00:43 - the office hour session is really based
00:45 - around the questions we've received from
00:46 - you
00:47 - and we know that teachers who are new
00:48 - and returning teachers to code monkey
00:50 - have some
00:50 - questions just while you get started
00:52 - with the back to school season
00:54 - we also know that they're you're using
00:56 - code monkey differently whether
00:58 - in person or through distance learning
00:59 - or maybe even through those hybrid
01:01 - models
01:02 - so you might be just learning learning
01:05 - looking to learn a little bit more about
01:07 - the platform and how it can work to
01:09 - accommodate all of those situations we
01:12 - also want to give you an opportunity to
01:13 - become more familiarized with the
01:15 - platform
01:16 - that it offers you as a teacher so we'll
01:18 - go over a few of the main features
01:19 - mainly the ones we've been getting those
01:21 - burning questions about
01:23 - and that might be most helpful for you
01:26 - but mostly we want to be able to hear

04:26 - this is more in a
04:27 - interactive session i'm gonna go ahead
04:30 - and share my screen now
04:38 - okay great if there for any reason
04:42 - you're not being you're not able to see
04:43 - my screen um
04:45 - let me know so i'm actually i'm going to
04:48 - start i want to show you a bit our
04:49 - our newest integration that we have with
04:51 - google classrooms
04:53 - um this would be relevant for what the
04:56 - ones of you who are using google
04:57 - classrooms who already um
04:59 - are many you're managing your rosters
05:01 - there and you're communicating with your
05:03 - students
05:04 - so you can now import your classrooms
05:06 - onto
05:07 - code monkey from google classrooms and
05:09 - i'm just going to
05:12 - log into my
05:15 - account and basically i would need to
05:19 - log in as you see through the
05:20 - google single sign-on to the google
05:22 - account that i'm also using for my
05:24 - google classroom so
05:26 - you're probably familiar with this uh
05:28 - page this
05:29 - is where you have all your classrooms
05:32 - and
05:32 - um i'm gonna show you how i'm going to
05:35 - create a new classroom so
05:37 - you know we have the regular way of just
05:38 - creating a regular classroom
05:41 - and and then
05:44 - connecting it to the subscription and
05:46 - then adding
05:47 - students to the classroom so i just
05:50 - quickly want to
05:51 - show you this part basically we have
05:53 - three methods for adding students the
05:56 - first two
05:56 - is by creating yourselves the
06:00 - accounts for your students so this might
06:02 - be helpful for the more younger students
06:04 - if you want to create
06:05 - accounts for them give them usernames
06:07 - and passwords and then pass it to them
06:09 - um so these two methods are for that
06:13 - um the third way is by sharing a class
06:15 - code so this is great if
06:16 - you have your students joining from home
06:18 - you might want them
06:20 - joining using their already existing
06:23 - accounts if they have
06:24 - for using google if they're using clever
06:27 - class link
06:28 - we have a few of these integrations so
06:31 - you would share with them the class code
06:34 - and have them join your classroom
06:36 - through that
06:38 - by the way once you've created the
06:40 - accounts for your students
06:42 - we have some nice methods which i call
06:44 - easier access for your students to
06:47 - then log into their accounts basically
06:50 - we have um the
06:53 - login cards and the classroom login
06:57 - url just gonna quickly show you that
07:00 - so once you've already created accounts
07:02 - for your students
07:05 - through the students tab
07:08 - you are able to share with them login
07:11 - cards
07:12 - with your username and password or a
07:14 - classroom login url
07:16 - where they would just um click on their
07:18 - username
07:20 - enter their password and they're in so
07:22 - this
07:23 - skips a few steps of writing the
07:25 - codemonkeyurl and typing in their
07:27 - username they just locate their username
07:30 - enter their password and they're in so
07:32 - this is great way for students to log
07:35 - into their accounts
07:37 - and i'm going to go back to the my
07:40 - classroom page
07:41 - because i actually really want to show
07:43 - you um
07:44 - the the google classroom options so
07:47 - i'll go more into details here just
07:50 - because this is a new integration
07:52 - um but you can actually import from
07:54 - google
07:55 - your classrooms and this is great if
07:57 - you're already using google classrooms
07:59 - or if you use google classrooms to
08:04 - as a way to communicate with your
08:06 - students
08:07 - so we now offer you this option so the
08:10 - first thing
08:11 - that you would need to do is to connect
08:13 - with google classroom
08:16 - basically you would be asked to choose
08:18 - the google account
08:20 - that you're using and basically
08:23 - authorize codemonkey
08:25 - to get the roster from google classroom
08:29 - so
08:29 - you need to allow this because if you
08:31 - won't allow it you won't be able to do
08:33 - the next steps that i'm going to show
08:35 - you now so
08:37 - i've now authorized the authorized code
08:39 - monkey
08:40 - and the next thing i would do is choose
08:42 - which classroom i'm looking to import
08:44 - and these are classrooms i have on my
08:46 - google classrooms
08:48 - okay and those are the ones i can
08:52 - pick from so i'm gonna pick my monday
08:54 - class next thing i'm gonna do
08:56 - is choose to which subscription i want
08:59 - to connect it to i only have one active
09:01 - subscription so that's the default
09:03 - and i'm gonna click on create my
09:06 - classroom
09:07 - and after a few moments the classroom
09:10 - will be
09:10 - imported and added to your classrooms
09:14 - list
09:14 - you can see it right here so a few
09:17 - things about that
09:19 - once i've imported my classroom i've
09:21 - already imported any students that are
09:25 - there so students now can just log into
09:28 - code monkey and
09:29 - we'll show you that part as well and
09:30 - they're already in the classroom can
09:32 - already access
09:34 - the courses if you need to make any
09:36 - changes to your roster
09:38 - you would only do it through google
09:39 - classroom
09:41 - and then you can um update your um
09:45 - roster also on code monkey so i'm gonna
09:47 - go
09:48 - into the classroom now
09:51 - and you can see here also the
09:55 - students as you can see i can't make
09:58 - any changes to the students because as i
10:01 - said these changes will be done
10:03 - in your roster on google classroom but
10:06 - once you
10:06 - make any changes let's say you remove a
10:09 - student or student has been
10:10 - added to the classroom on google
10:12 - classrooms
10:13 - you can always go here you see this same
10:16 - classroom option right here
10:18 - so once you click on that the classroom
10:20 - uncode monkey will be synced
10:23 - according to how you've updated your
10:25 - classroom on google classroom so maybe
10:27 - you've changed the name
10:29 - and you want it to be reflected also on
10:31 - codemonkey
10:32 - you would you would do that through the
10:34 - sync classroom
10:36 - button anytime so that's that's that
10:39 - part
10:41 - another thing i wanted to show you is an
10:44 - option to also add
10:46 - co-teachers to your google classroom so
10:49 - you might be already familiar with this
10:51 - feature you can add
10:52 - any colleagues of yours as a co-teacher
10:55 - to your classroom that would allow them
10:58 - the same managing abilities over the
11:00 - classroom
11:01 - they can view the progress they can
11:03 - assign courses and they can also access
11:05 - the courses themselves
11:07 - and when it comes to a google classroom
11:11 - you're also able to import teachers but
11:13 - these would only be
11:14 - teachers that are also teachers on your
11:17 - google classrooms on google
11:19 - so let me um let me quickly show you
11:23 - so this is my classroom on on google
11:25 - classroom so this is my monday class
11:28 - and i'm gonna go here to people um just
11:31 - to show you that
11:33 - basically this is this is me this is the
11:35 - user i'm now demoing from beaver
11:37 - achiever
11:38 - and this is my my personal gmail account
11:40 - so this is the code teacher and these
11:43 - are the students which were
11:44 - already added populated onto code monkey
11:47 - so
11:48 - so if i want to add additional teachers
11:51 - i first need to make sure that they are
11:53 - added on
11:54 - google classrooms on the specific
11:56 - classroom
11:58 - and then i can click on import from
12:00 - google
12:01 - and it will basically give me a drop
12:04 - down menu with all the teachers
12:06 - who are the same teachers that i have on
12:09 - google classrooms
12:10 - and then i can click to import the code
12:12 - teacher
12:14 - basically i can then share with my
12:16 - colleague these instructions
12:17 - they would just need to log into
12:19 - codemonkey and they'll already see this
12:21 - classroom
12:22 - under my classrooms um list and they're
12:25 - good to go so that's adding your
12:28 - colleagues
12:30 - last thing i wanted to show you before
12:33 - we move on
12:34 - is the option to assign
12:38 - activities um coding adventure
12:41 - activities
12:42 - from codemonkey so basically we
12:44 - currently
12:45 - don't support um assignments or any
12:48 - google classroom stream functionality
12:51 - [Music]
12:53 - which would basically allow any activity
12:56 - that your students do on code monkey to
12:58 - show
12:58 - on google classroom so we currently
13:00 - don't have that
13:02 - but what we do have for the lessons
13:05 - feature
13:06 - for um which is currently available for
13:09 - coding adventure part one part two part
13:11 - three
13:13 - um you can assign specific
13:16 - um activities from the lessons to your
13:19 - classroom so
13:21 - in each of coding adventure lesson plans
13:24 - there is a play time section
13:26 - um so after you do the introduction um
13:29 - and you can assign the challenges to
13:32 - your students
13:33 - each lesson of course it varies which
13:35 - challenges you assign
13:37 - so for example lesson number one you can
13:40 - have the kids start at challenges zero
13:43 - through
13:44 - five with this button here assigned to
13:46 - google classroom i
13:48 - can send an assignment to my classroom
13:51 - to play these challenges and i'm gonna
13:55 - go to my
13:58 - classroom stream
14:02 - to show you how would that look like
14:06 - as you can see i have here a new
14:07 - assignment um
14:09 - i can go to the assignment it shows
14:13 - the challenges and um basically
14:17 - the instructions complete six challenges
14:20 - in coding adventure part one if
14:22 - the student clicks on the link it would
14:24 - lead them
14:25 - directly to these um challenges
14:29 - and also you can edit this
14:32 - here so any additions you want to add to
14:34 - this assignment you would do on google
14:36 - classroom so you can add more
14:38 - instructions
14:39 - add a file uh you might want to give it
14:41 - a due date
14:42 - or you might want to assign it to just
14:44 - specific students so these are all
14:46 - functionalities that are on google
14:48 - classroom so i won't go into that but
14:51 - you can edit your assignments on google
14:53 - classrooms
14:56 - and then if you want the student to
14:58 - market is done that's something that
15:00 - they would do through google classrooms
15:02 - um they have the option on google
15:04 - classrooms to market assignment is done
15:06 - um also they can add links and comments
15:08 - um
15:09 - and so on so that's that's the part i
15:12 - wanted to
15:12 - to show you and um
15:16 - maybe before before we move uh
15:19 - to the next topic um let me also just
15:23 - quickly share the the students
15:26 - side
15:32 - okay so i'm now on
15:36 - the same classroom just viewing the
15:38 - classroom as a student
15:42 - and again i'm going to the classrooms
15:46 - stream and i can see here the assignment
15:49 - click on the assignment i'll access the
15:51 - challenges
15:54 - and i can also now you know after the
15:57 - teacher has imported the classroom
15:59 - on the teacher you can tell your
16:01 - students you can now go ahead
16:03 - log in onto codemonkey using your google
16:06 - account so i'm just gonna
16:08 - click on the google account and choose
16:11 - my
16:12 - the account that i use and this is the
16:15 - account i use in this classroom as a
16:17 - student
16:20 - great and now i've entered my code
16:22 - monkey account
16:23 - i can choose my avatar and i can
16:27 - start playing basically the the
16:30 - just the courses that my teacher has
16:32 - assigned to me um and
16:34 - assigned to to my classroom so just want
16:36 - to show you more of the
16:38 - student side of things and on the
16:40 - student side while
16:42 - talia is on this um as you can see the
16:44 - courses that have been assigned to them
16:46 - are
16:46 - in the upper half of the screen and all
16:49 - of the
16:50 - courses that are not yet available to
16:52 - the students or maybe are haven't been
16:53 - assigned by you
16:54 - are all down below so that's just
16:57 - something to kind of know it's a newer
16:59 - feature that we recently added so
17:01 - that's what your students see
17:08 - right um okay lena do you want to take
17:11 - it from here and maybe give a few
17:13 - updates yes ma'am i'm ready to give us
17:17 - some updates
17:18 - um okay so and then we'll follow up um
17:22 - knit he will follow up with your
17:23 - question too i know molly answered it
17:24 - here in the chat but we'll also follow
17:26 - up with that as well
17:27 - um so one of the updates that we have
17:29 - recently made
17:30 - to the codemonkey platform on the
17:32 - teacher's side of things is
17:34 - how the courses appear for both students
17:37 - and for teachers
17:38 - this this features also will also soon
17:41 - be
17:41 - on the courses when you assign the
17:42 - courses page but we do have a new um
17:46 - i guess system for how the courses are
17:48 - coded
17:49 - and so you'll see here the course
17:52 - they're basically rated in the same way
17:55 - the same scaffolding that we would
17:57 - suggest for students so where they would
17:59 - start from
18:00 - the beginner courses all the way to the
18:02 - more advanced courses so that's how they
18:03 - appear
18:04 - listed here um so we'll see the code
18:06 - monkey junior course we can see that
18:08 - this is a novice course
18:09 - um and it is block based and then when
18:11 - we move on to the beaver
18:12 - achiever course you can see it's also
18:14 - block based as well so each one has
18:15 - their own banner encoding for
18:18 - what level we suggest the courses to be
18:20 - at so for coding adventure you can see
18:22 - this is a beginners based course lena
18:24 - sorry
18:25 - can you can you double check that you're
18:27 - sharing oh sorry
18:29 - yeah i wasn't sure you're right i'm not
18:33 - sharing it all
18:34 - sorry everybody um okay let's start
18:37 - i'll try this again okay so so like i
18:39 - mentioned the courses are
18:41 - basically from beginner to
18:44 - advanced and that's how they're listed
18:46 - here on the screen and you'll have a
18:47 - little
18:48 - it'll tell you which one is block-based
18:50 - and then which level of coding we
18:52 - suggest for the students to be at in
18:53 - order to
18:54 - to work on this course that doesn't mean
18:56 - that they can't go to a more advanced
18:57 - course you know your students best
18:59 - but this is just how we recently are
19:01 - coding them um so you can see the block
19:03 - based course for the beaver achiever and
19:05 - for the coding adventure
19:06 - and then you can see that we say that
19:08 - the platform of course is more of an
19:09 - intermediate because we do say do coding
19:11 - adventure before um the game design or
19:14 - however you kind of want that to go and
19:15 - then the python courses you can see
19:17 - um the leveling so that's just something
19:19 - to kind of make it easier on your sides
19:21 - we
19:21 - tend to have a lot of questions and then
19:23 - also the students can kind of see you
19:25 - know oh okay
19:26 - this is what level we're kind of working
19:27 - on as well so it's nice for them to have
19:30 - that little bit of extra features
19:34 - so moving along from that new update
19:36 - another update that we
19:38 - actually have as well is
19:42 - our proficiency table so to get to the
19:43 - proficiency table
19:45 - you will go into your classrooms page
19:50 - and then you'll select your classroom so
19:52 - whichever classroom you're kind of
19:54 - working on
19:56 - or working within and then what we'll do
19:58 - is
19:59 - um we will go into the gradebook and so
20:03 - into the gradebook i click on the
20:04 - gradebook tab of my classroom
20:06 - and then up here at the top we can see
20:09 - the gradebook is by
20:10 - course or by proficiency so
20:13 - this is the proficiency table and we'll
20:15 - pull all of your students
20:17 - data and information and so this
20:18 - collects these are the coding concepts
20:20 - that are covered within all of coding
20:23 - within all of code monkey and you can
20:26 - see
20:26 - exactly the level of proficiency of
20:29 - which the students are on so we can see
20:31 - the sequencing and loops we can see that
20:33 - this
20:33 - teacher is in the intermediate category
20:37 - and they are a rock star on variables so
20:39 - we're able to see that
20:40 - a little bit more detail you know which
20:43 - concepts are they may be struggling on
20:45 - for just a little bit
20:46 - more variability in addition to this
20:50 - proficiency tab something else that we
20:52 - recently have is
20:53 - under the teacher resources we just
20:55 - recently launched a new
20:57 - how to video
21:00 - guide on how to get started so we do
21:02 - have that right here
21:04 - for you as well as video tutorials on
21:06 - anything from how to create a classroom
21:08 - and add students
21:09 - to adding students with class codes
21:11 - these are videos if you're very visual
21:13 - this is really great maybe you're not so
21:15 - visual
21:16 - so another place that you can go to is
21:17 - you can click down here in the bottom
21:19 - corner and go to the help center
21:21 - and when you go to the help center you
21:23 - can see that there's a lot of
21:24 - information there is a getting started
21:26 - guide right here for teachers as well
21:28 - it has everything that you might want to
21:30 - have in a text-based format the videos
21:32 - are also
21:33 - attached here as well so you can see
21:35 - like what is the classroom dashboard
21:36 - when i click on it
21:38 - it's going to give me a visual of it and
21:40 - then we'll have some more explanations
21:42 - sometimes there's links to other things
21:44 - it just kind of depends on what you're
21:46 - working on but what i really like most
21:47 - about the help center page is
21:49 - let's say i want to know what concepts
21:52 - are covered in coding adventure so what
21:55 - i do
21:55 - in coding adventure is i type in coding
21:57 - adventure and we can see that in coding
21:59 - venture part one
22:00 - here are all the coding concepts that
22:02 - are listed out so it will also cover
22:04 - what those coding concepts are so what
22:07 - is a simple loop
22:08 - what is a variable what is an array and
22:11 - what is a for loop
22:12 - these are the the concepts that we find
22:14 - are a little bit more challenging
22:16 - for both teachers and students when
22:18 - they're working through these courses
22:20 - and so we wanted to provide some extra
22:21 - support for you so we do have those in
22:23 - there for you as well
22:25 - i regularly visit the help page
22:29 - myself and so um there's just a lot of
22:33 - really great information that is in here
22:35 - like how to turn on super hints what
22:36 - courses should my students begin with so
22:38 - there's just a lot of information
22:40 - you know to kind of refer to as you go
22:45 - um all right so that
22:48 - is most of our updates that we have for
22:51 - you
22:52 - today um talia do you want to go
22:56 - to so now we're oh sorry go ahead no i
22:59 - do
22:59 - we have uh we have a great question here
23:03 - in the q a um lina do you want to take
23:06 - it the
23:07 - yeah sure regarding um what to do when
23:10 - students finish early their assignments
23:12 - yeah so we're just gonna now obviously
23:14 - move on to the q a session of this so
23:17 - um if you have a question that maybe we
23:18 - don't get to um if you just raise your
23:21 - hand it will actually
23:22 - unmute you and you guys can actually ask
23:23 - us yourself so it's nice to hear
23:25 - um you know the live live view of that
23:28 - as well so if you have a question that
23:29 - we don't get to just please feel free to
23:31 - answer that so i'll take this first
23:32 - question here
23:33 - um sometimes my students finish early on
23:35 - their assignments what is your advice
23:37 - for me so
23:39 - um a couple of options for you so
23:42 - within the course itself i would
23:45 - recommend
23:47 - the students working if you're working
23:48 - in the coding adventure course i would
23:50 - highly highly recommend for them to do
23:52 - the skill mode challenges
23:53 - um skill mode basically is a deeper dive
23:56 - into each coding concept and they open
23:58 - up
23:58 - as the students work through the
24:00 - concepts themselves so if they're
24:02 - working on simple loops they'll have
24:03 - access
24:04 - to the simple loops skill mode
24:05 - challenges as they work through so they
24:07 - kind of
24:07 - unlock as they're progressing through
24:10 - because the idea is that they have a
24:11 - deeper
24:12 - they already have an understanding and
24:13 - now they're just going to dive deeper
24:15 - into it and have a little bit more
24:16 - practice so that's one thing i would
24:18 - recommend
24:19 - and just depending on whichever course
24:21 - you're kind of working on let's say
24:23 - you're working on maybe the platformer
24:24 - course
24:25 - now is the time for the students to
24:26 - build and create their own games there's
24:28 - also the ability for students to build
24:29 - and create their own challenges
24:32 - basically when you pull up a
24:35 - challenge why this is locked just
24:37 - because i am in
24:38 - talia's classroom so i'm only able to
24:40 - see what she has assigned to me right
24:42 - now
24:43 - but the challenge builder here is just a
24:44 - freeform platform for the students to
24:46 - basically
24:47 - um there's no better way for a student
24:49 - to show mastery of a concept
24:51 - than for them to build and create it's
24:52 - one thing to work through the platform
24:54 - it's another thing for them to dive
24:55 - deeper into that concept and they can do
24:57 - that by the challenge builder itself or
24:59 - by
25:00 - the so those are just some
25:01 - recommendations that i have for you
25:03 - um as far as that goes so let's go back
25:05 - i want i want to add i want to add also
25:07 - to what to lena's answer regarding the
25:09 - challenge builder that i
25:10 - see many teachers use the
25:14 - the challenge builder you know maybe
25:16 - it's a bit of a
25:17 - different and creative activity so say
25:19 - you have your students
25:21 - going through coding adventures
25:22 - throughout the week i might let them
25:25 - create some challenges on friday just to
25:28 - maybe
25:29 - change it up a bit let them
25:32 - bring it bring it their creativity so i
25:35 - would definitely recommend the challenge
25:37 - builder
25:39 - i agree and i think there's also some
25:41 - different um variability that you can do
25:43 - with that i do i have seen
25:45 - people use it to create stories and to
25:47 - do different you know concepts within
25:49 - other content areas so there's also that
25:52 - as well
25:53 - um so our next question is in what order
25:56 - do you suggest
25:57 - that the students work through the
25:59 - courses so
26:01 - i'm actually going to go to this course
26:03 - page this
26:04 - course kind of map that we have here so
26:07 - i'm kind of depending on the grade level
26:08 - which your student is
26:10 - at so we do have a scope and sequence
26:12 - you feel free to reach out to your sales
26:14 - rep and they can send that over to you
26:15 - as well
26:16 - but let's say my students are in third
26:18 - grade i recommend them starting with
26:20 - coding adventure
26:21 - and then once they get to like after
26:24 - challenge 30 when they really start
26:26 - getting into variables is when i
26:27 - recommend that
26:28 - after each coding concept they complete
26:31 - a
26:32 - challenge like build their own challenge
26:35 - and then after that they would move into
26:36 - the game builder so they need to at
26:38 - least have finished part
26:39 - one of coding adventure to be able to
26:41 - really um
26:42 - i find for them to really unless they
26:44 - have a strong coding foundation
26:46 - they sometimes will struggle a little
26:48 - bit with the coding concepts that are
26:49 - within game builder so
26:51 - so our recommendation is you would do
26:52 - coding adventure then you would go into
26:54 - game builder
26:55 - or if your students are older you might
26:57 - want to start with banana tails
26:59 - and then move into coding into the
27:01 - coding chat box and kind of have that
27:03 - variability so it kind of depends on the
27:04 - level of where your students are at
27:06 - i personally like for all students to do
27:08 - coding code monkey junior just like as a
27:10 - starter i think it's a good warm up to
27:12 - every
27:13 - class period that you're in it's really
27:14 - about computational thinking you're
27:16 - moving the monkey forwards and backwards
27:17 - and you're
27:18 - doing some different directionality
27:19 - purposes with that so
27:21 - i hope that answered that question
27:26 - um okay so our next question was
27:29 - upgrade how does this work and should i
27:32 - use this instead of renaming the
27:33 - classroom
27:34 - talia do you want to answer this
27:36 - question yeah yeah i'd be happy to let
27:38 - let me just quickly
27:39 - share my screen
27:45 - okay just i'm just gonna quickly go over
27:48 - the upgrade
27:49 - it's the upgrade button available in
27:52 - your my classrooms page
27:54 - basically allows you to move over
27:56 - classrooms from one subscription to
27:58 - another and we usually recommend
28:01 - teachers
28:02 - to use this when they are let's say
28:04 - they're renewed they have a new
28:05 - subscription
28:06 - and you want to continue with your
28:08 - classroom you want to continue with the
28:09 - same
28:10 - four students from last year um to your
28:13 - new subscription so instead of creating
28:15 - a new classroom you want them to have
28:17 - their progress so they want you want
28:18 - them to continue with their
28:20 - existing accounts um so you can just
28:22 - move over
28:23 - the classroom to the new subscription by
28:25 - clicking on the upgrade
28:27 - um basically if there are if there's a
28:30 - student that who
28:30 - that you do not uh want to have continue
28:34 - this year so you would first archive
28:36 - them uh but you have all the
28:38 - instructions here but
28:39 - basically um i would just choose which
28:42 - subscription i want to move this
28:43 - classroom to
28:45 - and click the upgrade button i have some
28:49 - information here about the seats quota
28:51 - meaning once i move over the students to
28:52 - the new subscriptions they will take up
28:54 - seats in the new subscription so that's
28:56 - important to
28:57 - pay attention to um and once i've
28:59 - confirmed the upgrade
29:00 - you can see that the classroom now is
29:02 - part of the new subscription and
29:04 - students will be able to access
29:07 - all the content so i would definitely
29:09 - recommend using the upgrade
29:11 - when you're continuing with classrooms
29:13 - instead of creating new classrooms
29:16 - and moving just a student one by one the
29:18 - upgrade is
29:19 - is a good definitely something good to
29:22 - use
29:22 - in these scenarios
29:27 - okay so i'm gonna take over
29:31 - um okay so the next question was how do
29:33 - i know and then we'll
29:34 - get to these two live questions here in
29:36 - just a minute um how do i know which
29:38 - standards could monkey is aligned to so
29:40 - there's a couple of ways in which you
29:41 - can find the standard so
29:42 - one way that you can find the standard
29:44 - is you can go to the teacher resources
29:47 - and pull up the lesson plans that are
29:49 - there and in the lesson plans themselves
29:51 - you can
29:51 - click on any one of the lessons you're
29:53 - able to see
29:55 - the the standards that are addressed if
30:00 - you need specific
30:01 - state standards you can reach out to
30:04 - your sales rep or totally
30:05 - our customer success manager and we can
30:08 - get those
30:08 - reports for you as well something that's
30:10 - a little bit deeper
30:11 - another way is when you go to the code
30:13 - monkey homepage
30:15 - the codemonkey.com page at the very
30:17 - bottom
30:18 - of the page in the footer there is under
30:21 - under curriculum there is a standards
30:23 - page so when you click on the standards
30:25 - page
30:26 - you're actually able to see the
30:28 - standards um
30:29 - for the courses you can also click on a
30:31 - specific course and find the standards
30:33 - there so
30:34 - those are going to be the csta and the
30:36 - iste alignment
30:39 - and then now i'll answer this question
30:42 - here
30:43 - when when can students get their
30:46 - certificates you have access to the
30:48 - certificates
30:49 - at all times here in the classroom
30:51 - resources
30:52 - um so here you're able to get the
30:55 - certificate
30:56 - and you know give them out to your
30:58 - students whenever works best for you
31:01 - um yeah that's great i'll just add i'll
31:04 - just add that
31:05 - um definitely worth looking into these
31:07 - they're cute they have the courses
31:09 - um characters in them they are currently
31:13 - um you know you would need to download
31:15 - them you have you see and you can add
31:17 - the student's name
31:18 - and you can add your signature and date
31:20 - um there's currently no automatic
31:22 - process
31:23 - to generate certificates we've been
31:26 - getting these requests so hopefully with
31:28 - something that we will add in the future
31:30 - but definitely worth checking these out
31:33 - i think students enjoy getting these
31:35 - um sharing with their parents so under
31:37 - the teacher resources check them out
31:40 - yeah sometimes we have teachers ask as
31:42 - well so
31:43 - we'll help write out a certificate for
31:44 - you sometimes my
31:46 - students don't get the concept after
31:48 - finishing a level
31:50 - and they want to do the previous level
31:52 - again can they go back
31:53 - and work again on a previous level so at
31:56 - any time a student
31:58 - can go back at any time um to their
32:01 - course page and all they have to do is
32:03 - click on
32:04 - the challenge map and on the challenge
32:07 - map they can
32:08 - there we always recommend that people go
32:10 - that the students go back and revisit
32:12 - their
32:13 - challenges so you click on the story map
32:15 - up here
32:16 - and at any time the students can go back
32:17 - to any of the previous challenges that
32:19 - they've completed
32:20 - as a teacher you have the ability to
32:21 - move around the students don't so they
32:23 - can always go back
32:25 - their previous solution will always be
32:26 - there but it will help
32:28 - guide them um for okay well what
32:31 - improvement can i make to actually get a
32:32 - three star solution so
32:34 - that's what we would suggest there right
32:37 - and
32:37 - and i'd like to add something um from
32:40 - the teacher's point and
32:42 - lena i'm sharing my screen um
32:46 - i just want to add from the teacher's
32:47 - point so um
32:49 - if you're not familiar with our progress
32:52 - tab
32:53 - please you know get to know this
32:57 - page you have it for each of your
33:00 - classroom
33:01 - and basically this this allows you to
33:03 - really see
33:04 - live how your students are doing you
33:07 - have here the star grading that we use
33:10 - for some of our courses especially
33:11 - coding adventure
33:13 - and this allows you to see it you might
33:15 - go here and check for example and
33:17 - this is challenge 104 you can see
33:20 - that you have a few students who
33:22 - received only two stars
33:24 - um so you can see that this might be a
33:27 - chapter
33:27 - and two loops that students are
33:29 - struggling with so you
33:31 - might wanna go back and review this
33:33 - chapter
33:34 - you can even go and refer to our lesson
33:36 - plans and maybe use
33:38 - the instructions in the lesson plans if
33:39 - you yourself need any guidance or you
33:41 - can also contact
33:42 - us but just wanted to point this out
33:44 - because this is a great tool to use
33:47 - to see where your students are
33:48 - struggling the progress step
33:52 - and you can also go tell you can also go
33:55 - to the
33:55 - gradebook feature and in the great book
33:57 - at the very bottom of the grade book
34:00 - there are circles and the larger the
34:03 - circle the more students that struggle
34:05 - with that specific challenge so it's a
34:07 - really good way for
34:08 - um difficulty and you know basically
34:11 - understanding
34:12 - mini lessons that's what i'm meaning to
34:14 - say with that
34:15 - yeah and and we have here a question um
34:18 - how can students see their own star so
34:21 - basically the students can see their
34:22 - stars um
34:24 - in the course itself so for example
34:28 - i'll share my i'll share my student
34:32 - screen
34:38 - uh okay so this is specifically a
34:40 - student who hasn't made much
34:42 - progress but but basically um once i go
34:46 - to a course i can
34:50 - go through the the story mode map where
34:53 - i can
34:54 - my progress and as i progress i'll get
34:58 - the
34:59 - stars grading right here and i can see
35:02 - how i'm doing basically once i finish
35:05 - and once i solve a challenge i'll
35:07 - immediately get
35:08 - a feedback on my solution i'll get
35:11 - either one star up to three stars
35:13 - if i get only one star i'll get like
35:15 - lena said i'll get some hints on
35:17 - how to help me achieve the second and
35:18 - the third star so that's where the
35:20 - students can see how
35:22 - how they're doing in the course and this
35:25 - is the same
35:26 - if they are on any of the courses that
35:29 - we're working on so they just go to the
35:31 - story map and
35:32 - they'll navigate throughout the story a
35:34 - story map
35:35 - excuse me okay so another question that
35:39 - we had was
35:41 - a teacher that was wondering about
35:43 - variables and how to
35:45 - kind of teach variables so
35:48 - within that there are some different
35:50 - resources
35:52 - um that are available so within
35:55 - i am currently on our code monkey blog
35:58 - page
35:59 - and i just typed in unplugged activities
36:03 - and you can see some
36:04 - blog articles that we've done about
36:05 - unplugged activities and different
36:06 - things like that this is a really good
36:08 - way to
36:09 - find some alternate resources but there
36:12 - is one here specifically
36:14 - um this one has i can look for loops or
36:16 - i can look for variables anything that's
36:18 - kind of linked here
36:19 - will have an unplugged activity and so
36:22 - these are just really good ways
36:24 - the lesson plans have them themselves as
36:26 - well but here is just another
36:28 - example maybe in a little bit more
36:29 - detail about um
36:31 - how to kind of work with the variable
36:35 - with the variable itself so there is an
36:38 - activity here and it kind of walks you
36:39 - through that
36:40 - so some just different ways to you know
36:42 - find some different unplugged coding
36:44 - activities these are activities that
36:46 - um you could do even remote and distant
36:50 - i've seen a lot of teachers you know
36:52 - maybe you're working on the coding
36:53 - adventure course and the kids have
36:55 - like paper arrows that they've made you
36:57 - know like a one arrow
36:58 - and they can kind of move it and maybe
37:00 - there's like a loop where they can show
37:02 - that they're moving
37:03 - you know right or moving left um so
37:05 - there's some different ways to navigate
37:07 - that as well you know having them like
37:08 - which way do we move and solve a
37:10 - challenge or
37:11 - you can screenshot a challenge maybe
37:13 - that you want to do and then have the
37:14 - kids kind of you know maybe in a jam
37:16 - board
37:17 - put the challenge in there and have it
37:18 - as an assessment piece how would you
37:20 - solve this challenge and they can walk
37:21 - it out
37:22 - you know walk walk you through it so
37:25 - just some different ways to kind of
37:26 - utilize that online offline variability
37:37 - and we have this question we have a
37:39 - question here um is this linked to the
37:40 - teacher page so it is handy or do we
37:42 - have to go to the blog to
37:44 - to see it so it you would have to go to
37:47 - the blog
37:48 - itself when you're on the code monkey
37:51 - page
37:51 - it's sell so here i am and i'm logged
37:53 - into the platform i would go to the
37:55 - three lines in the right hand corner
37:57 - and i would click on blog um and then
38:00 - you can just search
38:01 - from there so it's easy to
38:04 - have access to it um but it's not right
38:06 - there underneath the teacher resources
38:08 - but it is located here for you
38:12 - it's a good point um adrian i think i
38:14 - think we are
38:15 - uh we did bring this up that it should
38:18 - be added to the teacher resources um
38:21 - yeah i think it's something that will be
38:23 - added to the teacher resources um
38:25 - um soon so it will be more handy but you
38:28 - can you can still
38:29 - um access it um through the menu like
38:32 - like lena shows
38:34 - and so there's some different just blogs
38:36 - here like offline coding activities you
38:37 - can look for
38:38 - or unplugged game builder
38:41 - just some different tips and hints so
38:44 - just some different things i definitely
38:45 - recommend checking that out
38:46 - and then the question corner as well um
38:49 - part of the blog there's some different
38:51 - questions here as well like drawing your
38:53 - own sprites course so there's some just
38:54 - different resources that you might not
38:56 - have known about before of different
38:58 - ways that you can find it so we have
38:59 - like a dota does math one there's just
39:01 - different
39:02 - places to kind of check and find out a
39:04 - little bit more information
39:08 - is there any competition for students in
39:10 - code monkey um currently
39:12 - we don't have a competition right now
39:13 - that we're doing with students
39:15 - um possibly we'll do when again we did
39:17 - do a challenge builder competition
39:19 - over during covid the initial covet
39:23 - crisis
39:24 - the beginning of the coveted crisis um
39:26 - but it's possible that we'll do
39:27 - something again soon
39:33 - great does anybody wanna ask another
39:35 - question does anybody wanna
39:39 - ask their question live
39:45 - oh yeah um i'm just answering here
39:47 - adrian
39:50 - yeah yeah we will be adding the the
39:52 - feature of the lesson
39:53 - of the blog to the teacher resources
39:58 - there's a question regarding grading
40:02 - we've we've shown a bit the the the
40:05 - gradebook tab
40:06 - lena showed the the new feature which
40:10 - we've recently added the proficiency tab
40:12 - that shows
40:13 - um students um
40:16 - proficiency in coding concepts across
40:20 - courses whereas we have the great book
40:22 - that shows students grade
40:24 - grades within each course the
40:27 - proficiency tab is more across
40:29 - courses taking
40:33 - the top coding concepts and showing
40:36 - how proficient a student is in each
40:39 - coding
40:41 - topic so that's available through the
40:42 - gradebook tab for
40:44 - for each classroom
40:49 - okay and then in the help center as well
40:52 - i'll just share this
40:54 - resource for you as well you can type in
40:55 - how's the grade how are the grades
40:57 - calculated there is a
40:58 - there is a resource here so um it'll
41:01 - tell you exactly
41:02 - how they're scored and then what each
41:05 - star value
41:06 - point is within the gradebook itself if
41:08 - you're ever wondering about that too
41:17 - how can students build their own game
41:20 - so students will i recommend the
41:23 - students working through
41:24 - each one of the courses there are three
41:26 - courses there's a platformer a frogger
41:28 - and
41:29 - a draw your own sprite animation course
41:33 - i recommend the students working through
41:35 - one of the courses
41:36 - and then and then recreating that course
41:39 - and game builder first
41:41 - um and doing that for each one of the
41:43 - courses and you know they can make
41:44 - modifications on
41:45 - you know what it looks like and whatever
41:48 - but it is a free-form platform here
41:51 - um and it pulls up and then the students
41:53 - will create their
41:54 - you know their games that way and they
41:56 - can share them either to our discover
41:58 - page or they can share them to the
42:00 - classroom
42:01 - and then once they do um the other
42:04 - students in the classroom can also play
42:05 - them
42:06 - something that i always like to share
42:07 - about the discover platform itself it is
42:09 - a worldwide
42:10 - sharing platform there are community
42:12 - guidelines here
42:13 - basically the gist of this is that we
42:16 - make sure that there is no
42:17 - inappropriate things in the game itself
42:19 - and making sure that there is
42:21 - no um personal information shared
42:25 - and we just shared a resource about our
42:27 - game builder webinar that we've done as
42:28 - well
42:29 - but anytime you publish a game or a
42:31 - challenge it makes a copy of that
42:33 - challenge
42:34 - essentially and so then if the students
42:36 - try to go in and
42:37 - make a change to it they can't make that
42:39 - change unless they unpublish and
42:41 - republish it will have to go through the
42:43 - approval process
42:44 - through our team
42:48 - okay
42:51 - um i think we'll start wrapping it up
42:53 - unless
42:54 - once we get more questions lina do you
42:57 - want to
42:58 - show the last slide on how to get help
43:01 - going forward great yeah so if you
43:05 - if you have any um questions for us you
43:07 - can
43:09 - feel free to contact us at support
43:11 - codemonkey.com and somebody from the
43:13 - team will get in touch or you can also
43:15 - get in touch directly with um your code
43:18 - monkey club monkey rep
43:20 - besides that we talked about the help
43:22 - center and we shared with you some of
43:24 - the articles but you know
43:25 - just go visit as lena showed it's an
43:28 - easy search you can find a lot of
43:30 - interesting articles um each article has
43:33 - more um it has links to other relevant
43:36 - articles so you might learn new things
43:39 - about the platform
43:40 - and how you can use it um so that's the
43:43 - email that's so sorry that's the url for
43:46 - the help center
43:48 - um
43:49 - [Music]
43:52 - yep so if there are no more nobody wants
43:55 - to
43:56 - jump on live and ask us a question
44:01 - um the game builder i'll just take this
44:03 - one last question then we'll wrap it up
44:04 - for today
44:05 - um the game builder and challenge
44:09 - builder do have to be assigned like all
44:11 - other courses i would not assign it
44:13 - until you're ready for the kids to have
44:14 - access to it because
44:16 - if it were me personally just me i would
44:19 - rather
44:19 - tinker around and create my own things
44:21 - and go through the course itself and i
44:23 - know that other students probably feel
44:25 - the same way as me where some people
44:26 - might want to
44:27 - do the course and then do the you know
44:29 - vice versa so i only tend to open things
44:31 - that i'm ready for the students to have
44:33 - access to
44:35 - so i hope i answered that question for
44:36 - you we appreciate
44:38 - every all of your answers that you you
44:40 - know all of your questions that you've
44:42 - asked for today's webinar we know that
44:44 - your time like i mentioned is so
44:45 - valuable especially we know you guys are
44:47 - doing
44:48 - even more work than you know than normal
44:51 - if that's possible but it is um so we
44:53 - just want to thank you guys so much for
44:55 - joining us for today's webinar

44:59 - at all please feel free to reach out to
45:01 - us in the team
45:03 - once again thank you so much and
45:05 - remember to always write code catch
45:07 - bananas and save the world we'll see you
45:09 - guys next time
45:10 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

so we do want to let you know um well we'll kind of get into that in a second anyway so thank you guys so much for joining us today um we appreciate you taking the time to share you're joining us from in the chat box as well as what grade levels you teach so welcome to code monkey's third webinar on our for our back to school season uh open hours basically this time is for you to be able to ask us questions so the go the code monkey team wants to thank you so much for joining us for our webinar we know that your time is limited and that everything is just not normal during these times so our goal today is to make sure that you're getting what you need out of today's webinar to help you prepare to teach code monkey with your students the office hour session is really based around the questions we've received from you and we know that teachers who are new and returning teachers to code monkey have some questions just while you get started with the back to school season we also know that they're you're using code monkey differently whether in person or through distance learning or maybe even through those hybrid models so you might be just learning learning looking to learn a little bit more about the platform and how it can work to accommodate all of those situations we also want to give you an opportunity to become more familiarized with the platform that it offers you as a teacher so we'll go over a few of the main features mainly the ones we've been getting those burning questions about and that might be most helpful for you but mostly we want to be able to hear from you so at the end of today's session we will actually give you the ability to um hop on the mic and ask us some live questions we've also taken your questions from your registrations and we hope to answer those as well at the end of today's webinar all right so let's go ahead and get started so today is an open office hours with code monkey you can always follow us on all of our social media platforms we are on twitter linkedin instagram facebook as well as our blog so we'll actually dive a little bit deeper into our blog here today at the end of today's webinar session um today we're gonna be working with um there's three of us here from the team my name is lena soleil and i'm the professional development and sales manager here at codemonkey and i've been with code monkey for about two and a half years now i'll pass it off to my other panelists um hi y'all um this is talia here um happy to be here and help and show you a bit around and answer your questions i'm hoping that questions that we answer um for some of you will also help the others um and also you know if you have more specific questions and if you won't get your answers during this session we'd be happy to continue the conversations with you after so i hope you enjoy hi everyone my name is molly schubach and i am on the sales team here at code monkey been with the company since the beginning of the year but in the industry for about six years so thank you for joining us today as lena and talia said we're excited to have you here and excited to answer all the questions you have great um so today during the webinar you can also tweet at us using the hashtag that you see here at the bottom of the slide cash echo monkey webinar we will do our best to answer any live tweets that we have during today's webinar we're also here to answer your questions so any questions that you have please place them in the q a box we find sometimes in the chat box they tend to get lost so it's easier for us and easier for you if we can get to those questions for you following today's webinar a survey will pop up once you take the survey a professional development certificate will be mailed to you for your time today so if you don't get that just feel free to reach out to us and we'll help you out with that so without any further further ado let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world oh i forgot to do this part but okay good i think we're good um okay great so i'll take it from here thanks lina um um as lina said please write your questions in the q a and also um and also we'll have some time at the end for for live questions um so feel free to do that we'll have this is more in a interactive session i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen now okay great if there for any reason you're not being you're not able to see my screen um let me know so i'm actually i'm going to start i want to show you a bit our our newest integration that we have with google classrooms um this would be relevant for what the ones of you who are using google classrooms who already um are many you're managing your rosters there and you're communicating with your students so you can now import your classrooms onto code monkey from google classrooms and i'm just going to log into my account and basically i would need to log in as you see through the google single signon to the google account that i'm also using for my google classroom so you're probably familiar with this uh page this is where you have all your classrooms and um i'm gonna show you how i'm going to create a new classroom so you know we have the regular way of just creating a regular classroom and and then connecting it to the subscription and then adding students to the classroom so i just quickly want to show you this part basically we have three methods for adding students the first two is by creating yourselves the accounts for your students so this might be helpful for the more younger students if you want to create accounts for them give them usernames and passwords and then pass it to them um so these two methods are for that um the third way is by sharing a class code so this is great if you have your students joining from home you might want them joining using their already existing accounts if they have for using google if they're using clever class link we have a few of these integrations so you would share with them the class code and have them join your classroom through that by the way once you've created the accounts for your students we have some nice methods which i call easier access for your students to then log into their accounts basically we have um the login cards and the classroom login url just gonna quickly show you that so once you've already created accounts for your students through the students tab you are able to share with them login cards with your username and password or a classroom login url where they would just um click on their username enter their password and they're in so this skips a few steps of writing the codemonkeyurl and typing in their username they just locate their username enter their password and they're in so this is great way for students to log into their accounts and i'm going to go back to the my classroom page because i actually really want to show you um the the google classroom options so i'll go more into details here just because this is a new integration um but you can actually import from google your classrooms and this is great if you're already using google classrooms or if you use google classrooms to as a way to communicate with your students so we now offer you this option so the first thing that you would need to do is to connect with google classroom basically you would be asked to choose the google account that you're using and basically authorize codemonkey to get the roster from google classroom so you need to allow this because if you won't allow it you won't be able to do the next steps that i'm going to show you now so i've now authorized the authorized code monkey and the next thing i would do is choose which classroom i'm looking to import and these are classrooms i have on my google classrooms okay and those are the ones i can pick from so i'm gonna pick my monday class next thing i'm gonna do is choose to which subscription i want to connect it to i only have one active subscription so that's the default and i'm gonna click on create my classroom and after a few moments the classroom will be imported and added to your classrooms list you can see it right here so a few things about that once i've imported my classroom i've already imported any students that are there so students now can just log into code monkey and we'll show you that part as well and they're already in the classroom can already access the courses if you need to make any changes to your roster you would only do it through google classroom and then you can um update your um roster also on code monkey so i'm gonna go into the classroom now and you can see here also the students as you can see i can't make any changes to the students because as i said these changes will be done in your roster on google classroom but once you make any changes let's say you remove a student or student has been added to the classroom on google classrooms you can always go here you see this same classroom option right here so once you click on that the classroom uncode monkey will be synced according to how you've updated your classroom on google classroom so maybe you've changed the name and you want it to be reflected also on codemonkey you would you would do that through the sync classroom button anytime so that's that's that part another thing i wanted to show you is an option to also add coteachers to your google classroom so you might be already familiar with this feature you can add any colleagues of yours as a coteacher to your classroom that would allow them the same managing abilities over the classroom they can view the progress they can assign courses and they can also access the courses themselves and when it comes to a google classroom you're also able to import teachers but these would only be teachers that are also teachers on your google classrooms on google so let me um let me quickly show you so this is my classroom on on google classroom so this is my monday class and i'm gonna go here to people um just to show you that basically this is this is me this is the user i'm now demoing from beaver achiever and this is my my personal gmail account so this is the code teacher and these are the students which were already added populated onto code monkey so so if i want to add additional teachers i first need to make sure that they are added on google classrooms on the specific classroom and then i can click on import from google and it will basically give me a drop down menu with all the teachers who are the same teachers that i have on google classrooms and then i can click to import the code teacher basically i can then share with my colleague these instructions they would just need to log into codemonkey and they'll already see this classroom under my classrooms um list and they're good to go so that's adding your colleagues last thing i wanted to show you before we move on is the option to assign activities um coding adventure activities from codemonkey so basically we currently don't support um assignments or any google classroom stream functionality which would basically allow any activity that your students do on code monkey to show on google classroom so we currently don't have that but what we do have for the lessons feature for um which is currently available for coding adventure part one part two part three um you can assign specific um activities from the lessons to your classroom so in each of coding adventure lesson plans there is a play time section um so after you do the introduction um and you can assign the challenges to your students each lesson of course it varies which challenges you assign so for example lesson number one you can have the kids start at challenges zero through five with this button here assigned to google classroom i can send an assignment to my classroom to play these challenges and i'm gonna go to my classroom stream to show you how would that look like as you can see i have here a new assignment um i can go to the assignment it shows the challenges and um basically the instructions complete six challenges in coding adventure part one if the student clicks on the link it would lead them directly to these um challenges and also you can edit this here so any additions you want to add to this assignment you would do on google classroom so you can add more instructions add a file uh you might want to give it a due date or you might want to assign it to just specific students so these are all functionalities that are on google classroom so i won't go into that but you can edit your assignments on google classrooms and then if you want the student to market is done that's something that they would do through google classrooms um they have the option on google classrooms to market assignment is done um also they can add links and comments um and so on so that's that's the part i wanted to to show you and um maybe before before we move uh to the next topic um let me also just quickly share the the students side okay so i'm now on the same classroom just viewing the classroom as a student and again i'm going to the classrooms stream and i can see here the assignment click on the assignment i'll access the challenges and i can also now you know after the teacher has imported the classroom on the teacher you can tell your students you can now go ahead log in onto codemonkey using your google account so i'm just gonna click on the google account and choose my the account that i use and this is the account i use in this classroom as a student great and now i've entered my code monkey account i can choose my avatar and i can start playing basically the the just the courses that my teacher has assigned to me um and assigned to to my classroom so just want to show you more of the student side of things and on the student side while talia is on this um as you can see the courses that have been assigned to them are in the upper half of the screen and all of the courses that are not yet available to the students or maybe are haven't been assigned by you are all down below so that's just something to kind of know it's a newer feature that we recently added so that's what your students see right um okay lena do you want to take it from here and maybe give a few updates yes ma'am i'm ready to give us some updates um okay so and then we'll follow up um knit he will follow up with your question too i know molly answered it here in the chat but we'll also follow up with that as well um so one of the updates that we have recently made to the codemonkey platform on the teacher's side of things is how the courses appear for both students and for teachers this this features also will also soon be on the courses when you assign the courses page but we do have a new um i guess system for how the courses are coded and so you'll see here the course they're basically rated in the same way the same scaffolding that we would suggest for students so where they would start from the beginner courses all the way to the more advanced courses so that's how they appear listed here um so we'll see the code monkey junior course we can see that this is a novice course um and it is block based and then when we move on to the beaver achiever course you can see it's also block based as well so each one has their own banner encoding for what level we suggest the courses to be at so for coding adventure you can see this is a beginners based course lena sorry can you can you double check that you're sharing oh sorry yeah i wasn't sure you're right i'm not sharing it all sorry everybody um okay let's start i'll try this again okay so so like i mentioned the courses are basically from beginner to advanced and that's how they're listed here on the screen and you'll have a little it'll tell you which one is blockbased and then which level of coding we suggest for the students to be at in order to to work on this course that doesn't mean that they can't go to a more advanced course you know your students best but this is just how we recently are coding them um so you can see the block based course for the beaver achiever and for the coding adventure and then you can see that we say that the platform of course is more of an intermediate because we do say do coding adventure before um the game design or however you kind of want that to go and then the python courses you can see um the leveling so that's just something to kind of make it easier on your sides we tend to have a lot of questions and then also the students can kind of see you know oh okay this is what level we're kind of working on as well so it's nice for them to have that little bit of extra features so moving along from that new update another update that we actually have as well is our proficiency table so to get to the proficiency table you will go into your classrooms page and then you'll select your classroom so whichever classroom you're kind of working on or working within and then what we'll do is um we will go into the gradebook and so into the gradebook i click on the gradebook tab of my classroom and then up here at the top we can see the gradebook is by course or by proficiency so this is the proficiency table and we'll pull all of your students data and information and so this collects these are the coding concepts that are covered within all of coding within all of code monkey and you can see exactly the level of proficiency of which the students are on so we can see the sequencing and loops we can see that this teacher is in the intermediate category and they are a rock star on variables so we're able to see that a little bit more detail you know which concepts are they may be struggling on for just a little bit more variability in addition to this proficiency tab something else that we recently have is under the teacher resources we just recently launched a new how to video guide on how to get started so we do have that right here for you as well as video tutorials on anything from how to create a classroom and add students to adding students with class codes these are videos if you're very visual this is really great maybe you're not so visual so another place that you can go to is you can click down here in the bottom corner and go to the help center and when you go to the help center you can see that there's a lot of information there is a getting started guide right here for teachers as well it has everything that you might want to have in a textbased format the videos are also attached here as well so you can see like what is the classroom dashboard when i click on it it's going to give me a visual of it and then we'll have some more explanations sometimes there's links to other things it just kind of depends on what you're working on but what i really like most about the help center page is let's say i want to know what concepts are covered in coding adventure so what i do in coding adventure is i type in coding adventure and we can see that in coding venture part one here are all the coding concepts that are listed out so it will also cover what those coding concepts are so what is a simple loop what is a variable what is an array and what is a for loop these are the the concepts that we find are a little bit more challenging for both teachers and students when they're working through these courses and so we wanted to provide some extra support for you so we do have those in there for you as well i regularly visit the help page myself and so um there's just a lot of really great information that is in here like how to turn on super hints what courses should my students begin with so there's just a lot of information you know to kind of refer to as you go um all right so that is most of our updates that we have for you today um talia do you want to go to so now we're oh sorry go ahead no i do we have uh we have a great question here in the q a um lina do you want to take it the yeah sure regarding um what to do when students finish early their assignments yeah so we're just gonna now obviously move on to the q a session of this so um if you have a question that maybe we don't get to um if you just raise your hand it will actually unmute you and you guys can actually ask us yourself so it's nice to hear um you know the live live view of that as well so if you have a question that we don't get to just please feel free to answer that so i'll take this first question here um sometimes my students finish early on their assignments what is your advice for me so um a couple of options for you so within the course itself i would recommend the students working if you're working in the coding adventure course i would highly highly recommend for them to do the skill mode challenges um skill mode basically is a deeper dive into each coding concept and they open up as the students work through the concepts themselves so if they're working on simple loops they'll have access to the simple loops skill mode challenges as they work through so they kind of unlock as they're progressing through because the idea is that they have a deeper they already have an understanding and now they're just going to dive deeper into it and have a little bit more practice so that's one thing i would recommend and just depending on whichever course you're kind of working on let's say you're working on maybe the platformer course now is the time for the students to build and create their own games there's also the ability for students to build and create their own challenges basically when you pull up a challenge why this is locked just because i am in talia's classroom so i'm only able to see what she has assigned to me right now but the challenge builder here is just a freeform platform for the students to basically um there's no better way for a student to show mastery of a concept than for them to build and create it's one thing to work through the platform it's another thing for them to dive deeper into that concept and they can do that by the challenge builder itself or by the so those are just some recommendations that i have for you um as far as that goes so let's go back i want i want to add i want to add also to what to lena's answer regarding the challenge builder that i see many teachers use the the challenge builder you know maybe it's a bit of a different and creative activity so say you have your students going through coding adventures throughout the week i might let them create some challenges on friday just to maybe change it up a bit let them bring it bring it their creativity so i would definitely recommend the challenge builder i agree and i think there's also some different um variability that you can do with that i do i have seen people use it to create stories and to do different you know concepts within other content areas so there's also that as well um so our next question is in what order do you suggest that the students work through the courses so i'm actually going to go to this course page this course kind of map that we have here so i'm kind of depending on the grade level which your student is at so we do have a scope and sequence you feel free to reach out to your sales rep and they can send that over to you as well but let's say my students are in third grade i recommend them starting with coding adventure and then once they get to like after challenge 30 when they really start getting into variables is when i recommend that after each coding concept they complete a challenge like build their own challenge and then after that they would move into the game builder so they need to at least have finished part one of coding adventure to be able to really um i find for them to really unless they have a strong coding foundation they sometimes will struggle a little bit with the coding concepts that are within game builder so so our recommendation is you would do coding adventure then you would go into game builder or if your students are older you might want to start with banana tails and then move into coding into the coding chat box and kind of have that variability so it kind of depends on the level of where your students are at i personally like for all students to do coding code monkey junior just like as a starter i think it's a good warm up to every class period that you're in it's really about computational thinking you're moving the monkey forwards and backwards and you're doing some different directionality purposes with that so i hope that answered that question um okay so our next question was upgrade how does this work and should i use this instead of renaming the classroom talia do you want to answer this question yeah yeah i'd be happy to let let me just quickly share my screen okay just i'm just gonna quickly go over the upgrade it's the upgrade button available in your my classrooms page basically allows you to move over classrooms from one subscription to another and we usually recommend teachers to use this when they are let's say they're renewed they have a new subscription and you want to continue with your classroom you want to continue with the same four students from last year um to your new subscription so instead of creating a new classroom you want them to have their progress so they want you want them to continue with their existing accounts um so you can just move over the classroom to the new subscription by clicking on the upgrade um basically if there are if there's a student that who that you do not uh want to have continue this year so you would first archive them uh but you have all the instructions here but basically um i would just choose which subscription i want to move this classroom to and click the upgrade button i have some information here about the seats quota meaning once i move over the students to the new subscriptions they will take up seats in the new subscription so that's important to pay attention to um and once i've confirmed the upgrade you can see that the classroom now is part of the new subscription and students will be able to access all the content so i would definitely recommend using the upgrade when you're continuing with classrooms instead of creating new classrooms and moving just a student one by one the upgrade is is a good definitely something good to use in these scenarios okay so i'm gonna take over um okay so the next question was how do i know and then we'll get to these two live questions here in just a minute um how do i know which standards could monkey is aligned to so there's a couple of ways in which you can find the standard so one way that you can find the standard is you can go to the teacher resources and pull up the lesson plans that are there and in the lesson plans themselves you can click on any one of the lessons you're able to see the the standards that are addressed if you need specific state standards you can reach out to your sales rep or totally our customer success manager and we can get those reports for you as well something that's a little bit deeper another way is when you go to the code monkey homepage the codemonkey.com page at the very bottom of the page in the footer there is under under curriculum there is a standards page so when you click on the standards page you're actually able to see the standards um for the courses you can also click on a specific course and find the standards there so those are going to be the csta and the iste alignment and then now i'll answer this question here when when can students get their certificates you have access to the certificates at all times here in the classroom resources um so here you're able to get the certificate and you know give them out to your students whenever works best for you um yeah that's great i'll just add i'll just add that um definitely worth looking into these they're cute they have the courses um characters in them they are currently um you know you would need to download them you have you see and you can add the student's name and you can add your signature and date um there's currently no automatic process to generate certificates we've been getting these requests so hopefully with something that we will add in the future but definitely worth checking these out i think students enjoy getting these um sharing with their parents so under the teacher resources check them out yeah sometimes we have teachers ask as well so we'll help write out a certificate for you sometimes my students don't get the concept after finishing a level and they want to do the previous level again can they go back and work again on a previous level so at any time a student can go back at any time um to their course page and all they have to do is click on the challenge map and on the challenge map they can there we always recommend that people go that the students go back and revisit their challenges so you click on the story map up here and at any time the students can go back to any of the previous challenges that they've completed as a teacher you have the ability to move around the students don't so they can always go back their previous solution will always be there but it will help guide them um for okay well what improvement can i make to actually get a three star solution so that's what we would suggest there right and and i'd like to add something um from the teacher's point and lena i'm sharing my screen um i just want to add from the teacher's point so um if you're not familiar with our progress tab please you know get to know this page you have it for each of your classroom and basically this this allows you to really see live how your students are doing you have here the star grading that we use for some of our courses especially coding adventure and this allows you to see it you might go here and check for example and this is challenge 104 you can see that you have a few students who received only two stars um so you can see that this might be a chapter and two loops that students are struggling with so you might wanna go back and review this chapter you can even go and refer to our lesson plans and maybe use the instructions in the lesson plans if you yourself need any guidance or you can also contact us but just wanted to point this out because this is a great tool to use to see where your students are struggling the progress step and you can also go tell you can also go to the gradebook feature and in the great book at the very bottom of the grade book there are circles and the larger the circle the more students that struggle with that specific challenge so it's a really good way for um difficulty and you know basically understanding mini lessons that's what i'm meaning to say with that yeah and and we have here a question um how can students see their own star so basically the students can see their stars um in the course itself so for example i'll share my i'll share my student screen uh okay so this is specifically a student who hasn't made much progress but but basically um once i go to a course i can go through the the story mode map where i can my progress and as i progress i'll get the stars grading right here and i can see how i'm doing basically once i finish and once i solve a challenge i'll immediately get a feedback on my solution i'll get either one star up to three stars if i get only one star i'll get like lena said i'll get some hints on how to help me achieve the second and the third star so that's where the students can see how how they're doing in the course and this is the same if they are on any of the courses that we're working on so they just go to the story map and they'll navigate throughout the story a story map excuse me okay so another question that we had was a teacher that was wondering about variables and how to kind of teach variables so within that there are some different resources um that are available so within i am currently on our code monkey blog page and i just typed in unplugged activities and you can see some blog articles that we've done about unplugged activities and different things like that this is a really good way to find some alternate resources but there is one here specifically um this one has i can look for loops or i can look for variables anything that's kind of linked here will have an unplugged activity and so these are just really good ways the lesson plans have them themselves as well but here is just another example maybe in a little bit more detail about um how to kind of work with the variable with the variable itself so there is an activity here and it kind of walks you through that so some just different ways to you know find some different unplugged coding activities these are activities that um you could do even remote and distant i've seen a lot of teachers you know maybe you're working on the coding adventure course and the kids have like paper arrows that they've made you know like a one arrow and they can kind of move it and maybe there's like a loop where they can show that they're moving you know right or moving left um so there's some different ways to navigate that as well you know having them like which way do we move and solve a challenge or you can screenshot a challenge maybe that you want to do and then have the kids kind of you know maybe in a jam board put the challenge in there and have it as an assessment piece how would you solve this challenge and they can walk it out you know walk walk you through it so just some different ways to kind of utilize that online offline variability and we have this question we have a question here um is this linked to the teacher page so it is handy or do we have to go to the blog to to see it so it you would have to go to the blog itself when you're on the code monkey page it's sell so here i am and i'm logged into the platform i would go to the three lines in the right hand corner and i would click on blog um and then you can just search from there so it's easy to have access to it um but it's not right there underneath the teacher resources but it is located here for you it's a good point um adrian i think i think we are uh we did bring this up that it should be added to the teacher resources um yeah i think it's something that will be added to the teacher resources um um soon so it will be more handy but you can you can still um access it um through the menu like like lena shows and so there's some different just blogs here like offline coding activities you can look for or unplugged game builder just some different tips and hints so just some different things i definitely recommend checking that out and then the question corner as well um part of the blog there's some different questions here as well like drawing your own sprites course so there's some just different resources that you might not have known about before of different ways that you can find it so we have like a dota does math one there's just different places to kind of check and find out a little bit more information is there any competition for students in code monkey um currently we don't have a competition right now that we're doing with students um possibly we'll do when again we did do a challenge builder competition over during covid the initial covet crisis the beginning of the coveted crisis um but it's possible that we'll do something again soon great does anybody wanna ask another question does anybody wanna ask their question live oh yeah um i'm just answering here adrian yeah yeah we will be adding the the feature of the lesson of the blog to the teacher resources there's a question regarding grading we've we've shown a bit the the the gradebook tab lena showed the the new feature which we've recently added the proficiency tab that shows um students um proficiency in coding concepts across courses whereas we have the great book that shows students grade grades within each course the proficiency tab is more across courses taking the top coding concepts and showing how proficient a student is in each coding topic so that's available through the gradebook tab for for each classroom okay and then in the help center as well i'll just share this resource for you as well you can type in how's the grade how are the grades calculated there is a there is a resource here so um it'll tell you exactly how they're scored and then what each star value point is within the gradebook itself if you're ever wondering about that too how can students build their own game so students will i recommend the students working through each one of the courses there are three courses there's a platformer a frogger and a draw your own sprite animation course i recommend the students working through one of the courses and then and then recreating that course and game builder first um and doing that for each one of the courses and you know they can make modifications on you know what it looks like and whatever but it is a freeform platform here um and it pulls up and then the students will create their you know their games that way and they can share them either to our discover page or they can share them to the classroom and then once they do um the other students in the classroom can also play them something that i always like to share about the discover platform itself it is a worldwide sharing platform there are community guidelines here basically the gist of this is that we make sure that there is no inappropriate things in the game itself and making sure that there is no um personal information shared and we just shared a resource about our game builder webinar that we've done as well but anytime you publish a game or a challenge it makes a copy of that challenge essentially and so then if the students try to go in and make a change to it they can't make that change unless they unpublish and republish it will have to go through the approval process through our team okay um i think we'll start wrapping it up unless once we get more questions lina do you want to show the last slide on how to get help going forward great yeah so if you if you have any um questions for us you can feel free to contact us at support codemonkey.com and somebody from the team will get in touch or you can also get in touch directly with um your code monkey club monkey rep besides that we talked about the help center and we shared with you some of the articles but you know just go visit as lena showed it's an easy search you can find a lot of interesting articles um each article has more um it has links to other relevant articles so you might learn new things about the platform and how you can use it um so that's the email that's so sorry that's the url for the help center um yep so if there are no more nobody wants to jump on live and ask us a question um the game builder i'll just take this one last question then we'll wrap it up for today um the game builder and challenge builder do have to be assigned like all other courses i would not assign it until you're ready for the kids to have access to it because if it were me personally just me i would rather tinker around and create my own things and go through the course itself and i know that other students probably feel the same way as me where some people might want to do the course and then do the you know vice versa so i only tend to open things that i'm ready for the students to have access to so i hope i answered that question for you we appreciate every all of your answers that you you know all of your questions that you've asked for today's webinar we know that your time like i mentioned is so valuable especially we know you guys are doing even more work than you know than normal if that's possible but it is um so we just want to thank you guys so much for joining us for today's webinar if you have any questions about anything at all please feel free to reach out to us in the team once again thank you so much and remember to always write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time bye
