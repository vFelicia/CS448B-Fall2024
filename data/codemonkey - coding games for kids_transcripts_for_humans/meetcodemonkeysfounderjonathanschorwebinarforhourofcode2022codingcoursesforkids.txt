With timestamps:

00:07 - so um
00:10 - oh sorry so thank you Zach and thanks
00:13 - everyone for uh coming uh that's my
00:16 - favorite time of the year they are of
00:17 - codeweek Computer Science Education week
00:19 - so
00:21 - um
00:21 - a little bit by myself and my background
00:24 - so I was born in Israel
00:26 - uh uh in 82 and both my parents actually
00:29 - are software Engineers
00:32 - um so me and my young brother the uh
00:35 - other Code Monkey co-founder uh started
00:38 - coding at a very young age naturally we
00:41 - were growing up with the first Apple
00:43 - computers at home
00:45 - um I think by the age of 10 we were
00:47 - creating our own computer games uh for
00:49 - fun
00:52 - um so that was my uh background in
00:56 - computer science my entry into the
00:58 - coding World
01:00 - um
01:01 - then when I was 19 I started
01:04 - [Music]
01:04 - um
01:06 - um volunteering and education
01:09 - um uh and I started my own coding
01:11 - courses for children the year was 2001.
01:16 - um so that's when I got into my first
01:19 - stage of Education
01:22 - um and that's also when the first
01:23 - inspiration for a cold monkey came from
01:25 - from those classes that I created my
01:27 - lesson plans that uh I created little
01:30 - games for the lessons computer games
01:32 - that children my students had to
01:34 - progress through the game
01:36 - uh by writing code and those games are
01:39 - very very basic like no Graphics at all
01:42 - very basic graphic uh but that was the
01:46 - first inspiration for Code Monkey wow
01:49 - um you know not to give away your age
01:52 - Jonathan but when you started
01:54 - not so long ago but a little bit time
01:57 - ago yeah
01:59 - um now you know thankfully we're at a
02:02 - ploy Place globally where it's more
02:05 - accepted for children to code and to
02:08 - teach coding whether you're in the
02:10 - United States Canada uh India Australia
02:13 - wherever you may be and wherever all
02:15 - these people who are joining us on this
02:16 - webinar
02:18 - um why did you think to teach coding did
02:20 - you know was important back then
02:22 - you know like is it something that you I
02:25 - mean I know it's something you did but
02:28 - why did you feel that it was important
02:29 - to teach coding and maybe and why not
02:31 - math or other subjects
02:35 - it's a good question
02:37 - I started coding in one in a similar
02:40 - course like when I was nine I think my
02:42 - mother signed me up for a like a coding
02:45 - summer class
02:48 - um
02:49 - so I knew from my experience that it's
02:52 - easy to start coding early and that it's
02:54 - it could be a lot of fun it's a fun
02:56 - skill to have
02:59 - um
03:00 - and I was already working as a coder at
03:02 - the time I started during my last year
03:05 - in high school uh having a part-time job
03:07 - in software development it was you know
03:09 - very lucrative uh for for 17 or 17 year
03:14 - old kid and I just thought I was working
03:16 - back then in a like a
03:18 - uh with children from underserved
03:22 - communities like uh immigrant families
03:24 - in Israel
03:26 - um and I just thought this is a great
03:29 - skill I could give those children that
03:32 - I'm working with as an enabler for
03:35 - social Mobility
03:37 - um
03:37 - uh and it actually worked like they they
03:39 - learned very quickly and some of them
03:41 - later chose to to this as a career path
03:47 - um that was the thinking wow very really
03:50 - really interesting so be before we jump
03:52 - into sort of that answer and then go
03:55 - into the start of Code Monkey and how
03:57 - that began
03:59 - um you're a software developer you still
04:02 - have those skill sets what what made
04:05 - what pushed you towards the education
04:09 - world you know you could have been in
04:12 - financial you could have been a sorry
04:13 - for developer in sports and as and
04:16 - especially as we know like there's you
04:18 - know there's so many ways that the you
04:21 - know children today as they learn is
04:23 - that adults can get into different
04:25 - Industries what about education
04:28 - um made you like why did you come into
04:30 - this industry of all other Industries
04:32 - when you had the skill sets to do so
04:35 - good question uh
04:40 - so I think I wasn't planning to like
04:43 - like I said my the house I grew up in
04:45 - was all around software and Tech and
04:48 - Entrepreneurship and nobody was
04:51 - um talking about education as an
04:54 - occupation where I grew up
04:57 - but then I sort of stumbled upon the
04:59 - world of Education in Israel when you
05:00 - when you finish high school you have to
05:02 - go to the Army or either you go to the
05:03 - Army or you do like um social
05:06 - volunteering in hospitals or or
05:09 - education in underserved communities
05:12 - so I did that
05:15 - um
05:16 - and it's really hard once you've started
05:19 - working in education working with
05:21 - children
05:22 - uh connecting with them spending time
05:25 - with them affecting their lives it's
05:27 - really hard to to go back to like a
05:30 - plain office job I think like you really
05:33 - want to continue having this exciting
05:39 - um I don't know influence important
05:41 - influence on others people's lives and
05:43 - and also just having this
05:47 - um
05:49 - this type of like special unique
05:52 - challenge of finding ways of uh giving
05:56 - skills to to young people
05:59 - wow yeah and it's and it's very uh
06:01 - commendable you know one of the things
06:03 - which you know we we bring up a lot is
06:06 - is the skill of coding being able to
06:09 - code in software development is as you
06:12 - mentioned could be quite a lucrative
06:13 - career you could really get great jobs
06:15 - in so many different places
06:17 - and uh to take the time and you know
06:21 - sacrifice you know whether you know not
06:24 - to go into full details but the
06:25 - sacrifice and go into education is quite
06:27 - is quite commendable and and it's paid
06:30 - off given that code monkey has grown all
06:32 - over the world so uh you mentioned how
06:35 - you you taught young students After High
06:38 - School uh young children
06:41 - um coding so maybe you could elaborate
06:44 - on that and talk a little bit about how
06:46 - that
06:47 - led to starting code monkey and sort of
06:51 - that Journey uh and all the different
06:53 - parts there because I know there there's
06:55 - there's a lot there so whatever you feel
06:57 - is uh great for the kids here and
06:59 - teachers to learn
07:01 - so there was a journey
07:04 - uh and I guess I'll start with the end
07:06 - like that the final conclusion from the
07:09 - journey is that timing is everything I
07:11 - guess because after I started those
07:13 - courses uh the year was 2001 and I
07:16 - wanted to create something like Code
07:17 - Monkey right after that like in 2002 but
07:21 - I ended up starting Code Monkey
07:22 - successfully only 12 years later or 13
07:26 - years later in 2014.
07:30 - um and in between I had to do like I had
07:34 - to sort of wait for the
07:36 - for the opportunity to to mature I guess
07:40 - so
07:41 - I started I went to University I got my
07:44 - computer science degree I started code
07:45 - monkey as a
07:47 - like an academic project
07:50 - um
07:52 - but that wasn't I think a good platform
07:54 - for uh from Israel to to reach a large
07:58 - scale and to create like a good enough
08:00 - product
08:02 - so I had to wait to graduate from
08:05 - University and then I
08:07 - um I tried to start Code Monkey for the
08:09 - first time in 2007.
08:12 - uh with the third Code Monkey founder is
08:15 - shy
08:16 - um
08:17 - but it was just too early like teaching
08:19 - kids to code wasn't a big thing back
08:21 - then education technology is one big
08:23 - thing like No Angel Investors we see
08:26 - like Venture Capital firms nobody wanted
08:28 - to invest in educational technology and
08:30 - specifically in technology for teaching
08:33 - kids to code like everyone said wow this
08:35 - is I would love to have such a product
08:36 - for my kids but this is not a good
08:39 - business to invest in because because
08:41 - not a lot of people uh
08:45 - would want to buy this like just like a
08:47 - small niche of maybe parents who are
08:49 - themselves into computer science and
08:51 - things like that so we failed back then
08:54 - in 2007 and only in 2013 uh
09:00 - the an edtech incubator was started in
09:03 - Israel because attic became I think
09:04 - educational technology became a thing in
09:06 - the in the Venture Capital Community and
09:09 - specifically teaching kids to code uh
09:12 - became a huge Trend back then the big
09:16 - nonprofit code that are responsible for
09:18 - the hour of code week Computer Science
09:20 - Education week was founded by an ex I
09:23 - think Microsoft executive was funded by
09:27 - by Google and Microsoft and all those
09:29 - for them it was simply because they were
09:32 - struggling with the shortage in in
09:34 - software developers so they wanted to to
09:37 - increase awareness to the importance of
09:39 - teaching computer science in school
09:41 - so then when we started Code Monkey in
09:44 - 2014
09:46 - uh success came uh very quickly
09:55 - I think you muted
09:56 - at least I don't hear
09:58 - thank you
10:00 - um I guess you know you touched on some
10:02 - of this but maybe you could talk a bit
10:06 - about some of the challenges you faced
10:10 - in terms of starting Code Monkey not
10:13 - just in terms of the market but you know
10:15 - you you have that backer and you were
10:17 - coding you were building something you
10:19 - were from Israel you're trying to grow
10:21 - this like talk about uh you know it's
10:24 - important for teachers and students to
10:26 - learn about you know now we're at a
10:29 - different place you have millions of
10:31 - kids using it and and schools and that's
10:33 - fantastic uh but wasn't always like that
10:36 - right at the beginning that's for sure
10:37 - how to what were some of those
10:39 - challenges you overcome how did you
10:41 - maintain that that ability to you know
10:44 - you know overcome those challenges as
10:46 - opposed to just saying you know what I
10:48 - could just go work for a company so
10:50 - there's sort of those two things you
10:51 - know challenges I know what enabled you
10:53 - to ensure that those challenges were
10:55 - overcome
10:56 - yeah
10:58 - um so
11:00 - that's a big question
11:02 - um I guess when starting a startup
11:05 - company
11:07 - um I Heard once they've done a research
11:09 - one it's it's like a caterpillar that
11:11 - has many different legs but all the legs
11:13 - have to take steps at the same time more
11:16 - or less so
11:18 - so like first we created like a
11:20 - prototype of the product
11:22 - um and that was really simple at
11:25 - creating a very small game that children
11:27 - liked and children and actually learned
11:30 - to code while playing it so that was the
11:33 - fun part
11:35 - um and the easy part so to speak because
11:37 - uh we got accepted into this incubator
11:40 - we received like a small investment from
11:42 - the incubator we kept our jobs like
11:45 - part-time jobs and in our the three
11:47 - co-founders we were all coders ourselves
11:49 - so we just created the game ourselves uh
11:52 - tried it in classrooms in schools in
11:54 - Israel
11:56 - um that was the easy part the hard part
11:58 - I guess is getting noticed
12:02 - um
12:02 - by potential users teachers potential
12:06 - Partners resellers schools governments
12:09 - and getting the attention of investors
12:13 - because Beyond just creating a small
12:15 - prototype coding it yourself everything
12:18 - else costs a lot of money like
12:21 - Marketing sales
12:24 - all of that
12:26 - um
12:27 - so yeah it was really just like always
12:30 - finding like the next step
12:33 - I remember for example the first large
12:36 - exposure that we received from users
12:38 - from teachers and students and families
12:40 - would through the computer science
12:41 - education week the hour of code uh we we
12:45 - shared this prototype that we had with
12:47 - code.org the foundation running uh the
12:51 - hour of code and they put it on their
12:53 - website and I remember around this time
12:55 - of the year uh eight years ago we just
12:59 - like overnight received like millions of
13:01 - users
13:02 - [Music]
13:03 - um
13:03 - um
13:05 - um yeah so that was one like jumping
13:08 - board for the exposure part and we had
13:11 - similar stories on how like one investor
13:14 - led to him the next investor larger
13:17 - investor than a strategic investor that
13:18 - also played as a distributor in a
13:20 - certain market and and so on so it's
13:23 - always about finding the next step in
13:26 - each one of those
13:28 - um
13:28 - each one of those uh challenges that
13:32 - you're trying to coordinate like
13:33 - exposure Marketing sales funding and of
13:36 - course uh product development right
13:40 - um and just because I have a question
13:42 - right here which I think ties nicely in
13:44 - it talked about challenges and then
13:45 - overcoming those
13:47 - um and you mentioned uh code.org and
13:50 - having millions of users due to the hour
13:52 - of code week that's one example can you
13:55 - maybe share a specific moment
13:59 - um in since 2014 with code monkey that
14:04 - was uh one of like the very happy
14:07 - moments in your in your you know
14:11 - startup process and even now so just
14:14 - something that you know all these kids
14:16 - everyone goes you know teachers they
14:18 - work so hard they have their own
14:20 - challenges and then they come out with
14:21 - like a great test that they studied on
14:22 - so like what is what is your example of
14:25 - that
14:26 - of a happy moment yeah
14:29 - uh well that night when we received like
14:32 - millions of you right so that's a good
14:34 - example that was an amazing week I
14:37 - remember that we almost didn't get any
14:39 - sleep that week we were busy uh
14:42 - maintaining the server so it doesn't
14:44 - crash we weren't expecting this huge
14:47 - traffic uh users
14:50 - um that was one
14:53 - [Music]
14:55 - uh other other
14:57 - interesting moments sleep
15:01 - I remember a specific meeting with uh we
15:04 - had like an angel investor putting a
15:06 - small amount of money uh a guy from
15:08 - Israel who's also a tech entrepreneur
15:11 - um and he told me I have a visitor from
15:14 - Japan he's my distributor for my stock
15:16 - company was creating like long-range
15:18 - Wi-Fi routers he said my distributor in
15:21 - Japan is now in Israel I told you about
15:23 - you I told him about your company I
15:25 - think you should meet him and we sat
15:27 - down uh in the beach bar until I believe
15:30 - I remember it was Midday
15:32 - and I told him about the code monkey and
15:35 - like just interrupted me like in the
15:37 - middle of my pitch banged his his glass
15:40 - of beer on the table and said I want in
15:43 - I wanna I Wanna Be The Exclusive
15:45 - distributor in Japan and I want to
15:46 - invest I don't care about the terms
15:49 - like when you're fundraising let me know
15:52 - I'll be the first investor in the next
15:54 - round so I remember that was a happy
15:55 - moment well it is that's great it's
15:59 - great here it's it is unbelievable
16:00 - myself working at Code Monkey just
16:02 - seeing the global reach and how many
16:05 - places we've traveled to it and how many
16:07 - times we see pictures right now for
16:10 - those for those of you who don't know
16:11 - there's uh there's a contest for those
16:14 - who are using hour of code you could
16:16 - take a picture of your children using it
16:18 - and and tweets uh Code Monkey we're
16:21 - giving away a free home license as well
16:23 - as uh a gift card for the best picture
16:26 - for those who are enjoying Code Monkey
16:28 - so definitely uh um maybe uh Angie can
16:31 - put that in uh in in the end or when
16:34 - we'll we'll send it as a follow-up
16:36 - um Jonathan gonna take a break from some
16:38 - of my questions because in the Q a we've
16:42 - had a couple and it seems like a good
16:43 - place to uh to answer those so
16:46 - one person asked about
16:49 - um would you please give your thoughts
16:51 - on the quickest approach to learn how to
16:55 - code
16:56 - so
16:57 - I would say maybe not quickest but
16:59 - what's a great way to learn code and
17:01 - obviously you'll probably talk about
17:02 - code monkey and why Code Monkey is a
17:06 - great way to learn how to code
17:08 - yeah so so actually I have one important
17:11 - like Nuance to to address whenever uh I
17:15 - guess that question I remember before I
17:18 - started Code Monkey successfully between
17:20 - the first failed the time and the second
17:22 - successful attempt I was working in the
17:23 - software developer
17:25 - um
17:26 - and then like a lot of people were
17:28 - looking to transition from other careers
17:30 - into software development it was the
17:33 - 2000 and
17:35 - uh for like the the tech boom one of the
17:38 - you know Tech rooms
17:41 - um and then uh so you had all those ads
17:43 - online telling you like targeting
17:46 - grown-ups saying learn to code in seven
17:48 - days learn to code in in uh you know uh
17:52 - 24 hours learning to code uh become a
17:55 - software developer in one month and then
17:57 - I remember reading an article saying
17:59 - like
18:00 - learned to code in like 14 years like
18:03 - the truth about how long it takes to
18:05 - really become a you know a decent
18:08 - software developer and they were talking
18:09 - about like the good software developer
18:11 - they started early and it really takes
18:13 - you to with any I guess skill or job
18:18 - craft uh like to become really good at
18:21 - something to become employable and to
18:23 - become like good at what you do we take
18:25 - Serious
18:25 - [Music]
18:26 - um
18:27 - so I guess I will change the question a
18:32 - little bit is what is the quickest way
18:33 - to get like a
18:35 - an initial successful Taste of coding
18:37 - like an exposure to
18:40 - to programmatic thinking
18:43 - um
18:44 - and I think the best way to do that is
18:46 - actually through the hour of code week
18:48 - and all of those different small
18:50 - activities that use the gamified way
18:54 - short gamified course to give young
18:57 - children really a taste of what coding
19:00 - is and it can be using a real
19:02 - programming language like you do on on
19:04 - some of the Code Monkey Arrow code
19:06 - activities or it can be just those
19:08 - scratch style building blocks drag and
19:11 - drop things actually my daughter is now
19:13 - five so I started doing that with her
19:15 - using Code Monkey Junior uh
19:18 - yeah I think it's not the coincidence
19:21 - that those games and the arrow code weak
19:23 - became very popular because I think it's
19:25 - a great way to get quickly into coding
19:28 - not to become a coder quickly but to get
19:31 - into coding yeah it's a it's a great
19:33 - that's a great difference
19:36 - um
19:37 - someone and I and I guess you know using
19:40 - Code Monkey is that has all those
19:42 - aspects as gamified coding and a really
19:46 - just very simple way to to jump into
19:49 - into uh coding maybe not becoming the
19:53 - coding coder in the quickest way again
19:55 - that's not uh the what we we're trying
19:58 - we're trying to get them in and and
19:59 - really get them uh those basic skills so
20:04 - what's what's uh special about
20:08 - Code Monkey
20:09 - in terms of whether it is that jumping
20:13 - in the being ease of it or actually
20:15 - after being in Code Monkey for x amount
20:17 - of years and using it for a while you
20:19 - come out with with what so sort of the
20:22 - going and what makes Code Monkey
20:24 - different from uh maybe other programs
20:27 - not in specific where our code week
20:30 - everyone's all the coding companies are
20:32 - doing great work
20:35 - I think oh they're really there are so
20:38 - many excellent
20:40 - products we're teaching kids to code
20:44 - um and each which one is a bit different
20:47 - but
20:48 - [Music]
20:48 - um
20:50 - I wouldn't say that Code Monkey like
20:54 - something unique that no other products
20:56 - have but I I I I would say I will say
20:59 - that for Code Monkey
21:02 - um
21:02 - I think the priority
21:06 - um was always
21:08 - the top priority was creating an
21:12 - engaging experience for the learners for
21:14 - the for the young students
21:17 - and that was achieved through many
21:20 - different aspects of the product uh we
21:23 - always it's always crucial for us to
21:25 - keep the the courses very intuitive and
21:29 - self-paced so that students uh can learn
21:33 - on their own at their own pace uh to
21:36 - keep the courses like to create the game
21:39 - a very like full-blown game experience
21:42 - like not a gamified course but an actual
21:45 - game
21:46 - and this doesn't mean that it needs to
21:48 - be like a very fancy game in a 3D World
21:50 - with a lot of visual effects and noises
21:52 - and sound of the contrary the the
21:54 - simpler the game is there was a research
21:57 - on that recently in Israel and the
21:59 - simpler the game is the better the
22:01 - learning outcomes are but the game does
22:03 - need to be a full-blown game like it
22:05 - needs to be and there needs to be
22:07 - characters you need to be a plot
22:10 - um the kids need to be like they need to
22:14 - get like sort of immersed in this in
22:16 - this game world
22:18 - so it was intuitiveness the the
22:20 - full-blown game experience
22:22 - um and then of course the pedagogy uh
22:26 - this is the most important thing when
22:27 - creating educational content so it's
22:30 - really like
22:31 - being mindful of a lot of and many many
22:35 - like small details and planning how you
22:38 - break the complex concept into simpler
22:42 - concept and creating this sequence where
22:45 - you build the uh the understanding of
22:49 - each concept like one on top of the
22:51 - other
22:52 - wow that's great and I highly suggest uh
22:55 - I'm sure many of you who are attending
22:57 - this webinar have already tried Code
22:58 - Monkey if not definitely go on
23:00 - codemonkey.com to register for uh free
23:02 - trial it's great so one more question
23:04 - before I get back into my list of
23:07 - questions Jonathan someone asked
23:10 - um May I know why it's called code
23:12 - monkey and the significance of its name
23:15 - yeah the name was very significant it's
23:18 - a catchy name and uh also a catchy logo
23:21 - I think
23:24 - um
23:24 - and
23:26 - um
23:27 - so we sort of borrowed the term Code
23:30 - Monkey uh it's not a term that that we
23:32 - created it was an existing term in the
23:34 - tech word
23:35 - uh
23:37 - uh it's sort of like a funny decoratory
23:39 - term for the junior coders on each
23:42 - software development team like the the
23:44 - most Junior coder coders you refer to
23:47 - them like as an internal joke is code
23:49 - monkeys and whenever you know you you
23:51 - break a large software project into many
23:54 - small pieces you give the the simpler
23:56 - task to the code monkeys like to the
23:58 - junior coders
24:01 - um so yeah so it's actually a decoratory
24:02 - term but there's nobody outside the tech
24:04 - world knows it so we thought we could
24:06 - just use it as a create a character a
24:09 - monkey character and that was actually
24:11 - my brother though the CTO the other
24:14 - co-founder of Code Monkey he came up
24:16 - with the name and the game concept of
24:18 - monkey collecting bananas
24:20 - wow yeah
24:22 - um it's exciting and you know it's Let's
24:25 - uh you talk to Brett at the beginning
24:26 - about getting noticed right you know you
24:28 - created a great program but to get
24:30 - noticed is sometimes Harden requires
24:32 - more than just having a great product
24:34 - that also requires the marketing and how
24:36 - you show so definitely that's been been
24:39 - important
24:40 - I Remember by the way this slide to your
24:42 - earlier question about a happy moment so
24:43 - when I moved from Tel Aviv to New York
24:45 - when Code Monkey reached that stage it
24:48 - was time to move to the United States
24:49 - and start the U.S office so I was
24:51 - getting a lot of reaction in New York
24:53 - like when I was telling people like just
24:55 - visiting a doctor or whatever uh what
24:57 - are you doing oh I started Coleman can
24:59 - say yeah Code Monkey I think I heard of
25:01 - it I think I know it and often I was
25:03 - thinking there's no way this person
25:05 - really knows Code Monkey but but I know
25:07 - the term sounds familiar so it made us
25:09 - sort of being perceived as bigger than
25:11 - than we really were at the time right
25:14 - wherever that's that is
25:17 - it's pretty uh pretty amazing
25:20 - um Okay so
25:23 - you know we we've talked about a number
25:25 - of number of items here about what was
25:28 - how you uh your background and code
25:31 - monkey's background so want to talk a
25:34 - little bit you know Code Monkey started
25:35 - you know eight years ago eight nine
25:38 - years ago what has changed and what has
25:42 - remained the same whether it's uh talk
25:45 - about the platform you could talk about
25:47 - maybe the the company itself but uh you
25:52 - know there's uh it's like a it's a
25:54 - company but it's a live company and
25:56 - there's things going on so what has
25:58 - changed and what has remained the same
26:01 - so we'll remain the same is you know our
26:05 - day-to-day of creating
26:07 - game-based coding courses for children
26:10 - and we pretty much do it the same way
26:12 - that we did it back then we create like
26:14 - a small initial version of a course we
26:16 - tried with children we we write down you
26:20 - know feedback from the user testing then
26:24 - we create a full version of the course
26:26 - release it get feedbacks from students
26:28 - teach your parents improve the course uh
26:31 - this hasn't changed and we you do it
26:34 - through the pedagogy a pedagogical
26:35 - experts software developers animators
26:37 - musicians so they stayed the same and
26:40 - I'm glad it did this is my favorite part
26:43 - of the of our work creating the courses
26:47 - and using them with children and getting
26:49 - the feedback and improving the courses
26:51 - uh what did change is the business side
26:56 - so back then as a startup company your
26:59 - main concern is
27:02 - reaching significant like success
27:06 - Milestones it would allow fundraising
27:08 - additional
27:09 - money from investor before you run out
27:12 - of the money that you raised previously
27:14 - and this was I'm glad we're beyond that
27:18 - stage because this is pretty
27:21 - um nerve-wracking
27:24 - um
27:25 - and and you you get it wears you out
27:29 - like this this sort of Chase
27:32 - um uh always chasing after a more invest
27:35 - investments before the money Runs Out
27:37 - and now that the companies were
27:40 - established and profitable uh so the
27:43 - business
27:45 - um the business challenge is is
27:47 - something I enjoy
27:49 - way more than the business Channel and
27:51 - the startup stage and it's just the
27:52 - challenge of
27:54 - sort of optimizing the business uh
27:56 - steadily growing it
27:58 - uh becoming better at planning becoming
28:01 - better at planning making business plan
28:03 - executing business plans becoming better
28:05 - at hiring the right people building the
28:08 - accurate teams managing them
28:12 - um
28:13 - better
28:15 - um yeah so it's really now about sort of
28:18 - optimizing the
28:21 - uh as uh as like sort of business
28:23 - professionals
28:25 - right yeah that's uh the right Partners
28:28 - as you know Zach right is something that
28:29 - we really be better in like you know
28:32 - yeah right Partners in each country and
28:34 - yeah yeah it's uh it's also interesting
28:38 - to really see
28:41 - um you know so many so many students who
28:45 - get to benefit from the program and that
28:48 - that focus and and you know keeping to
28:53 - the idea of from the beginning we were
28:56 - making gamified engaging coding courses
28:59 - for kids and we are still doing that and
29:02 - yeah so that's that's it's very hard to
29:04 - continue to do and but you know I can
29:07 - from my own experience it's it's true
29:09 - what's happening
29:11 - um so just looking a little bit to the
29:14 - Future
29:15 - you know we we've for those who don't
29:17 - know and it's it's I I highly suggest
29:19 - you all try out we've launched two new
29:23 - courses in digital literacy uh these are
29:27 - our first
29:29 - non-coding courses we have uh one on
29:32 - digital use
29:33 - um and digital citizenship we launched
29:35 - them this year a few months ago and
29:37 - they're being highly used they're
29:39 - they're beloved they're a new course but
29:42 - it's something that's completely
29:43 - different that we've done in the sense
29:45 - that they're not coding they're gamified
29:47 - learning programs but not coding so
29:51 - um where do you see Code Monkey in five
29:53 - years you know knowing you know we've
29:55 - launched these two courses but any type
29:58 - of vision or anything whether it's the
30:00 - courses or you know
30:02 - um anything like that that you could
30:04 - speak on would be great
30:07 - so I see cold monkey continue to
30:11 - [Music]
30:12 - um
30:13 - to grow on the path that we chose the
30:15 - recent few years of sort of
30:17 - transitioning from being
30:19 - um
30:19 - a courses company like specific courses
30:23 - coding courses to becoming a curriculum
30:26 - provider
30:28 - and that means covering Entire Computer
30:31 - Science curriculum according to
30:32 - different standards in different parts
30:34 - of the world so that's not only coding
30:36 - like you said it can include other
30:38 - subjects in computer science
30:41 - and to cover the entire pathway from
30:45 - kindergarten to eighth grade
30:48 - um
30:49 - and also to provide for all the
30:53 - different needs in uh
30:56 - required for for
30:58 - implementing computer science uh
31:01 - curriculum so that's not only the coding
31:04 - courses for the children that we've
31:05 - always been doing but uh also more about
31:10 - teacher resources teacher tools
31:13 - professional development for teachers
31:15 - customer success method that we improve
31:19 - every year
31:20 - to make sure that implementation is
31:22 - successful assessment quizzes
31:26 - um yeah all those other very crucial
31:29 - pillars that uh a curriculum solution uh
31:32 - relies on
31:34 - great
31:36 - um thank you do you
31:39 - with working on teacher tools and
31:44 - um the platform for teachers
31:47 - how do you feel the teacher's experience
31:51 - has been using Code Monkey
31:55 - um if they do have a background or
31:58 - don'ts
32:01 - so it was always uh actually the the
32:05 - problem that we were solving and still
32:07 - are is how to enable
32:11 - quick scaling of Computer Science
32:13 - Education despite the
32:15 - constant lack or shortage of computer
32:18 - science teachers in K-8 or in winning
32:21 - K-12
32:23 - and I don't expect that to change soon
32:26 - because
32:28 - [Music]
32:28 - um
32:29 - but if you have computer science skills
32:32 - often you would choose
32:35 - um like a computer science in Tech I
32:39 - think that's the reason why it's always
32:41 - hard to find like computer science
32:43 - teachers with coding background
32:47 - [Music]
32:48 - um
32:49 - so so our challenge was always to sort
32:53 - of
32:54 - um bridge that Gap and to create a
32:57 - curriculum solution that would not
32:59 - require coding background from the
33:01 - teachers so we're sort of also teaching
33:04 - the teachers or helping the teacher like
33:06 - allowing the teacher to learn with their
33:08 - students as they go along
33:11 - yeah so so being successful with
33:15 - teaching with code monk you definitely
33:16 - don't need to have Computer Science
33:19 - Background the entire ID behind Code
33:22 - Monkey was to create a curriculum that
33:24 - would not require coding background from
33:26 - the teachers right we have
33:29 - um one of the uh attendees of this
33:33 - webinar uh she wrote in the Q a but
33:36 - really page best off-road teachers I
33:38 - know love Code Monkey most of us didn't
33:40 - know anything about coding before using
33:42 - we're learning along with our students
33:47 - yeah yeah and I think that's fun I think
33:49 - it's a it's an interesting it's
33:50 - something that's changing now in the
33:52 - education world with the internet and
33:53 - all like children they can learn things
33:55 - on their own on YouTube and and you know
33:58 - uh teachers are no longer expected to
34:01 - become the source of knowledge and it's
34:04 - more and more common to see classrooms
34:06 - and courses in school where teachers
34:07 - learn something new with their students
34:10 - and I think this is actually like this
34:13 - is sometimes
34:15 - um
34:17 - I don't know a better experience or like
34:19 - I think everybody's having more fun that
34:21 - way
34:23 - um
34:23 - yeah not not just with computer science
34:25 - right no that is interesting
34:29 - um have just a couple more questions
34:30 - here so uh if anyone of the attendees
34:34 - has any questions please make sure you
34:36 - write them
34:37 - um in the uh Q and A and where uh Angie
34:42 - is also answering any of the more
34:43 - technical questions uh so uh thank you
34:46 - very much Angie so
34:49 - um you've been you've been doing you've
34:51 - been at Code Monkey for some time now uh
34:54 - and
34:55 - um
34:56 - there's the happy times and challenging
34:59 - times
35:00 - um I guess this is for for everyone here
35:02 - myself included but how do you maintain
35:05 - the passion towards working at uh Code
35:07 - Monkey towards the same goal after so
35:10 - long right it's uh you've been in a
35:13 - almost decade-long marathon and uh yeah
35:16 - not everyone has that ability so what
35:18 - what enables you to be able to continue
35:21 - the work that you're that you're doing
35:24 - so I think what helps me
35:28 - um
35:29 - actually two things one of them is he
35:33 - goes back to my answer on your previous
35:35 - question that I'm learning
35:37 - to become
35:40 - I'm learning business I'm learning
35:41 - business management this is something I
35:44 - didn't have experience in and it's an
35:45 - interesting challenge in managing a
35:48 - company managing teams
35:50 - um it's about you know like working with
35:52 - people it is a by the way has some
35:55 - similarities to working working in
35:57 - education I feel uh sometimes I feel
36:00 - like my my employees are like my
36:01 - students uh in different ways
36:05 - and I like that challenge and I like
36:08 - becoming better uh
36:11 - um in management I guess
36:15 - um but on the computer science side and
36:17 - what's what what keeps this job
36:20 - interesting is that the market is still
36:25 - evolving rapidly uh it's not like math
36:28 - or English that has been taught like for
36:31 - you know thousands of years computer
36:32 - science is still a new subject it's
36:34 - still not a mandatory subject in most
36:37 - part of the world and to see how the
36:39 - market is maturing and computer science
36:42 - is being adopted in a more serious way
36:46 - gradually all over the world
36:49 - um
36:50 - it makes it more interesting and creates
36:52 - new challenges remember when we were
36:54 - beginning we're not getting questions
36:56 - about like now we're getting like
36:58 - tougher questions from clients about
36:59 - like what exactly do you teach in
37:01 - computer science how exactly do you
37:02 - teach how exactly do you assess learning
37:05 - outcomes like in the initial days nobody
37:08 - cared like they were just doing like
37:09 - just just give me some
37:11 - fun coding activity for my students for
37:14 - the article week and that's all I need
37:16 - and now it's becoming the demand the
37:18 - requirement are becoming more
37:20 - sophisticated so so you know it keeps
37:23 - things interesting
37:25 - so I on that where do you see coding in
37:30 - schools coding in after schools like
37:34 - it's it's clearly being uh put into
37:37 - curriculum globally uh do you see coding
37:41 - ever becoming something like math or
37:45 - science or a language where it's a daily
37:47 - subject or something that's in the
37:49 - weekly schedule
37:52 - uh yeah that it's definitely the trend
37:55 - is obvious if you look you know code.org
37:57 - they post statistics on that and if you
37:59 - look just as a
38:01 - on the American education system uh as
38:04 - an example and also it's probably one of
38:06 - the largest K-12 systems in the world uh
38:10 - the trend is obvious like more schools
38:13 - are offering it more students are taking
38:15 - it more teachers are teaching it more
38:17 - states are requiring schools to teach it
38:20 - or to at least offer it as an uh
38:23 - um there's an elective
38:26 - um
38:27 - yeah so so the trend is definitely there
38:30 - and it's and it's very steady
38:34 - so
38:36 - um there obviously the the uh coding is
38:41 - where we focus and we moved into digital
38:44 - digital literacy um to a certain extent
38:48 - as coding grows what other what other
38:51 - what do you feel is very important for
38:54 - young students to learn and for teachers
38:56 - to focus on
38:58 - um in technology education as well you
39:01 - know coding is important for all the
39:03 - reasons whether it's getting a job
39:05 - understanding how technology works all
39:07 - the things you mentioned but you know we
39:09 - have people here where well what's
39:12 - important for the Educators to focus on
39:14 - and for the youngers children to or
39:18 - children and students and adolescents to
39:21 - learn about in terms of Technology
39:25 - so actually I'm very excited about the
39:27 - the recent course that we launched on on
39:31 - digital citizenship
39:34 - because
39:36 - um you know uh parents and teachers
39:39 - nowadays they tend to think like today's
39:42 - children were born with iPhones so we we
39:45 - think and they can do anything on them
39:47 - so we think they don't need to be taught
39:49 - how to use a computer how to use the
39:50 - internet because they just know it
39:52 - uh uh but that is not true so you know
39:57 - they intuitively know how to post
39:59 - something on a social network or how to
40:02 - watch a video on YouTube and to comment
40:05 - uh
40:06 - um but the World Wide Web is a
40:10 - complicated uh platform uh
40:15 - um and it's also uh kind of risky uh
40:20 - especially for children not only for
40:21 - children but there are so many things
40:23 - that you should watch out for and I'm in
40:27 - no way I don't wanna like I encourage
40:29 - parents and teachers to to let the
40:31 - children
40:32 - enjoy everything that they can from
40:35 - using the internet and computers all the
40:37 - great educational content that they
40:39 - consume and social the positive social
40:41 - interaction
40:42 - self-exploration and a lot of great
40:45 - things that can be done and those
40:47 - devices and on the internet but like I
40:49 - said this this though things are now
40:51 - risk-free and children nowadays like
40:55 - adults they don't the fact that they
40:57 - know how to use the internet it doesn't
40:59 - mean that they understand how it works
41:01 - and they don't understand how it works
41:03 - they also probably are not aware of the
41:06 - risks so I think
41:09 - um yeah it's it's a good thing to focus
41:11 - on at a quite early stage
41:15 - um is is the the things that we teach on
41:18 - the digital literacy course
41:20 - how to be safe how to use the internet
41:24 - safely
41:25 - for yourself and also you know not
41:27 - hurting others
41:30 - um because you know it's a powerful tool
41:31 - but like any powerful tool it can be it
41:35 - can be also uh create damage if you're
41:38 - not using it correctly for yourself and
41:39 - for other people
41:41 - right that's that's it's great to know
41:44 - um and uh yeah we highly encourage all
41:48 - of you to try out our new digitals uh
41:51 - digital literacy courses definitely give
41:53 - us any type of feedback Angie is our
41:55 - customer success manager who gets all
41:57 - that feedback and it helps us improve
42:00 - um the courses we have two more uh one
42:05 - comment and then uh one more question
42:08 - so I'll ask the question and then I'll
42:11 - then mention the comment is uh how does
42:14 - Code Monkey contribute to learning stem
42:17 - subjects
42:22 - so we just made sure like when creating
42:25 - the code monkey games
42:27 - uh to include other stem Concepts in it
42:31 - like distances numbers negative numbers
42:33 - angles degrees
42:37 - um in the more advanced courses things
42:39 - like velocity acceleration gravity
42:41 - so
42:43 - um it's uh
42:46 - it's very easy to use coding and Code
42:49 - Monkey it's sort of a playground to
42:50 - practice those math and physics Concepts
42:53 - and Engineering but even in the courses
42:56 - that don't uh deal with stem concept
43:00 - directly the
43:02 - the actual
43:04 - challenge of coding
43:08 - um is well known to to be fostering
43:12 - other sort of 21st century skills even
43:15 - if you're just coding
43:17 - like I don't know like a small game that
43:19 - has nothing to do with stem
43:22 - um the the action of coding the the
43:25 - mental challenges involved with it are
43:28 - very helpful in developing
43:30 - skill that are useful for any other
43:31 - subject and specifically stem like you
43:33 - know critical thinking problem solving
43:35 - collaboration
43:37 - um things like that
43:39 - no that's that's that's great and and I
43:42 - think that's something that we see
43:44 - more and more
43:47 - um and hopefully as as you mentioned as
43:49 - as this Market Global Market changes
43:52 - that people will see coding not just as
43:55 - a subject unto itself that's important
43:57 - to learn but how you know whether it's
44:00 - the computational thinking or the math
44:04 - that you learn or the you know I know
44:07 - globally like outside and in certain
44:09 - non-english speaking countries they'll
44:11 - use Code Monkey in English so that they
44:14 - can practice their English there's so
44:16 - many different ways that it impacts
44:19 - um the
44:21 - um impacts other subject areas in their
44:24 - learning and I just want to you know
44:27 - take that and what you mentioned and
44:28 - said uh from from Nicole who I
44:31 - personally work with in the United
44:32 - States she wrote uh this isn't a
44:35 - question it's a thank you I'm looking
44:37 - forward to seeing how working with Code
44:38 - Monkey impacts my students outlook on
44:41 - coding related interest this is my third
44:43 - year using Code Monkey school-wide your
44:46 - programs allow us to grow and progress
44:48 - from block based to Tech space it's a
44:51 - wonderful program and so thank you very
44:53 - much Nicole for that
44:55 - um and and I think it really ties into
44:57 - everything that uh Jonathan said
45:01 - um Jonathan maybe you could give some
45:04 - closing remarks about Code Monkey about
45:06 - the hour of code
45:09 - um and then in the meantime if anyone
45:11 - asks any more questions otherwise uh we
45:13 - can then wrap up and uh we'll send
45:16 - everyone I put some links there that's
45:18 - codemonkey.com that will lead you to our
45:20 - page our website to see any of the
45:23 - information that you'd like you can sign
45:24 - up for free uh 30-day trial if you sign
45:28 - up this week we've changed the
45:30 - parameters of the trial where you can
45:32 - get unlimited students so you can get
45:34 - your old school on it and then also if
45:36 - you go on the second one that's hour of
45:38 - code those are the activities you'll see
45:40 - Code Monkey is one of the first
45:42 - activities on the hour of code page this
45:45 - is out of many many different programs
45:47 - so that's just some of the back office
45:51 - but uh yeah maybe some closing remarks
45:53 - Jonathan
45:54 - for me yeah so it's the hour of code
45:57 - week and I happen to be wearing my Nike
46:00 - uh what do you call that sweatshirt I
46:03 - remember Nike I used to study slogan
46:05 - just do it do you remember that probably
46:07 - in the 90s of course so yeah I would
46:10 - just probably conclude that is the hour
46:12 - of code week just do it just you know
46:14 - choose one of the many different free
46:16 - hour of code activities uh book a time
46:20 - with your students in a classroom with
46:23 - computers or iPads or Chromebooks and
46:25 - just do it just give them these first
46:27 - taste of coding and see where it takes
46:29 - your classroom right that's a great
46:33 - ending uh Jonathan thank you so much for
46:35 - your time uh people from all over the
46:38 - world teachers and students alike uh
46:40 - really thank you so much for for joining
46:43 - this uh really fun and engaging webinar
46:46 - Angie thank you for the behind the
46:48 - scenes work we'll send a follow-up email
46:51 - to everyone
46:53 - um with some resources some of the links
46:55 - which I sent and as Jonathan said just
46:58 - do it go on uh go.org
47:01 - commoncodemonkey.com sign up for a free
47:03 - trial and really benefit from uh one of
47:06 - the world's best uh primary or
47:09 - elementary through Middle School uh
47:11 - computer science programs thank you so
47:13 - much Jonathan uh nice to see everyone
47:15 - have a great day thank you Zach and Andy
47:18 - and thanks everyone for attending
47:20 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

so um oh sorry so thank you Zach and thanks everyone for uh coming uh that's my favorite time of the year they are of codeweek Computer Science Education week so um a little bit by myself and my background so I was born in Israel uh uh in 82 and both my parents actually are software Engineers um so me and my young brother the uh other Code Monkey cofounder uh started coding at a very young age naturally we were growing up with the first Apple computers at home um I think by the age of 10 we were creating our own computer games uh for fun um so that was my uh background in computer science my entry into the coding World um then when I was 19 I started um um volunteering and education um uh and I started my own coding courses for children the year was 2001. um so that's when I got into my first stage of Education um and that's also when the first inspiration for a cold monkey came from from those classes that I created my lesson plans that uh I created little games for the lessons computer games that children my students had to progress through the game uh by writing code and those games are very very basic like no Graphics at all very basic graphic uh but that was the first inspiration for Code Monkey wow um you know not to give away your age Jonathan but when you started not so long ago but a little bit time ago yeah um now you know thankfully we're at a ploy Place globally where it's more accepted for children to code and to teach coding whether you're in the United States Canada uh India Australia wherever you may be and wherever all these people who are joining us on this webinar um why did you think to teach coding did you know was important back then you know like is it something that you I mean I know it's something you did but why did you feel that it was important to teach coding and maybe and why not math or other subjects it's a good question I started coding in one in a similar course like when I was nine I think my mother signed me up for a like a coding summer class um so I knew from my experience that it's easy to start coding early and that it's it could be a lot of fun it's a fun skill to have um and I was already working as a coder at the time I started during my last year in high school uh having a parttime job in software development it was you know very lucrative uh for for 17 or 17 year old kid and I just thought I was working back then in a like a uh with children from underserved communities like uh immigrant families in Israel um and I just thought this is a great skill I could give those children that I'm working with as an enabler for social Mobility um uh and it actually worked like they they learned very quickly and some of them later chose to to this as a career path um that was the thinking wow very really really interesting so be before we jump into sort of that answer and then go into the start of Code Monkey and how that began um you're a software developer you still have those skill sets what what made what pushed you towards the education world you know you could have been in financial you could have been a sorry for developer in sports and as and especially as we know like there's you know there's so many ways that the you know children today as they learn is that adults can get into different Industries what about education um made you like why did you come into this industry of all other Industries when you had the skill sets to do so good question uh so I think I wasn't planning to like like I said my the house I grew up in was all around software and Tech and Entrepreneurship and nobody was um talking about education as an occupation where I grew up but then I sort of stumbled upon the world of Education in Israel when you when you finish high school you have to go to the Army or either you go to the Army or you do like um social volunteering in hospitals or or education in underserved communities so I did that um and it's really hard once you've started working in education working with children uh connecting with them spending time with them affecting their lives it's really hard to to go back to like a plain office job I think like you really want to continue having this exciting um I don't know influence important influence on others people's lives and and also just having this um this type of like special unique challenge of finding ways of uh giving skills to to young people wow yeah and it's and it's very uh commendable you know one of the things which you know we we bring up a lot is is the skill of coding being able to code in software development is as you mentioned could be quite a lucrative career you could really get great jobs in so many different places and uh to take the time and you know sacrifice you know whether you know not to go into full details but the sacrifice and go into education is quite is quite commendable and and it's paid off given that code monkey has grown all over the world so uh you mentioned how you you taught young students After High School uh young children um coding so maybe you could elaborate on that and talk a little bit about how that led to starting code monkey and sort of that Journey uh and all the different parts there because I know there there's there's a lot there so whatever you feel is uh great for the kids here and teachers to learn so there was a journey uh and I guess I'll start with the end like that the final conclusion from the journey is that timing is everything I guess because after I started those courses uh the year was 2001 and I wanted to create something like Code Monkey right after that like in 2002 but I ended up starting Code Monkey successfully only 12 years later or 13 years later in 2014. um and in between I had to do like I had to sort of wait for the for the opportunity to to mature I guess so I started I went to University I got my computer science degree I started code monkey as a like an academic project um but that wasn't I think a good platform for uh from Israel to to reach a large scale and to create like a good enough product so I had to wait to graduate from University and then I um I tried to start Code Monkey for the first time in 2007. uh with the third Code Monkey founder is shy um but it was just too early like teaching kids to code wasn't a big thing back then education technology is one big thing like No Angel Investors we see like Venture Capital firms nobody wanted to invest in educational technology and specifically in technology for teaching kids to code like everyone said wow this is I would love to have such a product for my kids but this is not a good business to invest in because because not a lot of people uh would want to buy this like just like a small niche of maybe parents who are themselves into computer science and things like that so we failed back then in 2007 and only in 2013 uh the an edtech incubator was started in Israel because attic became I think educational technology became a thing in the in the Venture Capital Community and specifically teaching kids to code uh became a huge Trend back then the big nonprofit code that are responsible for the hour of code week Computer Science Education week was founded by an ex I think Microsoft executive was funded by by Google and Microsoft and all those for them it was simply because they were struggling with the shortage in in software developers so they wanted to to increase awareness to the importance of teaching computer science in school so then when we started Code Monkey in 2014 uh success came uh very quickly I think you muted at least I don't hear thank you um I guess you know you touched on some of this but maybe you could talk a bit about some of the challenges you faced in terms of starting Code Monkey not just in terms of the market but you know you you have that backer and you were coding you were building something you were from Israel you're trying to grow this like talk about uh you know it's important for teachers and students to learn about you know now we're at a different place you have millions of kids using it and and schools and that's fantastic uh but wasn't always like that right at the beginning that's for sure how to what were some of those challenges you overcome how did you maintain that that ability to you know you know overcome those challenges as opposed to just saying you know what I could just go work for a company so there's sort of those two things you know challenges I know what enabled you to ensure that those challenges were overcome yeah um so that's a big question um I guess when starting a startup company um I Heard once they've done a research one it's it's like a caterpillar that has many different legs but all the legs have to take steps at the same time more or less so so like first we created like a prototype of the product um and that was really simple at creating a very small game that children liked and children and actually learned to code while playing it so that was the fun part um and the easy part so to speak because uh we got accepted into this incubator we received like a small investment from the incubator we kept our jobs like parttime jobs and in our the three cofounders we were all coders ourselves so we just created the game ourselves uh tried it in classrooms in schools in Israel um that was the easy part the hard part I guess is getting noticed um by potential users teachers potential Partners resellers schools governments and getting the attention of investors because Beyond just creating a small prototype coding it yourself everything else costs a lot of money like Marketing sales all of that um so yeah it was really just like always finding like the next step I remember for example the first large exposure that we received from users from teachers and students and families would through the computer science education week the hour of code uh we we shared this prototype that we had with code.org the foundation running uh the hour of code and they put it on their website and I remember around this time of the year uh eight years ago we just like overnight received like millions of users um um um yeah so that was one like jumping board for the exposure part and we had similar stories on how like one investor led to him the next investor larger investor than a strategic investor that also played as a distributor in a certain market and and so on so it's always about finding the next step in each one of those um each one of those uh challenges that you're trying to coordinate like exposure Marketing sales funding and of course uh product development right um and just because I have a question right here which I think ties nicely in it talked about challenges and then overcoming those um and you mentioned uh code.org and having millions of users due to the hour of code week that's one example can you maybe share a specific moment um in since 2014 with code monkey that was uh one of like the very happy moments in your in your you know startup process and even now so just something that you know all these kids everyone goes you know teachers they work so hard they have their own challenges and then they come out with like a great test that they studied on so like what is what is your example of that of a happy moment yeah uh well that night when we received like millions of you right so that's a good example that was an amazing week I remember that we almost didn't get any sleep that week we were busy uh maintaining the server so it doesn't crash we weren't expecting this huge traffic uh users um that was one uh other other interesting moments sleep I remember a specific meeting with uh we had like an angel investor putting a small amount of money uh a guy from Israel who's also a tech entrepreneur um and he told me I have a visitor from Japan he's my distributor for my stock company was creating like longrange WiFi routers he said my distributor in Japan is now in Israel I told you about you I told him about your company I think you should meet him and we sat down uh in the beach bar until I believe I remember it was Midday and I told him about the code monkey and like just interrupted me like in the middle of my pitch banged his his glass of beer on the table and said I want in I wanna I Wanna Be The Exclusive distributor in Japan and I want to invest I don't care about the terms like when you're fundraising let me know I'll be the first investor in the next round so I remember that was a happy moment well it is that's great it's great here it's it is unbelievable myself working at Code Monkey just seeing the global reach and how many places we've traveled to it and how many times we see pictures right now for those for those of you who don't know there's uh there's a contest for those who are using hour of code you could take a picture of your children using it and and tweets uh Code Monkey we're giving away a free home license as well as uh a gift card for the best picture for those who are enjoying Code Monkey so definitely uh um maybe uh Angie can put that in uh in in the end or when we'll we'll send it as a followup um Jonathan gonna take a break from some of my questions because in the Q a we've had a couple and it seems like a good place to uh to answer those so one person asked about um would you please give your thoughts on the quickest approach to learn how to code so I would say maybe not quickest but what's a great way to learn code and obviously you'll probably talk about code monkey and why Code Monkey is a great way to learn how to code yeah so so actually I have one important like Nuance to to address whenever uh I guess that question I remember before I started Code Monkey successfully between the first failed the time and the second successful attempt I was working in the software developer um and then like a lot of people were looking to transition from other careers into software development it was the 2000 and uh for like the the tech boom one of the you know Tech rooms um and then uh so you had all those ads online telling you like targeting grownups saying learn to code in seven days learn to code in in uh you know uh 24 hours learning to code uh become a software developer in one month and then I remember reading an article saying like learned to code in like 14 years like the truth about how long it takes to really become a you know a decent software developer and they were talking about like the good software developer they started early and it really takes you to with any I guess skill or job craft uh like to become really good at something to become employable and to become like good at what you do we take Serious um so I guess I will change the question a little bit is what is the quickest way to get like a an initial successful Taste of coding like an exposure to to programmatic thinking um and I think the best way to do that is actually through the hour of code week and all of those different small activities that use the gamified way short gamified course to give young children really a taste of what coding is and it can be using a real programming language like you do on on some of the Code Monkey Arrow code activities or it can be just those scratch style building blocks drag and drop things actually my daughter is now five so I started doing that with her using Code Monkey Junior uh yeah I think it's not the coincidence that those games and the arrow code weak became very popular because I think it's a great way to get quickly into coding not to become a coder quickly but to get into coding yeah it's a it's a great that's a great difference um someone and I and I guess you know using Code Monkey is that has all those aspects as gamified coding and a really just very simple way to to jump into into uh coding maybe not becoming the coding coder in the quickest way again that's not uh the what we we're trying we're trying to get them in and and really get them uh those basic skills so what's what's uh special about Code Monkey in terms of whether it is that jumping in the being ease of it or actually after being in Code Monkey for x amount of years and using it for a while you come out with with what so sort of the going and what makes Code Monkey different from uh maybe other programs not in specific where our code week everyone's all the coding companies are doing great work I think oh they're really there are so many excellent products we're teaching kids to code um and each which one is a bit different but um I wouldn't say that Code Monkey like something unique that no other products have but I I I I would say I will say that for Code Monkey um I think the priority um was always the top priority was creating an engaging experience for the learners for the for the young students and that was achieved through many different aspects of the product uh we always it's always crucial for us to keep the the courses very intuitive and selfpaced so that students uh can learn on their own at their own pace uh to keep the courses like to create the game a very like fullblown game experience like not a gamified course but an actual game and this doesn't mean that it needs to be like a very fancy game in a 3D World with a lot of visual effects and noises and sound of the contrary the the simpler the game is there was a research on that recently in Israel and the simpler the game is the better the learning outcomes are but the game does need to be a fullblown game like it needs to be and there needs to be characters you need to be a plot um the kids need to be like they need to get like sort of immersed in this in this game world so it was intuitiveness the the fullblown game experience um and then of course the pedagogy uh this is the most important thing when creating educational content so it's really like being mindful of a lot of and many many like small details and planning how you break the complex concept into simpler concept and creating this sequence where you build the uh the understanding of each concept like one on top of the other wow that's great and I highly suggest uh I'm sure many of you who are attending this webinar have already tried Code Monkey if not definitely go on codemonkey.com to register for uh free trial it's great so one more question before I get back into my list of questions Jonathan someone asked um May I know why it's called code monkey and the significance of its name yeah the name was very significant it's a catchy name and uh also a catchy logo I think um and um so we sort of borrowed the term Code Monkey uh it's not a term that that we created it was an existing term in the tech word uh uh it's sort of like a funny decoratory term for the junior coders on each software development team like the the most Junior coder coders you refer to them like as an internal joke is code monkeys and whenever you know you you break a large software project into many small pieces you give the the simpler task to the code monkeys like to the junior coders um so yeah so it's actually a decoratory term but there's nobody outside the tech world knows it so we thought we could just use it as a create a character a monkey character and that was actually my brother though the CTO the other cofounder of Code Monkey he came up with the name and the game concept of monkey collecting bananas wow yeah um it's exciting and you know it's Let's uh you talk to Brett at the beginning about getting noticed right you know you created a great program but to get noticed is sometimes Harden requires more than just having a great product that also requires the marketing and how you show so definitely that's been been important I Remember by the way this slide to your earlier question about a happy moment so when I moved from Tel Aviv to New York when Code Monkey reached that stage it was time to move to the United States and start the U.S office so I was getting a lot of reaction in New York like when I was telling people like just visiting a doctor or whatever uh what are you doing oh I started Coleman can say yeah Code Monkey I think I heard of it I think I know it and often I was thinking there's no way this person really knows Code Monkey but but I know the term sounds familiar so it made us sort of being perceived as bigger than than we really were at the time right wherever that's that is it's pretty uh pretty amazing um Okay so you know we we've talked about a number of number of items here about what was how you uh your background and code monkey's background so want to talk a little bit you know Code Monkey started you know eight years ago eight nine years ago what has changed and what has remained the same whether it's uh talk about the platform you could talk about maybe the the company itself but uh you know there's uh it's like a it's a company but it's a live company and there's things going on so what has changed and what has remained the same so we'll remain the same is you know our daytoday of creating gamebased coding courses for children and we pretty much do it the same way that we did it back then we create like a small initial version of a course we tried with children we we write down you know feedback from the user testing then we create a full version of the course release it get feedbacks from students teach your parents improve the course uh this hasn't changed and we you do it through the pedagogy a pedagogical experts software developers animators musicians so they stayed the same and I'm glad it did this is my favorite part of the of our work creating the courses and using them with children and getting the feedback and improving the courses uh what did change is the business side so back then as a startup company your main concern is reaching significant like success Milestones it would allow fundraising additional money from investor before you run out of the money that you raised previously and this was I'm glad we're beyond that stage because this is pretty um nervewracking um and and you you get it wears you out like this this sort of Chase um uh always chasing after a more invest investments before the money Runs Out and now that the companies were established and profitable uh so the business um the business challenge is is something I enjoy way more than the business Channel and the startup stage and it's just the challenge of sort of optimizing the business uh steadily growing it uh becoming better at planning becoming better at planning making business plan executing business plans becoming better at hiring the right people building the accurate teams managing them um better um yeah so it's really now about sort of optimizing the uh as uh as like sort of business professionals right yeah that's uh the right Partners as you know Zach right is something that we really be better in like you know yeah right Partners in each country and yeah yeah it's uh it's also interesting to really see um you know so many so many students who get to benefit from the program and that that focus and and you know keeping to the idea of from the beginning we were making gamified engaging coding courses for kids and we are still doing that and yeah so that's that's it's very hard to continue to do and but you know I can from my own experience it's it's true what's happening um so just looking a little bit to the Future you know we we've for those who don't know and it's it's I I highly suggest you all try out we've launched two new courses in digital literacy uh these are our first noncoding courses we have uh one on digital use um and digital citizenship we launched them this year a few months ago and they're being highly used they're they're beloved they're a new course but it's something that's completely different that we've done in the sense that they're not coding they're gamified learning programs but not coding so um where do you see Code Monkey in five years you know knowing you know we've launched these two courses but any type of vision or anything whether it's the courses or you know um anything like that that you could speak on would be great so I see cold monkey continue to um to grow on the path that we chose the recent few years of sort of transitioning from being um a courses company like specific courses coding courses to becoming a curriculum provider and that means covering Entire Computer Science curriculum according to different standards in different parts of the world so that's not only coding like you said it can include other subjects in computer science and to cover the entire pathway from kindergarten to eighth grade um and also to provide for all the different needs in uh required for for implementing computer science uh curriculum so that's not only the coding courses for the children that we've always been doing but uh also more about teacher resources teacher tools professional development for teachers customer success method that we improve every year to make sure that implementation is successful assessment quizzes um yeah all those other very crucial pillars that uh a curriculum solution uh relies on great um thank you do you with working on teacher tools and um the platform for teachers how do you feel the teacher's experience has been using Code Monkey um if they do have a background or don'ts so it was always uh actually the the problem that we were solving and still are is how to enable quick scaling of Computer Science Education despite the constant lack or shortage of computer science teachers in K8 or in winning K12 and I don't expect that to change soon because um but if you have computer science skills often you would choose um like a computer science in Tech I think that's the reason why it's always hard to find like computer science teachers with coding background um so so our challenge was always to sort of um bridge that Gap and to create a curriculum solution that would not require coding background from the teachers so we're sort of also teaching the teachers or helping the teacher like allowing the teacher to learn with their students as they go along yeah so so being successful with teaching with code monk you definitely don't need to have Computer Science Background the entire ID behind Code Monkey was to create a curriculum that would not require coding background from the teachers right we have um one of the uh attendees of this webinar uh she wrote in the Q a but really page best offroad teachers I know love Code Monkey most of us didn't know anything about coding before using we're learning along with our students yeah yeah and I think that's fun I think it's a it's an interesting it's something that's changing now in the education world with the internet and all like children they can learn things on their own on YouTube and and you know uh teachers are no longer expected to become the source of knowledge and it's more and more common to see classrooms and courses in school where teachers learn something new with their students and I think this is actually like this is sometimes um I don't know a better experience or like I think everybody's having more fun that way um yeah not not just with computer science right no that is interesting um have just a couple more questions here so uh if anyone of the attendees has any questions please make sure you write them um in the uh Q and A and where uh Angie is also answering any of the more technical questions uh so uh thank you very much Angie so um you've been you've been doing you've been at Code Monkey for some time now uh and um there's the happy times and challenging times um I guess this is for for everyone here myself included but how do you maintain the passion towards working at uh Code Monkey towards the same goal after so long right it's uh you've been in a almost decadelong marathon and uh yeah not everyone has that ability so what what enables you to be able to continue the work that you're that you're doing so I think what helps me um actually two things one of them is he goes back to my answer on your previous question that I'm learning to become I'm learning business I'm learning business management this is something I didn't have experience in and it's an interesting challenge in managing a company managing teams um it's about you know like working with people it is a by the way has some similarities to working working in education I feel uh sometimes I feel like my my employees are like my students uh in different ways and I like that challenge and I like becoming better uh um in management I guess um but on the computer science side and what's what what keeps this job interesting is that the market is still evolving rapidly uh it's not like math or English that has been taught like for you know thousands of years computer science is still a new subject it's still not a mandatory subject in most part of the world and to see how the market is maturing and computer science is being adopted in a more serious way gradually all over the world um it makes it more interesting and creates new challenges remember when we were beginning we're not getting questions about like now we're getting like tougher questions from clients about like what exactly do you teach in computer science how exactly do you teach how exactly do you assess learning outcomes like in the initial days nobody cared like they were just doing like just just give me some fun coding activity for my students for the article week and that's all I need and now it's becoming the demand the requirement are becoming more sophisticated so so you know it keeps things interesting so I on that where do you see coding in schools coding in after schools like it's it's clearly being uh put into curriculum globally uh do you see coding ever becoming something like math or science or a language where it's a daily subject or something that's in the weekly schedule uh yeah that it's definitely the trend is obvious if you look you know code.org they post statistics on that and if you look just as a on the American education system uh as an example and also it's probably one of the largest K12 systems in the world uh the trend is obvious like more schools are offering it more students are taking it more teachers are teaching it more states are requiring schools to teach it or to at least offer it as an uh um there's an elective um yeah so so the trend is definitely there and it's and it's very steady so um there obviously the the uh coding is where we focus and we moved into digital digital literacy um to a certain extent as coding grows what other what other what do you feel is very important for young students to learn and for teachers to focus on um in technology education as well you know coding is important for all the reasons whether it's getting a job understanding how technology works all the things you mentioned but you know we have people here where well what's important for the Educators to focus on and for the youngers children to or children and students and adolescents to learn about in terms of Technology so actually I'm very excited about the the recent course that we launched on on digital citizenship because um you know uh parents and teachers nowadays they tend to think like today's children were born with iPhones so we we think and they can do anything on them so we think they don't need to be taught how to use a computer how to use the internet because they just know it uh uh but that is not true so you know they intuitively know how to post something on a social network or how to watch a video on YouTube and to comment uh um but the World Wide Web is a complicated uh platform uh um and it's also uh kind of risky uh especially for children not only for children but there are so many things that you should watch out for and I'm in no way I don't wanna like I encourage parents and teachers to to let the children enjoy everything that they can from using the internet and computers all the great educational content that they consume and social the positive social interaction selfexploration and a lot of great things that can be done and those devices and on the internet but like I said this this though things are now riskfree and children nowadays like adults they don't the fact that they know how to use the internet it doesn't mean that they understand how it works and they don't understand how it works they also probably are not aware of the risks so I think um yeah it's it's a good thing to focus on at a quite early stage um is is the the things that we teach on the digital literacy course how to be safe how to use the internet safely for yourself and also you know not hurting others um because you know it's a powerful tool but like any powerful tool it can be it can be also uh create damage if you're not using it correctly for yourself and for other people right that's that's it's great to know um and uh yeah we highly encourage all of you to try out our new digitals uh digital literacy courses definitely give us any type of feedback Angie is our customer success manager who gets all that feedback and it helps us improve um the courses we have two more uh one comment and then uh one more question so I'll ask the question and then I'll then mention the comment is uh how does Code Monkey contribute to learning stem subjects so we just made sure like when creating the code monkey games uh to include other stem Concepts in it like distances numbers negative numbers angles degrees um in the more advanced courses things like velocity acceleration gravity so um it's uh it's very easy to use coding and Code Monkey it's sort of a playground to practice those math and physics Concepts and Engineering but even in the courses that don't uh deal with stem concept directly the the actual challenge of coding um is well known to to be fostering other sort of 21st century skills even if you're just coding like I don't know like a small game that has nothing to do with stem um the the action of coding the the mental challenges involved with it are very helpful in developing skill that are useful for any other subject and specifically stem like you know critical thinking problem solving collaboration um things like that no that's that's that's great and and I think that's something that we see more and more um and hopefully as as you mentioned as as this Market Global Market changes that people will see coding not just as a subject unto itself that's important to learn but how you know whether it's the computational thinking or the math that you learn or the you know I know globally like outside and in certain nonenglish speaking countries they'll use Code Monkey in English so that they can practice their English there's so many different ways that it impacts um the um impacts other subject areas in their learning and I just want to you know take that and what you mentioned and said uh from from Nicole who I personally work with in the United States she wrote uh this isn't a question it's a thank you I'm looking forward to seeing how working with Code Monkey impacts my students outlook on coding related interest this is my third year using Code Monkey schoolwide your programs allow us to grow and progress from block based to Tech space it's a wonderful program and so thank you very much Nicole for that um and and I think it really ties into everything that uh Jonathan said um Jonathan maybe you could give some closing remarks about Code Monkey about the hour of code um and then in the meantime if anyone asks any more questions otherwise uh we can then wrap up and uh we'll send everyone I put some links there that's codemonkey.com that will lead you to our page our website to see any of the information that you'd like you can sign up for free uh 30day trial if you sign up this week we've changed the parameters of the trial where you can get unlimited students so you can get your old school on it and then also if you go on the second one that's hour of code those are the activities you'll see Code Monkey is one of the first activities on the hour of code page this is out of many many different programs so that's just some of the back office but uh yeah maybe some closing remarks Jonathan for me yeah so it's the hour of code week and I happen to be wearing my Nike uh what do you call that sweatshirt I remember Nike I used to study slogan just do it do you remember that probably in the 90s of course so yeah I would just probably conclude that is the hour of code week just do it just you know choose one of the many different free hour of code activities uh book a time with your students in a classroom with computers or iPads or Chromebooks and just do it just give them these first taste of coding and see where it takes your classroom right that's a great ending uh Jonathan thank you so much for your time uh people from all over the world teachers and students alike uh really thank you so much for for joining this uh really fun and engaging webinar Angie thank you for the behind the scenes work we'll send a followup email to everyone um with some resources some of the links which I sent and as Jonathan said just do it go on uh go.org commoncodemonkey.com sign up for a free trial and really benefit from uh one of the world's best uh primary or elementary through Middle School uh computer science programs thank you so much Jonathan uh nice to see everyone have a great day thank you Zach and Andy and thanks everyone for attending bye
