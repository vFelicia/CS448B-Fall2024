00:04 - welcome to comparisons
00:07 - let's learn about comparisons
00:12 - equal equal sign is the equality
00:15 - operator
00:17 - so it is two equal signs next to each
00:20 - other
00:21 - a single equal sign is the assignment
00:24 - operator that you use with variables
00:27 - but when you want to see if two values
00:29 - are
00:30 - equal
00:31 - you use two equal signs
00:34 - and
00:35 - the equality operator goes between
00:38 - values
00:39 - and it compares the left value to the
00:42 - right value to determine
00:44 - if they are equal to each other
00:46 - or not
00:48 - here's an example
00:50 - if health
00:52 - equal equal 100 so that's checking to
00:55 - see
00:56 - if the function health which returns a
00:59 - number if that return number is the same
01:02 - as 100 if those are equal
01:05 - this condition will be true and you'll
01:08 - go to the banana
01:12 - let's look at an example
01:14 - here's an example where the monkey wants
01:17 - to get
01:18 - those five bananas
01:20 - uh but the gorilla does not want
01:24 - the monkey to get those bananas and it's
01:26 - going to start throwing things at the
01:28 - monkey so we need to make sure the
01:30 - monkey's at
01:32 - its best health so
01:34 - we have this little health zone object
01:37 - here that we can go to to get more
01:39 - energy
01:41 - so we are going to um for being bananas
01:46 - so we're looping through the different
01:47 - bananas we're going to go to the health
01:49 - zone
01:50 - and we're going to want to wait here
01:52 - until
01:53 - our health is 100.
01:56 - okay so that means we want to say until
02:01 - in our condition is going to be i think
02:06 - health i'm going to check our health
02:08 - that returns a number and we're going to
02:10 - compare it with the
02:12 - the quality operator to
02:15 - 100
02:17 - okay so until
02:19 - it's 100 we're just gonna wait
02:23 - and when it's
02:24 - get rid of this
02:26 - when it's um actually 100 we'll leave
02:29 - the until and go to the banana
02:34 - let's go try that
02:39 - and up here it will tell you it's house
02:41 - number
02:43 - so i think it's going to be going back
02:45 - to the health zone
02:50 - yeah that
02:53 - gorilla is really beating up the monkey
02:57 - has to go back a lot but i think you see
03:00 - the what's gonna happen here we'll get
03:01 - all the bananas
03:03 - and three stars
03:07 - is less than is another comparison
03:10 - operator
03:11 - it goes between values
03:14 - is less than that symbol
03:17 - determines if the left value is less
03:21 - than the right value
03:23 - so for example
03:25 - in an if statement we could have a
03:27 - condition like this
03:29 - health remember is a function that
03:31 - returns a number
03:33 - so if health is less than 70
03:37 - it will run the indented code which in
03:40 - this case says i am weak
03:42 - else
03:44 - and you're going to reach this else if
03:46 - health is greater than 70 or even if
03:50 - it's equal to 70
03:52 - you would reach this else and you would
03:54 - and you would execute the indented code
03:57 - which in this case says i am strong
04:00 - let's look at an example
04:02 - here's an example where the monkey wants
04:04 - to get a bunch of bananas
04:06 - but we have the gorilla that's going to
04:09 - get in the way
04:10 - so
04:12 - we'll need to go to the health zone
04:15 - so let's see how we're going to do this
04:18 - here we have a for loop
04:21 - um where we're going through each of the
04:23 - bananas we're going to go and get a
04:24 - banana
04:26 - and then we want to check to see if the
04:28 - health is lower than 70 and then do
04:30 - something about it if it is
04:32 - so let's see if
04:36 - our condition would be
04:39 - health
04:41 - is less than 70.
04:45 - all right what do we want to do
04:48 - we want to
04:52 - basically go to
04:55 - the health zone
04:58 - and
05:00 - while there we are gonna wait until
05:03 - [Applause]
05:05 - our health is equal to 100.
05:10 - we'll wait until that's true
05:13 - delete these two lines
05:16 - and when that is true
05:18 - we'll just go back up to the for loop
05:21 - and get the next banana and then check
05:23 - all of this again
05:25 - let's see if that works
05:31 - all right looking good
05:38 - okay okay has to go back again
05:46 - we got it
05:50 - now it's your turn to use comparisons
05:52 - good luck

welcome to comparisons let's learn about comparisons equal equal sign is the equality operator so it is two equal signs next to each other a single equal sign is the assignment operator that you use with variables but when you want to see if two values are equal you use two equal signs and the equality operator goes between values and it compares the left value to the right value to determine if they are equal to each other or not here's an example if health equal equal 100 so that's checking to see if the function health which returns a number if that return number is the same as 100 if those are equal this condition will be true and you'll go to the banana let's look at an example here's an example where the monkey wants to get those five bananas uh but the gorilla does not want the monkey to get those bananas and it's going to start throwing things at the monkey so we need to make sure the monkey's at its best health so we have this little health zone object here that we can go to to get more energy so we are going to um for being bananas so we're looping through the different bananas we're going to go to the health zone and we're going to want to wait here until our health is 100. okay so that means we want to say until in our condition is going to be i think health i'm going to check our health that returns a number and we're going to compare it with the the quality operator to 100 okay so until it's 100 we're just gonna wait and when it's get rid of this when it's um actually 100 we'll leave the until and go to the banana let's go try that and up here it will tell you it's house number so i think it's going to be going back to the health zone yeah that gorilla is really beating up the monkey has to go back a lot but i think you see the what's gonna happen here we'll get all the bananas and three stars is less than is another comparison operator it goes between values is less than that symbol determines if the left value is less than the right value so for example in an if statement we could have a condition like this health remember is a function that returns a number so if health is less than 70 it will run the indented code which in this case says i am weak else and you're going to reach this else if health is greater than 70 or even if it's equal to 70 you would reach this else and you would and you would execute the indented code which in this case says i am strong let's look at an example here's an example where the monkey wants to get a bunch of bananas but we have the gorilla that's going to get in the way so we'll need to go to the health zone so let's see how we're going to do this here we have a for loop um where we're going through each of the bananas we're going to go and get a banana and then we want to check to see if the health is lower than 70 and then do something about it if it is so let's see if our condition would be health is less than 70. all right what do we want to do we want to basically go to the health zone and while there we are gonna wait until our health is equal to 100. we'll wait until that's true delete these two lines and when that is true we'll just go back up to the for loop and get the next banana and then check all of this again let's see if that works all right looking good okay okay has to go back again we got it now it's your turn to use comparisons good luck
