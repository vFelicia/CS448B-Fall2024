00:19 - it's great to get up in elementary

00:23 - know the rings aren't too really too
00:24 - much knowledge yet so they're government
00:26 - to grow and I like the fact that you've
00:28 - had a very comprehensive curriculum
00:30 - because that was a good backbone for me
00:33 - to have to lean on I didn't stick to it
00:35 - all the time agile percent but it gave
00:37 - me a framework to follow which I use and
00:39 - I like the form of activities were

01:12 - want them to have the capability the
01:13 - understanding of basic basic skills that
01:16 - they typically do a code monkey doing
01:18 - code.org doing the things that will
01:19 - allow them to create something that is
01:21 - original whether it's a game or an
01:23 - animation or whatever it is that they or
01:26 - a short story whatever it is that they
01:28 - can create it as I want them to have a
01:30 - sense of of ownership of something
01:31 - that's original content because you know
01:33 - the challenges are wonderful for
01:35 - developing the skills and all of these
01:37 - programs some of the end goal is to have
01:39 - them be created as a partner and not
01:41 - just consumers of content so my job is
01:44 - really to Knight interest and get them
01:47 - involved so that then they can take it
