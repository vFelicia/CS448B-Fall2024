00:14 - poll at the beginning if you are able to
00:16 - hear me just raise your hand
00:23 - awesome great so it's good to check you
00:26 - know beforehand where you start really
00:27 - talking okay so let's go ahead and let's
00:32 - get started welcome to a deeper deeper
00:34 - dive in adventure this is part of the
00:38 - webinar series if you didn't catch our
00:39 - first one feel free about to us we're
00:42 - happy to share that with you but let's
00:44 - go ahead and let's get started so today
00:47 - we're gonna do how to teach coding in a
00:50 - deeper dive into coding adventure and I
00:53 - always like to start off the webinar
00:55 - talking about Who I am and kind of
00:56 - introducing the team that's here for our
00:58 - webinar so my name is Lena Saleh I'm the
01:00 - professional development manager here
01:02 - you can see here at code monkey I've
01:04 - been with professional development team
01:07 - for almost a year and a half now so feel
01:10 - free at any time if you have any
01:11 - questions about anything to just reach
01:13 - out to me and I'm happy to help with any
01:14 - of that kind of those questions as well
01:18 - and this is my Twitter as well as you
01:21 - can reach out to me via email
01:25 - hi guys I'm Zoe
01:27 - I do the marketing and social media here
01:30 - at code monkey and if you guys have any
01:33 - questions at all about our blog or about
01:37 - any initiatives if you guys want to
01:39 - write for clip monkeys blog as well
01:40 - reach out to me at Zoe D at monkey
01:43 - comm and I hope you guys enjoy this
01:45 - webinar awesome thanks Oh a she's
01:50 - joining us from our headquarters in
01:51 - Israel so it's a little bit late there
01:54 - for her so we're thankful that she's
01:55 - joining us with the joining us at this
01:57 - late time hey guys I'm mark and as you
02:01 - can see I'm part of the customer and
02:03 - success team I code monkey relatively
02:06 - new actually I saw a couple of people in
02:08 - the chat that were from Chicago and for
02:10 - the last 13 years I've been told about
02:13 - October 1st I was actually a Chicago
02:15 - teacher myself so happy to have
02:17 - everybody here and I look forward to
02:19 - working with you guys throughout the
02:20 - school year thank you and I also see
02:24 - here on are just a shout out to some of
02:26 - our teacher ambassadors as well thank
02:28 - you so much for taking the time to join
02:30 - us here too
02:32 - okay so let's go ahead and let's dive in
02:35 - so we're gonna here our objectives for
02:38 - today's webinar we're gonna recap and
02:40 - kind of just talk about it about the
02:42 - concepts that we've covered in coding
02:44 - adventure up to challenge 60 I hope that
02:47 - you've had a chance to play up to
02:48 - challenge Dixie if you haven't no big
02:50 - deal
02:50 - today is just designed to give you a
02:52 - little bit more reinforcement of the
02:53 - skills that we've learned throughout
02:55 - coding adventure we're also going to
02:57 - discuss and refresh our minds on where
02:59 - we find the lesson plans we're going to
03:00 - go over lesson 12 which is for loops and
03:03 - then we're gonna also play a little bit
03:05 - ourselves so if you are new your
03:08 - computer or that kind of thing we said
03:10 - we would love for you to go ahead and
03:11 - log into coding adventure or log into
03:14 - code monkey and then kind of have kony
03:16 - adventure ready to go and we'll show you
03:17 - what a few challenges we're going to
03:19 - play today during our webinar we're also
03:23 - going to review the challenge builder
03:24 - and we're going to work up to lesson 15
03:26 - we're going to review the challenge
03:28 - builder guide and then why and what
03:31 - could what challenge builder is and
03:32 - basically why we use it and then we're
03:34 - going to leave some time for the second
03:35 - part of our Q&A session for today
03:38 - so what are some of the concepts that
03:41 - you've learned throughout coding
03:42 - adventure so throughout coding adventure
03:44 - so far we have learned about functions
03:46 - objects object-oriented simple loops
03:50 - variables array and indexing we've
03:53 - worked your sequencing we work through a
03:55 - lot of algorithms and planning and then
03:57 - today we're going to work on the last
03:58 - bit of coding adventure part one and
04:01 - that's the four loops
04:04 - so before we get into the lesson itself
04:06 - we're going to talk about how do I find
04:08 - the lesson plans and where do I go to
04:10 - find the lesson plans so to find the
04:13 - lesson plans
04:17 - we go to the code monkey homepage and
04:19 - sorry about it being a little bit slow
04:21 - anytime you do webinars and things like
04:23 - that your computer kind of slows down a
04:24 - little bit so but to find the lesson
04:27 - plans themselves you will actually go to
04:33 - underneath the lesson plans under the
04:35 - teacher resources we have all of our
04:37 - lesson plans listed for all of our
04:38 - courses it's also how you access the
04:40 - challenge builder which I'll show you
04:41 - here in a little bit as well but these
04:43 - are access to a part 1 lesson plans part
04:46 - 2 in part 3
04:47 - but the my favorite part to access that
04:50 - is to go to the see my classrooms and
04:53 - once you do so you'll log into your
05:01 - once you do so you'll log pull up the
05:03 - classroom that you're working with and
05:04 - then it'll take you right to the lesson
05:06 - mode itself you can click on the
05:09 - specific lesson plan that matches the
05:11 - lesson itself so we're going to be
05:14 - working on lesson number 12 so I can
05:15 - just click over on lesson number 12 and
05:17 - when I do so it brings me to the lesson
05:20 - plan specifically for that lesson so I'm
05:22 - not having to fumble and kind of search
05:24 - through all the lessons themselves
05:28 - rearranging my homebuyers here you get a
05:31 - lot of things open and you kind of get
05:33 - move in there so that's how we follow
05:36 - some plan so under the teacher resources
05:38 - or in the lot itself so let's go ahead
05:40 - and let's kind of get started into
05:42 - lesson 12 and kind of exploring this
05:44 - lesson is titled for loop to the rescue
05:47 - um so just reading this guy here so just
05:54 - reviewing the lesson mode itself so if
05:56 - you're not sure about code monkey
05:58 - lessons or how to access it there's a
06:00 - great short tutorial here for you will
06:02 - actually pop it into the chat box for
06:03 - you as well and then in the for loop and
06:08 - then here we have our lesson plan so you
06:12 - can see we're doing for loop for the
06:13 - rescue or doing challenges 61 through 65
06:15 - today and then the lesson plans are
06:17 - broken up into three parts an
06:19 - introduction which is an unplugged
06:21 - activity or some kind of unplugged thing
06:24 - that we kind of unplugged activity
06:27 - basically essentially for most of those
06:29 - with encoding about your part one then
06:30 - we get into the play time which is
06:32 - always my favorite part and then the
06:34 - debrief as well
06:39 - so let's go ahead and let's begin our
06:43 - lesson so in the lesson plan itself
06:45 - obviously the very beginning part is
06:47 - just a summary of what it is that we're
06:49 - going to do so today we're going to in
06:51 - this lesson identify the difference
06:52 - between a simple open a for loop
06:54 - discuss how and when to use the for
06:56 - loops and then we're going to work on
06:58 - completing challenges 61 through 64
07:00 - together and then you're gonna play some
07:02 - of the challenges later coding in but
07:04 - later more advanced challenges within
07:06 - the coding concept that we're working on
07:08 - today the components that we're going to
07:10 - be focusing on is the four name in the
07:13 - array and then an array so you have
07:15 - learned in the previous challenges right
07:17 - up until this coding concept about an
07:18 - array you're not sure what those are
07:20 - we'll review those concepts together as
07:23 - always the standards are always here so
07:25 - today in the intro I'm actually not
07:27 - gonna read this board forward if you
07:28 - want to kind of refresh yourself after
07:30 - our lesson today or the what we're
07:33 - working on today you can always refer
07:35 - back to this lesson so I took this
07:37 - activity straight from the lesson um I
07:39 - modified it a little bit just because
07:40 - I've taught it in person and so you know
07:42 - I think ever goes exactly how you want
07:45 - it to so what I have found to be the
07:46 - best way for my students and for myself
07:50 - so what you're gonna do for this
07:53 - unplugged activity is we're gonna review
07:55 - the difference really introduced the
07:56 - kids between to a simple loop versus a
07:59 - for loop so what I'm going to do is I'm
08:01 - gonna have my students all get into my
08:03 - whole group activity area so I taught
08:06 - fifth grade so all my students will be
08:08 - up on the carpet kind of around me and
08:10 - then I'll kind of have like a section in
08:11 - the middle mine was always facing the
08:13 - board so I'll bring up six students and
08:15 - that's what you see here is a line of
08:16 - six students and I'll bring up a student
08:18 - that doesn't necessarily shine in all
08:20 - the areas and for me this was Lisa Lewis
08:22 - was an English language learner but he
08:25 - was sometimes struggled and like the
08:29 - other concept areas but this is a really
08:30 - place where he could shine that's a
08:32 - beautiful part I believe about coding is
08:34 - it really empowers those students that
08:35 - not necessarily are strong in all the
08:37 - areas but this is a place where they
08:38 - could showcase so I bring Louisa and I
08:41 - lined my six kids up in a circle I write
08:44 - this on the board I write two times step
08:47 - give a high five and put your hands down
08:49 - so we've already reviewed
08:51 - a simple of before and chalant in the
08:54 - very beginning challenges challenges 20
08:56 - through 30 and so the students have
08:59 - already been introduced to assemble oops
09:01 - so now I just write it out what they've
09:02 - actually seen before and basically what
09:04 - the students are gonna be all six
09:06 - students are gonna be standing in the
09:07 - line with their hand up and Louise is
09:08 - gonna walk to them give them a high five
09:10 - and then they're gonna put their hands
09:12 - down now what you see here is that there
09:17 - are four students that didn't get their
09:19 - hands high fived
09:20 - so now I'm gonna introduce the kids for
09:23 - a four loop and I'm gonna write the four
09:25 - loop on the board we're gonna talk about
09:26 - it so this time I'm actually gonna bring
09:29 - up I'm gonna leave the six kids in the
09:31 - line and I'm gonna say 4's and students
09:33 - so s is our variable students is our
09:36 - array which is the collection and in
09:37 - this case is the students I'm going to
09:39 - turn specifically to the student then
09:42 - I'm gonna step the distance to the
09:44 - student and give a high-five to the
09:46 - student so I'm just gonna do this and
09:48 - what you'll see is that Louise can clap
09:51 - every single basically give a high-five
09:53 - to every single student and they'll put
09:54 - their hand down now in this specific
09:56 - example before that okay so a simple
10:01 - loop repeats a specific number of times
10:03 - so in this and the example before there
10:05 - are only two students hands and then we
10:08 - only just stepped they were all in a
10:10 - line so he stepped to them and then I
10:12 - gave a high-five and only two students
10:14 - could do that now if I took both
10:16 - classrooms from both next door and I put
10:18 - all my students in the line I would need
10:20 - to count every single student in the
10:22 - line in this case when I do a for loop I
10:24 - don't have to do that the computer is
10:26 - calculating the distance for me I can
10:28 - actually even mix the students I can
10:30 - actually even send all the students back
10:32 - to their desk and I can tell Louise okay
10:34 - go around the room and have all the
10:35 - students have their hands up and give a
10:37 - high-five and continue going until
10:38 - you're finished so basically it's sort
10:41 - of like a forever loop so I'm gonna keep
10:43 - doing this until the condition is met so
10:46 - every single student would get their
10:47 - hand
10:48 - high-five and nobody would be left out
10:51 - whereas the cipa loop I had to count
10:53 - exactly how many students so just kind
10:55 - of something to keep in mind so why do
10:57 - we even review lesson number twelve why
10:59 - do we bring it up why do we think it's
11:01 - important for you well based on lots of
11:03 - teachers reaching out and
11:05 - observations that we've made in
11:06 - classrooms it's just a very hard concept
11:10 - for the students to understand it's very
11:11 - abstract you know you have the variable
11:13 - you have to define the array and what
11:16 - variable kind of goes inside of it and
11:18 - then you have to understand stuff in the
11:20 - distance and all of that kind of stuff
11:21 - so there's quite a lot to it it's
11:24 - actually a very advanced concept simple
11:27 - loops are a little bit more
11:28 - straightforward there is a lot more
11:29 - specific planning that's involved but
11:31 - that's kind of why we do a for loop so
11:34 - let's go ahead and let's get into what a
11:35 - for loop actually actually before we do
11:38 - that I'm gonna go over one more part
11:40 - that's in the lesson plan to kind of
11:41 - review for you basically better
11:45 - understanding for a for loop so let's
11:47 - think about my grandma let's say it's my
11:50 - grandma my little old grandma it's her
11:51 - hundredth birthday so I bake her a cake
11:53 - and I put a hundred candles on the cake
11:56 - but I tell her because she's older she
12:00 - might only not be able to kind of blow
12:03 - all of the candles so I tell her okay
12:05 - six times I want you to blow so she
12:07 - blows the candles six times and because
12:08 - she's a little old woman she can't
12:11 - really get to all of the candles on the
12:13 - cake so instead I say for every candle I
12:15 - want you to turn to it and I want you to
12:16 - blow the candle and so she does that and
12:18 - she's able to reach all of the candles
12:20 - and she keeps going until every candle
12:22 - is kind of blown out so those are two
12:23 - different examples of the Unplugged
12:25 - activities that come from the lesson to
12:27 - kind of showcase of for-loop
12:30 - okay
12:32 - so now we're going to go to challenge 61
12:34 - which comes right from the lesson and it
12:36 - that's what the next step in the lesson
12:37 - tells you to do and this introduces a
12:39 - for-loop before we get into this for
12:41 - loop itself and just want to show you on
12:43 - the story map if you haven't noticed up
12:44 - until this point the very beginning
12:48 - challenges within every single coding
12:51 - concept are just an intro to that
12:52 - concept there's not really a lot of
12:53 - changes that the students do and then it
12:55 - starts to really dive deep into the
12:56 - concept so just kind of something to
12:59 - kind of refresh and kind of keep in mind
13:00 - so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
13:02 - just gonna run it because I already have
13:04 - code here and I'm just going to debug it
13:05 - I want you to kind of notice what's
13:07 - happening we see we're running through
13:09 - the floor loop and every time the beat
13:12 - is called
13:13 - the monkey is going to that specific
13:16 - array so let's let's actually look at
13:19 - this so we have so we have the for loop
13:21 - we define the variable and we can see
13:24 - when we highlight it it shows you all
13:25 - the variables that are attached here and
13:27 - then I say the collection so if I click
13:30 - on the banana I can see that the
13:31 - collection is bananas so that is the
13:33 - array and I'm not defining the specific
13:36 - index I'm just saying for every time for
13:39 - every number for every banana within
13:42 - this array I'm gonna turn to that banana
13:43 - and it goes one at a time and then I'm
13:45 - gonna step the distance that banana I
13:47 - turn to is it is a concept we've already
13:50 - learned instead of me calculating and
13:53 - figuring out how far I want to turn I
13:56 - can just say turn to that specific
13:57 - object is only this works in a for loop
14:01 - instead of where if you had multiple
14:04 - bananas and you're doing a simple if you
14:06 - couldn't use a turn to because you would
14:07 - need to have a specific distance and we
14:10 - can see here these are not all uniformly
14:12 - lined up then we also can step the
14:14 - distance to it so I can pick up my ruler
14:16 - I don't have to measure the distance I
14:18 - don't have to pick up my ruler I don't
14:19 - have to measure the distance the
14:20 - computer is doing it all for me we know
14:22 - computers are very smart so why not have
14:23 - them do the work for us and just kind of
14:27 - work through that that way so now I'm
14:29 - going to change this instead to that a
14:33 - common misconception is that we always
14:35 - to use a letter to represent the
14:41 - variable you can actually use a word or
14:42 - even a phrase to represent a variable we
14:45 - use
14:45 - be because it's it's short it's concise
14:49 - and it matches the array so we want to
14:52 - kind of keep it consistent but you'll
14:53 - see here that at the bottom the button
14:55 - actually changed and it says cat instead
14:58 - of saying B and you'll see here that he
14:59 - will call cat every single time he goes
15:03 - through it so you'll see that the index
15:05 - is being called the variable cat is
15:09 - being there is being called and then
15:11 - he's going to the specific index so just
15:14 - something to notes I kind of keep in
15:15 - your background knowledge in case you
15:17 - you know I don't know cases student
15:20 - finds that out before you do so now here
15:25 - we're introducing the for loop and you
15:26 - see we have quite a large connection a
15:28 - collection of bananas here there's
15:30 - actually 11 but actually there's not 11
15:33 - because the computer always counts from
15:35 - 0 so they're actually 12 bananas located
15:37 - here on the screen so just something to
15:39 - kind of keep in mind so we're just going
15:41 - to step the distance to
15:45 - we're going to step the distance to the
15:48 - banana and we'll see here that is
15:51 - calling it out it's going much quicker
15:52 - go zero then it calls out one two three
15:54 - and it keeps going until every single
15:56 - banana has been caught within the array
16:00 - itself
16:05 - all right now moving along to our next
16:07 - one this is introducing us showing us
16:10 - how to do the how to click on the banana
16:12 - and figure out what the array is that
16:15 - kind of thing but something I want to
16:16 - note here is we've already learned how
16:18 - to do object oriented programming in
16:20 - previous challenges 11 through 20 and
16:24 - this isn't any different we are want the
16:27 - turtle to move rather than the monkey to
16:29 - move so we can see here that although
16:31 - they are evenly spaced and we could
16:32 - actually use a simple loop we don't need
16:34 - to use a simple loop here we can have it
16:35 - do all the work for us I don't need to
16:37 - pick up the ruler I'm just moving and
16:38 - grooving so to make sure that I catch
16:41 - the object tag because we're not having
16:43 - the monkey move we're having the turtle
16:45 - move so the we want the
16:49 - oops Mussa sob
16:53 - okay so we want the turtle to turn to
16:57 - the banana
16:59 - okay so you can see here that I made a
17:01 - mistake and it says I said turtle dot
17:04 - step we have to make sure that the
17:06 - turtle is still stepping but we want to
17:08 - know how far the distance to the the
17:12 - variable at the banana within the array
17:14 - so we make sure that we are still
17:17 - attaching the object tag and we're still
17:19 - saying step the distance ooh so now the
17:20 - turtle is performing action it's calling
17:22 - out the index each time it works through
17:24 - the for loop until there are no more
17:26 - left in the collection or in the array
17:31 - is the appropriate term that we use here
17:36 - okay let's look at one more and see what
17:41 - this looks like here
17:44 - so here we see the SE function and so
17:49 - when we say something we put it in
17:51 - quotation marks and let's just see what
17:53 - happens when I say hi because it's in
17:58 - quotation marks the monkey will also say
18:00 - it and we can also see that there's no
18:02 - way that I can figure out exactly where
18:03 - the distance is that the rat is going to
18:05 - drop the banana each time so he says hi
18:08 - and then we also need to do a for loop
18:10 - again so we need to do for the B in
18:12 - bananas and obviously the students can
18:16 - use the drop downs if they want for the
18:19 - B in banana what do we want to have
18:20 - happen we want the monkey oops - oops -
18:25 - turn to the banana so they want him to
18:28 - turn to the our banana or turn to the
18:32 - variable for which it calls the banana
18:33 - and then we want it to stuck the
18:35 - distance to call the next the banana so
18:38 - each time it's calling this a separate
18:40 - banana within the array
18:45 - and it doesn't necessarily in this case
18:48 - the monkey is going specifically to in
18:51 - order it's going zero one two three but
18:54 - in a four loop there is no there isn't
18:57 - one banana that needs to come before the
18:59 - rest and we do this so the students can
19:00 - see the show showcasing of the numbers
19:03 - within the sequence with the indexes
19:06 - within the array but it doesn't
19:07 - necessarily have to go that way
19:10 - he can just keep going until he's
19:11 - reached everyone kind of similar to when
19:13 - we were giving high fives in the room I
19:14 - didn't give any specific directions I
19:16 - just said keep going
19:19 - okay so we just talked about the for
19:23 - loop now we want you to try it and I'm
19:27 - going to be answering some questions if
19:29 - you have any during this time so I want
19:30 - you to explore playing challenges 65
19:33 - through 69 if you have any questions we
19:35 - want you to pop it in the box and walk
19:36 - on it during this time otherwise we're
19:39 - getting few minutes to play those
19:40 - challenges 65 through 69
19:43 - good luck
19:51 - you
20:03 - you
20:06 - you
20:18 - oh it would help if my timer
20:21 - was going fast for it here
20:29 - you
20:33 - you
20:48 - you
20:51 - you
20:54 - you
21:18 - and if you have any questions up until
21:21 - this point feel free to like I said pop
21:23 - it in the chat box or in the Q&A as well
21:33 - you
21:37 - you
21:55 - you
22:11 - you
22:12 - you
22:18 - cave about 40 seconds
22:31 - you
22:48 - you
22:59 - all righty nicely done we hope you had a
23:03 - chance to play those specific challenges
23:06 - and explore those
23:09 - now let's go ahead and let's get moving
23:11 - a little bit more and as you get in I'll
23:21 - just make a note of something as you get
23:23 - in further to the floor loop itself
23:27 - you'll also find that there's some
23:28 - doubleness at for loops and some
23:30 - different things that are showcased in
23:31 - there so feel free to just double check
23:34 - those before you kind of work with your
23:35 - students there's some double nested of
23:38 - crocodiles and some different things
23:40 - like that and also you can play the
23:41 - skill no challenges to help reinforce
23:43 - that skill set for students like I said
23:45 - it's very challenging for them so
23:47 - there's that alright great nicely done
23:50 - now we are going to get challenged so
23:56 - we're gonna go through our challenge
23:57 - builder so challenge builder is less
24:00 - than 15 I'm going to show you where that
24:02 - is we're gonna build a challenge we're
24:03 - going to explain why to use the
24:05 - challenge builder and then kind of the
24:07 - assessment and differentiation piece of
24:09 - that okay so how do we even get to the
24:13 - challenge builder itself
24:16 - um actually before I do that let's talk
24:18 - about the challenge builder guide so
24:20 - over here on the right hand side is our
24:21 - challenge builder you can click on the
24:23 - how to use it so that's under the
24:25 - teacher resources it says challenge
24:27 - builder and then you just click right
24:28 - there the other way to access this is by
24:31 - clicking on lesson 15 and then there's a
24:34 - specific lesson that is associated with
24:37 - this lesson itself I it will walk you
24:43 - through all the pieces and parts of the
24:45 - of the check of how to do the challenge
24:47 - builder I I'm very visual so I really
24:51 - like the challenge builder itself now
24:52 - this walks you through really great it
24:54 - barely has I suggest you to read it but
24:57 - those are the two places that you can
24:59 - access the child builder so here's the
25:00 - challenge builder guide here it's has
25:03 - lots of pictures and it has text to
25:04 - support it and it kind of walks you
25:05 - through all of the pieces components and
25:07 - parts of the challenge builder which I'm
25:09 - going to review with you today but in
25:11 - case you need a refresher just check out
25:12 - the challenge builder guide or a review
25:14 - lesson
25:16 - okay so now I'm in back on my teacher
25:20 - dashboard and I'm going to scroll down
25:22 - to this new section that we have if you
25:24 - haven't noticed that until the
25:25 - creativity and it's actually called
25:26 - create challenges so I'm going to click
25:28 - on create challenges I'm going to start
25:30 - coding
25:37 - the first thing you see here
25:40 - is that Gordo doesn't have any text
25:43 - associate Jim he doesn't have a word
25:44 - bubble he's not giving direction so it's
25:46 - the students job to tell their users how
25:50 - to solve this challenge or maybe give
25:52 - them a tip or something like that it's a
25:54 - really good place to work on digital
25:55 - citizenship because we know that kids
25:57 - like to pop in words in there that they
25:59 - think that we're not going to see it so
26:02 - that's just something to know a really
26:04 - good place to work on the spelling and
26:05 - punctuation and all that kind of stuff
26:08 - kind of tiling in multiple disciplines
26:09 - into the area or into the into the
26:12 - lesson itself because computer science
26:14 - doesn't always have to be taught in
26:16 - isolation like many people assume that
26:18 - it has to be okay so now we're on the
26:21 - challenge builder itself I just exited
26:23 - out of Gordo I didn't give him any
26:24 - directions yet I didn't give him
26:27 - directions because I want to wait until
26:28 - I figure out what I'm going to be
26:30 - creating before I actually give him the
26:33 - directions the first thing though I am
26:34 - going to do is click on this pencil and
26:36 - I'm going to name my challenge
26:38 - so in this case I'm just going to call
26:41 - it webinar
26:46 - gonna click the check sign and I'm gonna
26:48 - do that okay so let's see what I see
26:51 - here first so here we have a challenge
26:54 - that looks similar to challenge number
26:56 - one of coding adventure it's basically
26:59 - the same thing except we're going to
27:01 - build it so I'm gonna actually click on
27:02 - the configurations and the
27:04 - configurations is what I like to
27:05 - behind-the-scenes so here we can see the
27:08 - monkey we can see that he is located
27:10 - where he is on his XY coordinate
27:12 - something that is a misconception really
27:15 - with this is even though we know this is
27:16 - working on a plane on the XY coordinate
27:18 - plane 0:04 hmm any programming is
27:23 - actually here at the top so that's just
27:25 - something to kind of keep in in mind you
27:27 - can see that as I move him his XY
27:29 - coordinates are changing when I rotate
27:31 - him his rotation is changing I'm all of
27:34 - that good stuff when I click on the
27:35 - banana here we have the banana and we
27:37 - have XY you'll see that the banana is
27:39 - now added underneath the other banana
27:42 - because it's an array so we can move
27:45 - these separately we can spin them we can
27:47 - see that it's gonna keep track of
27:48 - everywhere that it is so that's the
27:51 - banana piece if I don't want an object I
27:53 - just throw it in the trash bye bye see
27:56 - you later so these three rectangles here
27:59 - if I click on them that changes the
28:01 - background just something to kind of
28:02 - keep in mind is that I really try to
28:04 - suggest that the students don't use
28:06 - something that they haven't been exposed
28:08 - to so some of the backgrounds although
28:11 - we are now reaching the end of coding
28:12 - adventure part one they've been exposed
28:14 - to a lot of these backgrounds but I just
28:16 - suggest them only using things that
28:18 - they've been exposed to so let's say
28:19 - we've used the dark water like we just
28:21 - used in challenge number 63 so we can
28:28 - kind of put him put them there and then
28:31 - if we click the plus sign here we can
28:33 - add objects to our to our challenge
28:38 - something to know is that as the
28:40 - students this the animals only open up
28:42 - as the students are exposed to those
28:44 - challenges so going back to our lesson
28:48 - mode how do I even find those oops sorry
28:52 - I had this up and then I kind of got out
28:53 - of there
28:56 - ooh in our challenge let me just let me
29:01 - just actually go there so you can
29:02 - actually see
29:10 - you
29:12 - you
29:18 - how you always have it there and then
29:20 - it's you lose it
29:25 - anyway so how you get so in the lesson
29:27 - mode itself in the actual lessons or in
29:30 - the lesson mode itself when you get
29:31 - there on the right hand side underneath
29:33 - the challenges is the character review
29:36 - card in the character review card I've
29:38 - mentioned it's in the previous webinar
29:39 - so it's there but it'll show you when
29:42 - the students have been exposed to that
29:44 - specific character so that's just
29:46 - important to note because you can
29:47 - sometimes teachers ask that question
29:49 - like why can they see something that I
29:50 - can can't I can't they see something I
29:53 - can see the goat actually will break
29:55 - bananas and I so that's something that
29:57 - they are exposed to later and the tiger
29:59 - in the polar bear will chase the monkey
30:01 - they like him they think of him as food
30:03 - so they'll chase him and if they kiss
30:04 - students don't know how to program them
30:05 - there's no sense in having characters
30:07 - they don't know how to use so the
30:08 - students can then add objects to the
30:10 - screen and then unfortunately all the
30:12 - objects are always unlocked but always
30:14 - remind me of the students we only what
30:16 - we know
30:16 - so like the ice they haven't been
30:18 - exposed to yet like those things so we
30:20 - want to make sure that they are using
30:21 - using the right things that that they
30:24 - already know how to do so now I'm just
30:28 - going to try it and this is where the
30:31 - students play basically solve their own
30:33 - challenges here and then something to
30:36 - note here on the bottom is these buttons
30:38 - let's say I'm not going to use the Save
30:39 - button I just just hit the - oops the -
30:43 - button
30:44 - and it will go and I could also add
30:47 - concepts and you can see that the
30:49 - concepts get pretty advanced for
30:50 - recursion greater than the weight that
30:53 - kind of things so I'm only adding
30:54 - buttons that have been exposed to
30:57 - so there's that part so let me just go
31:00 - back to the land here so why do we use
31:04 - challenge builder and what is it even
31:06 - important for us it's a really great
31:08 - place to have differentiation so
31:09 - students seem like they're really strong
31:11 - and maybe you know they're saying I'm
31:13 - getting bored or whatever it is it's a
31:15 - really great way for them to showcase
31:16 - what they've so a student may be really
31:20 - strong in solving the coding adventure
31:21 - challenges but when they go to represent
31:23 - it rebuild it and recreate it they might
31:25 - not have the same strength that they
31:26 - showcased in the challenges themselves
31:28 - so this is a really great place to have
31:30 - that additional assessment or even have
31:32 - that extra enrichment or differentiation
31:34 - practice so let's just say I have these
31:36 - bananas here and gonna add another one
31:38 - I'll put my banana here and just kind of
31:40 - show you I'm just going to have the
31:42 - monkey turn to
31:45 - this banana and then I'm going to have
31:49 - him step and maybe I pick up the ruler
31:52 - and I measure it and I have him step 11
31:56 - and we'll see that I click run not only
31:58 - do I solve the challenge but I also need
32:01 - to write a message here at the end so
32:02 - that's just something also to kind of
32:04 - keep in mind then I want to share it
32:07 - before I share I always save so this is
32:10 - important to note students will share
32:11 - before they've saved and will not share
32:14 - what they built so I have to make sure
32:16 - of that
32:17 - so then I'm gonna continue editing and
32:20 - let's say I'm gonna share I finished
32:21 - building it ago I have it on private
32:24 - right now it's really not private for
32:26 - the student because it is showcasing in
32:29 - your showroom on your teacher on your
32:31 - classrooms page in the showroom page
32:34 - those are all populated there and
32:35 - they're all listed you can search by
32:36 - student and all of that good stuff there
32:38 - so that's what the private is it means
32:40 - they can only see it if they do the
32:42 - classroom and they publish it
32:49 - you
32:52 - I'll just show you what the this looks
32:54 - like
32:58 - you
33:04 - then for the student over here on the
33:06 - right hand side you'll see that all of
33:08 - the challenges that they've created and
33:10 - shared with their with their classroom
33:12 - they're able to play and do all that
33:15 - over there on that right hand side so
33:17 - that's just the place where the students
33:18 - actually see it themselves
33:23 - okay then I can create a live link here
33:25 - now this is really great so I used to
33:28 - have like the remind app and I would
33:29 - copy this this link and I would share
33:31 - with my parent so they could play what
33:33 - the students had created that day I'm
33:34 - really a great place to create to create
33:38 - buy-in or even doing like an arcade a
33:40 - embedding that webpage like that kind of
33:42 - a thing you can copy the link and it's
33:44 - live link and then when you publish the
33:46 - code monkey community it goes into the
33:47 - discover pay or do the discover tab so
33:50 - I'll show you where that is so when I
33:51 - publish it just keep in mind it is
33:53 - heavily vetted and so the students tend
33:56 - to write things that they think they
33:59 - think might not be you know the thing
34:03 - that we can't see but we can't see them
34:06 - so it's always pretty heavily vetted as
34:08 - far as that goes okay so in the discover
34:12 - tab I just want to show you where
34:13 - everything is placed so in the discover
34:15 - tab I will click on challenges so how I
34:18 - got there as I went to the main home
34:19 - code monkey page I clicked on discover
34:21 - and then I go to the challenges key that
34:25 - is a great question and I'm will answer
34:27 - for you that here at the end in that and
34:31 - then we have all the challenges and
34:32 - these are where all the students have
34:33 - published them you can actually sort by
34:35 - language as well we have we have ten
34:37 - million users were over ten million
34:38 - users worldwide so it might just be nice
34:41 - to kind of sort by English as well and
34:43 - then what you'll do is you can just have
34:45 - the students create a challenge for
34:47 - example probably I hope they're using a
34:50 - forever loop in this challenge
34:53 - specifically itself but those students
34:57 - can play their own challenges other
34:58 - people's challenges so what better way
35:00 - to challenge yourself in a new way then
35:03 - to play another student's challenge
35:10 - and students can also like it and the
35:12 - students can see how many people viewed
35:14 - their challenges so that's always like
35:15 - an as well just get this to refresh here
35:25 - and when they're sharing worldwide it's
35:27 - really great place for them to that
35:28 - their grammar is correct and that
35:31 - they're using the appropriate language
35:33 - my internet doesn't seem to be loading
35:37 - this challenge but it's the way that you
35:38 - can kind of access that as well so just
35:40 - kind of keep that in mind that you can
35:42 - the students can't tell there's
35:44 - challenges and other people's from
35:46 - worldwide users so there's some really
35:48 - great ones on here you know the kids
35:50 - have really their kids get really
35:52 - creative and they do things that you
35:54 - wouldn't think they would so it's just a
35:55 - nice way to kind of
36:01 - do that as well so here we can see
36:03 - there's no capitalization there's no
36:04 - period so just kind of something to kind
36:06 - of keep in mind sharing this publicly
36:08 - you really want to do your best work so
36:10 - the student has shook left these buttons
36:12 - at the bottom so there must be something
36:14 - here like stepping the distance to maybe
36:17 - turning to the banana this is more
36:18 - challenging because these are blocking
36:20 - them off so it's a really fun one to
36:23 - kind of play in salt
36:27 - okay so we have reviewed the concepts
36:33 - that we've covered up until challenge
36:35 - number 60 we reviewed where to find the
36:37 - lesson plans in the lesson mode itself
36:39 - and under the teacher resources we
36:41 - reviewed for loops and went into lesson
36:44 - 12 and you guys got to play a little bit
36:46 - of the challenges yourself we reviewed
36:48 - the challenge builder lesson 15 the
36:52 - challenge builder guide where it's
36:54 - located members under the teacher
36:55 - resources we use the challenge builder
36:58 - for additional assessment as well as me
37:00 - her student that's struggling or just a
37:04 - way to create a little bit more of that
37:05 - like extra challenge I guess no way and
37:10 - then we're gonna do some more QA here
37:13 - before I get to your questions I see
37:15 - some really great questions which I'm
37:17 - gonna review with you go over here for
37:19 - you I want time for your questions
37:21 - because it's interactive but we do have
37:25 - our new banana Tales course so if you
37:26 - haven't had the chance to check it out
37:28 - on the code monkey page you can click on
37:29 - the different courses and you can see
37:31 - banana tales banana tales is geared for
37:33 - grades 5 through 8
37:35 - it is the full Python course similar to
37:37 - coding adventure but walking them
37:39 - through the Python basically coding
37:41 - concepts and components and things that
37:43 - they need to know to become immersed in
37:47 - the world of Python code monkey junior
37:49 - is really designed for pre readers it is
37:52 - a block based course but there are no
37:54 - words or using symbol they're using
37:57 - arrows to kind of get and collect the
37:59 - banana and then our brand new course is
38:01 - beaver achiever this is a block based
38:04 - course geared for really get grades 1 &
38:08 - 2 they work through some coding concepts
38:11 - and some challenges and it's based on
38:13 - blockly so it's just a little less
38:15 - reading but still working through the
38:18 - computational thinking and programming
38:20 - and all of that kind of stuff and then
38:21 - if you haven't noticed you can now find
38:23 - this specifically at code monkey comm
38:24 - before it was plate code monkey comm um
38:27 - even if you type in plate code monkey
38:29 - comm it will redirect you but you just
38:31 - said can go to code monkey comm and find
38:34 - us there
38:36 - so now we're gonna leave some time for Q
38:38 - and a so keep asked this question and
38:41 - I'll go ahead and go through it with you
38:43 - he said where exactly is the showroom
38:47 - located on my teachers page and I know
38:49 - Zoey answered that but I would like to
38:50 - show you where that is because sometimes
38:52 - it can be like well where is it so I
38:54 - clicked on my see my classrooms and then
38:57 - I'm going to click on my classroom which
38:59 - I would like to find their actual
39:02 - challenges themselves and you'll see
39:04 - here along the top there is the show
39:07 - room so I'll just click here on the show
39:09 - room and ask students create the
39:12 - challenges they will just populate here
39:15 - and it's just created by student and
39:17 - then at the top over here you can search
39:18 - by a specific student let's say you're
39:20 - not trying to find every single one of
39:22 - them there
39:26 - okay and then Melissa asked me a
39:29 - question regarding the challenge builder
39:31 - itself so let's go to the challenge
39:33 - builder she said where do you click to
39:36 - add two other buttons for the challenge
39:39 - builder so let me let me get back to the
39:42 - challenge builder here
39:44 - so I can show you but basically on the
39:47 - bottom of the challenge itself there's
39:49 - like a little plus sign
39:54 - we just reorganized our courses and I
39:57 - love it they are now organized by by
40:02 - course and it's great so Melissa down
40:05 - here at the bottom where this plus see
40:08 - how it when I hover over it there's a
40:10 - minus sign I can take away ones I don't
40:11 - want and then if I add the plus sign I
40:13 - can add ones that I want so there's that
40:23 - Zoe I think you could probably help me
40:25 - with Donna's question here her question
40:28 - is if my students share a challenge to
40:29 - their group is that only their class I
40:32 - have four classes using CM I would love
40:34 - for them to see each other's challenges
40:35 - before sharing with the public I believe
40:37 - that the challenge is Zoe would you do
40:40 - you want to answer that yes that's a
40:42 - great question so the challenges are
40:46 - accessible to that class only but we can
40:52 - we can get back to you regarding having
40:54 - the other students see it you can also
40:57 - have them share the links and then they
41:01 - can the rest of the students can see it
41:03 - but I believe it's it's only for the
41:05 - specific class that they're in and I
41:08 - will we will get back to you to see if
41:10 - it's possible to have them see the other
41:12 - your other classrooms challenges as well
41:16 - and then we had one more question in
41:19 - this thing Zoe that's a great answer can
41:22 - a student publish it in the code monkey
41:24 - community or limits to the classroom so
41:26 - you can publish it to the classroom and
41:29 - to the community you can share both it
41:31 - does not limit you to do one or the
41:32 - other so let's say like Donna your class
41:34 - is loving Jimmy's challenge or Sally's
41:39 - challenge in the lakhan's the best one
41:40 - and so you allow them to like share it
41:42 - to the community you can do both so
41:44 - there's no limitations there
41:51 - is there any option on code monkey to
41:55 - share the link is that I'm sorry can you
42:01 - just clarify for me is that for Divya
42:05 - did you oh sorry I want to put your your
42:08 - name there is that are you talking
42:10 - specifically for the challenge itself or
42:12 - for anything else as far as coding
42:14 - adventure Oh for the challenge critic
42:16 - yes there is so when you are that's a
42:18 - great question so is there a way to
42:20 - share a live link when the challenge
42:23 - have and created there is when you click
42:25 - share and you click right here it's kind
42:28 - of small but it's right here it has link
42:30 - settings you could turn the link on and
42:32 - when you do then you can copy the link
42:34 - so great for sharing and all of that
42:36 - good stuff
42:38 - so just another way
42:43 - okay
42:47 - so we want to make sure that we are you
42:50 - know honoring your time and we thank you
42:52 - so much for spending time with us if
42:54 - there are any other questions I think it
43:01 - seems like we're pretty good at making
43:02 - pretty good time here just wanted to let
43:07 - you know that you can
43:10 - let's go back here
43:14 - oh I forgot about this I don't know if
43:17 - you guys noticed along the bottom but
43:18 - there was a teacher in a little car kind
43:22 - of crawling along the bottom here I
43:25 - personally love this little won't this
43:27 - little teacher in the car because we are
43:29 - designed to put you the teacher in the
43:30 - driver's seat and we want to make it
43:33 - just as easy to drive a car as it is for
43:35 - you to code so you could also follow us
43:40 - along on twitter at a code monkey st you
43:44 - or on our instagram or if you have any
43:46 - questions following the webinar please
43:48 - email us with any questions that you
43:50 - have we thank you so much for joining us
43:52 - this afternoon and we hope that you
43:54 - continue to write code catch bananas and
43:56 - save the world bye have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

you you awesome thank you to everyone who is joining us I always like to do a quick poll at the beginning if you are able to hear me just raise your hand awesome great so it's good to check you know beforehand where you start really talking okay so let's go ahead and let's get started welcome to a deeper deeper dive in adventure this is part of the webinar series if you didn't catch our first one feel free about to us we're happy to share that with you but let's go ahead and let's get started so today we're gonna do how to teach coding in a deeper dive into coding adventure and I always like to start off the webinar talking about Who I am and kind of introducing the team that's here for our webinar so my name is Lena Saleh I'm the professional development manager here you can see here at code monkey I've been with professional development team for almost a year and a half now so feel free at any time if you have any questions about anything to just reach out to me and I'm happy to help with any of that kind of those questions as well and this is my Twitter as well as you can reach out to me via email hi guys I'm Zoe I do the marketing and social media here at code monkey and if you guys have any questions at all about our blog or about any initiatives if you guys want to write for clip monkeys blog as well reach out to me at Zoe D at monkey comm and I hope you guys enjoy this webinar awesome thanks Oh a she's joining us from our headquarters in Israel so it's a little bit late there for her so we're thankful that she's joining us with the joining us at this late time hey guys I'm mark and as you can see I'm part of the customer and success team I code monkey relatively new actually I saw a couple of people in the chat that were from Chicago and for the last 13 years I've been told about October 1st I was actually a Chicago teacher myself so happy to have everybody here and I look forward to working with you guys throughout the school year thank you and I also see here on are just a shout out to some of our teacher ambassadors as well thank you so much for taking the time to join us here too okay so let's go ahead and let's dive in so we're gonna here our objectives for today's webinar we're gonna recap and kind of just talk about it about the concepts that we've covered in coding adventure up to challenge 60 I hope that you've had a chance to play up to challenge Dixie if you haven't no big deal today is just designed to give you a little bit more reinforcement of the skills that we've learned throughout coding adventure we're also going to discuss and refresh our minds on where we find the lesson plans we're going to go over lesson 12 which is for loops and then we're gonna also play a little bit ourselves so if you are new your computer or that kind of thing we said we would love for you to go ahead and log into coding adventure or log into code monkey and then kind of have kony adventure ready to go and we'll show you what a few challenges we're going to play today during our webinar we're also going to review the challenge builder and we're going to work up to lesson 15 we're going to review the challenge builder guide and then why and what could what challenge builder is and basically why we use it and then we're going to leave some time for the second part of our Q&A session for today so what are some of the concepts that you've learned throughout coding adventure so throughout coding adventure so far we have learned about functions objects objectoriented simple loops variables array and indexing we've worked your sequencing we work through a lot of algorithms and planning and then today we're going to work on the last bit of coding adventure part one and that's the four loops so before we get into the lesson itself we're going to talk about how do I find the lesson plans and where do I go to find the lesson plans so to find the lesson plans we go to the code monkey homepage and sorry about it being a little bit slow anytime you do webinars and things like that your computer kind of slows down a little bit so but to find the lesson plans themselves you will actually go to underneath the lesson plans under the teacher resources we have all of our lesson plans listed for all of our courses it's also how you access the challenge builder which I'll show you here in a little bit as well but these are access to a part 1 lesson plans part 2 in part 3 but the my favorite part to access that is to go to the see my classrooms and once you do so you'll log into your once you do so you'll log pull up the classroom that you're working with and then it'll take you right to the lesson mode itself you can click on the specific lesson plan that matches the lesson itself so we're going to be working on lesson number 12 so I can just click over on lesson number 12 and when I do so it brings me to the lesson plan specifically for that lesson so I'm not having to fumble and kind of search through all the lessons themselves rearranging my homebuyers here you get a lot of things open and you kind of get move in there so that's how we follow some plan so under the teacher resources or in the lot itself so let's go ahead and let's kind of get started into lesson 12 and kind of exploring this lesson is titled for loop to the rescue um so just reading this guy here so just reviewing the lesson mode itself so if you're not sure about code monkey lessons or how to access it there's a great short tutorial here for you will actually pop it into the chat box for you as well and then in the for loop and then here we have our lesson plan so you can see we're doing for loop for the rescue or doing challenges 61 through 65 today and then the lesson plans are broken up into three parts an introduction which is an unplugged activity or some kind of unplugged thing that we kind of unplugged activity basically essentially for most of those with encoding about your part one then we get into the play time which is always my favorite part and then the debrief as well so let's go ahead and let's begin our lesson so in the lesson plan itself obviously the very beginning part is just a summary of what it is that we're going to do so today we're going to in this lesson identify the difference between a simple open a for loop discuss how and when to use the for loops and then we're going to work on completing challenges 61 through 64 together and then you're gonna play some of the challenges later coding in but later more advanced challenges within the coding concept that we're working on today the components that we're going to be focusing on is the four name in the array and then an array so you have learned in the previous challenges right up until this coding concept about an array you're not sure what those are we'll review those concepts together as always the standards are always here so today in the intro I'm actually not gonna read this board forward if you want to kind of refresh yourself after our lesson today or the what we're working on today you can always refer back to this lesson so I took this activity straight from the lesson um I modified it a little bit just because I've taught it in person and so you know I think ever goes exactly how you want it to so what I have found to be the best way for my students and for myself so what you're gonna do for this unplugged activity is we're gonna review the difference really introduced the kids between to a simple loop versus a for loop so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna have my students all get into my whole group activity area so I taught fifth grade so all my students will be up on the carpet kind of around me and then I'll kind of have like a section in the middle mine was always facing the board so I'll bring up six students and that's what you see here is a line of six students and I'll bring up a student that doesn't necessarily shine in all the areas and for me this was Lisa Lewis was an English language learner but he was sometimes struggled and like the other concept areas but this is a really place where he could shine that's a beautiful part I believe about coding is it really empowers those students that not necessarily are strong in all the areas but this is a place where they could showcase so I bring Louisa and I lined my six kids up in a circle I write this on the board I write two times step give a high five and put your hands down so we've already reviewed a simple of before and chalant in the very beginning challenges challenges 20 through 30 and so the students have already been introduced to assemble oops so now I just write it out what they've actually seen before and basically what the students are gonna be all six students are gonna be standing in the line with their hand up and Louise is gonna walk to them give them a high five and then they're gonna put their hands down now what you see here is that there are four students that didn't get their hands high fived so now I'm gonna introduce the kids for a four loop and I'm gonna write the four loop on the board we're gonna talk about it so this time I'm actually gonna bring up I'm gonna leave the six kids in the line and I'm gonna say 4's and students so s is our variable students is our array which is the collection and in this case is the students I'm going to turn specifically to the student then I'm gonna step the distance to the student and give a highfive to the student so I'm just gonna do this and what you'll see is that Louise can clap every single basically give a highfive to every single student and they'll put their hand down now in this specific example before that okay so a simple loop repeats a specific number of times so in this and the example before there are only two students hands and then we only just stepped they were all in a line so he stepped to them and then I gave a highfive and only two students could do that now if I took both classrooms from both next door and I put all my students in the line I would need to count every single student in the line in this case when I do a for loop I don't have to do that the computer is calculating the distance for me I can actually even mix the students I can actually even send all the students back to their desk and I can tell Louise okay go around the room and have all the students have their hands up and give a highfive and continue going until you're finished so basically it's sort of like a forever loop so I'm gonna keep doing this until the condition is met so every single student would get their hand highfive and nobody would be left out whereas the cipa loop I had to count exactly how many students so just kind of something to keep in mind so why do we even review lesson number twelve why do we bring it up why do we think it's important for you well based on lots of teachers reaching out and observations that we've made in classrooms it's just a very hard concept for the students to understand it's very abstract you know you have the variable you have to define the array and what variable kind of goes inside of it and then you have to understand stuff in the distance and all of that kind of stuff so there's quite a lot to it it's actually a very advanced concept simple loops are a little bit more straightforward there is a lot more specific planning that's involved but that's kind of why we do a for loop so let's go ahead and let's get into what a for loop actually actually before we do that I'm gonna go over one more part that's in the lesson plan to kind of review for you basically better understanding for a for loop so let's think about my grandma let's say it's my grandma my little old grandma it's her hundredth birthday so I bake her a cake and I put a hundred candles on the cake but I tell her because she's older she might only not be able to kind of blow all of the candles so I tell her okay six times I want you to blow so she blows the candles six times and because she's a little old woman she can't really get to all of the candles on the cake so instead I say for every candle I want you to turn to it and I want you to blow the candle and so she does that and she's able to reach all of the candles and she keeps going until every candle is kind of blown out so those are two different examples of the Unplugged activities that come from the lesson to kind of showcase of forloop okay so now we're going to go to challenge 61 which comes right from the lesson and it that's what the next step in the lesson tells you to do and this introduces a forloop before we get into this for loop itself and just want to show you on the story map if you haven't noticed up until this point the very beginning challenges within every single coding concept are just an intro to that concept there's not really a lot of changes that the students do and then it starts to really dive deep into the concept so just kind of something to kind of refresh and kind of keep in mind so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna run it because I already have code here and I'm just going to debug it I want you to kind of notice what's happening we see we're running through the floor loop and every time the beat is called the monkey is going to that specific array so let's let's actually look at this so we have so we have the for loop we define the variable and we can see when we highlight it it shows you all the variables that are attached here and then I say the collection so if I click on the banana I can see that the collection is bananas so that is the array and I'm not defining the specific index I'm just saying for every time for every number for every banana within this array I'm gonna turn to that banana and it goes one at a time and then I'm gonna step the distance that banana I turn to is it is a concept we've already learned instead of me calculating and figuring out how far I want to turn I can just say turn to that specific object is only this works in a for loop instead of where if you had multiple bananas and you're doing a simple if you couldn't use a turn to because you would need to have a specific distance and we can see here these are not all uniformly lined up then we also can step the distance to it so I can pick up my ruler I don't have to measure the distance I don't have to pick up my ruler I don't have to measure the distance the computer is doing it all for me we know computers are very smart so why not have them do the work for us and just kind of work through that that way so now I'm going to change this instead to that a common misconception is that we always to use a letter to represent the variable you can actually use a word or even a phrase to represent a variable we use be because it's it's short it's concise and it matches the array so we want to kind of keep it consistent but you'll see here that at the bottom the button actually changed and it says cat instead of saying B and you'll see here that he will call cat every single time he goes through it so you'll see that the index is being called the variable cat is being there is being called and then he's going to the specific index so just something to notes I kind of keep in your background knowledge in case you you know I don't know cases student finds that out before you do so now here we're introducing the for loop and you see we have quite a large connection a collection of bananas here there's actually 11 but actually there's not 11 because the computer always counts from 0 so they're actually 12 bananas located here on the screen so just something to kind of keep in mind so we're just going to step the distance to we're going to step the distance to the banana and we'll see here that is calling it out it's going much quicker go zero then it calls out one two three and it keeps going until every single banana has been caught within the array itself all right now moving along to our next one this is introducing us showing us how to do the how to click on the banana and figure out what the array is that kind of thing but something I want to note here is we've already learned how to do object oriented programming in previous challenges 11 through 20 and this isn't any different we are want the turtle to move rather than the monkey to move so we can see here that although they are evenly spaced and we could actually use a simple loop we don't need to use a simple loop here we can have it do all the work for us I don't need to pick up the ruler I'm just moving and grooving so to make sure that I catch the object tag because we're not having the monkey move we're having the turtle move so the we want the oops Mussa sob okay so we want the turtle to turn to the banana okay so you can see here that I made a mistake and it says I said turtle dot step we have to make sure that the turtle is still stepping but we want to know how far the distance to the the variable at the banana within the array so we make sure that we are still attaching the object tag and we're still saying step the distance ooh so now the turtle is performing action it's calling out the index each time it works through the for loop until there are no more left in the collection or in the array is the appropriate term that we use here okay let's look at one more and see what this looks like here so here we see the SE function and so when we say something we put it in quotation marks and let's just see what happens when I say hi because it's in quotation marks the monkey will also say it and we can also see that there's no way that I can figure out exactly where the distance is that the rat is going to drop the banana each time so he says hi and then we also need to do a for loop again so we need to do for the B in bananas and obviously the students can use the drop downs if they want for the B in banana what do we want to have happen we want the monkey oops oops turn to the banana so they want him to turn to the our banana or turn to the variable for which it calls the banana and then we want it to stuck the distance to call the next the banana so each time it's calling this a separate banana within the array and it doesn't necessarily in this case the monkey is going specifically to in order it's going zero one two three but in a four loop there is no there isn't one banana that needs to come before the rest and we do this so the students can see the show showcasing of the numbers within the sequence with the indexes within the array but it doesn't necessarily have to go that way he can just keep going until he's reached everyone kind of similar to when we were giving high fives in the room I didn't give any specific directions I just said keep going okay so we just talked about the for loop now we want you to try it and I'm going to be answering some questions if you have any during this time so I want you to explore playing challenges 65 through 69 if you have any questions we want you to pop it in the box and walk on it during this time otherwise we're getting few minutes to play those challenges 65 through 69 good luck you you you oh it would help if my timer was going fast for it here you you you you you and if you have any questions up until this point feel free to like I said pop it in the chat box or in the Q&A as well you you you you you cave about 40 seconds you you all righty nicely done we hope you had a chance to play those specific challenges and explore those now let's go ahead and let's get moving a little bit more and as you get in I'll just make a note of something as you get in further to the floor loop itself you'll also find that there's some doubleness at for loops and some different things that are showcased in there so feel free to just double check those before you kind of work with your students there's some double nested of crocodiles and some different things like that and also you can play the skill no challenges to help reinforce that skill set for students like I said it's very challenging for them so there's that alright great nicely done now we are going to get challenged so we're gonna go through our challenge builder so challenge builder is less than 15 I'm going to show you where that is we're gonna build a challenge we're going to explain why to use the challenge builder and then kind of the assessment and differentiation piece of that okay so how do we even get to the challenge builder itself um actually before I do that let's talk about the challenge builder guide so over here on the right hand side is our challenge builder you can click on the how to use it so that's under the teacher resources it says challenge builder and then you just click right there the other way to access this is by clicking on lesson 15 and then there's a specific lesson that is associated with this lesson itself I it will walk you through all the pieces and parts of the of the check of how to do the challenge builder I I'm very visual so I really like the challenge builder itself now this walks you through really great it barely has I suggest you to read it but those are the two places that you can access the child builder so here's the challenge builder guide here it's has lots of pictures and it has text to support it and it kind of walks you through all of the pieces components and parts of the challenge builder which I'm going to review with you today but in case you need a refresher just check out the challenge builder guide or a review lesson okay so now I'm in back on my teacher dashboard and I'm going to scroll down to this new section that we have if you haven't noticed that until the creativity and it's actually called create challenges so I'm going to click on create challenges I'm going to start coding the first thing you see here is that Gordo doesn't have any text associate Jim he doesn't have a word bubble he's not giving direction so it's the students job to tell their users how to solve this challenge or maybe give them a tip or something like that it's a really good place to work on digital citizenship because we know that kids like to pop in words in there that they think that we're not going to see it so that's just something to know a really good place to work on the spelling and punctuation and all that kind of stuff kind of tiling in multiple disciplines into the area or into the into the lesson itself because computer science doesn't always have to be taught in isolation like many people assume that it has to be okay so now we're on the challenge builder itself I just exited out of Gordo I didn't give him any directions yet I didn't give him directions because I want to wait until I figure out what I'm going to be creating before I actually give him the directions the first thing though I am going to do is click on this pencil and I'm going to name my challenge so in this case I'm just going to call it webinar gonna click the check sign and I'm gonna do that okay so let's see what I see here first so here we have a challenge that looks similar to challenge number one of coding adventure it's basically the same thing except we're going to build it so I'm gonna actually click on the configurations and the configurations is what I like to behindthescenes so here we can see the monkey we can see that he is located where he is on his XY coordinate something that is a misconception really with this is even though we know this is working on a plane on the XY coordinate plane 004 hmm any programming is actually here at the top so that's just something to kind of keep in in mind you can see that as I move him his XY coordinates are changing when I rotate him his rotation is changing I'm all of that good stuff when I click on the banana here we have the banana and we have XY you'll see that the banana is now added underneath the other banana because it's an array so we can move these separately we can spin them we can see that it's gonna keep track of everywhere that it is so that's the banana piece if I don't want an object I just throw it in the trash bye bye see you later so these three rectangles here if I click on them that changes the background just something to kind of keep in mind is that I really try to suggest that the students don't use something that they haven't been exposed to so some of the backgrounds although we are now reaching the end of coding adventure part one they've been exposed to a lot of these backgrounds but I just suggest them only using things that they've been exposed to so let's say we've used the dark water like we just used in challenge number 63 so we can kind of put him put them there and then if we click the plus sign here we can add objects to our to our challenge something to know is that as the students this the animals only open up as the students are exposed to those challenges so going back to our lesson mode how do I even find those oops sorry I had this up and then I kind of got out of there ooh in our challenge let me just let me just actually go there so you can actually see you you how you always have it there and then it's you lose it anyway so how you get so in the lesson mode itself in the actual lessons or in the lesson mode itself when you get there on the right hand side underneath the challenges is the character review card in the character review card I've mentioned it's in the previous webinar so it's there but it'll show you when the students have been exposed to that specific character so that's just important to note because you can sometimes teachers ask that question like why can they see something that I can can't I can't they see something I can see the goat actually will break bananas and I so that's something that they are exposed to later and the tiger in the polar bear will chase the monkey they like him they think of him as food so they'll chase him and if they kiss students don't know how to program them there's no sense in having characters they don't know how to use so the students can then add objects to the screen and then unfortunately all the objects are always unlocked but always remind me of the students we only what we know so like the ice they haven't been exposed to yet like those things so we want to make sure that they are using using the right things that that they already know how to do so now I'm just going to try it and this is where the students play basically solve their own challenges here and then something to note here on the bottom is these buttons let's say I'm not going to use the Save button I just just hit the oops the button and it will go and I could also add concepts and you can see that the concepts get pretty advanced for recursion greater than the weight that kind of things so I'm only adding buttons that have been exposed to so there's that part so let me just go back to the land here so why do we use challenge builder and what is it even important for us it's a really great place to have differentiation so students seem like they're really strong and maybe you know they're saying I'm getting bored or whatever it is it's a really great way for them to showcase what they've so a student may be really strong in solving the coding adventure challenges but when they go to represent it rebuild it and recreate it they might not have the same strength that they showcased in the challenges themselves so this is a really great place to have that additional assessment or even have that extra enrichment or differentiation practice so let's just say I have these bananas here and gonna add another one I'll put my banana here and just kind of show you I'm just going to have the monkey turn to this banana and then I'm going to have him step and maybe I pick up the ruler and I measure it and I have him step 11 and we'll see that I click run not only do I solve the challenge but I also need to write a message here at the end so that's just something also to kind of keep in mind then I want to share it before I share I always save so this is important to note students will share before they've saved and will not share what they built so I have to make sure of that so then I'm gonna continue editing and let's say I'm gonna share I finished building it ago I have it on private right now it's really not private for the student because it is showcasing in your showroom on your teacher on your classrooms page in the showroom page those are all populated there and they're all listed you can search by student and all of that good stuff there so that's what the private is it means they can only see it if they do the classroom and they publish it you I'll just show you what the this looks like you then for the student over here on the right hand side you'll see that all of the challenges that they've created and shared with their with their classroom they're able to play and do all that over there on that right hand side so that's just the place where the students actually see it themselves okay then I can create a live link here now this is really great so I used to have like the remind app and I would copy this this link and I would share with my parent so they could play what the students had created that day I'm really a great place to create to create buyin or even doing like an arcade a embedding that webpage like that kind of a thing you can copy the link and it's live link and then when you publish the code monkey community it goes into the discover pay or do the discover tab so I'll show you where that is so when I publish it just keep in mind it is heavily vetted and so the students tend to write things that they think they think might not be you know the thing that we can't see but we can't see them so it's always pretty heavily vetted as far as that goes okay so in the discover tab I just want to show you where everything is placed so in the discover tab I will click on challenges so how I got there as I went to the main home code monkey page I clicked on discover and then I go to the challenges key that is a great question and I'm will answer for you that here at the end in that and then we have all the challenges and these are where all the students have published them you can actually sort by language as well we have we have ten million users were over ten million users worldwide so it might just be nice to kind of sort by English as well and then what you'll do is you can just have the students create a challenge for example probably I hope they're using a forever loop in this challenge specifically itself but those students can play their own challenges other people's challenges so what better way to challenge yourself in a new way then to play another student's challenge and students can also like it and the students can see how many people viewed their challenges so that's always like an as well just get this to refresh here and when they're sharing worldwide it's really great place for them to that their grammar is correct and that they're using the appropriate language my internet doesn't seem to be loading this challenge but it's the way that you can kind of access that as well so just kind of keep that in mind that you can the students can't tell there's challenges and other people's from worldwide users so there's some really great ones on here you know the kids have really their kids get really creative and they do things that you wouldn't think they would so it's just a nice way to kind of do that as well so here we can see there's no capitalization there's no period so just kind of something to kind of keep in mind sharing this publicly you really want to do your best work so the student has shook left these buttons at the bottom so there must be something here like stepping the distance to maybe turning to the banana this is more challenging because these are blocking them off so it's a really fun one to kind of play in salt okay so we have reviewed the concepts that we've covered up until challenge number 60 we reviewed where to find the lesson plans in the lesson mode itself and under the teacher resources we reviewed for loops and went into lesson 12 and you guys got to play a little bit of the challenges yourself we reviewed the challenge builder lesson 15 the challenge builder guide where it's located members under the teacher resources we use the challenge builder for additional assessment as well as me her student that's struggling or just a way to create a little bit more of that like extra challenge I guess no way and then we're gonna do some more QA here before I get to your questions I see some really great questions which I'm gonna review with you go over here for you I want time for your questions because it's interactive but we do have our new banana Tales course so if you haven't had the chance to check it out on the code monkey page you can click on the different courses and you can see banana tales banana tales is geared for grades 5 through 8 it is the full Python course similar to coding adventure but walking them through the Python basically coding concepts and components and things that they need to know to become immersed in the world of Python code monkey junior is really designed for pre readers it is a block based course but there are no words or using symbol they're using arrows to kind of get and collect the banana and then our brand new course is beaver achiever this is a block based course geared for really get grades 1 & 2 they work through some coding concepts and some challenges and it's based on blockly so it's just a little less reading but still working through the computational thinking and programming and all of that kind of stuff and then if you haven't noticed you can now find this specifically at code monkey comm before it was plate code monkey comm um even if you type in plate code monkey comm it will redirect you but you just said can go to code monkey comm and find us there so now we're gonna leave some time for Q and a so keep asked this question and I'll go ahead and go through it with you he said where exactly is the showroom located on my teachers page and I know Zoey answered that but I would like to show you where that is because sometimes it can be like well where is it so I clicked on my see my classrooms and then I'm going to click on my classroom which I would like to find their actual challenges themselves and you'll see here along the top there is the show room so I'll just click here on the show room and ask students create the challenges they will just populate here and it's just created by student and then at the top over here you can search by a specific student let's say you're not trying to find every single one of them there okay and then Melissa asked me a question regarding the challenge builder itself so let's go to the challenge builder she said where do you click to add two other buttons for the challenge builder so let me let me get back to the challenge builder here so I can show you but basically on the bottom of the challenge itself there's like a little plus sign we just reorganized our courses and I love it they are now organized by by course and it's great so Melissa down here at the bottom where this plus see how it when I hover over it there's a minus sign I can take away ones I don't want and then if I add the plus sign I can add ones that I want so there's that Zoe I think you could probably help me with Donna's question here her question is if my students share a challenge to their group is that only their class I have four classes using CM I would love for them to see each other's challenges before sharing with the public I believe that the challenge is Zoe would you do you want to answer that yes that's a great question so the challenges are accessible to that class only but we can we can get back to you regarding having the other students see it you can also have them share the links and then they can the rest of the students can see it but I believe it's it's only for the specific class that they're in and I will we will get back to you to see if it's possible to have them see the other your other classrooms challenges as well and then we had one more question in this thing Zoe that's a great answer can a student publish it in the code monkey community or limits to the classroom so you can publish it to the classroom and to the community you can share both it does not limit you to do one or the other so let's say like Donna your class is loving Jimmy's challenge or Sally's challenge in the lakhan's the best one and so you allow them to like share it to the community you can do both so there's no limitations there is there any option on code monkey to share the link is that I'm sorry can you just clarify for me is that for Divya did you oh sorry I want to put your your name there is that are you talking specifically for the challenge itself or for anything else as far as coding adventure Oh for the challenge critic yes there is so when you are that's a great question so is there a way to share a live link when the challenge have and created there is when you click share and you click right here it's kind of small but it's right here it has link settings you could turn the link on and when you do then you can copy the link so great for sharing and all of that good stuff so just another way okay so we want to make sure that we are you know honoring your time and we thank you so much for spending time with us if there are any other questions I think it seems like we're pretty good at making pretty good time here just wanted to let you know that you can let's go back here oh I forgot about this I don't know if you guys noticed along the bottom but there was a teacher in a little car kind of crawling along the bottom here I personally love this little won't this little teacher in the car because we are designed to put you the teacher in the driver's seat and we want to make it just as easy to drive a car as it is for you to code so you could also follow us along on twitter at a code monkey st you or on our instagram or if you have any questions following the webinar please email us with any questions that you have we thank you so much for joining us this afternoon and we hope that you continue to write code catch bananas and save the world bye have a great day
