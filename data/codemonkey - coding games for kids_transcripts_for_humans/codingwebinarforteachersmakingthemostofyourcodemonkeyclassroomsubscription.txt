07:30 - designed to answer your questions and
07:33 - then
07:34 - we're just here to

07:48 - so
07:49 - uh just so you can
07:50 - just so you know you can always follow
07:52 - us at
07:53 - codemonkey.sdu on our twitter facebook
07:56 - instagram and also on linkedin
07:59 - and then
08:00 - uh we also have our cod monk monkey blog
08:04 - so i would recommend following that as
08:07 - well and there's a lot of tips and
08:09 - tricks for teachers over there uh
08:11 - sometimes we'll just share some
08:13 - different content so
08:16 - we can dive into that later um but
08:19 - if you guys like to check out any of our
08:21 - social platforms then
08:24 - that would be great um
08:27 - you're also
08:29 - able to ask and if you have any
08:31 - questions that weren't answered during
08:33 - this webinar today then you're able to
08:35 - ask them through any of those uh
08:38 - platforms
08:40 - so
08:41 - let's take a second to meet the team
08:44 - uh so i'm maya maya miller i'm the
08:47 - customer success manager
08:49 - what i do is i help
08:53 - teachers schools districts
08:56 - and our uh partners
08:58 - to
08:59 - uh
09:00 - on board to code monkey
09:03 - implement them and reach their goals and
09:05 - throughout the school year i talk to a
09:09 - lot of teachers throughout my start my
09:12 - daily routine and i get a lot of
09:14 - really interesting tips and tricks some
09:16 - which i'm gonna share from you and share
09:18 - with you today not all of those tips and
09:21 - tricks are necessarily things that we
09:24 - thought of when
09:25 - we created the platform so it's always
09:28 - great to get feedback from you on how
09:31 - you use the platform eventually in your
09:34 - classroom
09:35 - we also have
09:36 - uh
09:38 - um
09:39 - leave not first kovitz here today she is
09:42 - the content developer and pedagogy
09:44 - manager and she is actually the one that
09:47 - works her magic and creates all of code
09:50 - monkey so
09:51 - pretty amazing
09:53 - and
09:54 - molly
09:56 - would you like to present yourself or
09:59 - okay
10:01 - i don't know if she's
10:03 - able to but i will say molly is our
10:05 - director of sales
10:07 - some of you may know her so
10:14 - so
10:15 - our
10:16 - objectives today in this webinar is to
10:20 - um
10:22 - show you how
10:24 - you can create access the classroom and
10:27 - how your students can access the
10:28 - classroom how you can create the
10:30 - classroom for them
10:31 - how to add co-teachers how to
10:34 - limit students progress and also how to
10:37 - track it and i will show you the lessons
10:39 - feature and the gradebook and
10:41 - proficiency reports and we'll also have
10:44 - a q a in the end so
10:46 - just a little something that i like to
10:48 - say is that i see the code monkey
10:51 - platform
10:53 - in a way sort of like a restaurant right
10:56 - because uh when you go to a restaurant
11:00 - the first the first thing that you would
11:02 - do is
11:03 - take your customers and take them to
11:05 - their table this is basically the
11:08 - student access and getting the students
11:11 - into the classrooms and then you have to
11:14 - cater them with some sort of service and
11:17 - you're also
11:19 - you're able to do it yourself as a
11:20 - teacher or add a co-teacher
11:24 - catering them with a service is just
11:25 - like
11:27 - showing them
11:28 - the um sharing with them the content the
11:31 - club monkey has so allowing them to pay
11:34 - and limit their progress and then
11:36 - afterwards after the food is served then
11:38 - you would ask how is the food was it
11:40 - good you would see if they ate
11:43 - everything on their plate or not this is
11:46 - part of the
11:48 - progress tracking that i will share with
11:50 - you today so
11:51 - for me it's just like
11:53 - a kind of
11:54 - cute way to remember uh things i hope it
11:57 - helps you too
11:59 - um
12:00 - so
12:01 - just in general uh i'm gonna cover this
12:04 - really briefly so co monkey is a leading
12:07 - fun and intuitive curriculum for kids to
12:11 - learn coding uh through the game and
12:14 - project-based courses students as young
12:16 - as seven use real programming languages
12:19 - to solve puzzles and build games and
12:22 - apps so the majority of code monkey's
12:25 - courses do not require prior coding
12:27 - experience uh in order to teach them
12:30 - which is amazing it's a very very
12:32 - teacher friendly platform and
12:35 - all of the courses are designed for
12:37 - school extracurricular and home use so
12:40 - our mission i would say is to provide an
12:44 - inclusive path for youngsters into the
12:47 - ever expanding world of code
12:49 - um code monkey is a game-based learning
12:53 - environment where children
12:55 - learn to code in real programming
12:57 - languages ever since codeman
13:01 - so you are
13:02 - uh
13:03 - you will be able to find
13:06 - this webinar and also many other
13:08 - webinars that are
13:10 - [Music]
13:12 - teacher and student geared
13:15 - right here if you follow this link
13:18 - www dot
13:22 - webinars
13:24 - so this
13:25 - once we finish
13:27 - once we end this webinar today we will
13:29 - be sending you
13:31 - a feedback survey
13:32 - which will also have a link to this
13:34 - webinar and about
13:37 - a week
13:38 - after
13:40 - i believe that we will already have this
13:42 - webinar
13:43 - on site
13:45 - so
13:46 - let's dive in directly to the platform
13:51 - or you know what
13:54 - let's start here
13:56 - can you see the login screen right now
14:02 - want to make sure
14:04 - no we see the
14:06 - courses page man
14:08 - okay
14:11 - okay
14:13 - so this is the common key login screen
14:16 - this is where you would probably start
14:19 - your way with codemonkey uh
14:22 - we recommend using one of the ssos if
14:25 - you're using
14:27 - codemonkey with google classroom then
14:30 - you would go with the google sso if
14:33 - you're using it with clever then you
14:35 - would use
14:36 - the clever sso and
14:39 - this is
14:42 - just
14:43 - the main uh
14:46 - screen
14:47 - and once you do log in
14:50 - this
14:51 - is the page that you will see uh you
14:54 - will get to the courses page
14:57 - this is a teacher account that i created
15:01 - especially for this webinar but
15:03 - this is
15:05 - what's unique about this page is that
15:07 - the students and the teachers
15:09 - it gives us
15:10 - they have the same
15:12 - main page so
15:14 - you
15:14 - as a teacher you're seeing this and
15:16 - you're also able to play the courses but
15:18 - this you're also seeing cool monkey the
15:20 - way that your students will see code
15:22 - monkey
15:24 - um okay
15:26 - so
15:28 - on the courses page you
15:30 - uh you can see that
15:32 - the courses are
15:34 - tagged by colors and
15:36 - there's novice beginner intermediate
15:40 - advent and advanced courses uh each
15:44 - course uh would be suitable for a
15:46 - different stage or a different grade
15:49 - and
15:50 - you can also see when you click on a
15:53 - certain course an explanation
15:57 - i mean a you can see the name of the
15:59 - course b
16:00 - whether it was started or not and then
16:02 - an explanation about what they would see
16:05 - in this course
16:07 - so when a student logs in for the first
16:09 - time they would see here start coding
16:11 - but once they have
16:14 - played their first challenge
16:16 - then it will
16:18 - turn into continue quoting and
16:20 - when they click it it will take them
16:22 - exactly to the
16:25 - point where they stopped last
16:41 - okay
16:42 - so
16:44 - on the
16:46 - left hand
16:47 - you can see that you have
16:48 - this menu that will help you to navigate
16:51 - throughout the platform and you also
16:53 - have another menu on the right hand
16:56 - that will take you to it will be able to
17:01 - change language from there you can go to
17:05 - your classrooms which is this page that
17:07 - we're on right now and you can go to
17:10 - your account to change account settings
17:13 - and you're also able to go to the help
17:15 - center or blog and contact us
17:19 - with this
17:21 - right hand menu
17:23 - so
17:24 - under my classrooms
17:27 - you can you
17:29 - once you
17:32 - populate your subscription with
17:34 - classrooms then you will be able to see
17:36 - the classroom list it also provides you
17:39 - with uh a summary of this like an
17:42 - overview summary of
17:45 - where where your subscription stands uh
17:49 - like student population wise so we can
17:52 - see that this subscription has five
17:54 - classrooms
17:56 - among all those classrooms there's 36
17:58 - students some of the classrooms are
18:00 - populated and some aren't and you can
18:03 - see which subscription it it's
18:05 - associated with you can see that one
18:08 - classroom is associated with and
18:12 - subscription that has been expired
18:14 - this
18:15 - i will show you later i want to use this
18:17 - to show you how we move from year to
18:20 - year uh in code monkey and class code is
18:24 - one of the ways
18:26 - that you can invite students into your
18:29 - classroom
18:31 - and from
18:32 - this my classrooms page you're able to
18:35 - edit the classroom name
18:37 - and the classroom grade as a teacher
18:41 - you are also able to archive classrooms
18:44 - so that's just
18:45 - by clicking the archive button here so
18:48 - let's just click archive
18:49 - and
18:50 - and it will not archive immediately it
18:53 - will make sure that you are that you're
18:55 - sure and then once i have
18:58 - archived it
19:00 - let's say i archive the classroom by
19:02 - mistake or i wanted to archive just one
19:06 - student from that classroom and that the
19:07 - whole classroom i know this is a
19:09 - repeating question that we get uh once
19:11 - in a while
19:12 - so
19:13 - you can on the same page on as
19:16 - uh the classroom list there's also the
19:19 - archive and you can easily restore the
19:21 - classroom by just clicking restore
19:24 - classroom
19:28 - okay
19:32 - so
19:33 - when
19:34 - your first step with chrome monkey would
19:36 - be to create a new classroom right so
19:40 - we have several ways that you can create
19:42 - a classroom with you can create a
19:44 - classroom
19:45 - [Music]
19:46 - just
19:51 - name it here and associate it with the
19:53 - subscription the teacher trial uh is
19:57 - some of you may have uh
19:59 - wanted to dab around code monkey so you
20:01 - had a teacher trial before so make sure
20:03 - that you're adding the classroom to the
20:06 - correct
20:07 - and active subscription
20:10 - and another way that you can create a
20:12 - classroom is import from google so right
20:15 - now i am not connected to my google
20:18 - classroom account but if i was
20:21 - then it would once i choose the check
20:24 - box import from google then a drop down
20:27 - menu will appear here and it will show
20:30 - me all of the classrooms that are um
20:34 - classrooms that i manage with google and
20:37 - the important thing to notice is uh just
20:40 - make sure that your
20:42 - login email to code monkey is the same
20:44 - as your login email to your
20:48 - google classroom
20:49 - and then
20:50 - maya just just one comment you um if you
20:54 - log in with clever it will say import
20:56 - form clever and right will import all
20:59 - your classes from cleveland
21:01 - okay that's that's correct thank you
21:03 - leave that
21:05 - and
21:06 - once classrooms are uh imported from
21:10 - either clever or google when we get into
21:13 - the specific classroom
21:16 - there will be an icon here right below
21:18 - the drop down menu that enables you to
21:21 - navigate between classrooms easily
21:23 - without having to go back to the my
21:25 - classrooms page so there will be uh
21:29 - a button here that looks like with the
21:31 - branding of either google or
21:35 - clever and once you click that button it
21:38 - will automatically sync
21:40 - the classroom with whatever
21:42 - um students or changes that you had on
21:47 - your google or clever classroom
21:51 - so
21:53 - by
21:54 - clicking by choosing a
21:56 - classroom i
21:58 - it will take actually
22:00 - sorry i want it
22:08 - okay
22:10 - so
22:10 - once you chose the classroom
22:13 - you we move from the
22:16 - like the main hall of the teacher
22:18 - dashboards to the to the dashboard of
22:21 - the specific classroom on the dashboard
22:23 - of the specific classroom we have those
22:25 - tabs and each tab has a world of
22:28 - possibilities and again the drop down
22:31 - menu is always here on the top right
22:34 - hand side you can
22:37 - change classroom easily
22:39 - you don't have to go back to the my
22:41 - classrooms every time because
22:43 - we know it can be
22:45 - exhausting
22:46 - so
22:48 - once you chose uh the specific classroom
22:51 - we get to the progress tab on the
22:54 - progress tab we're able to
22:56 - um
22:57 - monitor and control the progress of our
22:59 - students uh so i can
23:02 - currently we're looking at the coding
23:04 - adventure part one course of this
23:07 - classroom you can see
23:09 - uh the names of the students
23:11 - and
23:12 - we are you're able to
23:15 - sort in a way that you're most
23:17 - comfortable so you can either sort by
23:18 - name like it is sort of right now from
23:22 - by
23:23 - display name or by progress and then it
23:26 - will show you
23:28 - uh the mo the ones who made the most
23:30 - progress at the top and then
23:32 - going down to those who have less
23:34 - progress
23:35 - and
23:37 - the
23:38 - the star system
23:42 - as you can see here in the
23:45 - on the top
23:47 - a yellow star means three stars this
23:49 - means that the student was able to solve
23:52 - the the challenge in the best most
23:55 - elegant and shortest way
23:57 - uh
23:58 - a blue star means that he he
24:02 - submitted a two-star solution which
24:03 - means that they
24:05 - uh were able to reach the bananas but
24:07 - maybe there was like a step that was
24:09 - making it uh that could have been
24:12 - uh
24:13 - saved and once
24:15 - signs and that this they have struggled
24:18 - with this
24:19 - and
24:20 - an exclamation mark
24:22 - means a failed solution so they weren't
24:25 - able to solve the challenge at all
24:27 - and assessment challenges this is
24:30 - actually
24:34 - first look
24:36 - uh i wanted to show you
24:38 - that we currently
24:41 - we currently have assessment challenges
24:44 - here marked as
24:47 - with a
24:48 - yellow circle but we are working on
24:51 - special assessment challenges that will
24:53 - be separated from this which is
24:55 - something that i know a lot of teachers
24:57 - are really excited about
24:59 - um so on the progress table you're also
25:01 - able to limit progress as you can see
25:03 - here uh this classroom's progress was
25:06 - limited until
25:08 - to challenge 24 the
25:11 - one of the assessment challenges it's
25:14 - it's a choice you can limit by course
25:16 - you can limit by assessment challenges
25:19 - and
25:21 - and
25:22 - from the
25:24 - progress table you're also able to turn
25:26 - on
25:27 - turn on and off super hints for your
25:29 - students if you feel
25:31 - that your students are struggling for
25:33 - example
25:34 - if we
25:35 - see uh hi joanne
25:38 - so if we see that uh this is a great
25:40 - visual indication to see if our students
25:42 - struggled in a certain point so if i
25:45 - would see several students have blue or
25:47 - red stars in a certain challenge then i
25:50 - know maybe it's time to turn on super
25:52 - hints for them or maybe i want to
25:54 - revisit that challenge and see
25:58 - why they were struggling
26:01 - um
26:04 - okay
26:05 - wait so i think i jumped a little bit
26:08 - ahead i also wanted to
26:11 - before we jump into the classroom i
26:13 - wanted to say that if you are not
26:15 - importing with google classroom or
26:18 - clever or whatever
26:20 - uh
26:21 - free
26:22 - pre-made uh
26:23 - classroom then once you've created a
26:26 - classroom uh let's go to one of my empty
26:28 - classrooms
26:34 - this thing's always tend to happen when
26:35 - you're in a
26:36 - webinar sometimes uh
26:40 - one class wouldn't work let's see if
26:42 - this works
26:43 - no okay
26:44 - so if this classroom wasn't populated
26:48 - then we would not see the list of the
26:51 - students
26:53 - which
26:54 - means that we need to add students so
26:59 - once you click the plus and ends and add
27:02 - students the pop-up window
27:06 - and you will be able to add a single
27:08 - account or create multiple accounts
27:11 - and a single account is pretty obvious
27:14 - display name
27:15 - using password
27:19 - uh create multiple accounts so to do
27:22 - that you would need to download
27:26 - this
27:27 - and afterwards
27:32 - enter the info into that example file
27:34 - there are examples on the file so you
27:37 - won't have to um
27:38 - [Music]
27:41 - imagine uh how you have to fill this csv
27:45 - and then upload that csv into the
27:48 - platform and once you've uploaded it
27:51 - then the students will be populated in
27:54 - the classroom and
27:56 - uh
27:57 - you're getting uh first look this is the
27:59 - first webinar where we're presenting
28:01 - this so it's exciting uh you are also
28:04 - able to
28:06 - share a class code with your students a
28:09 - class code means so for example the
28:12 - classroom called adventures encoding has
28:15 - this unique class code that i can
28:18 - refresh and change
28:20 - and
28:21 - by clicking the regenerate
28:24 - button so by sharing a class code i
28:28 - can restrict or limit and how students
28:31 - will join because i know that some of
28:34 - the
28:35 - creators but
28:37 - mainly prereaders but not only uh
28:40 - could
28:41 - sometimes get confused then because you
28:45 - remember the login screen that i showed
28:47 - you at first so there are many sso
28:50 - systems so if you choose
28:52 - for example google or clever or
28:55 - classlink or whatever
28:57 - then it will present to those students
29:00 - only that option and it will prevent
29:03 - them from getting confused while they
29:06 - are
29:07 - blog signing in for the first time
29:11 - uh so once you shared the class code
29:14 - with the students they will you're
29:17 - basically
29:18 - um passing on that process to them
29:21 - you've shared the class talk with them
29:23 - and now they have to just
29:25 - click the
29:27 - link that you've shared with them and
29:32 - populate themselves into the classroom
29:36 - [Music]
29:39 - when can you change this after the code
29:42 - was already made so again if you
29:45 - even if the if for example you're
29:47 - actually seeing the
29:49 - uh
29:50 - perfect example right now this is a
29:52 - classroom which is already populated but
29:54 - i can still regenerate the class code
29:56 - again and again
29:58 - endlessly i think if i'm not mistaken so
30:02 - you're always able to change the
30:03 - classroom code and if
30:07 - by any chance
30:08 - the classroom code
30:10 - reached a student that is not meant to
30:12 - be in this classroom then you're always
30:14 - able to move this student to a different
30:16 - classroom the thing is that you're only
30:19 - able to move students within classrooms
30:21 - in your subscription and if i'm not
30:24 - mistaken
30:25 - only classrooms that you manage
30:29 - so
30:33 - and another great feature is
30:36 - the student log inputs right here at the
30:39 - top and
30:41 - so the student student logging cards are
30:44 - basically just uh individual cards for
30:47 - students that have their name and their
30:49 - just their credentials their login
30:51 - information this is really helpful if
30:53 - you're teaching a hybrid model or if
30:57 - you're teaching um
30:58 - [Music]
31:00 - remotely and you can i it does create a
31:03 - little bit work for the teacher because
31:05 - after you
31:06 - printed the login cards you have to
31:09 - share them with a specific student so it
31:11 - would either be print and cut
31:14 - or
31:16 - screenshot and share and but it does
31:19 - really help a lot of students log in
31:21 - correctly and that saves a lot of work
31:24 - later on
31:26 - okay so let's move on to
31:30 - the next step
31:32 - on the courses tab
31:34 - you're able to see uh the the same
31:37 - courses as we saw here
31:40 - but now we're seeing them with uh
31:42 - a little bit more information
31:45 - so we see which grades this course is
31:49 - suitable for how many lesson plans it
31:52 - has and what um
31:55 - advice it would work best on
31:58 - from the courses page you're able to
32:00 - assign
32:02 - or unassign
32:04 - courses
32:06 - from the classroom so i would assign by
32:08 - clicking it and it becomes yellow which
32:10 - means the sign and to unassign i just
32:13 - click the arrow and i'm assigned pretty
32:15 - intuitive
32:16 - and for every course if you click the
32:18 - read more
32:19 - it will give you an explanation on what
32:22 - are the coding concepts
32:23 - that are uh covered in this lesson and
32:27 - you have a
32:29 - link here that would take you to the
32:31 - lesson plan i will
32:33 - eat
32:34 - the lesson plans are
32:38 - let's let's just give it a second to
32:40 - vlog
32:43 - so the lesson plans is a presentation
32:46 - a pre-made presentation by uh by league
32:49 - nut
32:51 - that will help you
32:53 - teach the course in the classroom so you
32:56 - we basically did all the work and you
32:59 - can just rip
33:01 - rip up the fruits
33:03 - by using this presentation when you use
33:05 - uh
33:06 - in front of the students when you use
33:08 - code monkey in the classrooms or in zoom
33:10 - you can share your screen
33:14 - and
33:16 - now
33:18 - is there anything else i want to say
33:23 - and again you can see that it's color
33:25 - coded by uh
33:27 - how how difficult uh
33:30 - the
33:31 - the course is
33:38 - so on the gradebook
33:40 - the gradebook is another
33:42 - pretty great feature uh so on the
33:45 - gradebook you are able to see
33:48 - some data about uh
33:51 - about your specific classroom in a
33:54 - specific course you're able to navigate
33:56 - between courses here
33:58 - and between classrooms here
34:01 - you will be able to see
34:03 - uh
34:04 - the the
34:08 - the star
34:09 - and the star system translated into
34:12 - numbers from 1 to 10
34:14 - and
34:15 - it's like
34:18 - just grading them and you're able to
34:21 - change it from numbers to letters or to
34:24 - percents
34:25 - and so the percent is
34:29 - how
34:30 - how how successful were they in
34:33 - completing this
34:35 - course
34:36 - and you're also able to choose if you
34:39 - want to see
34:40 - the overall grade
34:43 - for a different
34:46 - okay this class hasn't covered all of
34:48 - that but
34:49 - uh you're able to change the
34:52 - the concept
34:54 - and
34:54 - this uh chart is also exp
34:58 - if you click export it would download as
35:01 - a
35:02 - it would be downloaded to your computer
35:05 - and euro can download certificates from
35:08 - here which is a great way
35:11 - to
35:14 - ramp up the excitement in the classroom
35:16 - so once you've finished
35:18 - uh coding adventure part one you can
35:20 - download certificates and the
35:22 - certificates would be done would be
35:24 - uh
35:26 - let's show you what they would look like
35:31 - so the certificates
35:32 - would be
35:35 - downloaded into your computer with the
35:38 - name of the student imprinted in the
35:41 - same font as codemonkey and
35:43 - [Music]
35:45 - let's see if i can see it here
35:47 - [Music]
35:50 - okay so let's see answer okay
35:56 - so this is an example for a certificate
35:58 - if you download it through the teacher
36:00 - resources then it's without a name but
36:02 - if you download it with the teacher
36:04 - resources so it will include an issue
36:07 - date student name
36:09 - and the signature or the founder of
36:11 - codemonkey
36:14 - so
36:20 - before we move on to the teacher
36:22 - resources officially i just wanted to
36:25 - show you briefly the showroom the
36:28 - showroom is where you would be able to
36:30 - see
36:31 - uh games that were created by your
36:33 - students
36:35 - and
36:36 - once you
36:38 - once you reach the point where the
36:40 - students are using the
36:43 - the
36:44 - more advanced quad monkey courses
36:50 - you're also able to enable or disable
36:53 - the discover
36:55 - so once right now the discovery is
36:58 - enabled so that's why it says the button
37:01 - says disable discover and once i click
37:03 - it it says
37:06 - that it will hide
37:08 - the discover from my students i really
37:11 - recommend uh
37:15 - maybe
37:16 - disabling discover for the first
37:19 - uh
37:20 - for the first month at least and
37:24 - it's just it's a personal recommendation
37:26 - it's not an official recommendation from
37:27 - code monkey but
37:29 - i think the discovery is a really
37:33 - students could get distracted by it and
37:36 - instead of doing the assigned courses
37:39 - then they might
37:41 - move to the discover so i would
37:43 - recommend once you have
37:47 - once you have created a classroom added
37:50 - students and then assigned courses the
37:53 - next step
37:54 - i think would be to disable this cover
37:57 - and then enable it as you go on but it's
37:59 - at your desk at your description
38:03 - so when we let's move on to the teacher
38:05 - resources
38:08 - so under the teacher resources
38:10 - uh
38:11 - you
38:12 - have always available the webinars this
38:15 - webinar also is going to be on the
38:17 - webinar page so whenever you want to
38:19 - revisit anything you can do it from here
38:23 - you can see uh the lesson plans
38:26 - uh on so
38:28 - the teacher resources would be
38:31 - obviously where you get all of your
38:32 - resources and the resources are
38:35 - directed for online activities offline
38:38 - activities and preparation for the
38:40 - classroom so
38:42 - if you're interested in preparation for
38:44 - the classroom then i would recommend
38:47 - looking at the lesson plans that are
38:49 - available for code mckee junior for
38:51 - beaver retriever recording adventure
38:54 - game builder banana tales
38:58 - pony chat
38:59 - and challenge builder
39:01 - and also for the
39:04 - preparation for classroom you can
39:07 - check out the very cool new feature
39:09 - coding concepts it's relevant only for
39:12 - coding adventure
39:14 - and but you're able to see
39:16 - brief uh videos that you're also
39:19 - i would recommend showing in the
39:20 - classroom uh later on and
39:24 - that will explain the specific coding
39:27 - concepts that will be taught in that
39:29 - course
39:30 - if you're interested in offline
39:32 - and one more preparation for the
39:34 - classroom you can see the solutions for
39:37 - every
39:39 - challenge in every course in code monkey
39:41 - all of the solutions are here all you
39:43 - need to do is click
39:45 - the
39:46 - the link in the correct course and then
39:48 - it will show you the
39:50 - the most
39:51 - eloquent way to solve the challenge and
39:54 - this is what you would be
39:56 - um
39:57 - directing your classroom towards
40:00 - if you're interested in offline
40:01 - activities then we have the media and
40:04 - graphics and you can find certificates
40:06 - here you can find
40:08 - coloring pages and posters you can print
40:13 - and hang in the classroom
40:15 - and
40:21 - what else did i want to say
40:24 - and
40:25 - if you click the teaching with coding
40:28 - adventure
40:29 - then it would take you
40:37 - [Music]
40:40 - there's a lot of windows open right now
40:42 - and i'm presenting my screen so it may
40:44 - take a second okay great
40:46 - so it will take you to the teaching with
40:50 - coding your page which has a lot of
40:52 - information about the
40:56 - about the different uh
40:58 - coding concepts that are covered and
41:00 - also a course overview
41:02 - and brief introduction to the platform
41:06 - uh so before i i know i do want to
41:09 - respect everyone's time and i know that
41:11 - the webinar is due to finish in a couple
41:13 - of minutes so i just want to uh briefly
41:17 - review uh where you can access
41:20 - the help center so you help center logo
41:24 - is always here on the left in the bottom
41:26 - left hand you're also able to contact us
41:30 - again
41:31 - as i mentioned at the beginning through
41:32 - here
41:36 - and
41:40 - okay
41:42 - let's just see
41:44 - the help center structure for a minute
41:46 - because i want you to be
41:48 - able to find your way
41:50 - once you use it for the first time so
41:52 - the help center
41:53 - is divided
41:56 - by
41:57 - articles for teachers
41:59 - articles for admins and articles for
42:02 - teachers and admins so this would be
42:05 - things relating to classroom classroom
42:07 - dashboard management articles for
42:09 - students which is basically
42:14 - text explanations on
42:16 - how to log in as a student
42:19 - and then frequently ask questions and
42:22 - dive deeper articles about
42:24 - the courses
42:29 - and
42:31 - okay so let's
42:36 - let's do a brief q a before we finish so
42:40 - we see that we have
42:42 - one question
42:43 - from
42:44 - jennifer hi jennifer
42:46 - let me just read it for a second
42:50 - okay because it's a sorry
42:53 - [Music]
42:59 - maya i will um i will check the health
43:01 - center and we'll get back to jennifer
43:03 - with the
43:04 - with the issue with it it means that
43:06 - they
43:07 - instead of using the class code they try
43:09 - to sign up maybe there weren't enough
43:12 - seats on your
43:15 - account so
43:17 - they couldn't join with the class code
43:18 - or maybe they entered the wrong class
43:21 - code so they tried to sign up students
43:24 - and then they had to enter their age and
43:26 - if their age is
43:27 - 13 or less which i assume it is then
43:30 - they get this message that they are not
43:32 - um old enough to join so but i will
43:35 - check the your um
43:38 - um your conversation uh on the help desk
43:41 - and now on the support and then i will
43:43 - get back to you right after this webinar
43:49 - thank you
43:51 - jennifer says thank you as well if
43:53 - anybody has any questions then
43:55 - if you could please
43:57 - either raise your hand or write them in
44:00 - the chat
44:11 - let's give people a second to write
44:14 - something if they need to
44:31 - okay so
44:33 - if nobody has
44:34 - any further questions then i think uh we
44:37 - can wrap this webinar up and i'll just
44:40 - remind everybody that this webinar was
44:43 - recorded and it will be will be live on
44:46 - our website uh within a week or so you
44:49 - will be able to access it through the
44:51 - teacher resources
44:53 - and
44:55 - let's just show you through the teacher
44:57 - resources if you click the
44:59 - visit webinar page
45:02 - you're also able to find on the webinar
45:04 - page a lot of uh
45:07 - um previously recorded webinars that are
45:10 - uh dealing with either specific subjects
45:13 - or general uh
45:16 - getting started with teacher getting
45:18 - started with code monkey for teachers
45:20 - explanations and also for students and
45:25 - and
45:26 - i
45:27 - want to thank everybody again for
45:29 - joining us today
45:31 - thank you for taking the time and please
45:34 - if any any of the questions are remained
45:36 - unanswered then
45:39 - you can always
45:42 - talk to us through the help center or by
45:44 - using the chat bot that for some reason
45:47 - i can't see it right now but it's always
45:49 - on the bottom right hand right here and
45:52 - there's a chat bot and you can write to
45:55 - our support center we enter within a day
45:57 - or two maximum
45:59 - so thank you for joining today i'm very
46:02 - happy
46:03 - to meet all of you and have a great rest

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone thank you so much for joining us today um so we are still one minute early so while we're waiting for people to join why don't you share with us in the chat box uh where you're joining us from we'd love to know where you're coming from uh okay i see we have angie from arizona hi angie welcome your first date uh samantha from africa hi samantha so i see that more and more people are joining the webinar and hopping on this zoom so i just want to welcome everyone thank you so much for taking your taking the time to join us today and i would love for you to just write uh just in the chat where you're coming from where are you joining us from today i see we have people from africa from the us from ireland hi great to see you so we're gonna just wait a couple more minutes uh let people who are being held up elsewhere join us just so they won't waste the beginning but i want to welcome everybody again uh to code monkey's quarterly webinar exclusive webinar for teachers and if you just hop in tourists like teresa from new hampshire we would love to hear where you're joining us from foreign okay so just one more minute and we will get going all right so thank you so much for joining us today we really appreciate you taking the time to share with us uh this 45 minutes where we're gonna try to cover as much as possible from the code monkey platform and we know you're joining us from around the world and the i want to thank you on behalf of not only myself but the code monkey team and we know that your time is limited so we really appreciate uh you for joining us today um so our goal today would be to to get to get you what you need uh from this webinar today so you can hit hit the ground running when you start teaching um so you might be looking uh to learn a little bit more about the platform you might want to get more familiarized with the platform and mainly we want to be able to hear from you also on this webinar um so we're going to give you the opportunity at the end of the webinar we're gonna hand over the mic and let you ask us some questions uh live so we won't be able to answer everyone's questions of course but i do hope that the answers to the questions that we are able to answer today for some will also help others so if you don't get your answer during this session and you can always just reach out to us via email or or using the chat box and the q a box right here in this uh zoom uh webinar and also i will show you how you can contact us uh while you're on the platform so again welcome everyone today is the quarterly quarterly webinar for teachers and i really like to think about it as sort of an open office hours because it's really designed to answer your questions and then we're just here to prepare to prepare you for the classroom show you some features and we really love seeing everyone and all of you here so uh just so you can just so you know you can always follow us at codemonkey.sdu on our twitter facebook instagram and also on linkedin and then uh we also have our cod monk monkey blog so i would recommend following that as well and there's a lot of tips and tricks for teachers over there uh sometimes we'll just share some different content so we can dive into that later um but if you guys like to check out any of our social platforms then that would be great um you're also able to ask and if you have any questions that weren't answered during this webinar today then you're able to ask them through any of those uh platforms so let's take a second to meet the team uh so i'm maya maya miller i'm the customer success manager what i do is i help teachers schools districts and our uh partners to uh on board to code monkey implement them and reach their goals and throughout the school year i talk to a lot of teachers throughout my start my daily routine and i get a lot of really interesting tips and tricks some which i'm gonna share from you and share with you today not all of those tips and tricks are necessarily things that we thought of when we created the platform so it's always great to get feedback from you on how you use the platform eventually in your classroom we also have uh um leave not first kovitz here today she is the content developer and pedagogy manager and she is actually the one that works her magic and creates all of code monkey so pretty amazing and molly would you like to present yourself or okay i don't know if she's able to but i will say molly is our director of sales some of you may know her so so our objectives today in this webinar is to um show you how you can create access the classroom and how your students can access the classroom how you can create the classroom for them how to add coteachers how to limit students progress and also how to track it and i will show you the lessons feature and the gradebook and proficiency reports and we'll also have a q a in the end so just a little something that i like to say is that i see the code monkey platform in a way sort of like a restaurant right because uh when you go to a restaurant the first the first thing that you would do is take your customers and take them to their table this is basically the student access and getting the students into the classrooms and then you have to cater them with some sort of service and you're also you're able to do it yourself as a teacher or add a coteacher catering them with a service is just like showing them the um sharing with them the content the club monkey has so allowing them to pay and limit their progress and then afterwards after the food is served then you would ask how is the food was it good you would see if they ate everything on their plate or not this is part of the progress tracking that i will share with you today so for me it's just like a kind of cute way to remember uh things i hope it helps you too um so just in general uh i'm gonna cover this really briefly so co monkey is a leading fun and intuitive curriculum for kids to learn coding uh through the game and projectbased courses students as young as seven use real programming languages to solve puzzles and build games and apps so the majority of code monkey's courses do not require prior coding experience uh in order to teach them which is amazing it's a very very teacher friendly platform and all of the courses are designed for school extracurricular and home use so our mission i would say is to provide an inclusive path for youngsters into the ever expanding world of code um code monkey is a gamebased learning environment where children learn to code in real programming languages ever since codeman so you are uh you will be able to find this webinar and also many other webinars that are teacher and student geared right here if you follow this link www dot webinars so this once we finish once we end this webinar today we will be sending you a feedback survey which will also have a link to this webinar and about a week after i believe that we will already have this webinar on site so let's dive in directly to the platform or you know what let's start here can you see the login screen right now want to make sure no we see the courses page man okay okay so this is the common key login screen this is where you would probably start your way with codemonkey uh we recommend using one of the ssos if you're using codemonkey with google classroom then you would go with the google sso if you're using it with clever then you would use the clever sso and this is just the main uh screen and once you do log in this is the page that you will see uh you will get to the courses page this is a teacher account that i created especially for this webinar but this is what's unique about this page is that the students and the teachers it gives us they have the same main page so you as a teacher you're seeing this and you're also able to play the courses but this you're also seeing cool monkey the way that your students will see code monkey um okay so on the courses page you uh you can see that the courses are tagged by colors and there's novice beginner intermediate advent and advanced courses uh each course uh would be suitable for a different stage or a different grade and you can also see when you click on a certain course an explanation i mean a you can see the name of the course b whether it was started or not and then an explanation about what they would see in this course so when a student logs in for the first time they would see here start coding but once they have played their first challenge then it will turn into continue quoting and when they click it it will take them exactly to the point where they stopped last okay so on the left hand you can see that you have this menu that will help you to navigate throughout the platform and you also have another menu on the right hand that will take you to it will be able to change language from there you can go to your classrooms which is this page that we're on right now and you can go to your account to change account settings and you're also able to go to the help center or blog and contact us with this right hand menu so under my classrooms you can you once you populate your subscription with classrooms then you will be able to see the classroom list it also provides you with uh a summary of this like an overview summary of where where your subscription stands uh like student population wise so we can see that this subscription has five classrooms among all those classrooms there's 36 students some of the classrooms are populated and some aren't and you can see which subscription it it's associated with you can see that one classroom is associated with and subscription that has been expired this i will show you later i want to use this to show you how we move from year to year uh in code monkey and class code is one of the ways that you can invite students into your classroom and from this my classrooms page you're able to edit the classroom name and the classroom grade as a teacher you are also able to archive classrooms so that's just by clicking the archive button here so let's just click archive and and it will not archive immediately it will make sure that you are that you're sure and then once i have archived it let's say i archive the classroom by mistake or i wanted to archive just one student from that classroom and that the whole classroom i know this is a repeating question that we get uh once in a while so you can on the same page on as uh the classroom list there's also the archive and you can easily restore the classroom by just clicking restore classroom okay so when your first step with chrome monkey would be to create a new classroom right so we have several ways that you can create a classroom with you can create a classroom just name it here and associate it with the subscription the teacher trial uh is some of you may have uh wanted to dab around code monkey so you had a teacher trial before so make sure that you're adding the classroom to the correct and active subscription and another way that you can create a classroom is import from google so right now i am not connected to my google classroom account but if i was then it would once i choose the check box import from google then a drop down menu will appear here and it will show me all of the classrooms that are um classrooms that i manage with google and the important thing to notice is uh just make sure that your login email to code monkey is the same as your login email to your google classroom and then maya just just one comment you um if you log in with clever it will say import form clever and right will import all your classes from cleveland okay that's that's correct thank you leave that and once classrooms are uh imported from either clever or google when we get into the specific classroom there will be an icon here right below the drop down menu that enables you to navigate between classrooms easily without having to go back to the my classrooms page so there will be uh a button here that looks like with the branding of either google or clever and once you click that button it will automatically sync the classroom with whatever um students or changes that you had on your google or clever classroom so by clicking by choosing a classroom i it will take actually sorry i want it okay so once you chose the classroom you we move from the like the main hall of the teacher dashboards to the to the dashboard of the specific classroom on the dashboard of the specific classroom we have those tabs and each tab has a world of possibilities and again the drop down menu is always here on the top right hand side you can change classroom easily you don't have to go back to the my classrooms every time because we know it can be exhausting so once you chose uh the specific classroom we get to the progress tab on the progress tab we're able to um monitor and control the progress of our students uh so i can currently we're looking at the coding adventure part one course of this classroom you can see uh the names of the students and we are you're able to sort in a way that you're most comfortable so you can either sort by name like it is sort of right now from by display name or by progress and then it will show you uh the mo the ones who made the most progress at the top and then going down to those who have less progress and the the star system as you can see here in the on the top a yellow star means three stars this means that the student was able to solve the the challenge in the best most elegant and shortest way uh a blue star means that he he submitted a twostar solution which means that they uh were able to reach the bananas but maybe there was like a step that was making it uh that could have been uh saved and once signs and that this they have struggled with this and an exclamation mark means a failed solution so they weren't able to solve the challenge at all and assessment challenges this is actually first look uh i wanted to show you that we currently we currently have assessment challenges here marked as with a yellow circle but we are working on special assessment challenges that will be separated from this which is something that i know a lot of teachers are really excited about um so on the progress table you're also able to limit progress as you can see here uh this classroom's progress was limited until to challenge 24 the one of the assessment challenges it's it's a choice you can limit by course you can limit by assessment challenges and and from the progress table you're also able to turn on turn on and off super hints for your students if you feel that your students are struggling for example if we see uh hi joanne so if we see that uh this is a great visual indication to see if our students struggled in a certain point so if i would see several students have blue or red stars in a certain challenge then i know maybe it's time to turn on super hints for them or maybe i want to revisit that challenge and see why they were struggling um okay wait so i think i jumped a little bit ahead i also wanted to before we jump into the classroom i wanted to say that if you are not importing with google classroom or clever or whatever uh free premade uh classroom then once you've created a classroom uh let's go to one of my empty classrooms this thing's always tend to happen when you're in a webinar sometimes uh one class wouldn't work let's see if this works no okay so if this classroom wasn't populated then we would not see the list of the students which means that we need to add students so once you click the plus and ends and add students the popup window and you will be able to add a single account or create multiple accounts and a single account is pretty obvious display name using password uh create multiple accounts so to do that you would need to download this and afterwards enter the info into that example file there are examples on the file so you won't have to um imagine uh how you have to fill this csv and then upload that csv into the platform and once you've uploaded it then the students will be populated in the classroom and uh you're getting uh first look this is the first webinar where we're presenting this so it's exciting uh you are also able to share a class code with your students a class code means so for example the classroom called adventures encoding has this unique class code that i can refresh and change and by clicking the regenerate button so by sharing a class code i can restrict or limit and how students will join because i know that some of the creators but mainly prereaders but not only uh could sometimes get confused then because you remember the login screen that i showed you at first so there are many sso systems so if you choose for example google or clever or classlink or whatever then it will present to those students only that option and it will prevent them from getting confused while they are blog signing in for the first time uh so once you shared the class code with the students they will you're basically um passing on that process to them you've shared the class talk with them and now they have to just click the link that you've shared with them and populate themselves into the classroom when can you change this after the code was already made so again if you even if the if for example you're actually seeing the uh perfect example right now this is a classroom which is already populated but i can still regenerate the class code again and again endlessly i think if i'm not mistaken so you're always able to change the classroom code and if by any chance the classroom code reached a student that is not meant to be in this classroom then you're always able to move this student to a different classroom the thing is that you're only able to move students within classrooms in your subscription and if i'm not mistaken only classrooms that you manage so and another great feature is the student log inputs right here at the top and so the student student logging cards are basically just uh individual cards for students that have their name and their just their credentials their login information this is really helpful if you're teaching a hybrid model or if you're teaching um remotely and you can i it does create a little bit work for the teacher because after you printed the login cards you have to share them with a specific student so it would either be print and cut or screenshot and share and but it does really help a lot of students log in correctly and that saves a lot of work later on okay so let's move on to the next step on the courses tab you're able to see uh the the same courses as we saw here but now we're seeing them with uh a little bit more information so we see which grades this course is suitable for how many lesson plans it has and what um advice it would work best on from the courses page you're able to assign or unassign courses from the classroom so i would assign by clicking it and it becomes yellow which means the sign and to unassign i just click the arrow and i'm assigned pretty intuitive and for every course if you click the read more it will give you an explanation on what are the coding concepts that are uh covered in this lesson and you have a link here that would take you to the lesson plan i will eat the lesson plans are let's let's just give it a second to vlog so the lesson plans is a presentation a premade presentation by uh by league nut that will help you teach the course in the classroom so you we basically did all the work and you can just rip rip up the fruits by using this presentation when you use uh in front of the students when you use code monkey in the classrooms or in zoom you can share your screen and now is there anything else i want to say and again you can see that it's color coded by uh how how difficult uh the the course is so on the gradebook the gradebook is another pretty great feature uh so on the gradebook you are able to see some data about uh about your specific classroom in a specific course you're able to navigate between courses here and between classrooms here you will be able to see uh the the the star and the star system translated into numbers from 1 to 10 and it's like just grading them and you're able to change it from numbers to letters or to percents and so the percent is how how how successful were they in completing this course and you're also able to choose if you want to see the overall grade for a different okay this class hasn't covered all of that but uh you're able to change the the concept and this uh chart is also exp if you click export it would download as a it would be downloaded to your computer and euro can download certificates from here which is a great way to ramp up the excitement in the classroom so once you've finished uh coding adventure part one you can download certificates and the certificates would be done would be uh let's show you what they would look like so the certificates would be downloaded into your computer with the name of the student imprinted in the same font as codemonkey and let's see if i can see it here okay so let's see answer okay so this is an example for a certificate if you download it through the teacher resources then it's without a name but if you download it with the teacher resources so it will include an issue date student name and the signature or the founder of codemonkey so before we move on to the teacher resources officially i just wanted to show you briefly the showroom the showroom is where you would be able to see uh games that were created by your students and once you once you reach the point where the students are using the the more advanced quad monkey courses you're also able to enable or disable the discover so once right now the discovery is enabled so that's why it says the button says disable discover and once i click it it says that it will hide the discover from my students i really recommend uh maybe disabling discover for the first uh for the first month at least and it's just it's a personal recommendation it's not an official recommendation from code monkey but i think the discovery is a really students could get distracted by it and instead of doing the assigned courses then they might move to the discover so i would recommend once you have once you have created a classroom added students and then assigned courses the next step i think would be to disable this cover and then enable it as you go on but it's at your desk at your description so when we let's move on to the teacher resources so under the teacher resources uh you have always available the webinars this webinar also is going to be on the webinar page so whenever you want to revisit anything you can do it from here you can see uh the lesson plans uh on so the teacher resources would be obviously where you get all of your resources and the resources are directed for online activities offline activities and preparation for the classroom so if you're interested in preparation for the classroom then i would recommend looking at the lesson plans that are available for code mckee junior for beaver retriever recording adventure game builder banana tales pony chat and challenge builder and also for the preparation for classroom you can check out the very cool new feature coding concepts it's relevant only for coding adventure and but you're able to see brief uh videos that you're also i would recommend showing in the classroom uh later on and that will explain the specific coding concepts that will be taught in that course if you're interested in offline and one more preparation for the classroom you can see the solutions for every challenge in every course in code monkey all of the solutions are here all you need to do is click the the link in the correct course and then it will show you the the most eloquent way to solve the challenge and this is what you would be um directing your classroom towards if you're interested in offline activities then we have the media and graphics and you can find certificates here you can find coloring pages and posters you can print and hang in the classroom and what else did i want to say and if you click the teaching with coding adventure then it would take you there's a lot of windows open right now and i'm presenting my screen so it may take a second okay great so it will take you to the teaching with coding your page which has a lot of information about the about the different uh coding concepts that are covered and also a course overview and brief introduction to the platform uh so before i i know i do want to respect everyone's time and i know that the webinar is due to finish in a couple of minutes so i just want to uh briefly review uh where you can access the help center so you help center logo is always here on the left in the bottom left hand you're also able to contact us again as i mentioned at the beginning through here and okay let's just see the help center structure for a minute because i want you to be able to find your way once you use it for the first time so the help center is divided by articles for teachers articles for admins and articles for teachers and admins so this would be things relating to classroom classroom dashboard management articles for students which is basically text explanations on how to log in as a student and then frequently ask questions and dive deeper articles about the courses and okay so let's let's do a brief q a before we finish so we see that we have one question from jennifer hi jennifer let me just read it for a second okay because it's a sorry maya i will um i will check the health center and we'll get back to jennifer with the with the issue with it it means that they instead of using the class code they try to sign up maybe there weren't enough seats on your account so they couldn't join with the class code or maybe they entered the wrong class code so they tried to sign up students and then they had to enter their age and if their age is 13 or less which i assume it is then they get this message that they are not um old enough to join so but i will check the your um um your conversation uh on the help desk and now on the support and then i will get back to you right after this webinar thank you jennifer says thank you as well if anybody has any questions then if you could please either raise your hand or write them in the chat let's give people a second to write something if they need to okay so if nobody has any further questions then i think uh we can wrap this webinar up and i'll just remind everybody that this webinar was recorded and it will be will be live on our website uh within a week or so you will be able to access it through the teacher resources and let's just show you through the teacher resources if you click the visit webinar page you're also able to find on the webinar page a lot of uh um previously recorded webinars that are uh dealing with either specific subjects or general uh getting started with teacher getting started with code monkey for teachers explanations and also for students and and i want to thank everybody again for joining us today thank you for taking the time and please if any any of the questions are remained unanswered then you can always talk to us through the help center or by using the chat bot that for some reason i can't see it right now but it's always on the bottom right hand right here and there's a chat bot and you can write to our support center we enter within a day or two maximum so thank you for joining today i'm very happy to meet all of you and have a great rest of your day
