00:00 - VP of sales here
00:03 - hi everyone it's great to be here yeah
00:06 - Zach
00:07 - um been working at Code Monkey for a
00:09 - number of years here I started off as a
00:12 - teacher and uh really looking forward to
00:15 - this webinar and thank you all for
00:18 - joining
00:20 - I'll be here to uh answer any questions
00:22 - on the Q a Molly we'll talk more about
00:25 - that
00:26 - yeah
00:27 - um so Zach is going to be our q a
00:29 - champion today so if you have any
00:31 - questions throughout the webinar please
00:33 - use the Q a box through Zoom Zach will
00:36 - be checking that and we'll be responding
00:38 - to them as they come in
00:40 - so today's webinar is the first in a
00:43 - three-part series designed to give
00:45 - schools and districts a look at what
00:47 - Code Monkey is all about in our course
00:49 - pathway how teachers can leverage the
00:52 - platform and feel empowered teaching
00:54 - coding whether or not they have a coding
00:56 - background and how schools and districts
00:58 - can implement or expand their K-8 coding
01:01 - curriculum
01:05 - so today's agenda we are going to start
01:07 - with an overview of Code Monkey and then
01:09 - at the majority of our time our short
01:11 - time together we will introduce our K-8
01:14 - coding pathway this will include our
01:17 - block to text based coding progression
01:19 - our new digital literacy courses and
01:22 - what students will learn
01:25 - so who is codemonkey
01:28 - Code Monkey was established in 2014 with
01:31 - the goal of creating developmentally
01:32 - appropriate and engaging curriculum for
01:35 - teaching students how to code online
01:37 - platform was designed with schools and
01:40 - teachers in mind
01:41 - the new features that are developed and
01:43 - released are primarily based on the
01:45 - feedback from our customers for checking
01:46 - in with them throughout the school year
01:48 - asking what's working what can be better
01:50 - and that's how we determine where we're
01:52 - going to make improvements or where we
01:54 - are going to add new things whether it's
01:55 - tools on the platform or new courses
01:58 - our coding in digital literacy courses
02:01 - are aligned to National standards and we
02:03 - are continuing to expand our standards
02:05 - alignment to state standards as well
02:09 - no prior coding experience is needed for
02:12 - teachers to use Code Monkey teachers
02:15 - aren't going to be getting slowed down
02:16 - with an overly technical platform
02:18 - classroom setup and management is easy
02:21 - lesson plan Solutions encoding concept
02:23 - guides are included with all
02:25 - subscriptions and our team is available
02:27 - as an additional resource for Technical
02:29 - and non-technical questions that may
02:31 - arise
02:36 - so our K-8 coding pathway Code Monkey
02:39 - offers offers the opportunity to teach
02:42 - students how to code in both block and
02:44 - text-based coding environments which can
02:47 - accommodate different learning abilities
02:48 - build confidence in students and
02:50 - minimize gaps in learning we provide a
02:53 - coding course progression that begins
02:55 - with block-based coding before
02:57 - introducing students to text-based
02:59 - coding where they learn to code using
03:01 - industry recognized languages such as
03:03 - coffeescript and python
03:06 - our K through 8 coding pathway begins
03:08 - over here with Code Monkey Junior which
03:11 - is a pre-reader course following Code
03:13 - Monkey Junior
03:14 - block based coding which is that
03:16 - traditional drag and drop block coding
03:19 - is then introduced in Beaver achiever
03:25 - got a little ahead of myself here
03:29 - uh now then starting as early as third
03:31 - grade
03:33 - we are introducing text-based coding
03:35 - coffeescript which is a very
03:37 - beginner-friendly language
03:39 - I encoding Adventure dodo does math game
03:43 - builder those build off of coding
03:44 - Adventure also using coffeescript and
03:47 - then our more advanced courses banana
03:49 - Tales encoding chat Bots introduce
03:52 - python also in a game-based environment
03:54 - like the rest of our courses
03:57 - now let's check out some of these
03:59 - courses in more detail
04:04 - so again getting ahead of myself happy
04:07 - trigger fingers over here
04:09 - so we have Code Monkey Jr and beaver
04:11 - achiever which are the first courses in
04:13 - our pathway Code Monkey Jr teaches
04:16 - students as early as Pre-K the basics of
04:19 - coding but the progression of challenges
04:21 - across four different courses Code
04:24 - Monkey Junior eases pre-readers into
04:26 - gaining an understanding a fundamental
04:28 - coding Concepts students will learn and
04:31 - practice these concepts by building a
04:32 - set of visual coding instructions to
04:34 - help lead a monkey to a treasure chest
04:37 - the four courses are aptly named after
04:39 - the concept students will learn which
04:42 - are sequencing in Loops Advanced
04:44 - sequencing and Loops conditional loops
04:47 - and procedures
04:48 - following Code Monkey Junior students
04:50 - are introduced as I mentioned to the
04:52 - drag and drop block based coding and
04:54 - beaver achiever the minimal text
04:56 - throughout the beaver achiever courses
04:58 - makes it the perfect solution for early
05:00 - readers and narration is also available
05:02 - throughout the courses
05:04 - through Beaver achiever
05:06 - students further expand their skills in
05:09 - sequencing and Loops conditional loops
05:11 - and if else conditions
05:14 - now talking about these courses is great
05:16 - looking at all of this text on a slide
05:18 - also great I'm sure but let's see what
05:20 - it looks like on the platform
05:25 - Code Monkey courses are consistent in
05:28 - how concepts are introduced and taught
05:30 - in the form of gamified challenges
05:32 - students must demonstrate their game
05:34 - knowledge of various coding elements in
05:36 - order to proceed through the story map
05:38 - in the game should also mention at this
05:40 - point if since I missed it early on but
05:43 - codemonkey is completely browser based
05:45 - all of these courses can work on
05:48 - Chromebooks laptops computers our block
05:51 - based courses copenky Junior and beaver
05:53 - achiever are also compatible with iPads
05:57 - but moving back to this so initial
06:01 - challenges are going to be teaching
06:03 - basic coding Concepts while later
06:05 - challenges ask students to use their
06:09 - creativity to form combinations of these
06:11 - elements in their coding Solutions so
06:14 - what we're looking at right here this
06:17 - title that says sequencing this is going
06:19 - to be the story map for Code Monkey
06:22 - Junior showing the first one through
06:25 - seven challenges so every challenge
06:27 - across all of our courses is based on a
06:31 - three star reading students are going to
06:33 - receive immediate feedback
06:35 - after they submit their solution and can
06:37 - see their progress in the course on a
06:40 - story map such as this
06:42 - students can return to any previously
06:44 - completed challenge for further practice
06:46 - or to attempt a higher rating students
06:50 - are not able to jump ahead and Skip
06:52 - challenges in order to ensure that
06:54 - they're learning the necessary skills
06:59 - so here on
07:01 - let's go into challenge seven
07:05 - so here on challenge seven and at Code
07:08 - Monkey Junior by clicking on the Arrow
07:10 - students will create a simple sequence
07:12 - in order to direct the monkey to pick up
07:14 - the banana and move to the treasure
07:16 - chest so here we will need to move right
07:19 - go up
07:21 - move right again and then we'll push
07:24 - play
07:28 - it's very exciting we made it to the
07:30 - chest and I can see that I received
07:33 - three stars on this challenge now that
07:35 - it's been completed I can go it forward
07:37 - to the next challenge in this course
07:42 - now let's look at a different challenge
07:44 - so what we're looking at here is a
07:46 - different challenge also a challenge
07:48 - number seven but on the course Beaver
07:50 - achiever we can see that students use
07:53 - the drag and drop functions and block
07:54 - based coding to create a different
07:56 - sequence in order for the beaver to drop
07:58 - logs and to build his damn his or her
08:02 - Dam so here we will drop to logs
08:08 - move right twice drop again and then
08:12 - we'll run through our code
08:18 - I knew we could do it we passed it again
08:20 - yep
08:21 - three stars on this challenge
08:23 - and then just by clicking the next Arrow
08:26 - we can move on to challenge eight or we
08:28 - can start this over and complete this
08:30 - challenge again
08:36 - so another course is coding Adventure
08:39 - coding Adventure is the first course
08:42 - that started it all for Code Monkey
08:44 - it introduces students to text-based
08:47 - coding students will gain an
08:49 - understanding of the fundamental
08:50 - concepts of programming as well as build
08:53 - skills in computational thinking and
08:55 - problem solving
08:56 - game builder is an intermediate level
08:58 - course that builds off of coding
08:59 - Adventure where students will learn
09:01 - fundamental game Design Concepts and
09:04 - using these skills students can then
09:05 - showcase their creativity by developing
09:07 - their own custom games and challenges in
09:10 - challenge Builder that can be shared
09:12 - with their peers so challenge Builder is
09:14 - going to be more of a Sandbox type
09:15 - environment where students can take the
09:17 - concepts that they've learned throughout
09:19 - coding Adventure or throughout game
09:21 - builder and again create their own
09:23 - custom challenges that they can then
09:25 - share
09:27 - text-based coding can seem intimidating
09:30 - to both teachers and students I
09:32 - understand but the course is set up to
09:34 - teach Concepts in incremental steps with
09:37 - handy tools students can use while
09:39 - they're working on mastering their
09:40 - typing and spelling skills
09:44 - so let's go on to this challenge back on
09:47 - the platform and looking at the course
09:50 - coding Adventure this is Challenge three
09:52 - so here on Challenge three the objective
09:54 - is to write a solution that will direct
09:56 - the monkey here
09:58 - to pick up the banana this challenge
10:00 - provides pre-written code so that
10:02 - students can manipulate the solution and
10:04 - practice using some of the tools
10:06 - including the ruler which is used for
10:08 - measuring so by picking up this ruler I
10:11 - can measure the distance between the
10:12 - monkey and the banana which is 12 steps
10:15 - it already states that here which is
10:16 - great so let's run through our code
10:19 - and oops I sent the monkey in the wrong
10:23 - direction
10:25 - so you may have noticed
10:27 - the platform I just clicked through it a
10:31 - little too quickly but platform provided
10:33 - a hint for me to correct my solution
10:36 - so here I'm going to go back and say
10:38 - instead of turning left let's turn right
10:41 - and run it again
10:44 - and there we go we reached three stars
10:47 - and we can move on to the next challenge
10:49 - but hints are provided throughout the
10:51 - courses when they're needed if students
10:54 - are running into
10:56 - areas where they might get stuck
10:58 - to help them out
11:01 - now further on in the course let's go up
11:04 - to challenge number 32. this is where it
11:08 - loops and variables are introduced so
11:10 - using the ruler again
11:13 - in challenge 32 students will correct
11:15 - this pre-written code that's already
11:17 - provided to them at the beginning of the
11:19 - challenge to show the correct number of
11:21 - steps between the monkey and the bananas
11:23 - so currently the variable X is saying
11:25 - that it's five steps but if we take this
11:27 - ruler measure between the monkey and the
11:30 - banana it's 15 Steps just double check
11:33 - banana between banana is another 15
11:36 - Steps
11:38 - so I'll update the variable X to 15.
11:44 - and click run
11:46 - and there we go running around in
11:49 - the square picking up each of the
11:51 - bananas
11:54 - now before moving on uh beyond the ruler
11:57 - there are additional tools that have
11:59 - been built in for inclusivity so by
12:01 - hovering over objects I'm able to see
12:03 - the spelling and I can click
12:07 - on any of these objects and it will be
12:10 - typed out for me I can also find the
12:13 - relevant commands here at the bottom of
12:14 - the code editor that also by clicking on
12:18 - it it will type it out for me
12:22 - now this is great for students hints are
12:25 - great but what about for teachers what
12:28 - resources and tools are going to be
12:29 - available for teachers to use as they're
12:31 - using Code Monkey and teaching
12:33 - coffeescript for example to their
12:36 - students
12:38 - so along with bully guided lesson plans
12:42 - for each course teachers can also
12:44 - leverage the coding concept guides which
12:46 - have been created for coding adventure
12:48 - and banana Tales where copy script and
12:50 - python are introduced so all of these
12:53 - resources can be found on the T-shirt
12:55 - teacher dashboard over here on the left
12:57 - hand side I have teacher resources
12:59 - and lesson plans can be found under
13:01 - teaching with codemonkey and then we can
13:03 - go over to coding Concepts where those
13:06 - more detailed
13:08 - resources are available
13:13 - so this is what the coding concept guide
13:16 - would look like where variables are
13:18 - introduced so the coding concept guides
13:21 - provide a more detailed explanation for
13:23 - Concepts introduced including its
13:26 - definition why and when is it used it
13:29 - also provides examples and gifts these
13:32 - have been developed to be student facing
13:34 - so if a teacher chooses to they can
13:37 - provide this to their students as a
13:39 - further Resource as they're going
13:40 - through the course or they can keep it
13:42 - for themselves and easy with the entire
13:44 - class
13:49 - all right so that was quick preview of
13:53 - just some of our coding courses but for
13:57 - sake of time that we have let's move on
14:00 - in addition to our block and text-based
14:02 - coding pathway this past year this
14:05 - current year code monkey has introduced
14:07 - digital literacy courses which is a new
14:09 - segment to our course offerings each
14:12 - course is a semester-long in length and
14:14 - covers different topics digital use
14:16 - being focused on the different aspects
14:19 - of computers and how to use them digital
14:21 - citizenship focuses on how students can
14:23 - be good citizens of the online world and
14:25 - be aware of their digital footprint both
14:28 - of these courses as is Code Monkey
14:31 - tradition are gamified and students work
14:33 - through different puzzles as they go
14:35 - through the courses these would be
14:37 - geared towards
14:38 - third grade and up I'm also very
14:41 - relevant and appropriate for middle
14:43 - school students as well
14:49 - now what comes next
14:53 - so you've had a preview of some of the
14:55 - Code Monkey courses very quick crash
14:59 - course to give you an idea of what code
15:02 - monkey can offer but
15:06 - we do offer teacher trial accounts the
15:08 - school year isn't over yet you can sign
15:10 - up for a free teacher trial to try out
15:12 - code monkey with your students with the
15:14 - free trial you can try out the first 30
15:16 - challenges of Code Monkey Junior
15:19 - coding adventure and banana tales as
15:21 - well as all of our mini courses so
15:23 - although we didn't go into banana tales
15:26 - in depth or even checked out some of
15:28 - those challenges you can do so yourself
15:30 - by signing up for a trial and again you
15:32 - can use it with your students
15:34 - so the link to sign up for a teacher
15:36 - trial is here
15:38 - but
15:39 - um for a simpler URL you can go to
15:42 - codemaki.com in the upper right hand
15:44 - corner there's a sign up button
15:47 - and then if you're interested in
15:48 - learning more we ask that you write to
15:51 - us at sales codemonkey.com
15:53 - you can also go to our website again
15:55 - codemonkey.com and request more
15:57 - information through our site
16:00 - now also don't forget we have two more
16:02 - webinars uh in over the next two weeks
16:06 - the next one is going to be February
16:07 - 27th which is going to be focused on
16:10 - Code Monkey for teachers what resources
16:12 - are available what does does the teacher
16:14 - dashboarding classroom dashboard look
16:16 - like and then the third webinar is going
16:19 - to be May 4th which is going to be Code
16:21 - Monkey for district so as a district or
16:24 - a school what can I do to bring in Code
16:28 - Monkey and how can we start using it
16:31 - I want to thank everyone for joining us
16:34 - again today and we are looking forward
16:37 - to seeing you all again soon
16:43 - thank you Molly if there are any
16:45 - questions feel free to write on the Q a
16:48 - we'll wait a few minutes
17:10 - someone asked Molly February 27th has
17:13 - passed it's April 27th it is April 27th
17:16 - I am clearly living
17:18 - in the last two months
17:27 - a question was asked we have programs
17:29 - for homeschoolers we do
17:31 - um if you want to go to codemonkey.com
17:35 - home Dash plans you can find
17:38 - subscriptions available there for
17:41 - homeschools or individual learners
17:47 - foreign
17:53 - well again thank you everyone for
17:55 - joining us today
18:09 - um
18:12 - Molly there's a few more questions
18:16 - all right let's see one is I am from
18:18 - Gabriella I'm a robotics teacher would I
18:20 - be able to have all K5 students access
18:22 - this platform absolutely
18:25 - uh with our subscriptions we include all
18:28 - courses as well so you'd have the
18:29 - flexibility in assigning one or multiple
18:32 - courses based on where your students are
18:34 - at and what you want to use for your
18:35 - your robotics program
18:37 - another question about discounts for
18:40 - Title 1 schools if you want to reach out
18:42 - to us at sales codemaki.com happy to go
18:46 - over uh pricing options for for your
18:49 - specific school well I would just add to
18:51 - that that if you go to our Code Monkey
18:53 - grants page which we launched last year
18:56 - you can see all the different wording we
18:59 - have for grants that you'd like to apply
19:03 - to we've already created language that

19:26 - very much Molly see you all next
19:28 - Thursday

Cleaned transcript:

VP of sales here hi everyone it's great to be here yeah Zach um been working at Code Monkey for a number of years here I started off as a teacher and uh really looking forward to this webinar and thank you all for joining I'll be here to uh answer any questions on the Q a Molly we'll talk more about that yeah um so Zach is going to be our q a champion today so if you have any questions throughout the webinar please use the Q a box through Zoom Zach will be checking that and we'll be responding to them as they come in so today's webinar is the first in a threepart series designed to give schools and districts a look at what Code Monkey is all about in our course pathway how teachers can leverage the platform and feel empowered teaching coding whether or not they have a coding background and how schools and districts can implement or expand their K8 coding curriculum so today's agenda we are going to start with an overview of Code Monkey and then at the majority of our time our short time together we will introduce our K8 coding pathway this will include our block to text based coding progression our new digital literacy courses and what students will learn so who is codemonkey Code Monkey was established in 2014 with the goal of creating developmentally appropriate and engaging curriculum for teaching students how to code online platform was designed with schools and teachers in mind the new features that are developed and released are primarily based on the feedback from our customers for checking in with them throughout the school year asking what's working what can be better and that's how we determine where we're going to make improvements or where we are going to add new things whether it's tools on the platform or new courses our coding in digital literacy courses are aligned to National standards and we are continuing to expand our standards alignment to state standards as well no prior coding experience is needed for teachers to use Code Monkey teachers aren't going to be getting slowed down with an overly technical platform classroom setup and management is easy lesson plan Solutions encoding concept guides are included with all subscriptions and our team is available as an additional resource for Technical and nontechnical questions that may arise so our K8 coding pathway Code Monkey offers offers the opportunity to teach students how to code in both block and textbased coding environments which can accommodate different learning abilities build confidence in students and minimize gaps in learning we provide a coding course progression that begins with blockbased coding before introducing students to textbased coding where they learn to code using industry recognized languages such as coffeescript and python our K through 8 coding pathway begins over here with Code Monkey Junior which is a prereader course following Code Monkey Junior block based coding which is that traditional drag and drop block coding is then introduced in Beaver achiever got a little ahead of myself here uh now then starting as early as third grade we are introducing textbased coding coffeescript which is a very beginnerfriendly language I encoding Adventure dodo does math game builder those build off of coding Adventure also using coffeescript and then our more advanced courses banana Tales encoding chat Bots introduce python also in a gamebased environment like the rest of our courses now let's check out some of these courses in more detail so again getting ahead of myself happy trigger fingers over here so we have Code Monkey Jr and beaver achiever which are the first courses in our pathway Code Monkey Jr teaches students as early as PreK the basics of coding but the progression of challenges across four different courses Code Monkey Junior eases prereaders into gaining an understanding a fundamental coding Concepts students will learn and practice these concepts by building a set of visual coding instructions to help lead a monkey to a treasure chest the four courses are aptly named after the concept students will learn which are sequencing in Loops Advanced sequencing and Loops conditional loops and procedures following Code Monkey Junior students are introduced as I mentioned to the drag and drop block based coding and beaver achiever the minimal text throughout the beaver achiever courses makes it the perfect solution for early readers and narration is also available throughout the courses through Beaver achiever students further expand their skills in sequencing and Loops conditional loops and if else conditions now talking about these courses is great looking at all of this text on a slide also great I'm sure but let's see what it looks like on the platform Code Monkey courses are consistent in how concepts are introduced and taught in the form of gamified challenges students must demonstrate their game knowledge of various coding elements in order to proceed through the story map in the game should also mention at this point if since I missed it early on but codemonkey is completely browser based all of these courses can work on Chromebooks laptops computers our block based courses copenky Junior and beaver achiever are also compatible with iPads but moving back to this so initial challenges are going to be teaching basic coding Concepts while later challenges ask students to use their creativity to form combinations of these elements in their coding Solutions so what we're looking at right here this title that says sequencing this is going to be the story map for Code Monkey Junior showing the first one through seven challenges so every challenge across all of our courses is based on a three star reading students are going to receive immediate feedback after they submit their solution and can see their progress in the course on a story map such as this students can return to any previously completed challenge for further practice or to attempt a higher rating students are not able to jump ahead and Skip challenges in order to ensure that they're learning the necessary skills so here on let's go into challenge seven so here on challenge seven and at Code Monkey Junior by clicking on the Arrow students will create a simple sequence in order to direct the monkey to pick up the banana and move to the treasure chest so here we will need to move right go up move right again and then we'll push play it's very exciting we made it to the chest and I can see that I received three stars on this challenge now that it's been completed I can go it forward to the next challenge in this course now let's look at a different challenge so what we're looking at here is a different challenge also a challenge number seven but on the course Beaver achiever we can see that students use the drag and drop functions and block based coding to create a different sequence in order for the beaver to drop logs and to build his damn his or her Dam so here we will drop to logs move right twice drop again and then we'll run through our code I knew we could do it we passed it again yep three stars on this challenge and then just by clicking the next Arrow we can move on to challenge eight or we can start this over and complete this challenge again so another course is coding Adventure coding Adventure is the first course that started it all for Code Monkey it introduces students to textbased coding students will gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming as well as build skills in computational thinking and problem solving game builder is an intermediate level course that builds off of coding Adventure where students will learn fundamental game Design Concepts and using these skills students can then showcase their creativity by developing their own custom games and challenges in challenge Builder that can be shared with their peers so challenge Builder is going to be more of a Sandbox type environment where students can take the concepts that they've learned throughout coding Adventure or throughout game builder and again create their own custom challenges that they can then share textbased coding can seem intimidating to both teachers and students I understand but the course is set up to teach Concepts in incremental steps with handy tools students can use while they're working on mastering their typing and spelling skills so let's go on to this challenge back on the platform and looking at the course coding Adventure this is Challenge three so here on Challenge three the objective is to write a solution that will direct the monkey here to pick up the banana this challenge provides prewritten code so that students can manipulate the solution and practice using some of the tools including the ruler which is used for measuring so by picking up this ruler I can measure the distance between the monkey and the banana which is 12 steps it already states that here which is great so let's run through our code and oops I sent the monkey in the wrong direction so you may have noticed the platform I just clicked through it a little too quickly but platform provided a hint for me to correct my solution so here I'm going to go back and say instead of turning left let's turn right and run it again and there we go we reached three stars and we can move on to the next challenge but hints are provided throughout the courses when they're needed if students are running into areas where they might get stuck to help them out now further on in the course let's go up to challenge number 32. this is where it loops and variables are introduced so using the ruler again in challenge 32 students will correct this prewritten code that's already provided to them at the beginning of the challenge to show the correct number of steps between the monkey and the bananas so currently the variable X is saying that it's five steps but if we take this ruler measure between the monkey and the banana it's 15 Steps just double check banana between banana is another 15 Steps so I'll update the variable X to 15. and click run and there we go running around in the square picking up each of the bananas now before moving on uh beyond the ruler there are additional tools that have been built in for inclusivity so by hovering over objects I'm able to see the spelling and I can click on any of these objects and it will be typed out for me I can also find the relevant commands here at the bottom of the code editor that also by clicking on it it will type it out for me now this is great for students hints are great but what about for teachers what resources and tools are going to be available for teachers to use as they're using Code Monkey and teaching coffeescript for example to their students so along with bully guided lesson plans for each course teachers can also leverage the coding concept guides which have been created for coding adventure and banana Tales where copy script and python are introduced so all of these resources can be found on the Tshirt teacher dashboard over here on the left hand side I have teacher resources and lesson plans can be found under teaching with codemonkey and then we can go over to coding Concepts where those more detailed resources are available so this is what the coding concept guide would look like where variables are introduced so the coding concept guides provide a more detailed explanation for Concepts introduced including its definition why and when is it used it also provides examples and gifts these have been developed to be student facing so if a teacher chooses to they can provide this to their students as a further Resource as they're going through the course or they can keep it for themselves and easy with the entire class all right so that was quick preview of just some of our coding courses but for sake of time that we have let's move on in addition to our block and textbased coding pathway this past year this current year code monkey has introduced digital literacy courses which is a new segment to our course offerings each course is a semesterlong in length and covers different topics digital use being focused on the different aspects of computers and how to use them digital citizenship focuses on how students can be good citizens of the online world and be aware of their digital footprint both of these courses as is Code Monkey tradition are gamified and students work through different puzzles as they go through the courses these would be geared towards third grade and up I'm also very relevant and appropriate for middle school students as well now what comes next so you've had a preview of some of the Code Monkey courses very quick crash course to give you an idea of what code monkey can offer but we do offer teacher trial accounts the school year isn't over yet you can sign up for a free teacher trial to try out code monkey with your students with the free trial you can try out the first 30 challenges of Code Monkey Junior coding adventure and banana tales as well as all of our mini courses so although we didn't go into banana tales in depth or even checked out some of those challenges you can do so yourself by signing up for a trial and again you can use it with your students so the link to sign up for a teacher trial is here but um for a simpler URL you can go to codemaki.com in the upper right hand corner there's a sign up button and then if you're interested in learning more we ask that you write to us at sales codemonkey.com you can also go to our website again codemonkey.com and request more information through our site now also don't forget we have two more webinars uh in over the next two weeks the next one is going to be February 27th which is going to be focused on Code Monkey for teachers what resources are available what does does the teacher dashboarding classroom dashboard look like and then the third webinar is going to be May 4th which is going to be Code Monkey for district so as a district or a school what can I do to bring in Code Monkey and how can we start using it I want to thank everyone for joining us again today and we are looking forward to seeing you all again soon thank you Molly if there are any questions feel free to write on the Q a we'll wait a few minutes someone asked Molly February 27th has passed it's April 27th it is April 27th I am clearly living in the last two months a question was asked we have programs for homeschoolers we do um if you want to go to codemonkey.com home Dash plans you can find subscriptions available there for homeschools or individual learners foreign well again thank you everyone for joining us today um Molly there's a few more questions all right let's see one is I am from Gabriella I'm a robotics teacher would I be able to have all K5 students access this platform absolutely uh with our subscriptions we include all courses as well so you'd have the flexibility in assigning one or multiple courses based on where your students are at and what you want to use for your your robotics program another question about discounts for Title 1 schools if you want to reach out to us at sales codemaki.com happy to go over uh pricing options for for your specific school well I would just add to that that if you go to our Code Monkey grants page which we launched last year you can see all the different wording we have for grants that you'd like to apply to we've already created language that will enable you to easily take that language and put it into your Grant application um for for all different types of grants available all right see you all later thank you very much Molly see you all next Thursday
