00:08 - my name is Marissa and I am the
00:11 - coordinator of programs and Partnerships
00:13 - here at Young Women's Preparatory
00:15 - Network so I oversee various
00:17 - Partnerships and programs and make sure
00:19 - they're being implemented on all of our
00:21 - campus we are a network of all girls
00:25 - college preparatory Public Schools
00:26 - across Texas our schools are located
00:29 - here in Dallas Fort Worth Austin San
00:32 - Antonio we have two in Houston El Paso
00:36 - Midland and L and our campuses are
00:39 - usually located in lowincome areas and
00:42 - more more than half of our students are
00:45 - first generation so we really push to
00:47 - support those girls in those lowincome
00:50 - areas by giving them academic and
00:53 - Leadership skills to achieve success not
00:56 - only when they go to college but just in
00:58 - their life in general
01:01 - actually one of our teachers in Midland
01:05 - went to a um conference and they saw a
01:08 - presentation about Code Monkey in 2019
01:11 - and so she was really interested in that
01:13 - and so she started using Code Monkey in
01:15 - her own classroom and then when she saw
01:18 - all of the success with her students um
01:20 - with the program she kind of told the
01:22 - network about it and so we started
01:24 - implementing Code Monkey in
01:27 - 2022 um in our all of of our schools so
01:31 - we've been using Code Monkey for about 2
01:33 - years now going on three next year so we
01:36 - use Code Monkey in our Middle School and
01:38 - High School classrooms and all of our
01:41 - schools are stem based schools so Code
01:44 - Monkey fits very well into our
01:46 - curriculum and I would say Code Monkey
01:48 - does a really great job at catering to
01:50 - our students needs a lot of our students
01:52 - when they start in Middle School don't
01:55 - know what coding is or often think it's
01:57 - very difficult or something that they
01:59 - won't able to learn um but I think cold
02:02 - monkey does a very great job at breaking
02:04 - it down and making coding seem easy and
02:07 - not so scary so most of the Code Monkey
02:10 - lessons start with a very basic concept
02:13 - and they build upon that so all of our
02:15 - students experience small successes
02:18 - early on which I think is really great
02:20 - and we also encourage the students to
02:22 - think of themselves as teammates and
02:24 - coaches with their groupmates so they're
02:27 - really good at helping each other out
02:28 - and keeping a positive attitude
02:30 - especially when things start progressing
02:33 - over the course and it gets a little
02:35 - harder I would say that our teachers
02:37 - really love the resources and features
02:40 - in Code Monkey I know they really
02:42 - appreciate the student progress chart um
02:45 - they can see at a glance how many levels
02:47 - students have completed and based on the
02:50 - color of they of the star they know if
02:52 - they're needing Assistance or ring if
02:55 - they use the required skill for the
02:57 - level or if they simply just had too
02:59 - many lines to code I can also say that
03:03 - they like the grading tool um I think it
03:06 - helps them out and makes their job
03:08 - easier I think code monkey has
03:10 - contributed a lot especially with the
03:13 - introduction to coding Concepts they
03:16 - have Hands-On learning they learn
03:18 - problem solving skills creativity and
03:21 - real world
03:23 - application I think one of the biggest
03:26 - aspects that they like is the game feel
03:28 - to the program
03:30 - I know the students don't feel like
03:31 - they're logging on and doing you know
03:34 - that tedious schoolwork students are
03:37 - excited to log on and get farther into
03:39 - the program I know they also like the
03:42 - instant feedback and the step-by-step
03:44 - instruction when they are needing
03:47 - guidance um to pass a certain level and
03:52 - I know a lot of them have also kind of
03:54 - made it kind of like a competition in
03:56 - their classroom so they'll kind of see
03:59 - who get farther along and so I feel like
04:02 - that's really good and they get
04:04 - excitement out of that and it's fun for
04:06 - them so I would definitely say that um
04:10 - these schools that are not using Cod
04:11 - monkey are missing out Code Monkey is a
04:14 - program that is loved by both teachers
04:17 - and students and I feel like it's hard
04:18 - to come across a program that is loved
04:20 - by both um I would say this program is
04:23 - very userfriendly engaging and flexible
04:27 - and I know students will get more out of
04:29 - this program program than you could
04:30 - really imagine it doesn't only teach
04:32 - them how to code but it teaches them
04:35 - problem solving skills creativity
04:37 - collaboration and even gets them career
04:39 - ready so we love Code Monkey at ywpn
