00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - welcome to key to success
00:07 - let's learn about keyboard events
00:10 - an event is an occurrence detected by
00:13 - the program
00:14 - in many cases the event is a user
00:17 - interaction
00:19 - examples of events are pressing a key
00:22 - moving the mouse clicking on the mouse
00:26 - let's review the keyboard events you'll
00:28 - be using in the next several challenges
00:32 - on key
00:34 - is a code monkey function that works
00:37 - with your keyboard
00:39 - every time you press a key on your
00:41 - keyboard the on key function is
00:43 - automatically called
00:45 - you can write code inside this on key
00:48 - function
00:49 - to do a certain action when a certain
00:52 - key is pressed
00:54 - so let's look at this example
00:56 - we have the on key function
00:59 - then you've got uppercase k
01:02 - and we have a parameter key
01:05 - so whenever you press a key on your
01:07 - keyboard the value of that key
01:10 - gets passed in to this parameter key
01:15 - and then you can check what that value
01:17 - is
01:19 - we're checking here if the value is a
01:21 - lowercase w step one
01:24 - if you've just pressed the key let
01:26 - lowercase s
01:27 - step negative one
01:30 - so your function could be checking other
01:34 - keys key values
01:36 - it could be checking more key values you
01:38 - could even do something if any key is
01:41 - pressed
01:43 - now an example as it's written here
01:46 - what would happen
01:47 - if the l key
01:50 - was pressed
01:53 - the on key function would get called
01:56 - and the key parameter would take on the
01:59 - value l
02:01 - but since we're not checking for l
02:03 - nothing would happen
02:06 - let's look at a challenge
02:08 - here's a fun challenge
02:10 - we have a lot going on here
02:13 - the monkey is on the turtle
02:15 - and needs to collect these bananas but
02:18 - remember the monkey has to go past these
02:20 - bushes before getting off the turtle
02:22 - and then we have that gorilla so we're
02:25 - going to need to use our potion to get
02:28 - our health up after the gorilla's been
02:30 - throwing things at us
02:32 - okay and remember we're going to do all
02:34 - of this by pressing keys on our keyboard
02:39 - so we'll start by
02:41 - putting down our on key function
02:44 - so remember the key parameter takes on
02:47 - the value of the key you just pressed
02:51 - okay we'll go ahead and use what they're
02:54 - starting us with
02:56 - okay so if key
02:58 - if the key you just pressed is a w step
03:00 - one let's step three instead so this the
03:03 - monkey will step three
03:06 - okay now let's say if
03:09 - the key is equal to
03:12 - an ask i'm going to have the monkey
03:15 - be able to move completely around so
03:17 - let's say
03:18 - let's step
03:21 - negative three so now it goes forwards
03:23 - and backwards
03:24 - let's allow it to turn so if
03:28 - he is equal to
03:30 - a
03:33 - we could turn left
03:35 - the monkey could turn left
03:37 - if
03:39 - key is equal to
03:42 - d
03:44 - we'll have the monkey turn right okay
03:48 - now the monkey can turn
03:50 - how about that turtle
03:52 - so if
03:53 - p is equal to
03:56 - t
03:58 - let's have a turtle
04:02 - step
04:03 - three
04:05 - okay let's see if we could do this you
04:07 - have to
04:09 - press i have to press the keys now to
04:11 - make it all happen so i'll run
04:14 - okay t
04:16 - t
04:18 - okay let's see okay now
04:23 - okay let's see turn
04:26 - okay we can get that banana
04:29 - what if i turn around again
04:33 - try to get those two bananas
04:36 - okay then i'll turn again
04:39 - and walk
04:41 - okay i want to go get the
04:43 - potion
04:45 - just in time
04:48 - you guys are probably better than at
04:49 - this than me
04:51 - there we
04:54 - go now it's your turn to use keyboard
04:58 - events good luck
