00:28 - first webinar for the back to school
00:31 - season
00:32 - on how to set up and manage your
00:34 - classrooms the code monkey team wants to
00:36 - personally
00:36 - thank you for joining us for today's
00:38 - webinar we know that
00:40 - time seems like it has been turned
00:41 - upside down so our goal for today
00:44 - is to make sure that you are getting
00:45 - exactly what you need out of today's
00:47 - webinar to help prepare you to teach
00:49 - code monkey with your students
00:56 - oops so
00:59 - be sure to follow us on twitter
01:01 - instagram
01:02 - at codemonkeystu during today's webinar
01:05 - and also tweet at us using the hashtag
01:08 - codemonkeywebinar
01:09 - we'll do our best to answer any live
01:11 - tweets during our webinar today and my
01:13 - team is also here to answer any
01:15 - questions that you may have and you'll

01:19 - so please chat with us along the side if
01:21 - you have any questions or
01:23 - ask them in the q a box we
01:26 - if we do not answer your questions
01:28 - immediately during
01:30 - the session of today's webinar we will
01:33 - try to get them
01:34 - get to them today during our q a and if
01:36 - we don't get to them during the q a
01:38 - we'll be sure to follow up with you
01:39 - after today's webinar
01:41 - following today's webinar a survey will
01:44 - pop up and once you take the survey
01:46 - a professional development certificate
01:48 - will be emailed to you
01:49 - directly following if you don't receive
01:51 - that you can email us and we'll follow
01:53 - up with you as well
01:54 - so let's get ready to write code catch
01:56 - bananas and save the world
01:59 - before we introduce ourselves i do want
02:01 - to go ahead and just
02:03 - take a poll for you for today i just
02:05 - kind of want to
02:07 - just learn a little bit about who you
02:08 - are so i'm just going to give everyone
02:10 - just a few moments to take this poll
02:12 - and then it just says you know like i
02:15 - mentioned we just want to learn as much
02:17 - about you
02:18 - today as we can to help guide you
02:20 - through this back to school
02:22 - new norm that we live in
02:41 - and if you don't find your role there
02:42 - just go ahead and select one that is a
02:44 - best fit for you
02:57 - all right i'll give everyone just about
02:58 - 10 more seconds we'll close that pull up
03:00 - and we'll get moving
03:04 - and if you don't see the poll it will
03:06 - just be
03:09 - no need to worry
03:15 - all righty i'm going to go ahead and
03:17 - close the poll
03:19 - and then i just always like to share the
03:21 - results so i'm hoping that you can see
03:22 - these with us
03:23 - how familiar are you as a coder it seems
03:25 - like the general
03:27 - consensus is that most of you are
03:28 - familiar with coding but still
03:30 - learning and then majority of you are
03:33 - going to be in the beginner side which
03:34 - is perfectly
03:36 - great have you used code monkey before
03:39 - majority of you have actually not used
03:40 - code monkey before so that's good for us
03:42 - to know as well and then what is your
03:43 - role
03:44 - so it seems like the majority of people
03:46 - are elementary teachers or computer
03:47 - technology teachers so we're going to go
03:51 - ahead now and
03:52 - get started with today's webinar
03:56 - alright so we'd like to always start off
03:58 - with just talking about
04:00 - what is code monkey so code monkey is a
04:01 - learning program for kids
04:03 - that provides online engaging courses
04:05 - for students to learn how
04:07 - to code it's made with schools and
04:09 - teachers in mind we are standards
04:11 - aligned we do have a k-8 coding
04:13 - curriculum
04:14 - and there is no prior experience needed
04:17 - to begin teaching with codemonkey
04:20 - and now we're just going to play the
04:21 - code monkey professional development
04:26 - series
04:28 - we envision a global playful learning
04:30 - experience
04:31 - where the next generations of coders are
04:33 - born and raised
04:35 - we aim to create an engaging platform
04:37 - where programming knowledge is acquired
04:39 - alongside 21st century skills through
04:41 - collaboratively playing
04:42 - and solving puzzles inventing creating
04:45 - and sharing
04:49 - why do we need to use code monkey for
04:50 - computational thinking
04:52 - coding is for everyone and concepts that
04:54 - everyone should know
04:55 - we are one of the best gamified
04:57 - platforms for teaching coding and
04:59 - computational thinking
05:00 - it is easy for both students and
05:02 - teachers alike
05:03 - [Music]
05:06 - what role does the teacher play in the
05:07 - code monkey platform
05:09 - the teacher facilitates the class checks
05:12 - for student understanding
05:13 - and fosters the ability for students to
05:15 - dive deeper into the various coding
05:17 - concepts
05:20 - codemonkey also has automated feedback
05:22 - loops with a rating scale to rate
05:24 - student solutions a three star means
05:27 - that the student was able to solve the
05:28 - challenge with the shortest most concise
05:30 - solution
05:31 - a two star means that the student was
05:33 - able to take what they learned and apply
05:35 - it to the challenge
05:36 - a one star means that the student was
05:38 - able to collect the bananas
05:47 - all right so we'll dive a little bit
05:48 - deeper into those concepts as we
05:50 - progress through today's
05:52 - webinar and like i mentioned if you have
05:54 - any questions along the way feel free to
05:55 - ask them we want to value your time as
05:57 - much as
05:57 - as we can during this time so now we're
06:00 - going to go ahead and meet the team so
06:02 - you can see exactly who it is that
06:03 - you're
06:04 - meeting today so first i want to start
06:06 - off by introducing myself
06:08 - my name is lena saleh and i am the
06:10 - professional development manager
06:12 - i'm here at code monkey i've been with
06:14 - code monkey for
06:17 - a few years now prior to that i taught
06:19 - in the classroom i taught
06:21 - at the elementary level and computer
06:23 - technology as well as rope
06:25 - curriculum for our district and i did
06:27 - that for a little over 10 years and now
06:29 - i also organize some meetups here in
06:31 - austin for
06:32 - a tech companies and teachers to meet
06:35 - together and kind of marry the
06:36 - partnership between them
06:37 - so now i'd like for you if you have any
06:39 - questions actually
06:40 - um you can always email me here at
06:42 - lena.s codemonkey.com or you can always
06:44 - tweet at me at lena
06:46 - codemonkey and i'm happy to answer those
06:48 - questions along the way
06:50 - now i'd like for you to meet my team
06:57 - hi everybody i'm talia marielle i'm the
07:00 - head of customer success at codemonkey
07:04 - i'm happy to be here with you and thank
07:06 - you for joining our webinar
07:08 - and i'll be taking your questions
07:10 - throughout the webinar so i hope you
07:14 - enjoy
07:16 - hi everybody my name is molly i am the
07:19 - director of sales here at code monkey
07:21 - um and i'm somewhat new to the company
07:23 - um just started here
07:24 - this past january but i will be helping
07:27 - out talia and lena as well with
07:29 - answering questions so again thank you
07:31 - for joining us today
07:35 - awesome thank you ladies so much um and
07:37 - just so you guys know talia is joining
07:38 - us
07:39 - from israel so she's up a little bit
07:42 - later than normal so thank you for
07:43 - taking that time with us today
07:47 - okay so what are we going to cover in
07:48 - today's webinar
07:50 - objectives today we are going to get
07:52 - familiar with the teachers homepage
07:54 - we're going to explore your code monkey
07:56 - classroom as well as the students
07:58 - access how to monitor students progress
08:00 - and what that will look like we'll also
08:02 - discuss what a self-paced
08:04 - lesson looks like versus a structured
08:05 - lesson for that remote learning
08:08 - experience and then we'll talk about
08:09 - next steps and then we'll be some time
08:11 - definitely for some q a
08:12 - we also pulled some of your questions
08:15 - from
08:16 - your webinar registration that we're
08:18 - going to
08:20 - also answer here at the end but like i
08:22 - said feel free to answer any of those
08:23 - questions along the way
08:26 - um in the chat box actually right now if
08:28 - you wouldn't mind
08:30 - um just go ahead and letting us know if
08:32 - you are going back to school remote if
08:34 - you're going back to school
08:36 - student facing or if you're doing a
08:37 - mixture of the both hybrid i've been
08:39 - talking to a lot of teachers that are
08:40 - doing all three so kind of however
08:42 - you're going back to school just kind of
08:43 - lets us know
08:44 - how to guide today's discussion a little
08:46 - bit more
08:48 - all right and while you guys are taking
08:49 - the time to do that we're going to go
08:51 - ahead and get into
08:53 - the teacher's homepage i've actually
08:54 - already logged in
08:56 - under myself if you
08:59 - are not sure how to do that you can log
09:01 - in using a single sign
09:03 - on and so i used my google sign on today
09:06 - to just go ahead and log in i personally
09:08 - like to use google i like for everything
09:09 - to be
09:10 - synchronous so that i don't have to
09:11 - remember 9000 passwords
09:13 - i'm sure you might be the same way as
09:14 - well so once you do that it's fairly
09:17 - easy to just
09:17 - get logged in every single time i did
09:19 - skip that step just in the interest of
09:21 - time but if you have questions with that
09:22 - we do have some really great help
09:23 - articles to help you along the way
09:25 - as soon as i log in here to the teacher
09:28 - home page
09:30 - what you'll see right away is it pops us
09:32 - out into
09:33 - or pops us right onto the my classrooms
09:35 - page the my classrooms page
09:39 - oh good lots of people are oh some are
09:42 - doing 100
09:43 - virtual it will be interesting to see
09:44 - how this year kind of progresses as well
09:46 - but once you're into the my classrooms
09:49 - page this is where you'll manage your
09:51 - classrooms and students accounts
09:52 - and we'll get back to that a little bit
09:54 - later as we dive in deeper
09:57 - on the upper right hand corner of the
09:58 - screen is where
10:00 - you will see basically if you think
10:02 - about it it's our it's a menu bar
10:04 - in the upper right hand corner is where
10:05 - you can access the ability to change our
10:07 - languages
10:09 - you will also see information about your
10:12 - account is located here
10:14 - our privacy policy we know that privacy
10:16 - is a really big
10:17 - concern just so everybody knows we are
10:19 - copa certified
10:20 - um and we are um in association with
10:23 - kidsafe so if anyone has any questions
10:24 - about privacy policy we're happy to send
10:26 - that information along as well
10:28 - our help center is located here and our
10:30 - help center are articles related
10:32 - to just anything that you might want to
10:34 - know code monkey related concepts
10:36 - courses
10:37 - there's a lot of wealth of information
10:38 - of resources that we've added there
10:40 - as well and then we have our blog if
10:42 - you're not following along on our blog
10:44 - we have lots of guest bloggers and we
10:45 - just try
10:46 - to talk about things that are relevant
10:48 - to you as a teacher
10:50 - and you can also contact us here pretty
10:52 - self-explanatory there
10:53 - on the left hand side what we see here
10:55 - is in my classroom page which is where
10:57 - we're on right now which is why it's
10:58 - highlighted in green
10:59 - the courses and this is where you will
11:02 - be able to
11:03 - access and complete the courses included
11:06 - in your subscriptions so this is also
11:08 - what your students will see when they
11:09 - log in so this is the main page that
11:11 - they'll actually be able to see
11:13 - and i'm just going to briefly kind of
11:16 - cover
11:16 - our courses that we have here on our
11:20 - page just to kind of talk about what the
11:21 - courses are
11:22 - and if you're not sure about how the
11:24 - courses work we do have the ability to
11:26 - go ahead and customize
11:27 - some scope and sequences for you for
11:29 - just some suggestions
11:30 - but i would always check out our
11:34 - course page here which i'm about to show
11:36 - you
11:40 - okay so here are our code monkey courses
11:42 - i'm just going to give you a brief
11:43 - rundown of them and then i'll show you
11:44 - where they're located so
11:46 - um right away starting in kindergarten
11:48 - we do like i mentioned before
11:49 - stan k through eight we actually go into
11:51 - the higher range we do actually have a
11:53 - lot of
11:53 - high schoolers actually using some of
11:54 - our courses in their
11:56 - um you know intro to computer science
11:58 - courses and things like that so it
12:00 - actually does run
12:01 - the gamut of that we like to think about
12:03 - coding as a language so sometimes you
12:05 - may
12:05 - start in different places no matter what
12:07 - grade level you are you might start if i
12:10 - start learning spanish and my students
12:11 - start learning spanish we're really
12:12 - going to start learning in the same
12:13 - place so just kind of keep that in mind
12:15 - as we go through
12:16 - the courses so code monkey junior is our
12:19 - younger student block based course
12:21 - it is really about computational
12:23 - thinking directionality it teaches the
12:25 - basics of sequencing and loops
12:27 - and if you're interested in learning
12:28 - more about our courses we do have a
12:29 - webinar next week that's going to
12:31 - dive deeper into all of those courses
12:32 - and exactly what they look like
12:34 - um then we have our beaver achiever
12:36 - course that's really geared for our
12:37 - first first and second graders it is a
12:39 - block based course as well but it does
12:41 - dive into the loops
12:42 - conditionals and then if and else
12:44 - statements then we have our coding
12:45 - adventure which we start uh text-based
12:47 - coding really early which is in third
12:49 - grade
12:50 - um some students will even start it
12:51 - younger if they've been coding for a
12:53 - really long time in the block based
12:55 - um so we use coffeescript and
12:56 - coffeescript is a shorter version of
12:58 - javascript and python it's really the
12:59 - meat and potatoes of the language
13:01 - it doesn't have a lot of syntax it's
13:03 - really going to be tying kids down it's
13:04 - hard for them to remember where comma
13:06 - goes or curly bracket so we really
13:07 - wanted to make
13:08 - the students have the skill set to
13:10 - really progress to those
13:11 - harder languages as they move through
13:14 - then we have
13:15 - a math course which is a supplemental it
13:18 - works through
13:18 - angles distances and multiplication so
13:22 - they're working with math focused
13:24 - concepts while coding
13:25 - so those are really great to have as
13:26 - well and then we also have a game
13:28 - builder course and that really
13:30 - is teaching the game mechanics in order
13:32 - for the students to then build
13:34 - and design their own games to share out
13:36 - and then
13:37 - one of our newer courses in addition to
13:39 - the beaver achiever is our
13:40 - banana tales and that is a python course
13:43 - it is set up similar to our coding
13:44 - adventure course
13:45 - it does work through the coding concepts
13:47 - and then our coding chat box course
13:50 - where students code
13:51 - in python to build a interactive chatbot
13:55 - so how you will see that is all the
13:56 - courses are located here
13:58 - all the courses that are available in
13:59 - your subscription will
14:01 - be available for you if you see anything
14:03 - that has a lock on it it just means that
14:05 - it's not part of your subscription
14:07 - and just a reminder and then down here
14:10 - at the bottom sorry i forgot to mention
14:11 - this down here at the bottom
14:13 - in our creativity section is where the
14:14 - students can actually build and create
14:16 - their own
14:17 - challenges so that's for extra
14:19 - enrichment extra practice which we'll
14:20 - talk about a little bit
14:22 - at the end but we'll dive deeper into
14:24 - that next week actually
14:26 - um so you can complete any of the
14:29 - courses like i mentioned
14:30 - that your students have access to and
14:32 - what you'll do is you'll actually just
14:33 - click on them as students they will
14:36 - not be able to i'll show you what they
14:38 - won't be able to do but everyone will
14:39 - start out the same
14:40 - so you will just mine says redo course
14:42 - so i'll just click on it and yours will
14:44 - say start coding so when you click on
14:45 - the course itself
14:48 - you can begin doing playing the course
14:51 - and then you'll kind of go through there
14:54 - you'll
14:54 - progress through the challenges the same
14:56 - as your students just something to note
14:57 - the students don't have the ability to
14:59 - skip around throughout the courses
15:01 - it is designed for them to learn
15:03 - linearly through the coding concepts so
15:05 - just kind of keep that in mind as a
15:07 - teacher you are able to
15:08 - move around and navigate the challenges
15:10 - because we want you
15:12 - to have more of a flexibility than to be
15:14 - tied down and have to do the whole
15:15 - coding course we want you to have those
15:17 - tools in your tool set to kind of move
15:19 - through there okay
15:21 - so that's how you would begin any of the
15:23 - coding courses
15:24 - like i mentioned in the tour to courses
15:26 - we will tour de france but to order
15:28 - courses
15:29 - we will dive deeper into what each one
15:31 - of those look like so i would recommend
15:32 - that as well
15:36 - next is on the left-hand side is our
15:38 - teacher resources
15:39 - under the under the teacher resources we
15:42 - have our teaching with coding adventure
15:45 - and that's where you'll be able to
15:46 - access our teaching i mean
15:48 - where it will take an in-depth look of
15:50 - the coding concepts that are covered in
15:52 - coding adventure part one
15:55 - you can also have access to all of our
15:57 - webinars current and past webinars that
15:59 - are coming up where you can register
16:00 - and find all those things which you were
16:02 - probably directed to to
16:04 - for today's webinar then underneath here
16:06 - is all of our fully guided lesson plans
16:09 - they have our standards aligned with all
16:12 - of them they are pdf versions of them
16:14 - and then briefly i'll just mention that
16:18 - well i'll go back to the lesson plans as
16:19 - well but that's where all the lesson
16:21 - plans are located
16:22 - and then here you'll have your how-to
16:24 - guide so these are short video tutorials
16:26 - we also have
16:27 - the access to the help center which you
16:29 - notice in the up here in the upper right
16:31 - hand corner
16:32 - the beginner's guide to code monkey is
16:33 - just a lot as a pdf version of
16:35 - everything
16:36 - kind of all located in one location um
16:39 - getting started videos and then we have
16:41 - just some short tutorials on things like
16:43 - how to upgrade your subscription
16:44 - archiving how to access certain
16:46 - challenges
16:47 - um they're really great and
16:48 - informational and
16:50 - in the honor of time short for you as
16:52 - well
16:55 - um and then also i'd like to mention we
16:57 - do have notes for the hour of code we
16:59 - also have these classroom resources
17:00 - which do have certificates for all of
17:02 - our courses there's also
17:04 - a media kit so if you want the cute
17:05 - images that we have as well uh classroom
17:07 - posters and then we do have some
17:08 - coloring pages which have been really
17:10 - good for like after school clubs and
17:11 - things like that are just
17:12 - things to fill the students time with um
17:14 - and then
17:15 - newest to here is the solution so this
17:18 - is where you can access all of the
17:20 - solutions it's kind of like a cheat
17:21 - sheet for you
17:22 - for all of the courses that we offer you
17:24 - can
17:26 - have the solution for everything so
17:28 - those are there for you those are the
17:30 - three star solutions for every single
17:32 - course that we offer
17:34 - and then moving right along on the left
17:36 - hand side is the my creations the my
17:38 - creations
17:39 - are if you use the challenge builder or
17:41 - the game builder
17:42 - to create your own challenges this is
17:44 - where your specific challenges will be
17:46 - located and the students will see this
17:47 - as well let's see the courses
17:49 - um the my creations and the discover
17:51 - page so under the my creations you'll
17:53 - see here
17:53 - are all of the um basically challenges
17:57 - that i've created
17:58 - within the lifetime of my account
18:00 - they're all located here
18:01 - they're located with games and
18:03 - challenges so those are just
18:04 - my personal creations that i've created
18:07 - then
18:08 - over here we have the discover page and
18:10 - the discover page is where
18:12 - students and teachers can publish
18:14 - publicly
18:15 - and when you publish a challenge
18:17 - publicly there are the community
18:19 - guidelines so we make sure that there's
18:20 - no student information that everything
18:22 - is very safe
18:23 - if we ever have questions about you know
18:25 - something questionable like a student
18:26 - adding a word that we might not think
18:28 - you know that could kind of cross a line
18:29 - we definitely don't approve them so i'll
18:31 - just let you know that as well
18:33 - so all of the students that have
18:34 - published those are there i do like to
18:37 - mention this this is just
18:39 - something for teachers to know that
18:41 - basically when the students do publish
18:43 - to the discover it makes a copy of their
18:44 - challenge so they can't go back through
18:46 - and try to change it
18:48 - you can also remix oops excuse me once
18:50 - you click on the game
18:52 - itself you can also remix those games as
18:54 - well
18:55 - and so it will also let you know that
18:57 - the students have remixed those games so
18:58 - just some little tidbits to kind of keep
19:00 - in mind as you're going through
19:03 - then moving on we do have um
19:06 - the help center is also located here and
19:09 - i'll just briefly
19:11 - just talk about that so we do have our
19:13 - getting started for teachers classroom
19:15 - dashboard just really any questions that
19:17 - you
19:17 - that you would like to have most of them
19:19 - have videos attached or
19:21 - just really descriptive for questions
19:23 - that you may have so we always recommend
19:25 - checking that out first
19:33 - okay so now we are going to move on if
19:36 - you have any questions about that part
19:38 - you can go ahead and
19:40 - let me know so we just talked about how
19:42 - you get to log in
19:45 - and then now we're going to actually go
19:48 - into the code monkey classroom itself
19:50 - and talk about students access so now
19:52 - we're going to do the steps to create a
19:53 - classroom
19:54 - how to set up a student account
19:56 - continuing with a previous
19:58 - code monkey classroom and then adding
20:00 - co-teacher so we're going to kind of
20:01 - walk through all of this part as far as
20:04 - setup goes so the first steps
20:07 - when for setting up your new
20:10 - subscription
20:10 - whether you have a trial or a purchase a
20:13 - purchased
20:15 - trial that you've purchased or a
20:17 - purchase subscription
20:18 - that how you're going to go about this
20:20 - is you're going to be populated
20:22 - right you know you'll be put right into
20:23 - the my classrooms page and on the my
20:25 - classrooms page what you'll do is you'll
20:27 - create
20:28 - a classroom so when you click here on
20:29 - the on the classroom you can do two
20:31 - things
20:32 - so you can create a new classroom
20:36 - and add the name of the classroom which
20:38 - you would like to name it and just make
20:40 - sure you select the
20:41 - appropriate subscription or new to us as
20:44 - you can import from google classroom so
20:46 - when you connect to the google classroom
20:48 - it will go ahead and pull your students
20:50 - from the google classroom right into
20:52 - code monkey here into the code monkey
20:55 - classroom so you don't have to do
20:56 - giving them a class code or any of that
20:58 - kind of thing so it just creates that
20:59 - seamless
21:00 - transition for students to do that
21:03 - so i actually want to show you that
21:06 - itself so i have i'm going to share with
21:08 - you
21:09 - a another screen so i can show you what
21:10 - that will look like
21:12 - when you do do the when you do create
21:17 - with a google classroom because i know
21:18 - that's a
21:19 - big question right now especially with
21:20 - the learning management so when i create
21:22 - a classroom here
21:23 - i can just import from google and the
21:25 - classroom that i have here is named
21:26 - monday
21:27 - i make sure i have it attached the
21:28 - correct subscription and then i create
21:30 - my classroom
21:32 - some things to note here is that you
21:34 - can't actually edit the students names
21:35 - once they're populated but everything is
21:37 - completely
21:37 - coppa compliant and what you'll see is
21:39 - that i don't have a class code that's
21:41 - here because
21:42 - it's already made i don't need to share
21:43 - a class code or create anything with
21:45 - them
21:45 - as well okay so that is
21:48 - that part of the classroom
21:53 - creating a classroom and so when i click
21:54 - onto it all those students will be
21:56 - populated which we'll show you here in
21:58 - just a moment
21:59 - okay so now that we've taken a look at
22:01 - importing the google classroom which is
22:03 - one of my favorite
22:04 - things to do make my life a little bit
22:06 - easier
22:08 - um we can also so i've created that
22:12 - so let's create our classroom so i'll
22:14 - just name it
22:16 - webinar for today and i make sure i
22:18 - attach it to my correct subscription and
22:20 - then when i create the classroom it will
22:21 - populate here you see i have a lot of
22:23 - classrooms created
22:24 - right now i don't have any students in
22:26 - my classroom i do have a class code i
22:28 - can see which subscription
22:29 - it's attached to i can also edit this i
22:32 - can also
22:33 - archive this which just means it will no
22:35 - longer appear on my screen
22:37 - but the data will still remain in the
22:39 - classroom
22:40 - and then if i want to upgrade to a
22:41 - subscription is where i would do that as
22:43 - well
22:44 - so now that we are we've created our
22:47 - classroom let's go ahead and look at
22:48 - what it looks like to create a student
22:50 - account because that's what you all want
22:52 - to know is how to
22:53 - how do we even create our student
22:54 - accounts so
22:56 - as we can see here there are no students
22:58 - in my classroom so i'm going to click
23:00 - create student account and
23:03 - i can add a student here so what i do is
23:06 - i add the student i can share the class
23:07 - code if i want
23:08 - here i can also do a bulk upload so a
23:12 - bulk upload means that i have 50
23:14 - students in my classroom and i want to
23:15 - upload the 50 students
23:17 - there is a csv file that it will give
23:19 - you as an example
23:21 - and we just recommend anytime you're
23:23 - creating any type of student information
23:25 - is that you're just
23:26 - keeping it you know with their first
23:27 - name and their lesson initially you're
23:29 - not doing anything
23:30 - as far as sharing extra information that
23:32 - doesn't need to be shared
23:34 - um they are really um hyping up privacy
23:36 - right now i've heard that from a lot of
23:38 - teachers
23:39 - that they've been asking a lot of
23:40 - questions about privacy and doing
23:41 - privacy checks so i would just really
23:43 - recommend that you're making sure that
23:44 - you are
23:45 - doing your part to keep your students
23:47 - information safe as well because we do
23:48 - our part to not collect information so
23:51 - we we hope that you do the same so then
23:53 - i can also create an account so i can
23:54 - put a display name if i want or
23:56 - i can just put um
24:00 - let's just say i create my student
24:02 - account here and then i create my
24:03 - password
24:04 - try to keep the password something that
24:05 - the students can remember
24:07 - and then what i do is i click create and
24:10 - once i do it tells me that the user has
24:11 - been successfully created
24:13 - and now they're going to be in my
24:15 - classroom now that i have a student in
24:17 - my classroom i can do
24:19 - a couple um
24:23 - a couple of different things here and
24:25 - what i can do is i can actually move
24:28 - let's say this is an old classroom from
24:30 - another location ooh actually
24:32 - let's talk about this so you can print
24:33 - student login cards if you would like
24:35 - here that's obviously more
24:36 - tactile for the students i know we're
24:38 - really trying to eliminate the use of
24:39 - extra papers and different things like
24:41 - that
24:41 - or you can do a classroom direct login
24:44 - url
24:45 - and so what you do is you embed this in
24:47 - your web page you click on it the
24:48 - students will have a picture
24:50 - and they'll just click on their picture
24:51 - and they'll add their
24:54 - their password and so that's just there
24:56 - if the students are single sign-on users
24:58 - however if they are
24:59 - using a google classroom or even just a
25:03 - google login
25:04 - we would want to stay away from doing
25:06 - this direct login url that's just a few
25:08 - they're not single sign-on associated
25:12 - um okay so we can also so here what i
25:15 - can do is let's say this is a really old
25:17 - classroom and i want to move them to
25:19 - uh another classroom i can either
25:21 - archive this whole classroom all at once
25:23 - really quickly
25:24 - or i can move them to a new classroom
25:26 - you can also do the same here with each
25:28 - of the students
25:30 - once you archive a student they will
25:33 - be removed from your classroom but their
25:35 - data will remain
25:37 - and you can also move them like i
25:39 - mentioned to another classroom so they
25:41 - move you know different
25:42 - to another classroom and so you just
25:43 - move them and so there's they're still
25:45 - there keeping all of their data
25:47 - and then you can also delete a student
25:49 - you can notice here that i can delete
25:50 - this student only because there is no
25:52 - student progress so that's just
25:53 - something to keep in mind once a student
25:55 - has
25:56 - logged in and began you can no longer
25:58 - remove them so they do occupy a seat
26:00 - on that um brooke that's a great
26:04 - question and i think um
26:06 - a member of my team will actually answer
26:08 - that and then i'll also answer that
26:09 - question at the end because that's a
26:10 - really good question for us as well
26:12 - um okay so we have um talked about the
26:15 - student list here and i just want to
26:17 - mention that if you have a co-teacher
26:19 - in your classroom that you are wanting
26:22 - to maybe your team teaching
26:23 - you can actually actually add the
26:26 - teacher here and send them an
26:27 - invitation and then they will have the
26:30 - ability to have the same level of access
26:32 - to that classroom as you do
26:34 - all right um i'll go back to
26:37 - how to upgrade a subscription in just a
26:39 - minute but let's talk about
26:41 - um now that we're in the student list
26:42 - we've created a student
26:44 - um we're going to talk about how to
26:46 - assign courses and then i'll go back to
26:48 - the progress
26:49 - and some of the pieces that you probably
26:51 - want to know most of all
26:52 - so here in the courses tab remember i'm
26:54 - in a classroom
26:56 - and now i'm on the courses tab for that
26:58 - specific classroom
27:00 - i can go ahead and assign the courses
27:02 - any classroom that does
27:04 - any corset is not assigned to the
27:06 - classroom
27:07 - is going to be green and anything that
27:10 - is already assigned is grayed out
27:12 - so that you know that it's there so i
27:14 - can just quickly click on it
27:15 - and it'll say it's unassigned and i can
27:17 - click on it again and assign so it's
27:18 - fairly easy to assign
27:20 - unassigned courses to your students um
27:23 - something that i do want to know we do
27:24 - get a lot of questions about this so
27:26 - i'll just bring it i feel like now is a
27:27 - good time to bring it up
27:29 - if you have all of the coding adventure
27:31 - courses assigned to your students or all
27:33 - of the banana tales or all of the beaver
27:34 - achiever anything that has a three
27:37 - has a succession of courses together so
27:39 - like coding adventure beaver achiever
27:41 - banana tales
27:43 - even if this all of the courses are
27:44 - assigned the students do still have to
27:46 - work linearly through those concepts and
27:48 - they'll unlock as they go along
27:49 - so i just would like to mention that as
27:52 - well
27:56 - okay so now that we have assigned
28:00 - courses
28:02 - um and we talked about setting up a
28:05 - student account and we've talked about
28:07 - adding teachers to the co-teachers i
28:10 - want to talk about how to monitor
28:11 - monitor student progress
28:14 - and our gradebook we'll also talk about
28:15 - that as well so monitoring student
28:17 - progress
28:18 - is um obviously important it's important
28:21 - for everyone to kind of know where their
28:22 - students are as well
28:24 - so let me just go ahead and get into a
28:25 - classroom that has some student data in
28:27 - it
28:28 - and we can talk about some different
28:31 - components that are going to be
28:32 - important to kind of investigate as we
28:34 - go along
28:35 - so here i am in my student progress page
28:37 - all of the courses have their own
28:40 - basically progress tables for the course
28:42 - so let's just click on our coding
28:44 - adventure course
28:46 - what we can see here is that i can sort
28:48 - the students
28:49 - i can see how far the students have
28:51 - progressed here
28:54 - along the um right here on the left-hand
28:57 - side where the students names are where
28:58 - the student name list is i can also sort
29:00 - by student
29:01 - progress and so when i do that i'm able
29:04 - to see
29:04 - you know the top the students at the top
29:07 - that have the most progress
29:09 - are going to be there and then it's
29:10 - going to you know go down
29:13 - as it goes through so we can see the
29:14 - ones with the least amount of progress
29:15 - are going to be at the bottom
29:18 - um some also things to note here is in
29:20 - our coding adventure course
29:21 - beaver achiever banana tales most of our
29:23 - courses except for the
29:26 - game design course all have three star
29:28 - solutions so three star solution is the
29:30 - shortest most concise code
29:31 - a two star means that the student took
29:33 - an extra step something that
29:36 - what would have been there and one star
29:38 - means that the student was able to
29:39 - collect that banana but i like to say
29:41 - that they're on the struggle rust
29:42 - probably didn't really understand the
29:43 - concept that was there took a lot of
29:45 - extra steps that were not needed
29:47 - so great creates really good
29:48 - conversational pieces
29:51 - so what you can see here is that i can
29:53 - sort by sort of by my student progress
29:56 - and i can see that
29:56 - in this specific challenge here
29:58 - challenge 16.
30:00 - um just so you know all of these numbers
30:02 - along the top are
30:03 - the solutions as well so you can access
30:06 - them
30:07 - on the teacher resource page or you can
30:10 - do this
30:10 - specifically in the progress page it
30:11 - does report live
30:14 - so as the students are working it is
30:16 - populating into
30:18 - the progress page here for you but let's
30:20 - say i have a student who is what i like
30:22 - to call the struggle blesser i click on
30:24 - this
30:24 - star here i'm able to see how many times
30:27 - this student attempted the challenge and
30:28 - we can see that the student attempted
30:30 - this challenge four times
30:31 - i'm going to click on it and when i do
30:33 - it gives me a real life animation
30:36 - it gives me their exact solution in how
30:37 - they solved it so i'm able to see it in
30:39 - real time
30:39 - exactly how they solved it and it also
30:41 - pulls up anonymously
30:42 - for some really good conversation for
30:45 - you to have
30:46 - as well it also it's not like a writing
30:49 - sample where you pull with a writing
30:50 - simply cut off their name and you put it
30:52 - up there and everyone knows that
30:53 - person's writing so this way it gives a
30:55 - really anonymous
30:57 - um you know authentic conversation to
30:59 - have and learning to have with your
31:01 - students
31:02 - um something else to kind of mention too
31:05 - is that your teacher solutions when you
31:07 - pull them up they actually won't say
31:08 - teach your solution across the top so
31:10 - you can also share those two
31:12 - um if you're trying to compare some
31:13 - different solutions something else to
31:15 - note here is that
31:16 - every single star that is reported back
31:18 - to here
31:19 - in this in this page every single one of
31:22 - them contains a solution
31:23 - all of them live here in this page so
31:26 - you can always click on any of them and
31:28 - kind of see
31:29 - when they did that if you're looking for
31:30 - something that's a little bit more
31:32 - robust maybe you want to see a little
31:34 - bit more information you can export that
31:35 - data to a csv file and it will really
31:37 - break it down for you exactly how they
31:39 - did it and the file can be quite large
31:41 - so it does
31:43 - give some really detailed information
31:45 - there
31:47 - for coding adventure we do have a skill
31:49 - mode so that's deeper dive into the
31:51 - coding concepts that are there
31:53 - as you notice here each of these this
31:56 - has the concepts actually here in the
31:57 - gradebook and that does match
31:59 - the courses themselves so just something
32:01 - to note there too and those
32:03 - solutions are there for you as well as
32:05 - the student solutions
32:06 - there um we can also limit the student
32:09 - progress so i currently have them
32:11 - limited i actually um
32:13 - have some younger siblings and they're
32:15 - actually working in this page right now
32:17 - um so i have them limited because i'm
32:20 - really trying to keep track of what
32:21 - they're doing and where they are so
32:23 - basically what that means when i've
32:24 - limited a student's progress
32:26 - as you can see here they are actually
32:28 - not able to progress
32:29 - beyond challenge number 20. um
32:32 - so just to kind of keep that in mind
32:34 - because you know what happens they go
32:36 - through they complete the challenges
32:37 - before you're ready for them to complete
32:39 - and this is just a way for you to kind
32:40 - of keep everyone all together if you
32:42 - want to unlock it
32:43 - obviously it's up to your discretion you
32:44 - are the teacher you know what's best
32:46 - so that's why we give you the
32:48 - flexibility to kind of have that as well
32:51 - and now you see i've unlocked it i just
32:53 - clicked on the limit progress i clicked
32:55 - free play
32:56 - and i was able to unlock all of the
32:57 - challenges we're going to talk about
33:00 - lesson modes
33:00 - in just a moment but you can also limit
33:03 - the progress
33:04 - based on the last lesson that was taught
33:07 - so there's also that
33:08 - a little bit more flexibility there as
33:10 - far as that goes so i'm just going to go
33:11 - ahead and limit this back up here
33:13 - just so they don't progress beyond where
33:15 - i want them to go
33:17 - i'll probably forget later and then what
33:19 - i can also do
33:20 - in our coding adventure course is turn
33:22 - on or off super hints so this is really
33:24 - good especially in your remote learning
33:27 - environment is that this will give
33:29 - students an extra set of hints there's
33:31 - always hints
33:32 - within our platform but this will give
33:34 - us
33:35 - this will give the students some extra
33:36 - hints and i'll show you this
33:38 - in just a minute but you can turn it on
33:39 - or turn it off here as well
33:43 - um okay so now let's go ahead and we've
33:46 - talked about the progress tab
33:47 - and what each of the stars mean how to
33:49 - limit we talked about the solutions and
33:51 - what that looks like
33:52 - next we're going to talk about the grade
33:54 - book so code monkey
33:56 - does this really wonderful thing and i
33:58 - know when i was teaching in the
33:59 - classroom i always
34:00 - um wanted to
34:03 - know that andrea that's a really great
34:05 - question i'm actually going to um
34:07 - answer that in just a second um
34:10 - so here in the grade book it's going to
34:13 - you have a couple of two different
34:15 - choices here this is automatically
34:16 - graded for you so always makes your life
34:18 - a little bit easier you can change it
34:19 - from letters numbers and percentages
34:21 - and then you can also calculate it
34:23 - between the different coding concepts
34:24 - you have
34:25 - every there is a gradebook for every
34:27 - single course within your subscription
34:30 - that you have available to you you can
34:32 - also export that as a csv file
34:35 - and that's just something to know at the
34:37 - bottom here of the page it will tell you
34:39 - how far the students have progressed
34:41 - through the challenges
34:42 - average score on assessment so in the
34:44 - coding adventure course itself there are
34:46 - built-in assessment challenges
34:48 - and so that is reporting the score for
34:50 - that there
34:51 - also there are the challenges by
34:53 - difficulty so the
34:54 - more students that struggle with a
34:56 - specific challenge the larger these
34:58 - circles become
34:59 - when you click on these circles
35:00 - themselves it pulls up the challenge so
35:02 - you can solve and work through it
35:03 - together so another place to
35:05 - have more student data and to have that
35:07 - student deep dive of data to really
35:09 - drive your instruction
35:13 - and then something that's brand brand
35:15 - new to us is
35:16 - this proficiency table so it's kind of
35:18 - hidden here
35:19 - you might quickly overlook it if you
35:21 - didn't know it was there but here is the
35:23 - proficiency
35:24 - table that we just recently added so we
35:26 - have
35:27 - four different levels here we have a
35:29 - novice we have a beginner
35:30 - intermediate and advanced and this is
35:32 - progress within every single code monkey
35:34 - course
35:35 - and the subjects that are covered there
35:38 - the coding concepts
35:39 - they're not subjects but coding concepts
35:42 - and talia just
35:43 - put a really great article for you to
35:44 - read up to for later
35:47 - but we can see the coding concepts that
35:48 - are covered here and then we can see
35:50 - exactly how the students um have done
35:52 - within each of the coding concepts
35:54 - throughout
35:54 - all of the courses so this tells you how
35:56 - proficient they are within the concepts
35:58 - themselves
36:00 - so that's just something that's new to
36:03 - us brand new there
36:07 - okay so now we have talked about the
36:10 - gradebook and the proficiency tab
36:12 - and then and just really quickly i do
36:14 - want to mention the
36:15 - showroom and then i'll talk about these
36:16 - lessons here
36:19 - so in the showroom this is when the
36:21 - students have created
36:22 - and built their own challenges they will
36:26 - actually um be able to
36:29 - um they'll populate here for you so
36:31 - you'll be able to see them so you have
36:33 - the
36:33 - access to the games and the challenges
36:36 - and then there's some ways that you can
36:37 - share them publicly with you know
36:39 - parents for that extra
36:40 - deep dive for that extra buy-in for them
36:43 - to kind of play and
36:44 - interact with that as well um you can
36:46 - also disable
36:47 - the discover here and so that means that
36:50 - when you disable it the students cannot
36:52 - share to the discover and so that's kind
36:53 - of just giving you a little bit more
36:55 - discretion if you would like as well
36:58 - um okay so now let's talk about
37:02 - one of my favorites which is the lessons
37:04 - tab i will mention that the lessons
37:05 - right now are currently only available
37:07 - for the coding adventure course
37:08 - just the lesson um feature here
37:12 - we obviously all the lesson plans are
37:14 - still available but this specific one is
37:16 - only for the coding adventure course
37:18 - as of right now so you select a specific
37:20 - coding adventure course what happens is
37:22 - that this is broken up exactly how our
37:24 - lesson plans are so all of our lesson
37:26 - plans are
37:27 - set up in the exact same manner there is
37:28 - an intro which is an unplugged activity
37:31 - then you have or some kind of the
37:32 - introduction to the coding concept that
37:34 - the students are working on
37:36 - then you have play time so that's the
37:37 - chance where students are then working
37:39 - through the challenges themselves
37:41 - um you can assign specific challenges
37:42 - within the lesson itself here which is
37:45 - really great
37:46 - um and then you have debris so usually
37:47 - it's a reflection or sometimes you're
37:49 - doing a walk through
37:50 - or sometimes even the play time you
37:52 - might do a walkthrough so all of those
37:53 - are going to be here for you as well
37:55 - and then you can have access to those
37:58 - specific
37:58 - challenges that are there within the
38:00 - lesson so you're not having to navigate
38:02 - throughout 9000 screens everything is
38:04 - right here located for you
38:06 - when you begin the lesson what happens
38:08 - is the students get a big lock on their
38:10 - screen
38:11 - and not just a lock on the course is a
38:12 - big lock on their screen saying that
38:14 - they cannot progress
38:15 - until you've ended the lesson so that
38:16 - creates
38:19 - the ability to kind of lock them down a
38:20 - little bit more and keep them with you
38:21 - while you
38:22 - work on the lesson itself the specific
38:24 - lesson plan is located here for that
38:26 - specific lesson
38:28 - and it's going to have everything on it
38:30 - the objectives overall what are you
38:32 - going to be working on
38:33 - the specific components so those are
38:35 - like the coding concepts that you're
38:36 - going to be working on
38:37 - um what are you going to be working on a
38:39 - variable and an assignment variable
38:42 - and then the standards that are
38:44 - addressed which i'll discuss this a
38:46 - little bit more but we do have common
38:47 - core alignment we also have cst
38:49 - alignment and we do have specific state
38:50 - alignment so if you're looking for that
38:52 - we can talk about that also
38:54 - um and then that's just how the lesson
38:55 - plan is there play time
38:57 - intro debrief okay um all right
39:02 - now let me go back here once i mark the
39:05 - i can do two things i can end the lesson
39:08 - or i can mark it as complete once i mark
39:10 - it as complete
39:11 - that means that the lesson has now ended
39:13 - we also for coding adventure i'll show
39:15 - you where the reference cards are for
39:16 - the other ones but we do have a
39:18 - reference card that just lets them know
39:20 - what each of the buttons mean
39:22 - just a reminder it's a really good
39:24 - visual reminder for students
39:28 - and then we also have a character review
39:30 - card this character review card is
39:32 - really important when you're working
39:33 - through the challenge builder because as
39:35 - the students progress
39:36 - through the um
39:39 - through the courses or through the
39:41 - through the course itself the more
39:43 - characters and objects unlock so this
39:45 - will let you know
39:46 - when those characters are going to be
39:47 - unlocked like in 55 i know i can now
39:49 - introduce a beaver
39:50 - and then in 66 i can now work with the
39:52 - crocodile so we do get a lot of
39:54 - questions sometimes surrounding that
39:56 - so just and some information for you to
39:58 - have as well
40:00 - okay so now we've worked through all the
40:02 - features of
40:04 - the classroom page itself um
40:07 - so i noticed there's been some really
40:09 - good questions
40:13 - about
40:18 - somebody asked i just want to stop and
40:20 - ask this question because i think it's a
40:21 - very good question
40:22 - are grades available per class and
40:24 - individuals they are available they're
40:26 - actually per individual
40:28 - it's not specific to to the course
40:33 - itself so we can see here that this
40:36 - student a b monkey we can see exactly
40:39 - how they scored
40:40 - obviously it's an overall gradebook for
40:42 - the class but they are individual grades
40:44 - so we don't just pull like a whole class
40:46 - grade like everyone got a b
40:48 - um but there is a usage report that you
40:50 - can actually pull so i can show you i'll
40:51 - show you
40:52 - that in just a uh just a quick moment
40:55 - and then i'll just answer there's one
40:58 - more question too
41:01 - um that i would like to answer too so
41:04 - um unplugged activities are available
41:08 - in the resources when you subscribe that
41:10 - is correct so
41:12 - basically are they available for you so
41:14 - as soon as you subscribe to
41:16 - a code monkey subscription all of those
41:18 - features are basically unlocked for you
41:20 - so you have available to
41:21 - all of the lesson plans so they're not
41:23 - like locked down for you
41:24 - at all um so those will just be
41:27 - available for you and they're always in
41:29 - in those lesson plans so if you have
41:30 - questions finding those we can kind of
41:31 - help you also on the blog there's some
41:33 - really great
41:34 - articles about some unplugged activities
41:36 - that you can do and we're going to
41:37 - actually talk about that here
41:38 - in just a few moments i'm just running
41:41 - quickly i can notice out of time so i
41:42 - just want to make sure i'm
41:43 - honoring that amy had a really good
41:46 - question too when you mark
41:48 - com when you mark it complete can a
41:50 - student not
41:51 - access that lesson any longer in case
41:54 - they didn't finish or miss a lesson
41:56 - um actually that is that is a really
41:59 - good question
42:00 - when you are in lesson mode itself
42:03 - basically
42:03 - um what happens is that when you begin
42:06 - this lesson the students can
42:07 - only have access to those challenges so
42:10 - they are only working through
42:12 - the specific challenges and as i hover
42:14 - over you can see
42:15 - it's probably quite small for you but
42:16 - you can see that they are the specific
42:18 - challenges that are related to
42:20 - lessons so they can only have access to
42:22 - that so once you end it then it opens
42:24 - back up to wherever they have progressed
42:26 - through
42:27 - um so then i would recommend making sure
42:29 - that you have that limit progress button
42:31 - on or something like that so if they
42:32 - miss it which happens you know
42:34 - kids are absent and they miss lessons
42:35 - and whatever then that way they're still
42:38 - able to catch up and
42:39 - basically be on the same page but this
42:40 - also gives the ability for those
42:42 - students who
42:43 - are farther behind to be able to work
42:45 - through the same challenges that you're
42:47 - working through together during your
42:48 - lesson
42:49 - so just some differentiation pieces
42:50 - there
42:53 - okay so we talked about monitoring
42:55 - student progress now we're going to talk
42:57 - a little bit
42:58 - about self-paced lessons versus
43:01 - structured lessons so
43:05 - um basically when we're talking about
43:08 - self-paced we're basically talking about
43:10 - um you know the students are at home
43:12 - they're not with you
43:13 - live um so what you can do is you can
43:16 - assign the specific courses
43:18 - you can give students you know super
43:19 - hints which we talked about so basically
43:21 - what happens is gordo
43:22 - has this light bulb here for like an
43:24 - extra um
43:26 - he has he has a light bulb here and so
43:28 - when he has a super hit you'll click on
43:30 - it
43:30 - um the beaver achiever course also does
43:32 - the same thing where they have a hint
43:33 - you can see exactly the code
43:36 - it's not the answer but it gets them
43:38 - closer to the answer
43:41 - oops excuse me then you can also review
43:44 - if you're not there with the students
43:45 - you know because you're doing remote
43:47 - learning or
43:48 - maybe they're just not even with you you
43:50 - can review the previous challenges so i
43:51 - always recommend for students who are
43:53 - struggle bussing it
43:55 - um to go back to previous challenges and
43:57 - play those previous challenges
43:59 - sometimes you just need a refresher and
44:01 - just going through it one time
44:02 - you know if i only learned how to ride
44:05 - my bike one time i would never be very
44:06 - good sometimes sometimes you have to go
44:08 - back
44:08 - and practice um just doing what it is
44:12 - and
44:12 - and coding is just not a natural concept
44:14 - right like i don't come out of the womb
44:16 - knowing how to program
44:17 - so um the students don't either so just
44:19 - encouraging them to go back to play
44:20 - those previous challenges and just
44:22 - making sure that they read the
44:23 - instructions this is really important
44:25 - for our game builder courses
44:27 - as well as our coding chatbot courses
44:29 - it's they're pretty text heavy so
44:31 - it's really important for them to read
44:32 - those instructions or clicking on
44:34 - just reading instructions in general i
44:36 - you all are teachers so you know exactly
44:39 - um you know exactly how
44:42 - that goes okay um and then if you
44:45 - also can provide them with the solution
44:47 - if they want or really having them ask a
44:49 - friend so i always recommend
44:51 - collaborating
44:52 - fostering that collaboration is going to
44:54 - be key because you don't want teachers
44:56 - you don't want students copy and pasting
44:57 - their answers um to each other
45:00 - and then sometimes you might have to
45:01 - provide them with a solution
45:03 - um i do think i was just listening to a
45:05 - podcast from marina bears if you don't
45:07 - know who she is she
45:08 - was one of the she works with scratch
45:10 - and as the developer
45:11 - is the main person who developed scratch
45:13 - jr and she was talking about
45:15 - you know what is the difference between
45:16 - having a teacher and having a student
45:18 - just code at home and the and the
45:20 - missing component of all of it is you
45:22 - you're the missing piece
45:24 - and so they really need you to kind of
45:25 - help them work through the thinking
45:27 - you know sometimes it's just thinking
45:29 - out loud of different things so
45:31 - those are just possibilities so i
45:32 - encourage that communication happen
45:34 - we'll talk about what that communication
45:36 - could look like
45:37 - um and then the difference and then a
45:39 - structured lesson so
45:40 - a structured lesson is obviously working
45:42 - through the lessons within coding
45:44 - adventure
45:44 - assigning them a course making sure you
45:46 - monitor the progress
45:48 - limit within the courses you know really
45:50 - using the lesson feature or just at
45:52 - least limiting them
45:54 - um and then that way you guys you can
45:56 - even limit them to zero so they can't
45:57 - see it when you're doing the lesson if
45:59 - you're working in another course
46:01 - and then when you're ready then you give
46:02 - them back the ability to kind of
46:04 - progress through the challenges so
46:07 - there's just a lot of flexibility to do
46:08 - that and if you're not sure about it
46:10 - you can always ask us a member of the
46:12 - team we're happy to help walk you
46:14 - through that as well but
46:15 - um i i personally like structured
46:17 - lessons just me i really don't like my
46:19 - students to progress through
46:21 - i don't feel like they get as much of a
46:23 - depth of knowledge
46:25 - if they are not working together with us
46:27 - and having that communication so just
46:28 - fostering that communication and
46:29 - collaboration is a really big piece
46:31 - especially with coding
46:34 - um okay so um
46:38 - we talked about that so let's talk about
46:40 - some like next steps or some different
46:42 - things that you can do
46:43 - so um we recently just did a challenge
46:46 - builder competition
46:47 - that page still lives at the bottom
46:49 - footer of the codemonkey.com page you
46:51 - can see it there
46:53 - but i recommend the students really
46:55 - creating and building their own
46:56 - challenging
46:57 - challenges for mastery and one for
46:59 - creativity it can get really boring just
47:00 - going through
47:01 - the concepts although code monkey's
47:03 - quite fun it's not typical that somebody
47:05 - would say it's boring but
47:06 - um this is just a really good way to
47:08 - create extra engagement the students can
47:10 - share out their challenges and play them
47:12 - with each other and it's also a good way
47:14 - to do
47:14 - uh feedback loops so having the students
47:17 - you know maybe they don't know exactly
47:19 - which student created that challenge and
47:20 - you give them the challenge
47:22 - and they complete it and maybe they give
47:23 - some code commenting or some different
47:25 - ways to kind of work through the
47:26 - thinking you know the computational
47:28 - thinking model
47:29 - or even the engineering design process
47:31 - are really good strategies to use
47:33 - when building and creating your own
47:34 - challenges
47:36 - you can also connect it to other
47:38 - disciplines so this is
47:39 - um one of the challenges that we got um
47:43 - from from the challenge builder
47:45 - competition that we recently did
47:47 - and this was um not something that we
47:50 - told the students to do we just had a
47:51 - specif
47:52 - a few rules for them to kind of complete
47:53 - so if you want those guidelines those
47:55 - are there
47:56 - um but he basically tells a
47:59 - story oh of course
48:04 - okay well i'll pull that up here in just
48:06 - a moment but basically he tells a story
48:07 - so he
48:08 - actually interacts here with these
48:09 - characters so there is a save function
48:12 - um within the coding adventure course
48:14 - and so he turns to this
48:15 - go and i'll pull this up in just a
48:17 - couple minutes i don't know why it's not
48:18 - playing up right now but
48:19 - um so he turns to the monkey and the
48:21 - monkey turns to the goat and he talks to
48:22 - them about moving and then the
48:24 - then the beaver has to move so he can
48:26 - get across basically when you progress
48:28 - through these challenges the bear and
48:29 - the tiger are both hungry for both the
48:31 - monkey and the goat so they want to eat
48:32 - him
48:33 - so there's some different functions and
48:35 - things that progress through there so
48:36 - there's a lot of different ways to use
48:38 - storytelling
48:39 - um even a math concept like what's two
48:41 - plus two
48:42 - and then they go through and they move
48:44 - him if he gets the correct answer you
48:45 - know just
48:46 - just doing some if statements and
48:48 - working in some different
48:49 - um interdisciplinary um you know
48:53 - content areas that are really important
48:55 - for that
48:56 - um and then the lesson plans there are
48:58 - some really great activities from the
49:00 - lesson plans themselves which i'm going
49:02 - to come back to this page here
49:03 - but i personally really love to use the
49:05 - code code
49:06 - monkey junior lesson plans i know this
49:09 - is for the younger kids but it's really
49:11 - about the computational thinking which
49:12 - is really what you want to have happen
49:14 - i personally just am a big big fan of
49:17 - these lesson plans and the unplugged
49:19 - activities that they have
49:20 - here um so inside of this so on this
49:24 - second lesson plan that's in here it has
49:26 - instructional cards
49:28 - that you basically print out so what i
49:30 - used to do
49:31 - was i would um you know have the
49:34 - students create cards or you can have
49:36 - them do like a google slide and you
49:38 - kind of have like a grid and have the
49:40 - students basically program
49:42 - an object or you know you can have the
49:44 - students do this offline where they come
49:46 - up with their own activity
49:47 - and they can record it and send it to
49:49 - you there's lots of different variations
49:51 - that you can do with these unplugged
49:52 - activities which we'll talk more
49:54 - in the uh intro and sorry in the tour de
49:57 - courses we can talk
49:58 - a little bit more about that as well but
49:59 - these lesson plans are really really
50:01 - great
50:02 - um for working with students and i
50:04 - really like to use them as an opener to
50:06 - my coding courses i just
50:07 - i just am obsessed with using them
50:09 - because i think it gets kids moving and
50:12 - even if you're doing remote learning you
50:14 - can do unplugged activities
50:17 - without being directly in front of the
50:19 - code monkey platform together so you can
50:21 - utilize
50:22 - these resources so i'd recommend just
50:24 - using those
50:25 - they're one of my favorite things to do
50:29 - and then the next thing is just kind of
50:30 - communicating with your students
50:32 - creating those open feedback loops
50:34 - the biggest part about being a computer
50:36 - programmer
50:37 - is that there's a lot of failure that's
50:39 - involved with computer programming if
50:40 - you talk to anyone
50:41 - computer programming who's been on a
50:43 - sprint meaning they've worked multiple
50:44 - hours and days on a project
50:46 - um a lot of times a syntax error will
50:49 - happen or they need to you know
50:51 - collaborate but just creating those
50:52 - feedback loops we don't have that
50:54 - specifically built into the platform but
50:56 - i have seen some teachers do some really
50:58 - great things in google classroom or
50:59 - canva or
51:00 - whatever it is that you're kind of using
51:01 - with the students to kind of communicate
51:03 - about that and have them
51:05 - communicate their thinking because the
51:08 - deeper that they can go within their
51:09 - thinking you know being able to teach
51:10 - something creates a
51:12 - greater mastery of a concept
51:16 - um something that we did want to mention
51:18 - just for some different things as far as
51:20 - tips for communication
51:21 - i took this from a teach with technology
51:23 - facebook group
51:24 - also tcea had some of these images as
51:26 - well but there are some google meet
51:28 - expectations for when students come in
51:30 - um google just did some really good
51:32 - updates also to the google me if you're
51:34 - not sure they just had a
51:35 - conference yesterday so i would
51:37 - recommend checking that out we also have
51:39 - some zoom expectations here too
51:41 - just making sure that you know you're
51:43 - chatting responsibly
51:45 - um that kind of thing i also recommend
51:48 - recording and then disabling the chat
51:50 - while you're working through we've done
51:51 - some live lessons during covert with
51:53 - students and we really had to make sure
51:54 - everything was pretty blocked down
51:56 - um and just making sure that they know
51:58 - they to be in a quiet place and just
52:00 - some things
52:01 - you know it's a little bit different
52:02 - they have a little bit more exposure now
52:03 - as we're going through but just
52:04 - making sure we have that ability as well
52:07 - so now
52:08 - we are now we've talked about the
52:11 - teachers homepage
52:12 - the classroom and the student access how
52:14 - to monitor students progress the
52:16 - difference between a self-paced
52:18 - lesson and a structured lesson next
52:20 - steps and now we're going to give some
52:22 - time for
52:22 - q a i see a lot of questions here that
52:25 - that i didn't um have the ability to
52:27 - answer and then i'm also going to answer
52:29 - some of your questions i know where
52:31 - how our time is working here so
52:35 - um i'll just go ahead and talk about
52:38 - that and then i will also answer these
52:39 - questions here on the side and any
52:41 - questions that you have in the chat box
52:42 - itself
52:43 - okay um so
52:46 - one of the questions that had been asked
52:47 - beforehand was how much coding knowledge
52:49 - is needed by a teacher so to begin code
52:51 - monkey
52:52 - and any of the courses within codemonkey
52:55 - you
52:56 - don't need to have a ton of coding
52:58 - knowledge but i would recommend taking
53:00 - that teaching with coding adventure
53:01 - course
53:02 - it's going to walk you through concepts
53:04 - like what is a function
53:06 - um what is a for loop what does a for
53:08 - loop mean what exactly is a times loop
53:10 - and what exactly does the times loop
53:12 - mean it is me
53:13 - so um working through that so you get to
53:15 - hear my voice again i'm sure
53:17 - you're pretty excited about that but um
53:19 - it'll be me working through the concepts
53:21 - with you
53:22 - talking about each one of those as well
53:24 - another question was how do you tie
53:26 - coding with robotics well in robotics
53:29 - themselves even with the blocks that are
53:31 - used with most robotics
53:33 - that there are um there's a lot of
53:34 - computational thinking one that's in
53:36 - there so i would say definitely working
53:37 - through the computational thinking model
53:39 - it's always a way of problem solving
53:41 - but also there's a lot of concepts in
53:44 - the first part of coding venture or one
53:46 - of the whatever course you kind of
53:48 - choose that
53:48 - will actually tie to robotics like a
53:50 - times loop or a for loop
53:53 - or just talking about a function like
53:54 - how do we make the robot move so there's
53:56 - a lot of components that when they take
53:58 - the actual hard coding itself then
54:01 - they're beta better
54:02 - able to program the robotics because now
54:04 - they have a really strong background
54:06 - knowledge of information to kind of
54:08 - deliver um
54:11 - how do i know which standards code
54:13 - monkey is aligned to so i did mention
54:15 - that i was going to talk about how you
54:17 - can figure out where those are so if you
54:19 - go to
54:20 - the bottom of codemonkey.com you'll see
54:23 - there is a standards page here
54:25 - if you want more a deeper dive into this
54:28 - concepts or the standards that are
54:29 - covered just
54:30 - ask whoever basically your sales rep
54:32 - that you're working with or talia she's
54:34 - very great with helping with that
54:35 - but you can see the specific concepts
54:37 - that are covered here
54:38 - um we do have specific reports for just
54:40 - like csta
54:42 - or whatever but they are in the lesson
54:44 - plan as well for you
54:45 - okay um all right
54:49 - next question is um distance learning
54:52 - strategy so just some strategies that i
54:54 - recommend
54:55 - are having the students work offline
54:57 - with some of the coding concepts that
54:58 - they're working on
54:59 - they're working on functions why can't
55:01 - they go outside most of them have cell
55:03 - phones so their parents have a cell
55:04 - phone and have them record and have them
55:06 - do their own unplugged activity of that
55:08 - concept
55:09 - another strategy is having them you know
55:12 - work with those
55:13 - game builder or challenge builders some
55:15 - different ways to kind of show the
55:16 - mastery of learning in a new way
55:18 - and i also really recommend working with
55:21 - like
55:22 - writing problems like having the
55:23 - students write out exactly what it is
55:25 - that you're
55:26 - um you're going to do
55:30 - okay so those are some of the questions
55:32 - from today and then i just had this
55:34 - question here what was the name of the
55:35 - beginner teacher course webinar and how
55:37 - to access that so
55:38 - under the teacher resources um
55:42 - you'll see the teaching with code monkey
55:44 - tab
55:46 - uh that's from the main screen just on
55:48 - the left hand side you click on teacher
55:49 - resources
55:50 - here it's the teaching with coding
55:52 - adventure course
55:56 - um and there you'll see the course
55:59 - overview
55:59 - and then you'll go all the way to four
56:01 - loops array in indexes say
56:03 - and distance two variables which is a
56:04 - really important concept to kind of go
56:06 - over so i
56:07 - i personally recommend taking that um i
56:10 - found that a lot of teachers that have
56:11 - done it and that i recommend them taking
56:13 - it have a much
56:13 - stronger foundation there's also a
56:16 - teacher that i've been working with
56:17 - directly and she actually learned how to
56:18 - program
56:19 - from working with code monkey so just a
56:21 - lot of capabilities as far as that goes
56:25 - okay how many hours per week do you
56:26 - recommend using code monkey um
56:30 - i think it depends on what it is that
56:32 - you're doing is code monkey your sole
56:33 - program are you integrating it with
56:35 - other subject areas
56:37 - and and that so i would recommend
56:40 - typically we say that a lesson one
56:43 - lesson
56:44 - in coding adventure covers five
56:45 - challenges
56:47 - and that is typically 45 minutes so i
56:50 - personally would recommend that you do
56:52 - so basically the coding adventure lesson
56:54 - plans are broken up is there's two
56:56 - two lessons for almost every concept
56:59 - that's covered
57:00 - i would say taking a blend of that
57:02 - lesson and then having them work through
57:03 - at least 10 of the challenges
57:05 - and 10 of the skill mode challenges if i
57:07 - were doing coding adventure that's what
57:08 - i would do
57:10 - um but if you're integrating it with
57:11 - math i would have them
57:13 - write out the specific because in coding
57:15 - adventure
57:17 - there is um a ruler measurement and
57:20 - angle measurement so i would integrate
57:21 - that and then i also would have them
57:23 - do um you know like a writing prompt
57:26 - surrounding that so
57:27 - some just some different capabilities so
57:29 - if you're interested you can always
57:30 - reach out to us
57:31 - um we do have a clean looking facebook
57:33 - group that you can jump into and really
57:34 - ask those questions we really encourage
57:36 - that soon our teacher ambassadors will
57:37 - be
57:38 - running that a little bit more so that
57:40 - will kind of
57:41 - happen as we go um
57:46 - all right when you mark complete can a
57:49 - student not access the lesson any longer
57:51 - so i answered that question
57:53 - i mentioned marina bears somebody said i
57:55 - just purchased kevo kits for our school
57:56 - do you believe code monkey would
57:57 - complement working with kibo i do think
57:59 - the code monkey junior and beaver
58:01 - achiever course would really complement
58:02 - what they're doing i know that that's
58:04 - a really unplugged type of thing that
58:07 - she's doing there but i do think that
58:09 - those
58:09 - would support what it is that you're
58:11 - doing and we can always talk about that
58:12 - in a little bit more complexity if you
58:14 - would like to
58:15 - just in honor of y'all's time today all
58:22 - right
58:26 - talia um molly do you guys have any
58:29 - questions that
58:31 - i didn't get to
58:41 - no i we have some individuals that we're
58:43 - going to follow up with directly
58:44 - after the webinar i think we have a
58:46 - couple more in the queue that we are
58:48 - still
58:49 - answering but you've covered the rest
58:52 - excellently
58:53 - all right great
58:57 - just finished just on time but if you
58:59 - guys have any follow-up questions kind
59:01 - of as we
59:03 - you know go through i apologize i wasn't
59:05 - able to show you that example of the
59:06 - students but it's really great so if you
59:07 - want me to show it to you i will
59:09 - um follow up with me via email and i'm
59:11 - happy to do that
59:13 - um just remember that next week i've
59:14 - mentioned this several times throughout
59:16 - today's webinar
59:17 - um that we do have a tour to courses
59:20 - coming up next wednesday so or the 18th
59:24 - so excuse me next tuesday so that will
59:26 - be
59:26 - there for you so i will be going through
59:28 - all the courses and really
59:30 - touring them looking into the courses
59:31 - themselves and talking
59:33 - just a little bit deeper about that side
59:35 - of things today we just wanted to give
59:36 - you the back end of
59:37 - every all the details as well um so if
59:40 - you have any questions regarding
59:42 - help so you are stuck on something
59:45 - you're not sure where to go
59:46 - you can um contact us at support
59:48 - codemonkey.com
59:50 - if you um you know anything that you're
59:52 - kind of struggling with and we'll make
59:54 - sure we get that routed to the correct
59:55 - person to answer your question

60:40 - catch bananas and save the world and
60:41 - we'll see you guys next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

all righty so just to be able to honor everyone's time we are going to get started right away at two o'clock on the dot so 2 2 p.m eastern sorry 2 p.m central standard time um so if you um that's it we're going to get started alrighty so hello everybody welcome to code monkey's first webinar for the back to school season on how to set up and manage your classrooms the code monkey team wants to personally thank you for joining us for today's webinar we know that time seems like it has been turned upside down so our goal for today is to make sure that you are getting exactly what you need out of today's webinar to help prepare you to teach code monkey with your students oops so be sure to follow us on twitter instagram at codemonkeystu during today's webinar and also tweet at us using the hashtag codemonkeywebinar we'll do our best to answer any live tweets during our webinar today and my team is also here to answer any questions that you may have and you'll meet them in just a few moments so please chat with us along the side if you have any questions or ask them in the q a box we if we do not answer your questions immediately during the session of today's webinar we will try to get them get to them today during our q a and if we don't get to them during the q a we'll be sure to follow up with you after today's webinar following today's webinar a survey will pop up and once you take the survey a professional development certificate will be emailed to you directly following if you don't receive that you can email us and we'll follow up with you as well so let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world before we introduce ourselves i do want to go ahead and just take a poll for you for today i just kind of want to just learn a little bit about who you are so i'm just going to give everyone just a few moments to take this poll and then it just says you know like i mentioned we just want to learn as much about you today as we can to help guide you through this back to school new norm that we live in and if you don't find your role there just go ahead and select one that is a best fit for you all right i'll give everyone just about 10 more seconds we'll close that pull up and we'll get moving and if you don't see the poll it will just be no need to worry all righty i'm going to go ahead and close the poll and then i just always like to share the results so i'm hoping that you can see these with us how familiar are you as a coder it seems like the general consensus is that most of you are familiar with coding but still learning and then majority of you are going to be in the beginner side which is perfectly great have you used code monkey before majority of you have actually not used code monkey before so that's good for us to know as well and then what is your role so it seems like the majority of people are elementary teachers or computer technology teachers so we're going to go ahead now and get started with today's webinar alright so we'd like to always start off with just talking about what is code monkey so code monkey is a learning program for kids that provides online engaging courses for students to learn how to code it's made with schools and teachers in mind we are standards aligned we do have a k8 coding curriculum and there is no prior experience needed to begin teaching with codemonkey and now we're just going to play the code monkey professional development series we envision a global playful learning experience where the next generations of coders are born and raised we aim to create an engaging platform where programming knowledge is acquired alongside 21st century skills through collaboratively playing and solving puzzles inventing creating and sharing why do we need to use code monkey for computational thinking coding is for everyone and concepts that everyone should know we are one of the best gamified platforms for teaching coding and computational thinking it is easy for both students and teachers alike what role does the teacher play in the code monkey platform the teacher facilitates the class checks for student understanding and fosters the ability for students to dive deeper into the various coding concepts codemonkey also has automated feedback loops with a rating scale to rate student solutions a three star means that the student was able to solve the challenge with the shortest most concise solution a two star means that the student was able to take what they learned and apply it to the challenge a one star means that the student was able to collect the bananas all right so we'll dive a little bit deeper into those concepts as we progress through today's webinar and like i mentioned if you have any questions along the way feel free to ask them we want to value your time as much as as we can during this time so now we're going to go ahead and meet the team so you can see exactly who it is that you're meeting today so first i want to start off by introducing myself my name is lena saleh and i am the professional development manager i'm here at code monkey i've been with code monkey for a few years now prior to that i taught in the classroom i taught at the elementary level and computer technology as well as rope curriculum for our district and i did that for a little over 10 years and now i also organize some meetups here in austin for a tech companies and teachers to meet together and kind of marry the partnership between them so now i'd like for you if you have any questions actually um you can always email me here at lena.s codemonkey.com or you can always tweet at me at lena codemonkey and i'm happy to answer those questions along the way now i'd like for you to meet my team hi everybody i'm talia marielle i'm the head of customer success at codemonkey i'm happy to be here with you and thank you for joining our webinar and i'll be taking your questions throughout the webinar so i hope you enjoy hi everybody my name is molly i am the director of sales here at code monkey um and i'm somewhat new to the company um just started here this past january but i will be helping out talia and lena as well with answering questions so again thank you for joining us today awesome thank you ladies so much um and just so you guys know talia is joining us from israel so she's up a little bit later than normal so thank you for taking that time with us today okay so what are we going to cover in today's webinar objectives today we are going to get familiar with the teachers homepage we're going to explore your code monkey classroom as well as the students access how to monitor students progress and what that will look like we'll also discuss what a selfpaced lesson looks like versus a structured lesson for that remote learning experience and then we'll talk about next steps and then we'll be some time definitely for some q a we also pulled some of your questions from your webinar registration that we're going to also answer here at the end but like i said feel free to answer any of those questions along the way um in the chat box actually right now if you wouldn't mind um just go ahead and letting us know if you are going back to school remote if you're going back to school student facing or if you're doing a mixture of the both hybrid i've been talking to a lot of teachers that are doing all three so kind of however you're going back to school just kind of lets us know how to guide today's discussion a little bit more all right and while you guys are taking the time to do that we're going to go ahead and get into the teacher's homepage i've actually already logged in under myself if you are not sure how to do that you can log in using a single sign on and so i used my google sign on today to just go ahead and log in i personally like to use google i like for everything to be synchronous so that i don't have to remember 9000 passwords i'm sure you might be the same way as well so once you do that it's fairly easy to just get logged in every single time i did skip that step just in the interest of time but if you have questions with that we do have some really great help articles to help you along the way as soon as i log in here to the teacher home page what you'll see right away is it pops us out into or pops us right onto the my classrooms page the my classrooms page oh good lots of people are oh some are doing 100 virtual it will be interesting to see how this year kind of progresses as well but once you're into the my classrooms page this is where you'll manage your classrooms and students accounts and we'll get back to that a little bit later as we dive in deeper on the upper right hand corner of the screen is where you will see basically if you think about it it's our it's a menu bar in the upper right hand corner is where you can access the ability to change our languages you will also see information about your account is located here our privacy policy we know that privacy is a really big concern just so everybody knows we are copa certified um and we are um in association with kidsafe so if anyone has any questions about privacy policy we're happy to send that information along as well our help center is located here and our help center are articles related to just anything that you might want to know code monkey related concepts courses there's a lot of wealth of information of resources that we've added there as well and then we have our blog if you're not following along on our blog we have lots of guest bloggers and we just try to talk about things that are relevant to you as a teacher and you can also contact us here pretty selfexplanatory there on the left hand side what we see here is in my classroom page which is where we're on right now which is why it's highlighted in green the courses and this is where you will be able to access and complete the courses included in your subscriptions so this is also what your students will see when they log in so this is the main page that they'll actually be able to see and i'm just going to briefly kind of cover our courses that we have here on our page just to kind of talk about what the courses are and if you're not sure about how the courses work we do have the ability to go ahead and customize some scope and sequences for you for just some suggestions but i would always check out our course page here which i'm about to show you okay so here are our code monkey courses i'm just going to give you a brief rundown of them and then i'll show you where they're located so um right away starting in kindergarten we do like i mentioned before stan k through eight we actually go into the higher range we do actually have a lot of high schoolers actually using some of our courses in their um you know intro to computer science courses and things like that so it actually does run the gamut of that we like to think about coding as a language so sometimes you may start in different places no matter what grade level you are you might start if i start learning spanish and my students start learning spanish we're really going to start learning in the same place so just kind of keep that in mind as we go through the courses so code monkey junior is our younger student block based course it is really about computational thinking directionality it teaches the basics of sequencing and loops and if you're interested in learning more about our courses we do have a webinar next week that's going to dive deeper into all of those courses and exactly what they look like um then we have our beaver achiever course that's really geared for our first first and second graders it is a block based course as well but it does dive into the loops conditionals and then if and else statements then we have our coding adventure which we start uh textbased coding really early which is in third grade um some students will even start it younger if they've been coding for a really long time in the block based um so we use coffeescript and coffeescript is a shorter version of javascript and python it's really the meat and potatoes of the language it doesn't have a lot of syntax it's really going to be tying kids down it's hard for them to remember where comma goes or curly bracket so we really wanted to make the students have the skill set to really progress to those harder languages as they move through then we have a math course which is a supplemental it works through angles distances and multiplication so they're working with math focused concepts while coding so those are really great to have as well and then we also have a game builder course and that really is teaching the game mechanics in order for the students to then build and design their own games to share out and then one of our newer courses in addition to the beaver achiever is our banana tales and that is a python course it is set up similar to our coding adventure course it does work through the coding concepts and then our coding chat box course where students code in python to build a interactive chatbot so how you will see that is all the courses are located here all the courses that are available in your subscription will be available for you if you see anything that has a lock on it it just means that it's not part of your subscription and just a reminder and then down here at the bottom sorry i forgot to mention this down here at the bottom in our creativity section is where the students can actually build and create their own challenges so that's for extra enrichment extra practice which we'll talk about a little bit at the end but we'll dive deeper into that next week actually um so you can complete any of the courses like i mentioned that your students have access to and what you'll do is you'll actually just click on them as students they will not be able to i'll show you what they won't be able to do but everyone will start out the same so you will just mine says redo course so i'll just click on it and yours will say start coding so when you click on the course itself you can begin doing playing the course and then you'll kind of go through there you'll progress through the challenges the same as your students just something to note the students don't have the ability to skip around throughout the courses it is designed for them to learn linearly through the coding concepts so just kind of keep that in mind as a teacher you are able to move around and navigate the challenges because we want you to have more of a flexibility than to be tied down and have to do the whole coding course we want you to have those tools in your tool set to kind of move through there okay so that's how you would begin any of the coding courses like i mentioned in the tour to courses we will tour de france but to order courses we will dive deeper into what each one of those look like so i would recommend that as well next is on the lefthand side is our teacher resources under the under the teacher resources we have our teaching with coding adventure and that's where you'll be able to access our teaching i mean where it will take an indepth look of the coding concepts that are covered in coding adventure part one you can also have access to all of our webinars current and past webinars that are coming up where you can register and find all those things which you were probably directed to to for today's webinar then underneath here is all of our fully guided lesson plans they have our standards aligned with all of them they are pdf versions of them and then briefly i'll just mention that well i'll go back to the lesson plans as well but that's where all the lesson plans are located and then here you'll have your howto guide so these are short video tutorials we also have the access to the help center which you notice in the up here in the upper right hand corner the beginner's guide to code monkey is just a lot as a pdf version of everything kind of all located in one location um getting started videos and then we have just some short tutorials on things like how to upgrade your subscription archiving how to access certain challenges um they're really great and informational and in the honor of time short for you as well um and then also i'd like to mention we do have notes for the hour of code we also have these classroom resources which do have certificates for all of our courses there's also a media kit so if you want the cute images that we have as well uh classroom posters and then we do have some coloring pages which have been really good for like after school clubs and things like that are just things to fill the students time with um and then newest to here is the solution so this is where you can access all of the solutions it's kind of like a cheat sheet for you for all of the courses that we offer you can have the solution for everything so those are there for you those are the three star solutions for every single course that we offer and then moving right along on the left hand side is the my creations the my creations are if you use the challenge builder or the game builder to create your own challenges this is where your specific challenges will be located and the students will see this as well let's see the courses um the my creations and the discover page so under the my creations you'll see here are all of the um basically challenges that i've created within the lifetime of my account they're all located here they're located with games and challenges so those are just my personal creations that i've created then over here we have the discover page and the discover page is where students and teachers can publish publicly and when you publish a challenge publicly there are the community guidelines so we make sure that there's no student information that everything is very safe if we ever have questions about you know something questionable like a student adding a word that we might not think you know that could kind of cross a line we definitely don't approve them so i'll just let you know that as well so all of the students that have published those are there i do like to mention this this is just something for teachers to know that basically when the students do publish to the discover it makes a copy of their challenge so they can't go back through and try to change it you can also remix oops excuse me once you click on the game itself you can also remix those games as well and so it will also let you know that the students have remixed those games so just some little tidbits to kind of keep in mind as you're going through then moving on we do have um the help center is also located here and i'll just briefly just talk about that so we do have our getting started for teachers classroom dashboard just really any questions that you that you would like to have most of them have videos attached or just really descriptive for questions that you may have so we always recommend checking that out first okay so now we are going to move on if you have any questions about that part you can go ahead and let me know so we just talked about how you get to log in and then now we're going to actually go into the code monkey classroom itself and talk about students access so now we're going to do the steps to create a classroom how to set up a student account continuing with a previous code monkey classroom and then adding coteacher so we're going to kind of walk through all of this part as far as setup goes so the first steps when for setting up your new subscription whether you have a trial or a purchase a purchased trial that you've purchased or a purchase subscription that how you're going to go about this is you're going to be populated right you know you'll be put right into the my classrooms page and on the my classrooms page what you'll do is you'll create a classroom so when you click here on the on the classroom you can do two things so you can create a new classroom and add the name of the classroom which you would like to name it and just make sure you select the appropriate subscription or new to us as you can import from google classroom so when you connect to the google classroom it will go ahead and pull your students from the google classroom right into code monkey here into the code monkey classroom so you don't have to do giving them a class code or any of that kind of thing so it just creates that seamless transition for students to do that so i actually want to show you that itself so i have i'm going to share with you a another screen so i can show you what that will look like when you do do the when you do create with a google classroom because i know that's a big question right now especially with the learning management so when i create a classroom here i can just import from google and the classroom that i have here is named monday i make sure i have it attached the correct subscription and then i create my classroom some things to note here is that you can't actually edit the students names once they're populated but everything is completely coppa compliant and what you'll see is that i don't have a class code that's here because it's already made i don't need to share a class code or create anything with them as well okay so that is that part of the classroom creating a classroom and so when i click onto it all those students will be populated which we'll show you here in just a moment okay so now that we've taken a look at importing the google classroom which is one of my favorite things to do make my life a little bit easier um we can also so i've created that so let's create our classroom so i'll just name it webinar for today and i make sure i attach it to my correct subscription and then when i create the classroom it will populate here you see i have a lot of classrooms created right now i don't have any students in my classroom i do have a class code i can see which subscription it's attached to i can also edit this i can also archive this which just means it will no longer appear on my screen but the data will still remain in the classroom and then if i want to upgrade to a subscription is where i would do that as well so now that we are we've created our classroom let's go ahead and look at what it looks like to create a student account because that's what you all want to know is how to how do we even create our student accounts so as we can see here there are no students in my classroom so i'm going to click create student account and i can add a student here so what i do is i add the student i can share the class code if i want here i can also do a bulk upload so a bulk upload means that i have 50 students in my classroom and i want to upload the 50 students there is a csv file that it will give you as an example and we just recommend anytime you're creating any type of student information is that you're just keeping it you know with their first name and their lesson initially you're not doing anything as far as sharing extra information that doesn't need to be shared um they are really um hyping up privacy right now i've heard that from a lot of teachers that they've been asking a lot of questions about privacy and doing privacy checks so i would just really recommend that you're making sure that you are doing your part to keep your students information safe as well because we do our part to not collect information so we we hope that you do the same so then i can also create an account so i can put a display name if i want or i can just put um let's just say i create my student account here and then i create my password try to keep the password something that the students can remember and then what i do is i click create and once i do it tells me that the user has been successfully created and now they're going to be in my classroom now that i have a student in my classroom i can do a couple um a couple of different things here and what i can do is i can actually move let's say this is an old classroom from another location ooh actually let's talk about this so you can print student login cards if you would like here that's obviously more tactile for the students i know we're really trying to eliminate the use of extra papers and different things like that or you can do a classroom direct login url and so what you do is you embed this in your web page you click on it the students will have a picture and they'll just click on their picture and they'll add their their password and so that's just there if the students are single signon users however if they are using a google classroom or even just a google login we would want to stay away from doing this direct login url that's just a few they're not single signon associated um okay so we can also so here what i can do is let's say this is a really old classroom and i want to move them to uh another classroom i can either archive this whole classroom all at once really quickly or i can move them to a new classroom you can also do the same here with each of the students once you archive a student they will be removed from your classroom but their data will remain and you can also move them like i mentioned to another classroom so they move you know different to another classroom and so you just move them and so there's they're still there keeping all of their data and then you can also delete a student you can notice here that i can delete this student only because there is no student progress so that's just something to keep in mind once a student has logged in and began you can no longer remove them so they do occupy a seat on that um brooke that's a great question and i think um a member of my team will actually answer that and then i'll also answer that question at the end because that's a really good question for us as well um okay so we have um talked about the student list here and i just want to mention that if you have a coteacher in your classroom that you are wanting to maybe your team teaching you can actually actually add the teacher here and send them an invitation and then they will have the ability to have the same level of access to that classroom as you do all right um i'll go back to how to upgrade a subscription in just a minute but let's talk about um now that we're in the student list we've created a student um we're going to talk about how to assign courses and then i'll go back to the progress and some of the pieces that you probably want to know most of all so here in the courses tab remember i'm in a classroom and now i'm on the courses tab for that specific classroom i can go ahead and assign the courses any classroom that does any corset is not assigned to the classroom is going to be green and anything that is already assigned is grayed out so that you know that it's there so i can just quickly click on it and it'll say it's unassigned and i can click on it again and assign so it's fairly easy to assign unassigned courses to your students um something that i do want to know we do get a lot of questions about this so i'll just bring it i feel like now is a good time to bring it up if you have all of the coding adventure courses assigned to your students or all of the banana tales or all of the beaver achiever anything that has a three has a succession of courses together so like coding adventure beaver achiever banana tales even if this all of the courses are assigned the students do still have to work linearly through those concepts and they'll unlock as they go along so i just would like to mention that as well okay so now that we have assigned courses um and we talked about setting up a student account and we've talked about adding teachers to the coteachers i want to talk about how to monitor monitor student progress and our gradebook we'll also talk about that as well so monitoring student progress is um obviously important it's important for everyone to kind of know where their students are as well so let me just go ahead and get into a classroom that has some student data in it and we can talk about some different components that are going to be important to kind of investigate as we go along so here i am in my student progress page all of the courses have their own basically progress tables for the course so let's just click on our coding adventure course what we can see here is that i can sort the students i can see how far the students have progressed here along the um right here on the lefthand side where the students names are where the student name list is i can also sort by student progress and so when i do that i'm able to see you know the top the students at the top that have the most progress are going to be there and then it's going to you know go down as it goes through so we can see the ones with the least amount of progress are going to be at the bottom um some also things to note here is in our coding adventure course beaver achiever banana tales most of our courses except for the game design course all have three star solutions so three star solution is the shortest most concise code a two star means that the student took an extra step something that what would have been there and one star means that the student was able to collect that banana but i like to say that they're on the struggle rust probably didn't really understand the concept that was there took a lot of extra steps that were not needed so great creates really good conversational pieces so what you can see here is that i can sort by sort of by my student progress and i can see that in this specific challenge here challenge 16. um just so you know all of these numbers along the top are the solutions as well so you can access them on the teacher resource page or you can do this specifically in the progress page it does report live so as the students are working it is populating into the progress page here for you but let's say i have a student who is what i like to call the struggle blesser i click on this star here i'm able to see how many times this student attempted the challenge and we can see that the student attempted this challenge four times i'm going to click on it and when i do it gives me a real life animation it gives me their exact solution in how they solved it so i'm able to see it in real time exactly how they solved it and it also pulls up anonymously for some really good conversation for you to have as well it also it's not like a writing sample where you pull with a writing simply cut off their name and you put it up there and everyone knows that person's writing so this way it gives a really anonymous um you know authentic conversation to have and learning to have with your students um something else to kind of mention too is that your teacher solutions when you pull them up they actually won't say teach your solution across the top so you can also share those two um if you're trying to compare some different solutions something else to note here is that every single star that is reported back to here in this in this page every single one of them contains a solution all of them live here in this page so you can always click on any of them and kind of see when they did that if you're looking for something that's a little bit more robust maybe you want to see a little bit more information you can export that data to a csv file and it will really break it down for you exactly how they did it and the file can be quite large so it does give some really detailed information there for coding adventure we do have a skill mode so that's deeper dive into the coding concepts that are there as you notice here each of these this has the concepts actually here in the gradebook and that does match the courses themselves so just something to note there too and those solutions are there for you as well as the student solutions there um we can also limit the student progress so i currently have them limited i actually um have some younger siblings and they're actually working in this page right now um so i have them limited because i'm really trying to keep track of what they're doing and where they are so basically what that means when i've limited a student's progress as you can see here they are actually not able to progress beyond challenge number 20. um so just to kind of keep that in mind because you know what happens they go through they complete the challenges before you're ready for them to complete and this is just a way for you to kind of keep everyone all together if you want to unlock it obviously it's up to your discretion you are the teacher you know what's best so that's why we give you the flexibility to kind of have that as well and now you see i've unlocked it i just clicked on the limit progress i clicked free play and i was able to unlock all of the challenges we're going to talk about lesson modes in just a moment but you can also limit the progress based on the last lesson that was taught so there's also that a little bit more flexibility there as far as that goes so i'm just going to go ahead and limit this back up here just so they don't progress beyond where i want them to go i'll probably forget later and then what i can also do in our coding adventure course is turn on or off super hints so this is really good especially in your remote learning environment is that this will give students an extra set of hints there's always hints within our platform but this will give us this will give the students some extra hints and i'll show you this in just a minute but you can turn it on or turn it off here as well um okay so now let's go ahead and we've talked about the progress tab and what each of the stars mean how to limit we talked about the solutions and what that looks like next we're going to talk about the grade book so code monkey does this really wonderful thing and i know when i was teaching in the classroom i always um wanted to know that andrea that's a really great question i'm actually going to um answer that in just a second um so here in the grade book it's going to you have a couple of two different choices here this is automatically graded for you so always makes your life a little bit easier you can change it from letters numbers and percentages and then you can also calculate it between the different coding concepts you have every there is a gradebook for every single course within your subscription that you have available to you you can also export that as a csv file and that's just something to know at the bottom here of the page it will tell you how far the students have progressed through the challenges average score on assessment so in the coding adventure course itself there are builtin assessment challenges and so that is reporting the score for that there also there are the challenges by difficulty so the more students that struggle with a specific challenge the larger these circles become when you click on these circles themselves it pulls up the challenge so you can solve and work through it together so another place to have more student data and to have that student deep dive of data to really drive your instruction and then something that's brand brand new to us is this proficiency table so it's kind of hidden here you might quickly overlook it if you didn't know it was there but here is the proficiency table that we just recently added so we have four different levels here we have a novice we have a beginner intermediate and advanced and this is progress within every single code monkey course and the subjects that are covered there the coding concepts they're not subjects but coding concepts and talia just put a really great article for you to read up to for later but we can see the coding concepts that are covered here and then we can see exactly how the students um have done within each of the coding concepts throughout all of the courses so this tells you how proficient they are within the concepts themselves so that's just something that's new to us brand new there okay so now we have talked about the gradebook and the proficiency tab and then and just really quickly i do want to mention the showroom and then i'll talk about these lessons here so in the showroom this is when the students have created and built their own challenges they will actually um be able to um they'll populate here for you so you'll be able to see them so you have the access to the games and the challenges and then there's some ways that you can share them publicly with you know parents for that extra deep dive for that extra buyin for them to kind of play and interact with that as well um you can also disable the discover here and so that means that when you disable it the students cannot share to the discover and so that's kind of just giving you a little bit more discretion if you would like as well um okay so now let's talk about one of my favorites which is the lessons tab i will mention that the lessons right now are currently only available for the coding adventure course just the lesson um feature here we obviously all the lesson plans are still available but this specific one is only for the coding adventure course as of right now so you select a specific coding adventure course what happens is that this is broken up exactly how our lesson plans are so all of our lesson plans are set up in the exact same manner there is an intro which is an unplugged activity then you have or some kind of the introduction to the coding concept that the students are working on then you have play time so that's the chance where students are then working through the challenges themselves um you can assign specific challenges within the lesson itself here which is really great um and then you have debris so usually it's a reflection or sometimes you're doing a walk through or sometimes even the play time you might do a walkthrough so all of those are going to be here for you as well and then you can have access to those specific challenges that are there within the lesson so you're not having to navigate throughout 9000 screens everything is right here located for you when you begin the lesson what happens is the students get a big lock on their screen and not just a lock on the course is a big lock on their screen saying that they cannot progress until you've ended the lesson so that creates the ability to kind of lock them down a little bit more and keep them with you while you work on the lesson itself the specific lesson plan is located here for that specific lesson and it's going to have everything on it the objectives overall what are you going to be working on the specific components so those are like the coding concepts that you're going to be working on um what are you going to be working on a variable and an assignment variable and then the standards that are addressed which i'll discuss this a little bit more but we do have common core alignment we also have cst alignment and we do have specific state alignment so if you're looking for that we can talk about that also um and then that's just how the lesson plan is there play time intro debrief okay um all right now let me go back here once i mark the i can do two things i can end the lesson or i can mark it as complete once i mark it as complete that means that the lesson has now ended we also for coding adventure i'll show you where the reference cards are for the other ones but we do have a reference card that just lets them know what each of the buttons mean just a reminder it's a really good visual reminder for students and then we also have a character review card this character review card is really important when you're working through the challenge builder because as the students progress through the um through the courses or through the through the course itself the more characters and objects unlock so this will let you know when those characters are going to be unlocked like in 55 i know i can now introduce a beaver and then in 66 i can now work with the crocodile so we do get a lot of questions sometimes surrounding that so just and some information for you to have as well okay so now we've worked through all the features of the classroom page itself um so i noticed there's been some really good questions about somebody asked i just want to stop and ask this question because i think it's a very good question are grades available per class and individuals they are available they're actually per individual it's not specific to to the course itself so we can see here that this student a b monkey we can see exactly how they scored obviously it's an overall gradebook for the class but they are individual grades so we don't just pull like a whole class grade like everyone got a b um but there is a usage report that you can actually pull so i can show you i'll show you that in just a uh just a quick moment and then i'll just answer there's one more question too um that i would like to answer too so um unplugged activities are available in the resources when you subscribe that is correct so basically are they available for you so as soon as you subscribe to a code monkey subscription all of those features are basically unlocked for you so you have available to all of the lesson plans so they're not like locked down for you at all um so those will just be available for you and they're always in in those lesson plans so if you have questions finding those we can kind of help you also on the blog there's some really great articles about some unplugged activities that you can do and we're going to actually talk about that here in just a few moments i'm just running quickly i can notice out of time so i just want to make sure i'm honoring that amy had a really good question too when you mark com when you mark it complete can a student not access that lesson any longer in case they didn't finish or miss a lesson um actually that is that is a really good question when you are in lesson mode itself basically um what happens is that when you begin this lesson the students can only have access to those challenges so they are only working through the specific challenges and as i hover over you can see it's probably quite small for you but you can see that they are the specific challenges that are related to lessons so they can only have access to that so once you end it then it opens back up to wherever they have progressed through um so then i would recommend making sure that you have that limit progress button on or something like that so if they miss it which happens you know kids are absent and they miss lessons and whatever then that way they're still able to catch up and basically be on the same page but this also gives the ability for those students who are farther behind to be able to work through the same challenges that you're working through together during your lesson so just some differentiation pieces there okay so we talked about monitoring student progress now we're going to talk a little bit about selfpaced lessons versus structured lessons so um basically when we're talking about selfpaced we're basically talking about um you know the students are at home they're not with you live um so what you can do is you can assign the specific courses you can give students you know super hints which we talked about so basically what happens is gordo has this light bulb here for like an extra um he has he has a light bulb here and so when he has a super hit you'll click on it um the beaver achiever course also does the same thing where they have a hint you can see exactly the code it's not the answer but it gets them closer to the answer oops excuse me then you can also review if you're not there with the students you know because you're doing remote learning or maybe they're just not even with you you can review the previous challenges so i always recommend for students who are struggle bussing it um to go back to previous challenges and play those previous challenges sometimes you just need a refresher and just going through it one time you know if i only learned how to ride my bike one time i would never be very good sometimes sometimes you have to go back and practice um just doing what it is and and coding is just not a natural concept right like i don't come out of the womb knowing how to program so um the students don't either so just encouraging them to go back to play those previous challenges and just making sure that they read the instructions this is really important for our game builder courses as well as our coding chatbot courses it's they're pretty text heavy so it's really important for them to read those instructions or clicking on just reading instructions in general i you all are teachers so you know exactly um you know exactly how that goes okay um and then if you also can provide them with the solution if they want or really having them ask a friend so i always recommend collaborating fostering that collaboration is going to be key because you don't want teachers you don't want students copy and pasting their answers um to each other and then sometimes you might have to provide them with a solution um i do think i was just listening to a podcast from marina bears if you don't know who she is she was one of the she works with scratch and as the developer is the main person who developed scratch jr and she was talking about you know what is the difference between having a teacher and having a student just code at home and the and the missing component of all of it is you you're the missing piece and so they really need you to kind of help them work through the thinking you know sometimes it's just thinking out loud of different things so those are just possibilities so i encourage that communication happen we'll talk about what that communication could look like um and then the difference and then a structured lesson so a structured lesson is obviously working through the lessons within coding adventure assigning them a course making sure you monitor the progress limit within the courses you know really using the lesson feature or just at least limiting them um and then that way you guys you can even limit them to zero so they can't see it when you're doing the lesson if you're working in another course and then when you're ready then you give them back the ability to kind of progress through the challenges so there's just a lot of flexibility to do that and if you're not sure about it you can always ask us a member of the team we're happy to help walk you through that as well but um i i personally like structured lessons just me i really don't like my students to progress through i don't feel like they get as much of a depth of knowledge if they are not working together with us and having that communication so just fostering that communication and collaboration is a really big piece especially with coding um okay so um we talked about that so let's talk about some like next steps or some different things that you can do so um we recently just did a challenge builder competition that page still lives at the bottom footer of the codemonkey.com page you can see it there but i recommend the students really creating and building their own challenging challenges for mastery and one for creativity it can get really boring just going through the concepts although code monkey's quite fun it's not typical that somebody would say it's boring but um this is just a really good way to create extra engagement the students can share out their challenges and play them with each other and it's also a good way to do uh feedback loops so having the students you know maybe they don't know exactly which student created that challenge and you give them the challenge and they complete it and maybe they give some code commenting or some different ways to kind of work through the thinking you know the computational thinking model or even the engineering design process are really good strategies to use when building and creating your own challenges you can also connect it to other disciplines so this is um one of the challenges that we got um from from the challenge builder competition that we recently did and this was um not something that we told the students to do we just had a specif a few rules for them to kind of complete so if you want those guidelines those are there um but he basically tells a story oh of course okay well i'll pull that up here in just a moment but basically he tells a story so he actually interacts here with these characters so there is a save function um within the coding adventure course and so he turns to this go and i'll pull this up in just a couple minutes i don't know why it's not playing up right now but um so he turns to the monkey and the monkey turns to the goat and he talks to them about moving and then the then the beaver has to move so he can get across basically when you progress through these challenges the bear and the tiger are both hungry for both the monkey and the goat so they want to eat him so there's some different functions and things that progress through there so there's a lot of different ways to use storytelling um even a math concept like what's two plus two and then they go through and they move him if he gets the correct answer you know just just doing some if statements and working in some different um interdisciplinary um you know content areas that are really important for that um and then the lesson plans there are some really great activities from the lesson plans themselves which i'm going to come back to this page here but i personally really love to use the code code monkey junior lesson plans i know this is for the younger kids but it's really about the computational thinking which is really what you want to have happen i personally just am a big big fan of these lesson plans and the unplugged activities that they have here um so inside of this so on this second lesson plan that's in here it has instructional cards that you basically print out so what i used to do was i would um you know have the students create cards or you can have them do like a google slide and you kind of have like a grid and have the students basically program an object or you know you can have the students do this offline where they come up with their own activity and they can record it and send it to you there's lots of different variations that you can do with these unplugged activities which we'll talk more in the uh intro and sorry in the tour de courses we can talk a little bit more about that as well but these lesson plans are really really great um for working with students and i really like to use them as an opener to my coding courses i just i just am obsessed with using them because i think it gets kids moving and even if you're doing remote learning you can do unplugged activities without being directly in front of the code monkey platform together so you can utilize these resources so i'd recommend just using those they're one of my favorite things to do and then the next thing is just kind of communicating with your students creating those open feedback loops the biggest part about being a computer programmer is that there's a lot of failure that's involved with computer programming if you talk to anyone computer programming who's been on a sprint meaning they've worked multiple hours and days on a project um a lot of times a syntax error will happen or they need to you know collaborate but just creating those feedback loops we don't have that specifically built into the platform but i have seen some teachers do some really great things in google classroom or canva or whatever it is that you're kind of using with the students to kind of communicate about that and have them communicate their thinking because the deeper that they can go within their thinking you know being able to teach something creates a greater mastery of a concept um something that we did want to mention just for some different things as far as tips for communication i took this from a teach with technology facebook group also tcea had some of these images as well but there are some google meet expectations for when students come in um google just did some really good updates also to the google me if you're not sure they just had a conference yesterday so i would recommend checking that out we also have some zoom expectations here too just making sure that you know you're chatting responsibly um that kind of thing i also recommend recording and then disabling the chat while you're working through we've done some live lessons during covert with students and we really had to make sure everything was pretty blocked down um and just making sure that they know they to be in a quiet place and just some things you know it's a little bit different they have a little bit more exposure now as we're going through but just making sure we have that ability as well so now we are now we've talked about the teachers homepage the classroom and the student access how to monitor students progress the difference between a selfpaced lesson and a structured lesson next steps and now we're going to give some time for q a i see a lot of questions here that that i didn't um have the ability to answer and then i'm also going to answer some of your questions i know where how our time is working here so um i'll just go ahead and talk about that and then i will also answer these questions here on the side and any questions that you have in the chat box itself okay um so one of the questions that had been asked beforehand was how much coding knowledge is needed by a teacher so to begin code monkey and any of the courses within codemonkey you don't need to have a ton of coding knowledge but i would recommend taking that teaching with coding adventure course it's going to walk you through concepts like what is a function um what is a for loop what does a for loop mean what exactly is a times loop and what exactly does the times loop mean it is me so um working through that so you get to hear my voice again i'm sure you're pretty excited about that but um it'll be me working through the concepts with you talking about each one of those as well another question was how do you tie coding with robotics well in robotics themselves even with the blocks that are used with most robotics that there are um there's a lot of computational thinking one that's in there so i would say definitely working through the computational thinking model it's always a way of problem solving but also there's a lot of concepts in the first part of coding venture or one of the whatever course you kind of choose that will actually tie to robotics like a times loop or a for loop or just talking about a function like how do we make the robot move so there's a lot of components that when they take the actual hard coding itself then they're beta better able to program the robotics because now they have a really strong background knowledge of information to kind of deliver um how do i know which standards code monkey is aligned to so i did mention that i was going to talk about how you can figure out where those are so if you go to the bottom of codemonkey.com you'll see there is a standards page here if you want more a deeper dive into this concepts or the standards that are covered just ask whoever basically your sales rep that you're working with or talia she's very great with helping with that but you can see the specific concepts that are covered here um we do have specific reports for just like csta or whatever but they are in the lesson plan as well for you okay um all right next question is um distance learning strategy so just some strategies that i recommend are having the students work offline with some of the coding concepts that they're working on they're working on functions why can't they go outside most of them have cell phones so their parents have a cell phone and have them record and have them do their own unplugged activity of that concept another strategy is having them you know work with those game builder or challenge builders some different ways to kind of show the mastery of learning in a new way and i also really recommend working with like writing problems like having the students write out exactly what it is that you're um you're going to do okay so those are some of the questions from today and then i just had this question here what was the name of the beginner teacher course webinar and how to access that so under the teacher resources um you'll see the teaching with code monkey tab uh that's from the main screen just on the left hand side you click on teacher resources here it's the teaching with coding adventure course um and there you'll see the course overview and then you'll go all the way to four loops array in indexes say and distance two variables which is a really important concept to kind of go over so i i personally recommend taking that um i found that a lot of teachers that have done it and that i recommend them taking it have a much stronger foundation there's also a teacher that i've been working with directly and she actually learned how to program from working with code monkey so just a lot of capabilities as far as that goes okay how many hours per week do you recommend using code monkey um i think it depends on what it is that you're doing is code monkey your sole program are you integrating it with other subject areas and and that so i would recommend typically we say that a lesson one lesson in coding adventure covers five challenges and that is typically 45 minutes so i personally would recommend that you do so basically the coding adventure lesson plans are broken up is there's two two lessons for almost every concept that's covered i would say taking a blend of that lesson and then having them work through at least 10 of the challenges and 10 of the skill mode challenges if i were doing coding adventure that's what i would do um but if you're integrating it with math i would have them write out the specific because in coding adventure there is um a ruler measurement and angle measurement so i would integrate that and then i also would have them do um you know like a writing prompt surrounding that so some just some different capabilities so if you're interested you can always reach out to us um we do have a clean looking facebook group that you can jump into and really ask those questions we really encourage that soon our teacher ambassadors will be running that a little bit more so that will kind of happen as we go um all right when you mark complete can a student not access the lesson any longer so i answered that question i mentioned marina bears somebody said i just purchased kevo kits for our school do you believe code monkey would complement working with kibo i do think the code monkey junior and beaver achiever course would really complement what they're doing i know that that's a really unplugged type of thing that she's doing there but i do think that those would support what it is that you're doing and we can always talk about that in a little bit more complexity if you would like to just in honor of y'all's time today all right talia um molly do you guys have any questions that i didn't get to no i we have some individuals that we're going to follow up with directly after the webinar i think we have a couple more in the queue that we are still answering but you've covered the rest excellently all right great just finished just on time but if you guys have any followup questions kind of as we you know go through i apologize i wasn't able to show you that example of the students but it's really great so if you want me to show it to you i will um follow up with me via email and i'm happy to do that um just remember that next week i've mentioned this several times throughout today's webinar um that we do have a tour to courses coming up next wednesday so or the 18th so excuse me next tuesday so that will be there for you so i will be going through all the courses and really touring them looking into the courses themselves and talking just a little bit deeper about that side of things today we just wanted to give you the back end of every all the details as well um so if you have any questions regarding help so you are stuck on something you're not sure where to go you can um contact us at support codemonkey.com if you um you know anything that you're kind of struggling with and we'll make sure we get that routed to the correct person to answer your question um you can also always go to help.codmonkey.com use that help center i promise there's some really amazing resources there that would really um help guide you and if you can't get the answers you're looking for reach back out to us at the support
