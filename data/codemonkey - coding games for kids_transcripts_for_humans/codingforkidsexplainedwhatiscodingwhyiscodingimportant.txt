00:02 - [Music]
00:03 - oh hi are you wondering what i'm doing
00:07 - i'll show you
00:08 - this is quite neat isn't it and i made
00:10 - it myself and you can do it too with
00:12 - coding
00:14 - what's coding
00:15 - well have you ever wondered how
00:16 - computers do the things they do like
00:19 - play movies or show pictures or make
00:21 - music
00:22 - how does it know what to do
00:24 - that's what i wanted to know too
00:27 - computers know what to do because of
00:29 - coding
00:30 - think of it like a recipe book for when
00:32 - you want to make your favorite food when
00:34 - the computer is turned on it needs
00:36 - instructions and when you ask it to do
00:38 - something like use netflix or youtube or
00:41 - anything it's like giving it a recipe
00:43 - for how to do it but instead of
00:45 - ingredients and cooking it uses
00:47 - something called a programming language
00:50 - to us a page of code looks like a page
00:52 - with numbers but to a computer it's in a
00:55 - language you can understand and there
00:57 - are different computer languages in the
00:59 - same way that there are different human
01:01 - languages we have english french german
01:05 - and they have things called c
01:07 - plus or python or java so if you can
01:10 - understand english you can follow a
01:12 - cooking recipe written in english but if
01:15 - you don't understand french then you
01:17 - won't know what to do with the french
01:18 - recipe
01:19 - anyone can learn to program and some
01:21 - languages are easier than others if you
01:24 - work hard at it you can get a computer
01:26 - to do whatever you want
01:28 - that's how they make video games that's
01:30 - how they make computer programs like
01:32 - drawing software and it's even how they
01:34 - make websites like youtube and tick tock
01:38 - nowadays almost everything uses a
01:40 - computer in one way or another can you
01:42 - think of how many things in your house
01:44 - use a computer smartphones and devices
01:47 - are little computers tvs also have
01:50 - computers in them now even things like
01:52 - microwaves and calculators have teeny
01:55 - tiny computers on them
01:57 - so how do we get all these computers to
01:59 - work together if they use different
02:01 - languages and do different things
02:04 - it's kind of like human languages
02:06 - all the different languages in the world
02:08 - might have different words and sounds
02:10 - and even a different alphabet but they
02:12 - all have a few things in common they all
02:15 - use letters to make words and the words
02:17 - go together to make sentences and
02:19 - sometimes even if we don't know exactly
02:22 - what someone is saying we can understand
02:24 - what they mean by how they say
02:31 - it's a bit like that for computers it's
02:34 - always better to speak to a computer in
02:36 - its own language
02:37 - speaking to it in a different language
02:39 - might lead to mistakes so maybe you have
02:42 - your own idea for an app or video game
02:44 - or computer program or maybe something
02:47 - so futuristic in advance that only you
02:50 - can think of it
02:51 - well you can make it happen there are
02:54 - lots of smaller easy computer languages
02:57 - to learn to help you understand the
02:58 - basics of coding
03:00 - and once you master the basics you can
03:02 - move on to more sophisticated and
03:04 - challenging languages to really make
03:06 - things take off
03:08 - when you finish a program please let me
03:10 - know you can tell me about it in the
03:12 - comments
03:13 - also please like this video to show
03:16 - support for children learning coding and
03:18 - if you know another cool kid who could
03:20 - also be a cool computer coder then
03:22 - please share the video with them to
03:24 - kickstart their computer coding career
03:27 - thank you for watching see you soon
