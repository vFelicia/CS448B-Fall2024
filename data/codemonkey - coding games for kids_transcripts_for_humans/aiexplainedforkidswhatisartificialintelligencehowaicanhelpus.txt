00:01 - called AI it's everywhere
00:07 - now but what exactly is AI it's our new
00:11 - friend hello owl hi you monkey great
00:15 - sumers salt thanks say I was just
00:18 - telling my friends about AI you mean
00:21 - artificial intelligence that's when a
00:23 - computer learns like you or me we use it
00:26 - when we're trying to do amazing things
00:29 - like pulling off the best somersault of
00:31 - all time that's right the AI we're using
00:34 - at the moment is for pose detection
00:37 - that's right when we program things
00:39 - we're telling the computer how to do
00:41 - simple things like climbing a tree but
00:45 - if you want to do something really
00:46 - complicated then we need help from a
00:49 - computer that can learn AI helps us do
00:52 - really amazing things like shopping
00:55 - assistance organizing data training
00:58 - employees and even houseold told
01:01 - chores you can try out the same AI
01:04 - course on the Code Monkey website and
01:06 - see for yourself how the computer
01:08 - teaches
01:12 - itself the computer learns by doing
01:15 - puzzles just like
01:17 - [Music]
01:28 - us
01:33 - but that also means that just like us AI
01:37 - can sometimes make
01:44 - mistakes I think our AI has a bit more
01:49 - studying to do good thing I know where
01:52 - we can do that on the Code Monkey
01:54 - website where there's a game to learn
01:56 - about AI great idea we'll practice there
02:00 - but next time you wear the
02:05 - helmet please like this video share with
02:08 - your friends and don't forget to
02:09 - subscribe to our Channel thank you for
