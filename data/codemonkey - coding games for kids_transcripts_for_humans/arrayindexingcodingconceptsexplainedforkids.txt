00:04 - hello welcome to array indexing
00:07 - let's learn about array indexing
00:12 - an array is a way to store many items
00:15 - together
00:16 - so if you have a lot of numbers you can
00:18 - store them in an array
00:20 - many strings can be put into an array or
00:23 - even many objects for example
00:26 - many bananas can be put into an array
00:30 - called bananas
00:32 - use indexing to refer to a single item
00:36 - in an array
00:37 - for example bananas square bracket zero
00:41 - which we could say bananas with the
00:44 - index of zero
00:46 - is the first banana in the bananas array
00:50 - now you might wonder well why is the
00:52 - first banana bananas with index zero
00:55 - well array indexing begins at zero
00:59 - in fact
01:00 - most counting
01:02 - in coding begins at zero
01:05 - so if you have three items
01:08 - those items would have had the index of
01:10 - 0
01:11 - 1
01:12 - and 2.
01:14 - let's look at an example
01:16 - here's an example where we have several
01:19 - items
01:21 - as part of our challenge
01:23 - we have two bananas
01:25 - so those bananas could be put and they
01:28 - are into an array called
01:30 - bananas
01:32 - this one has the index of zero
01:35 - and this banana has
01:37 - is in the array bananas with an index of
01:40 - one
01:42 - we also have all of these bushes that
01:44 - are in an array called bushes
01:47 - with and each one has a different index
01:51 - since there's only one monkey it's not
01:54 - put into an array it's just monkey
01:57 - so let's see how we would solve this
02:00 - um
02:01 - turn two banana zero so the monkey's
02:03 - turning to
02:04 - bananas with index zero and then
02:07 - stepping the distance to
02:09 - that same banana
02:11 - and then
02:13 - turn to bananas with index 1
02:17 - and we probably want to let's see step
02:24 - the distance to
02:26 - [Music]
02:28 - banana one
02:31 - okay let's try that
02:38 - [Music]
02:40 - great let's look at one more example
02:45 - here's a challenge with beavers
02:47 - we have three of them and they are in an
02:51 - array called beavers
02:53 - so we have
02:54 - beavers with index 0
02:57 - with index 1 and beavers with index 2.
03:02 - we also have all of these islands that
03:06 - are in our ray
03:08 - um and when we have our
03:10 - single monkey
03:11 - and our banana
03:13 - so let's see what this challenge is all
03:15 - about
03:17 - uh looks like we are um
03:20 - having this first beavers with index
03:23 - zero
03:24 - step four
03:26 - this beaver steps eight
03:29 - what do we think beavers with index two
03:32 - will step
03:34 - four eight
03:36 - probably twelve
03:40 - oh we need to move it so a good way to a
03:43 - little tip for
03:44 - moving code around is you can do
03:48 - your cut
03:51 - and paste using your keyboard shortcuts
03:55 - and
03:56 - then we want to step
04:00 - 12
04:03 - okay and then we will step the distance
04:06 - to banana okay let's see how that works
04:17 - great
04:18 - [Applause]
04:20 - now that we've learned a little bit
04:22 - about array indexing it's your turn good
04:25 - luck
04:26 - [Music]
04:31 - you

hello welcome to array indexing let's learn about array indexing an array is a way to store many items together so if you have a lot of numbers you can store them in an array many strings can be put into an array or even many objects for example many bananas can be put into an array called bananas use indexing to refer to a single item in an array for example bananas square bracket zero which we could say bananas with the index of zero is the first banana in the bananas array now you might wonder well why is the first banana bananas with index zero well array indexing begins at zero in fact most counting in coding begins at zero so if you have three items those items would have had the index of 0 1 and 2. let's look at an example here's an example where we have several items as part of our challenge we have two bananas so those bananas could be put and they are into an array called bananas this one has the index of zero and this banana has is in the array bananas with an index of one we also have all of these bushes that are in an array called bushes with and each one has a different index since there's only one monkey it's not put into an array it's just monkey so let's see how we would solve this um turn two banana zero so the monkey's turning to bananas with index zero and then stepping the distance to that same banana and then turn to bananas with index 1 and we probably want to let's see step the distance to banana one okay let's try that great let's look at one more example here's a challenge with beavers we have three of them and they are in an array called beavers so we have beavers with index 0 with index 1 and beavers with index 2. we also have all of these islands that are in our ray um and when we have our single monkey and our banana so let's see what this challenge is all about uh looks like we are um having this first beavers with index zero step four this beaver steps eight what do we think beavers with index two will step four eight probably twelve oh we need to move it so a good way to a little tip for moving code around is you can do your cut and paste using your keyboard shortcuts and then we want to step 12 okay and then we will step the distance to banana okay let's see how that works great now that we've learned a little bit about array indexing it's your turn good luck you
