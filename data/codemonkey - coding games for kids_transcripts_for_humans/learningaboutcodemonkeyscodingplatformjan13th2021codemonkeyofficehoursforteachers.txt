02:51 - adding co-teachers limiting student pro
02:55 - progress the lessons feature and just
02:56 - some of those

03:11 - sure that we are answering
03:13 - your burning desired questions
03:18 - right so now let's go ahead and we are
03:21 - going to show you
03:22 - how to um sign up
03:26 - as a teacher from the get-go so i'm just
03:29 - going to pause my screen really quick
03:30 - and
03:31 - pull up my hundreds of windows as you
03:33 - guys know how that goes
03:34 - um all right and always when you are
03:39 - doing zoom nothing ever pulls up exactly
03:42 - how you would like it to go
03:43 - so all right so i am just going to go
03:46 - ahead and
03:48 - sign up here as a
03:53 - as a teacher
03:58 - and just pulling the right window up
04:00 - here okay
04:01 - all right so the first thing i want to
04:02 - show you guys is how to log in
04:04 - using either signing up for an account
04:07 - or logging in
04:09 - with your google account so i personally
04:11 - like to use a single sign-on
04:12 - account i find that if you sync it that
04:15 - way it just makes it a little bit easier
04:17 - also who has time to remember more
04:18 - passwords
04:19 - so the first thing you'll do is you'll
04:21 - click on sign up i already have an
04:23 - existing account but i'll just show you
04:25 - that way you can either sign up as a
04:26 - student a teacher or a parent in this
04:28 - case
04:29 - that is how your students would sign up
04:30 - and then as a teacher you would sign up
04:32 - right here so in
04:34 - and then once you do it will bring you
04:36 - to the option where you can sign in with
04:38 - a
04:38 - using an email your full name password
04:40 - or you can sign up with a single sign-on
04:42 - option so if you have clever class link
04:44 - you can sign up doing it that way i
04:46 - recommend however your students are
04:48 - logging in
04:49 - then you would log in the same way as
04:51 - they do basically
04:52 - if you're using any functionalities of
04:54 - google at all google classroom any of
04:56 - that
04:57 - you would want to sign in using google
04:59 - or else you can't use the features of
05:00 - google classroom which we're going to
05:02 - get into here so i'm just going to go
05:04 - ahead and i'm going to
05:05 - log in using my single sign on account
05:07 - here
05:09 - and then you're just going to go ahead
05:10 - and you're going to put your email
05:11 - address and your password
05:14 - and then just making sure that you
05:15 - accept the authentication from google
05:19 - um interesting i
05:22 - didn't think that's how that was going
05:23 - to go but anyway so then once you do
05:24 - then you'll be
05:26 - um you'll be in to the account let me
05:29 - just do a new share
05:31 - here and once you do it'll populate
05:35 - you here into the classroom
05:39 - so we're going to get into the classroom
05:41 - feature so this is how you
05:42 - sign in just really briefly the my
05:44 - classrooms page is where all of your
05:46 - classroom information is held and so
05:47 - that's just going to be everything that
05:49 - you
05:50 - how you access any of your student data
05:52 - and any of that information there
05:54 - under the courses tab i'm just going to
05:56 - brief mention this part because it's
05:58 - going to be fun to see this site on the
05:59 - back end
06:01 - and the courses side is where all of the
06:02 - courses that are available to you you'll
06:04 - see that as a student they'll only see
06:06 - the available courses that have been
06:08 - assigned and at the bottom all of the
06:09 - courses that are not that they're not
06:12 - utilizing are all going to be underneath
06:14 - and unavailable for them
06:16 - what has been newly added to code monkey
06:19 - here are these banners across the top
06:21 - that talk about what type of language
06:23 - each of the courses are
06:24 - and then what level the courses are so
06:26 - that's just something for you to keep in
06:28 - mind and
06:29 - i'm going to show you our new feature
06:31 - after that
06:32 - and then we'll go over some of these
06:34 - other features here at the end just
06:36 - based kind of on your questions
06:37 - um so in the classroom this is what we
06:39 - call the classrooms page
06:42 - to create a classroom there's three ways
06:43 - that you can create a classroom you can
06:45 - click on create classroom here
06:46 - and you can either create a new
06:48 - classroom and then you just want to make
06:50 - sure that you select the appropriate
06:52 - subscription this is important when you
06:54 - have an active subscription
06:55 - just making sure that you've connected
06:57 - it to the correct one
06:59 - or you can import from google and what
07:00 - you'll do is you'll click
07:02 - connect with google classroom and then
07:05 - once you do so and make sure you hit all
07:07 - of the
07:08 - all that and making sure that you allow
07:10 - the google classroom then you'll
07:12 - actually have the ability to
07:14 - basically what it will do is straight
07:16 - import your students so that's important
07:18 - um for you to have that when it's synced
07:21 - together then you can have all the
07:23 - functionalities and it will speak
07:24 - between
07:25 - google and itself um so if i allow this
07:27 - to go through then you'll see that my
07:30 - i now have the ability to import
07:33 - um this one i don't have any imported
07:35 - classroom so let me share
07:37 - another screen with you and i'll show
07:38 - you that
07:42 - so you're able to pull that up
07:46 - like i mentioned i have so many tabs
07:48 - here so
07:51 - just give me one second
07:56 - okay
08:06 - so once you do that you'll see you have
08:08 - your teachers and your students here and
08:10 - then you'll actually just be able to
08:12 - work simultaneously together with one
08:15 - another
08:17 - and then those clap that classroom data
08:19 - will just be imported there and then
08:20 - when you want to do the lessons feature
08:22 - which i'll show you it'll populate there
08:24 - another way that you can do it is you
08:26 - can just when you create your classroom
08:29 - you can add students more manually so
08:33 - i'll kind of show you
08:34 - that as well so that's how you create
08:36 - the classrooms
08:37 - um so now that i've created a classroom
08:41 - which you can see here i'll just
08:42 - click on one of the classrooms that i've
08:44 - created this one actually will have
08:45 - students populated inside of it
08:47 - um so i create the classroom either
08:49 - importing it from google or just
08:50 - manually creating a classroom
08:53 - when i go directly here to the classroom
08:55 - i'll click on the students tab here if
08:57 - you've
08:58 - synced with google the students will
09:00 - just be straight rostered in here
09:01 - if you haven't there's a couple of ways
09:03 - that you can do this if you have
09:04 - younger students and they're not using
09:06 - any single sign-on you can
09:09 - create click on this classroom login url
09:12 - if you are synced with google and google
09:13 - classroom this will not pull up for you
09:15 - so that's just something to keep in mind
09:18 - and then the students will just click on
09:19 - their username and be able to easily
09:21 - import
09:22 - or be able to easily add their password
09:25 - and it's just a strike link or they can
09:26 - go into login
09:28 - at the code monkey regular home page
09:30 - there
09:31 - you can also print login url cards
09:33 - obviously in our new remote learning
09:35 - environments of the world
09:37 - this does doesn't necessarily work as
09:39 - well as you would like it to but it does
09:40 - have a straight direct url on here and
09:42 - it does tell their username and their
09:44 - password so you could break that up take
09:46 - a screenshot
09:48 - it's a little bit extra work for you on
09:49 - that side of things but if you're in
09:51 - person it obviously works
09:52 - very very great so that is how you would
09:56 - add
09:56 - students now at the bottom here um so
09:59 - let me just remove one of my co-teachers
10:01 - here you'll see that you can
10:02 - add a co-teacher so on this one
10:05 - specifically i'm actually not
10:07 - able to add a co-teacher because i had
10:09 - both full
10:10 - but you would add a co-teacher here if
10:12 - you're connected with the google
10:13 - classroom it will sync the
10:14 - it will sync the co-teacher there so if
10:16 - you are importing with google classroom
10:18 - you need to make sure with whoever
10:20 - you're
10:20 - sharing your subscription with that you
10:22 - have added them as a co-teacher on your
10:24 - google classroom so that you're able to
10:26 - import and roster with them
10:30 - so that is how you would do that side of
10:34 - things
10:34 - uh for adding students and so molly will
10:37 - actually
10:38 - add that easy link for you there in the
10:41 - chat box
10:43 - um so students who are joining for home
10:46 - or or any of that we do have
10:50 - how would they actually join the
10:51 - classrooms themselves so
10:53 - here you can see we have a classroom
10:55 - code so the students can join
10:57 - signing up using their username or their
10:59 - password and then they would just enter
11:01 - in this
11:02 - this classroom code so something that i
11:04 - want to show you is that in our help
11:05 - center i click on the three lines on the
11:07 - right hand side
11:08 - in the help center we just recently
11:10 - added these student login guides so this
11:12 - is really
11:12 - important
11:18 - oh i'm on a google classroom still okay
11:20 - good catch you guys i'm so sorry about
11:22 - that
11:24 - um okay
11:28 - well good to know my apologies about
11:30 - that okay
11:31 - so i guess you guys didn't see any of
11:32 - that part with the students so
11:34 - let me let me go back because that's um
11:38 - embarrassing part of that okay so here i
11:40 - am in the
11:42 - uh student list here
11:46 - um thanks susan yeah um so
11:49 - here i am in the student list and i'll
11:50 - go back and cover whatever it is that i
11:52 - might have missed at the beginning but
11:53 - i'm just in the
11:54 - classroom so how i got here is the my
11:56 - classrooms page i'm not sure exactly
11:58 - where
11:58 - i left the offer didn't but here's the
12:00 - classrooms page each one of these you
12:02 - can create a classroom by either
12:03 - importing the classroom
12:05 - or manually creating it the class code
12:07 - is also located here as well just
12:10 - for that instance you can click on
12:13 - so i created my classroom i'm going to
12:15 - click into my classroom
12:17 - and i'll just re quick go over this part
12:20 - because i feel like it's important
12:22 - when i get here i will go to the
12:24 - students tab so i'm in my specific
12:26 - classroom so that's just
12:28 - something to keep in mind is that i'm in
12:30 - the specific classroom that i want
12:32 - um and then i'm gonna show you how you
12:33 - can navigate that but here i click on
12:35 - the students tab
12:36 - at the top and if you've imported with
12:40 - google it will just already be here
12:42 - manually won't be able to
12:44 - change passwords or anything like that
12:46 - and if you want to archive or
12:47 - maybe a student leaves your class you'll
12:48 - just have a button at the top here that
12:50 - will say sync with the google classroom
12:53 - and the login url just brief show that
12:55 - since you didn't see that i clicked on
12:57 - the login url
12:58 - and here it shows all the student lists
13:00 - that i've created i've created this
13:01 - student list here in my student account
13:05 - by using a bulk import
13:07 - and so down here you can add students
13:09 - three ways either creating a single
13:11 - account
13:12 - doing multiple accounts which is how i
13:13 - did this because this is a teacher
13:15 - classroom
13:15 - a teacher training classroom or you can
13:17 - share the class code and if you share
13:19 - that then you're able
13:20 - to see it much larger new students
13:23 - you can click on these tabs and these
13:24 - will actually take you to the student
13:26 - guides themselves so
13:27 - if it's input if you're imported with
13:29 - google classroom you won't have this
13:30 - feature
13:31 - if you need to add the students manually
13:32 - this is where you'll see it
13:34 - and then what i was saying is down here
13:37 - at the bottom i have a co-teacher
13:38 - if my classroom is synced with google
13:42 - classroom it will
13:43 - show you just to invite the teacher they
13:45 - must be on your google classroom to be
13:47 - synced with with the classroom here so
13:50 - it's that part is an important feature
13:52 - there
13:53 - um or you can just add people
13:55 - independently and what a co-teacher does
13:57 - is basically they share the classroom
13:59 - with you so they see all of the
14:00 - classroom data of just the specific
14:02 - classroom they can assign courses see
14:05 - student progress
14:06 - and all of the functionalities of being
14:07 - a teacher on the classroom but just for
14:09 - that specific classroom so it's good
14:11 - sometimes special ed teachers or
14:12 - maybe you have another teacher that you
14:14 - want to share your your
14:16 - classroom with and that's also the ways
14:18 - that we share our subscriptions
14:21 - um so that is some of the
14:22 - functionalities and then the
14:24 - login cards which i was mentioning here
14:26 - it does print out a student
14:28 - individual login cards and it has a
14:30 - direct url
14:32 - a username and a password so um
14:36 - not so much it doesn't work so well in
14:38 - our new virtual world but that is there
14:41 - so that is how you would um
14:44 - add students to that classroom so brand
14:47 - new
14:48 - just released this week my most favorite
14:50 - most needed update that we have here
14:52 - is the classroom so before every time
14:55 - you wanted to access each and every
14:56 - single classroom you would have to go
14:58 - out to the my classrooms page click into
15:00 - the classroom
15:01 - now you can easily navigate from this
15:03 - nice little drop down tab and i can
15:05 - easily navigate between my classes
15:08 - i find this to be a really needed
15:10 - functionality and it's really great that
15:12 - i don't have to do extra clicking
15:15 - in that way so here i am so the student
15:17 - list that's how you add students
15:19 - and i just wanted to note that part
15:23 - and then on the courses page so i'm just
15:26 - going to briefly go over this
15:28 - course page here um so on the course
15:30 - page now the tiling
15:32 - these banners at the top match exactly
15:34 - what is on
15:36 - our courses themselves so it has the
15:38 - languaging it has the
15:40 - skill level and then it'll tell you the
15:42 - specific course
15:43 - when you assign it to the class it'll
15:45 - say assigned
15:47 - here will tell you what grade levels
15:48 - it's great for what devices
15:50 - it works best on and my most favorite
15:53 - part is when you click on read more
15:55 - it'll also tell you the coding concepts
15:57 - that are covered within the course
16:00 - and the specific lesson plans are
16:02 - actually attached right here for you as
16:04 - well so if you don't want to go back to
16:06 - the teacher resources you have it all
16:08 - right here kind of in a
16:09 - nifty little square everything that you
16:12 - need
16:13 - and the same is true for our coding
16:15 - adventure course we have the standards
16:17 - here which
16:18 - i know this is true i just caught this
16:20 - today it's telling you exactly what
16:22 - functionalities and what will be covered
16:24 - in the course itself
16:25 - lesson plans and exactly to the
16:26 - standards so if you're wanting to know
16:28 - what standards are associated these are
16:30 - basic standards
16:32 - more general standards not specific
16:33 - state standards are the common core
16:35 - standards for math and language arts or
16:37 - ela
16:38 - and then we do have the csta standards
16:41 - and the national curriculum standards
16:43 - for
16:45 - our international standards as well
16:48 - so that's a really great thing that just
16:50 - also got released so we're very very
16:52 - excited about that
16:55 - um okay so now
16:58 - since i'm unable to get into my google
17:00 - classroom the way that i wanted to i'm
17:02 - gonna
17:02 - talk about um
17:04 - [Music]
17:06 - i'm going to go into our gradebook tab
17:08 - and then i'm going to show you some
17:08 - features
17:09 - and and functionalities of our progress
17:11 - page so in our gradebook
17:13 - as students are working through the
17:15 - course their grades are populating here
17:17 - for you so it's automatically graded you
17:19 - can export it as a csv file if you'd
17:21 - like
17:21 - and import it if you have assigned
17:24 - google classroom
17:26 - in the lessons tab which we're going to
17:27 - go to you're able to
17:30 - edit the grade it won't automatically
17:31 - report this grade to the google
17:33 - classroom
17:33 - um something that we are working on but
17:36 - google's a little bit tricky on their
17:37 - back side of things
17:39 - but that's there and then also here we
17:42 - have this proficiency tab and in the
17:44 - proficiency tab
17:48 - we have this new proficiency table
17:53 - and it's kind of hidden as you can see
17:54 - here it says by course and it says by
17:56 - proficiency
17:57 - but this is basically all of the coding
17:59 - concepts that are covered throughout
18:01 - all of the courses within code monkey's
18:04 - curriculum and so every single one of
18:07 - these is a different coding concept and
18:08 - basically as the students
18:10 - get more familiarize which in each and
18:12 - every single concept it's going to be
18:13 - reporting back
18:15 - to them the more that they practice a
18:16 - skill the more advanced they will be
18:19 - so if they only do one course you're not
18:21 - going to see that they're going to be
18:22 - advanced in that topic
18:24 - it's more about extra practice um
18:27 - and really getting them so if they've if
18:30 - they worked
18:31 - let's say they worked with variables in
18:32 - coding adventure they work with
18:33 - variables in beaver achiever and they
18:35 - worked with variables
18:36 - in the game design courses then they
18:39 - will have
18:40 - mastered that concept so it's just the
18:42 - more exposure that they have to those
18:44 - concepts the more you'll see this chart
18:47 - begin to fill out um
18:51 - and then i'll just quick mention about
18:52 - the showroom here just really quickly
18:54 - here
18:55 - so in the showroom is where students
18:57 - games and challenges will be populated
18:59 - for you so once they publish it to the
19:00 - classroom they'll show up here
19:02 - something i like to know is when you
19:04 - disable the the discover feature so
19:07 - discover is a worldwide publishing
19:08 - platform
19:09 - it is heavily vetted making sure no
19:11 - student information is shared there's no
19:13 - inappropriate
19:14 - things laced inside of there but
19:16 - basically when you discover
19:18 - when you disable the discover for your
19:20 - classroom the students don't have access
19:21 - to this discovery they won't actually
19:23 - see it there at all so
19:24 - that's just something that i like to
19:27 - note i think it's important until you
19:28 - introduce the concept that
19:30 - um my own personal opinion is that they
19:32 - don't have exposure to that right away
19:36 - okay so i've showed you the
19:38 - functionalities of those and now i want
19:40 - to go into the progress page so the
19:41 - progress page i like to always say is a
19:44 - teacher's best friend
19:45 - um and why do i say the progress page is
19:48 - a teacher's best friend well
19:49 - all of the solutions for the solutions
19:52 - are located in two places but this one
19:54 - here is
19:55 - where everything is contained like the
19:56 - holy grail i find of everything
19:59 - it's broken up into by coding concepts
20:02 - for each and every single course
20:03 - along the top and green is the teacher
20:05 - solutions for everything so you're not
20:07 - hunting
20:08 - and every single star within the
20:10 - gradebook or within the progress page
20:12 - actually contains a student solution so
20:14 - you can sort this
20:16 - by student progress and you can do a
20:18 - data dive and notice a data trend
20:20 - so if we look here specifically at
20:21 - challenge 15
20:23 - or challenge 16 excuse me we can see
20:25 - there's a lot of blue stars
20:27 - a three star is the shortest most
20:29 - concise
20:30 - solution that a student could have done
20:31 - so that's kind of the goal
20:33 - a two star means there was an extra step
20:35 - and a one star is a struggle
20:36 - so they really didn't understand the
20:38 - concept but were able to pass
20:40 - the challenge when you click on any one
20:42 - of these
20:43 - student solutions it will tell you how
20:45 - many times they attempted it
20:46 - and like i said you can pull it up in a
20:48 - real life animation it also pulls up
20:50 - anonymously so really good for
20:52 - you know debugging a challenge
20:54 - altogether or some whole group
20:55 - instruction
20:57 - maybe you put it up in a jam board and
20:59 - the students solve it
21:00 - in the best way that they can after
21:02 - you've done some like small reteaching
21:04 - as well
21:05 - but not only that you can put this up a
21:08 - lot of teachers will put this up in
21:09 - their classroom and show the students
21:10 - progressing through the challenges
21:12 - obviously up to you
21:14 - but the biggest feature of this page
21:16 - especially for
21:17 - synchronous and asynchronous type of
21:19 - learning is that you can actually limit
21:20 - student progress so what that means is
21:23 - that
21:23 - maybe i don't want my students to have
21:24 - access to anything i'm starting the
21:28 - i'm starting my lesson i can put limit
21:30 - progress to zero they won't have access
21:31 - to any of the content at all
21:33 - um until i'm ready for them so typically
21:36 - i like to lock this down so i don't have
21:37 - students
21:38 - progressing beyond where i am so it just
21:41 - kind of gives you a little bit more
21:43 - control there
21:44 - the super hints here is only available
21:46 - for coding adventure basically
21:49 - the more a student fails a challenge um
21:52 - then gordo will pop up with an extra
21:54 - hint it will guide them to the answer
21:56 - but doesn't give them
21:58 - the full answer this is really good for
22:00 - remote style learning i also think that
22:02 - if a student has failed a challenge that
22:03 - many times that they probably need the
22:05 - right extra reinforcement so
22:07 - i personally like to turn it on that's
22:09 - just my own preference
22:13 - um
22:19 - i agree that limiting the students is
22:22 - amazing because it just keeps everyone
22:24 - together and you don't have kids that
22:25 - are all
22:26 - over the place as far as that goes so
22:27 - that's kind of the functionalities of
22:29 - behind the scene
22:31 - and then i'm going to show you one more
22:33 - thing here which is our lessons page
22:36 - so the lessons page is only available
22:39 - for coding
22:40 - adventure um depending on
22:43 - um where we go with this but coding
22:46 - adventure right now is the only
22:48 - course that is available for lesson mode
22:50 - but i do find this to be
22:52 - important it's really good for either
22:55 - using it in its full functionality
22:57 - keeping kids with you
22:58 - or being able to do some differentiation
23:02 - so i'll kind of talk about all three of
23:03 - those so here the lessons
23:05 - are so they are set up in the same
23:07 - structure as our regular lessons our
23:09 - lessons are always an intro which is a
23:11 - unplugged activity the play time is a
23:13 - dive into the platform itself
23:15 - and a debrief could be a walk through it
23:17 - could be
23:18 - a reflectionary period anything like
23:20 - that what's nice about this is that i
23:22 - know that in lesson eight just by
23:24 - looking at this these are the challenges
23:25 - that the students will be working on
23:28 - um and here's some other challenges that
23:31 - might be
23:32 - usually in a walk-through it's something
23:33 - that might be a newer concept that they
23:35 - haven't worked on
23:36 - i also have exclusively the lesson plan
23:39 - for that specific lesson right here
23:41 - and if you have this synced with google
23:43 - classroom and i apologize that i wasn't
23:44 - able to pull that up
23:46 - um for some reason it's i'm using my
23:50 - associates account uh and so she
23:54 - needed to approve me again for that so
23:56 - anyway but um so
23:57 - if i were in a google classroom itself i
23:59 - would begin i would actually instead of
24:01 - beginning the lesson it would say
24:03 - assign the lesson and the students would
24:05 - see this on their side of the it would
24:07 - say
24:08 - assigned lesson 8
24:11 - and it would show the challenges which
24:13 - they need to work on and so you can go
24:14 - in and manually grade it there
24:17 - but for all the rest of them when you
24:18 - begin the lesson
24:20 - this is my favorite part about it is
24:21 - that the screens of every single student
24:23 - it says that we are now in the
24:25 - introduction stage
24:26 - every single student will see a lock on
24:28 - their screen so they're actually not
24:30 - able to do
24:30 - anything until you're ready to unlock
24:32 - them so this is just good for going over
24:35 - any unplugged activities any intros
24:38 - maybe doing that small group teachable
24:40 - lesson on lesson 15
24:42 - challenge 15 that the students were
24:44 - struggling so it's kind of nice to kind
24:46 - of keep everyone together and not
24:48 - have the ability for them to mess around
24:51 - while you're talking
24:53 - and then what is also really really nice
24:55 - about this is let's say i have students
24:56 - that are
24:58 - they're not achieving at the same level
25:00 - as everybody else when i'm in the
25:01 - specific lesson
25:03 - and i'm going over the specific concept
25:05 - when i assign the challenges to these
25:07 - students
25:08 - so now the students screens will be
25:10 - unlocked and they will be in play time
25:12 - and what they will see is only
25:16 - when they go into coding adventure only
25:18 - the challenges that are associated with
25:19 - this lesson so that can keep everybody
25:21 - all in the same place
25:23 - once i end playtime the students will go
25:26 - back to their place where they were
25:27 - before so this is
25:28 - really really good for introducing new
25:30 - concepts especially
25:32 - variables or some of the other concepts
25:34 - that are covered in coding mentioned
25:36 - that might be a little bit
25:37 - more challenging and that students can't
25:39 - keep up with that's just a way that you
25:41 - can kind of keep everyone together and
25:43 - kind of do some differentiation
25:45 - once you like i mentioned end play time
25:48 - um then the student screens go back to
25:50 - locked
25:52 - and then you can do your challenge
25:54 - walkthroughs or anything like that
25:56 - the reference cards those are going to
25:58 - talk about all of the
25:59 - the code blocks that are at the bottom
26:01 - so you know the blocks of code don't
26:04 - they're not drag and drop but they do
26:05 - contain text so this will tell
26:07 - each and every single student what those
26:09 - blocks are and what they mean
26:11 - and then the character review card this
26:13 - is something that i always like to
26:14 - mention
26:15 - the character review card will tell the
26:17 - students when they're meeting a
26:18 - character but it's also very very
26:19 - important for when the students do the
26:21 - challenge builder because
26:22 - ad students work through coding
26:23 - adventure these characters and objects
26:26 - open up as they go through
26:28 - and it's just nice for them to have a
26:30 - reminder like this is how you move the
26:32 - turtle so we tell them
26:33 - that we have to have an object tag this
26:35 - is
26:36 - this is how we move the turtle this is
26:38 - what we do when we move the beaver so
26:40 - it's just kind of some good reminders
26:42 - for students as well
26:43 - banana tails game builder they have the
26:46 - reference card all built in for them so
26:49 - but for our younger students we like to
26:51 - have them have access to that so then
26:53 - once i end the lesson
26:54 - now you can see it is green and it means
26:56 - that i've already done that lesson any
26:58 - of the lessons that i have yet to do
27:00 - are going to be in white so it's just
27:01 - good to kind of keep
27:03 - kind of keeps you on track especially
27:04 - when you're teaching hundreds of
27:06 - sections
27:06 - of that
27:10 - um okay so
27:13 - we've talked about the gradebook in the
27:15 - proficiencies tab and we've talked about
27:16 - all parts of the behind
27:18 - the scenes i'm just going to briefly
27:22 - mention this and then we'll get into
27:23 - total q a
27:24 - here with all of you in just a minute is
27:27 - i'm going to click on the teacher
27:28 - resources so i clicked on the teacher
27:30 - resources on the left hand side of the
27:31 - screen
27:33 - here we do have a certification course
27:34 - if you didn't get tired of me today
27:36 - um this is of course uh covering the
27:39 - concepts within the first part of coding
27:41 - adventure
27:42 - they're short they'll just walk you
27:44 - through the concepts that are there
27:45 - especially if you're not super familiar
27:47 - it might be a nice way to just kind of
27:48 - do a refresher for you
27:51 - our webinars any webinars that we host
27:53 - you found our webinars today
27:54 - but our webinars are also hosted there
27:56 - from previously and you can also find
27:58 - them on our youtube channel as well
28:00 - all the lesson plans for all of our
28:02 - courses are located here
28:04 - how-to guides let's say you forgot how
28:06 - to do something you can find the how-to
28:08 - guides
28:09 - locate our help center you can find the
28:10 - help center here or down here in the
28:12 - left-hand side of the screen
28:16 - and there's a classroom complete
28:18 - classroom management guide i like to
28:20 - to note this we everything basically
28:22 - anything that you ever wanted to know is
28:24 - going to live
28:25 - inside of this document it's also on our
28:27 - help center but it has everything
28:28 - pedagogical resources
28:30 - grades by course proficiency in computer
28:32 - science
28:33 - topics how to limit how to view
28:35 - challenge solutions just really anything
28:36 - that you want to know
28:38 - is is in that document it's a very large
28:39 - document but it contains a lot of
28:41 - information
28:42 - we do have getting started video guides
28:44 - so this will walk you through basically
28:46 - everything that i'm doing right now
28:48 - we do have some short video tutorials
28:50 - adding a teacher assigning
28:51 - courses all of that good stuff hour of
28:54 - code notes those
28:55 - really aren't going to be so necessary
28:57 - for you
28:59 - and then classroom resources all the
29:00 - student certificates are located here
29:02 - and the solutions are also located here
29:05 - so the student solutions are
29:06 - so solutions are located on the teacher
29:09 - resource page
29:10 - and in the progress tab so just know you
29:12 - have that
29:13 - um availability um
29:17 - the creation my creations is where all
29:19 - of your creations live nobody else's but
29:21 - yours
29:23 - and then the discover like i mentioned
29:24 - our worldwide
29:27 - discovery platform and then in the help
29:29 - center i'm just going to go there
29:30 - briefly in the help center here you'll
29:32 - see a getting started guide for code
29:34 - for for code monkey it has everything as
29:38 - a text guide how to create classrooms
29:40 - how to add co-teachers
29:42 - there's some different advanced steps
29:43 - there if you're not sure
29:45 - and then we also have these student
29:47 - login guides which is what i was showing
29:48 - my screen was not showing you what i was
29:50 - showing
29:51 - um so the student login guides are on
29:52 - the help center they're at the bottom
29:54 - section
29:55 - and here it will talk about how to sign
29:58 - up with
29:59 - how to share basically it's a guide for
30:01 - your students on how they can
30:03 - join code monkey using a student
30:05 - walkthrough we have that
30:06 - in this web version or we have it as a
30:09 - pdf that you can share with your
30:10 - students as well so
30:11 - if they're not sure how to join using a
30:13 - class code or any of that if you get
30:15 - stuck
30:16 - ever on that you can always reach out to
30:17 - us and we're happy to
30:19 - help with that um
30:22 - and so that's all that we have
30:26 - for that today so we did the lesson
30:27 - features the grade book and the
30:29 - proficiency the q a
30:32 - um our webinars page we talked about
30:34 - that
30:35 - um and then now i'm going to answer a
30:37 - couple of questions that we had
30:39 - previously and then um i'll show you
30:44 - um i'll get into your questions so what
30:47 - is the best way to get k3 students
30:49 - started so it's either having them
30:53 - importing a google classroom typically
30:55 - is going to be the easiest way for them
30:57 - to kind of sign in
30:58 - as well but you can just share a class
31:01 - code or
31:02 - anything in that manner would be the
31:04 - quickest way and then if you're not sure
31:05 - about where
31:06 - students should get started i'll just
31:09 - come back to the slide here we do have
31:11 - this
31:11 - located on the course page but this is
31:13 - basically where every single student
31:15 - should begin so kindergarten will begin
31:16 - with kobunky junior
31:18 - i typically like to have first and
31:20 - second grade start with copenhagen
31:22 - junior i love the lesson plans they have
31:23 - some really great unplugged activities
31:25 - that you can actually
31:27 - change to make virtually and i just like
31:31 - to get the students excited about coding
31:33 - as well um okay so the next
31:37 - question is how do i know which
31:39 - standards code monkey are aligned to so
31:41 - i showed you that in the course page
31:43 - there specifically
31:44 - um you can find the course and then you
31:46 - can click on the standards and it'll
31:47 - take you right there directly
31:49 - if you need something more customized
31:51 - then just reach out to whoever
31:53 - your regional sales director is and
31:55 - they'll help you
31:57 - with that as well susan good question
32:00 - nothing yet for canada
32:01 - but i'll definitely put that as a
32:04 - request down to our product team
32:06 - um regarding those standards i know that
32:08 - it's important for you guys as well
32:11 - what does it mean to upgrade so this is
32:12 - a really good question
32:14 - so oftentimes when you first sign up for
32:16 - your account
32:17 - you'll see that um
32:21 - this will say that is either expired or
32:24 - you have a teacher trial so
32:26 - see here i have this super teacher
32:27 - account so what i will do
32:29 - is i will upgrade it and then when i hit
32:32 - continue
32:33 - i just need to make sure that i'm
32:34 - selecting the correct subscription
32:38 - and with the correct subscription then i
32:41 - select it and then i just upgrade and
32:43 - that means that
32:44 - now my students in the classroom are
32:46 - going to be attached to the correct
32:48 - subscription so that's just an important
32:50 - thing to know or if it's expired so
32:52 - i just clicked on the upgrade and i just
32:54 - selected it
32:56 - we do have use just note here there is a
32:58 - usage report here and then this data to
33:00 - the export data to a csv it's very
33:03 - robust it will
33:04 - it contains a lot of student information
33:07 - it shows you
33:07 - everything that basically is in the
33:09 - progress page but in a csv file so
33:12 - if you ever need that as well and then
33:15 - i forgot to mention this but if i'm in a
33:18 - classroom i'm just going to click
33:19 - on a classroom
33:24 - and i'll go to the students tab here
33:26 - let's say this student
33:27 - class has ended and i want to move them
33:30 - i can click on
33:31 - over here i can click on this and i can
33:33 - select i can either archive
33:35 - all the students in the classroom
33:37 - archive only means that the students
33:39 - move to a non-active position all of
33:41 - their student data will still live there
33:44 - or i can move them to a classroom we
33:47 - the only way that you can delete a
33:49 - student ever
33:50 - is if a student has never used code
33:53 - monkey and so that only means that they
33:55 - can
33:56 - um that means that they can't be
34:01 - that they never took up your
34:03 - subscription see if you do if you
34:04 - archive them it does not reopen a seat
34:07 - the only way the archive works is if you
34:09 - have a flexible type of subscription
34:12 - um and that's the only way that you'll
34:14 - be able to reopen those seats so the
34:15 - question about
34:16 - if a student left from school how can
34:18 - you get the space back unfortunately
34:20 - if you have the subscription that's a
34:21 - per student subscription
34:23 - they occupy that seat for the lifetime
34:26 - of the account
34:28 - susan had a question can students be
34:30 - moved to a different
34:31 - school so if that is the case so we have
34:35 - a lot of students that move around just
34:36 - let us know
34:38 - um and we can help with that as well
34:40 - because we want the students contain
34:42 - their same coding language and things
34:44 - like that um so susan i would say
34:49 - get probably with zach and um he can
34:52 - help you with that
34:53 - and zac and talia they should be able to
34:54 - help you with that part of it um but we
34:56 - do have students that move around
34:57 - pretty regularly in within districts
35:00 - which is
35:00 - always interesting okay
35:04 - so that's that question and then how do
35:06 - i get students to collaborate so i just
35:08 - created a
35:09 - jamboard and i created i took a
35:11 - challenge that i know students struggle
35:13 - with
35:14 - which is the first time this is an
35:16 - assessment challenge for coding
35:17 - adventure
35:18 - and you can create just put the
35:20 - challenges here
35:22 - and then have the students each code it
35:24 - using different colors
35:25 - or you know show theirs each working
35:28 - together collaboratively sometimes you
35:30 - can put them in a breakout room or
35:32 - something like that i had a trial period
35:35 - but never
35:35 - had the opportunity to use it can i get
35:37 - the trial again antoinette if you just
35:39 - want to send
35:40 - a message to support codemonkey.com
35:43 - we can help work through that as well
35:47 - um okay let's see here this is a good
35:50 - question
35:50 - edward asked this question is there the
35:53 - ability to limit progress for code
35:54 - monkey junior unfortunately at this time
35:56 - we do not have the ability for
35:58 - students to
36:01 - occupy basically for you to be able to
36:03 - limit students progress
36:06 - but it is something that we have heard
36:09 - from teachers that
36:10 - is unique
36:13 - how can i delete students from google
36:15 - classroom can i get the space back so if
36:17 - you have
36:18 - your classroom synced with google
36:19 - classroom what you'll need to do is you
36:21 - need to
36:22 - go to your google classroom or not go to
36:24 - your google classroom up here it will
36:26 - say it's been synced with google
36:27 - classroom and you just need to make sure
36:28 - you re-sync it
36:30 - um as far as the space brought i think
36:33 - it's going to be best that you reach out
36:35 - to your your rep whoever you've been
36:38 - working with
36:39 - and they can work through with you on
36:40 - those details because i'm not very
36:42 - familiar with your subscription itself
36:57 - antoinette i did see your question here
36:59 - about doing a small
37:01 - demonstration on how to teach code
37:03 - monkey there is a webinar that i did a
37:07 - little while ago
37:08 - and it is um getting started with coding
37:10 - adventure and i did like a mini
37:12 - type of lesson of teaching i would say
37:14 - that would be a really good resource
37:17 - for how to teach with code monkey i
37:19 - definitely would recommend that as well
37:23 - okay and i see a couple of questions
37:26 - here
37:28 - i already created student accounts with
37:30 - their emails is it too late to sync with
37:33 - the google classroom
37:35 - patty if they've already logged in
37:39 - i would um
37:43 - i would say just reach out to whoever
37:46 - your rep is or
37:47 - to support codemonkey.com and we can
37:49 - look into that sometimes if the student
37:51 - accounts are already
37:53 - google related like they have a they're
37:56 - already google
37:57 - authenticated there is a way that we can
38:00 - we can help you with that if you would
38:02 - like so just
38:04 - um i would say just reach out to support
38:06 - codemonkey.com and
38:07 - we can help take care of that for you
38:10 - um will the recording be available after
38:13 - this it's always
38:14 - they're always available they always
38:15 - live on our
38:19 - website so let me just go there so you
38:20 - guys can see it
38:22 - they live on the webinars page
38:30 - on the code monkey webinars page so when
38:32 - you go to codemonkey you'll see there's
38:34 - a webinars page
38:36 - here there's also some student webinars
38:39 - that i personally did with students
38:41 - over cook19 and we did some for hour of
38:43 - code
38:45 - but here are some specific ones that
38:47 - will walk you through the office hours
38:48 - that we've done
38:49 - anytime you want to register and then
38:50 - all of ours that are available for you
38:52 - to be able to view are right here as
38:54 - well too so
38:55 - but we will definitely send out this
38:56 - recording afterwards as well
39:01 - okay sounds like we've had some really
39:04 - really amazing questions and
39:07 - we just want you to know how much we
39:09 - appreciate you
39:11 - and the time that you spend for both
39:13 - students
39:14 - and and just the time that you take
39:17 - every single day to put into your
39:19 - students and teaching with code monkey
39:20 - it's
39:21 - so greatly appreciated um
39:25 - please check out our blog and our help
39:26 - center sometimes there's there's
39:28 - also some coding concepts that are there
39:29 - some things that should hopefully be
39:31 - helpful and if at any time you're
39:32 - struggling with something you're not
39:34 - sure what to do

39:45 - support.commonkey.com
39:46 - support codemonkey.com and we will get
39:50 - back with you as soon as we can and as
39:52 - soon as we have an answer for you
40:00 - okay so it sounds like
40:03 - there are not any more there are no more

40:22 - survey

Cleaned transcript:

so today is the office hours webinar for teachers i really like to think about it as open office hours because it is really designed to answer your questions and then we're just here to pepper in a couple of new features love seeing all the people that are joining us we have people from all over from ohio to morocco and all the way um across the united states so it's really great to see everyone joining us from everywhere um so you can always follow us at codemonkeystu on our twitter facebook instagram we also are on linkedin as well and then we also have our code monkey blog so we recommend following us there for teacher tips and tricks sometimes we'll just share some different content so we can dive into that later if you guys would like to check that out as well um and if you want to tweet at us at all we're a small group here but you can always tweet us live during today's webinar if we aren't able to get with you during the webinar we'll follow directly after all right so now it's time to meet the team so my name is lena sololei and i'm the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey i've been with a company almost about three years now and prior to that i spent over 10 years in the classroom in a multitude of different roles so i've been where you are and now i'm on the opposite side helping really make your our goals really make your lives a little bit easier now let my colleague introduce herself hi everyone i'm molly i am at the director of sales um i have been with code monkey for about a year working from salt lake city utah and have been in edtech for just over six years now so i will be here to assist lina with answering questions on chat and on q a so please send those over as they come up all right great thank you so much molly um so today please feel free to chat with us along the side and then if you have any questions it you can also pop that into the q a box as well something that we don't get to you know during while i'm going over some of the features then we'll make sure we answer those right at the end i may stop and also um just quickly answer them if it fits where we are and if we don't answer your questions immediately during today's webinar we'll let you know that we'll follow up with you via email but we'll follow up with you directly following us and then after you finish today's webinar there will be a survey that will pop up and once you take the survey a professional development certificate will be emailed to you for an hour of professional development credit so if you guys are ready let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world all right so what will we be actually covering in today's webinar session we are going to go over classrooms and the student access adding coteachers limiting student pro progress the lessons feature and just some of those things that are really beneficial for both inperson and distance learning gradebook and proficiency report some of our newer features and then we're going to have some time for q a we also took q a questions from your registration as well just making sure that we are answering your burning desired questions right so now let's go ahead and we are going to show you how to um sign up as a teacher from the getgo so i'm just going to pause my screen really quick and pull up my hundreds of windows as you guys know how that goes um all right and always when you are doing zoom nothing ever pulls up exactly how you would like it to go so all right so i am just going to go ahead and sign up here as a as a teacher and just pulling the right window up here okay all right so the first thing i want to show you guys is how to log in using either signing up for an account or logging in with your google account so i personally like to use a single signon account i find that if you sync it that way it just makes it a little bit easier also who has time to remember more passwords so the first thing you'll do is you'll click on sign up i already have an existing account but i'll just show you that way you can either sign up as a student a teacher or a parent in this case that is how your students would sign up and then as a teacher you would sign up right here so in and then once you do it will bring you to the option where you can sign in with a using an email your full name password or you can sign up with a single signon option so if you have clever class link you can sign up doing it that way i recommend however your students are logging in then you would log in the same way as they do basically if you're using any functionalities of google at all google classroom any of that you would want to sign in using google or else you can't use the features of google classroom which we're going to get into here so i'm just going to go ahead and i'm going to log in using my single sign on account here and then you're just going to go ahead and you're going to put your email address and your password and then just making sure that you accept the authentication from google um interesting i didn't think that's how that was going to go but anyway so then once you do then you'll be um you'll be in to the account let me just do a new share here and once you do it'll populate you here into the classroom so we're going to get into the classroom feature so this is how you sign in just really briefly the my classrooms page is where all of your classroom information is held and so that's just going to be everything that you how you access any of your student data and any of that information there under the courses tab i'm just going to brief mention this part because it's going to be fun to see this site on the back end and the courses side is where all of the courses that are available to you you'll see that as a student they'll only see the available courses that have been assigned and at the bottom all of the courses that are not that they're not utilizing are all going to be underneath and unavailable for them what has been newly added to code monkey here are these banners across the top that talk about what type of language each of the courses are and then what level the courses are so that's just something for you to keep in mind and i'm going to show you our new feature after that and then we'll go over some of these other features here at the end just based kind of on your questions um so in the classroom this is what we call the classrooms page to create a classroom there's three ways that you can create a classroom you can click on create classroom here and you can either create a new classroom and then you just want to make sure that you select the appropriate subscription this is important when you have an active subscription just making sure that you've connected it to the correct one or you can import from google and what you'll do is you'll click connect with google classroom and then once you do so and make sure you hit all of the all that and making sure that you allow the google classroom then you'll actually have the ability to basically what it will do is straight import your students so that's important um for you to have that when it's synced together then you can have all the functionalities and it will speak between google and itself um so if i allow this to go through then you'll see that my i now have the ability to import um this one i don't have any imported classroom so let me share another screen with you and i'll show you that so you're able to pull that up like i mentioned i have so many tabs here so just give me one second okay so once you do that you'll see you have your teachers and your students here and then you'll actually just be able to work simultaneously together with one another and then those clap that classroom data will just be imported there and then when you want to do the lessons feature which i'll show you it'll populate there another way that you can do it is you can just when you create your classroom you can add students more manually so i'll kind of show you that as well so that's how you create the classrooms um so now that i've created a classroom which you can see here i'll just click on one of the classrooms that i've created this one actually will have students populated inside of it um so i create the classroom either importing it from google or just manually creating a classroom when i go directly here to the classroom i'll click on the students tab here if you've synced with google the students will just be straight rostered in here if you haven't there's a couple of ways that you can do this if you have younger students and they're not using any single signon you can create click on this classroom login url if you are synced with google and google classroom this will not pull up for you so that's just something to keep in mind and then the students will just click on their username and be able to easily import or be able to easily add their password and it's just a strike link or they can go into login at the code monkey regular home page there you can also print login url cards obviously in our new remote learning environments of the world this does doesn't necessarily work as well as you would like it to but it does have a straight direct url on here and it does tell their username and their password so you could break that up take a screenshot it's a little bit extra work for you on that side of things but if you're in person it obviously works very very great so that is how you would add students now at the bottom here um so let me just remove one of my coteachers here you'll see that you can add a coteacher so on this one specifically i'm actually not able to add a coteacher because i had both full but you would add a coteacher here if you're connected with the google classroom it will sync the it will sync the coteacher there so if you are importing with google classroom you need to make sure with whoever you're sharing your subscription with that you have added them as a coteacher on your google classroom so that you're able to import and roster with them so that is how you would do that side of things uh for adding students and so molly will actually add that easy link for you there in the chat box um so students who are joining for home or or any of that we do have how would they actually join the classrooms themselves so here you can see we have a classroom code so the students can join signing up using their username or their password and then they would just enter in this this classroom code so something that i want to show you is that in our help center i click on the three lines on the right hand side in the help center we just recently added these student login guides so this is really important oh i'm on a google classroom still okay good catch you guys i'm so sorry about that um okay well good to know my apologies about that okay so i guess you guys didn't see any of that part with the students so let me let me go back because that's um embarrassing part of that okay so here i am in the uh student list here um thanks susan yeah um so here i am in the student list and i'll go back and cover whatever it is that i might have missed at the beginning but i'm just in the classroom so how i got here is the my classrooms page i'm not sure exactly where i left the offer didn't but here's the classrooms page each one of these you can create a classroom by either importing the classroom or manually creating it the class code is also located here as well just for that instance you can click on so i created my classroom i'm going to click into my classroom and i'll just re quick go over this part because i feel like it's important when i get here i will go to the students tab so i'm in my specific classroom so that's just something to keep in mind is that i'm in the specific classroom that i want um and then i'm gonna show you how you can navigate that but here i click on the students tab at the top and if you've imported with google it will just already be here manually won't be able to change passwords or anything like that and if you want to archive or maybe a student leaves your class you'll just have a button at the top here that will say sync with the google classroom and the login url just brief show that since you didn't see that i clicked on the login url and here it shows all the student lists that i've created i've created this student list here in my student account by using a bulk import and so down here you can add students three ways either creating a single account doing multiple accounts which is how i did this because this is a teacher classroom a teacher training classroom or you can share the class code and if you share that then you're able to see it much larger new students you can click on these tabs and these will actually take you to the student guides themselves so if it's input if you're imported with google classroom you won't have this feature if you need to add the students manually this is where you'll see it and then what i was saying is down here at the bottom i have a coteacher if my classroom is synced with google classroom it will show you just to invite the teacher they must be on your google classroom to be synced with with the classroom here so it's that part is an important feature there um or you can just add people independently and what a coteacher does is basically they share the classroom with you so they see all of the classroom data of just the specific classroom they can assign courses see student progress and all of the functionalities of being a teacher on the classroom but just for that specific classroom so it's good sometimes special ed teachers or maybe you have another teacher that you want to share your your classroom with and that's also the ways that we share our subscriptions um so that is some of the functionalities and then the login cards which i was mentioning here it does print out a student individual login cards and it has a direct url a username and a password so um not so much it doesn't work so well in our new virtual world but that is there so that is how you would um add students to that classroom so brand new just released this week my most favorite most needed update that we have here is the classroom so before every time you wanted to access each and every single classroom you would have to go out to the my classrooms page click into the classroom now you can easily navigate from this nice little drop down tab and i can easily navigate between my classes i find this to be a really needed functionality and it's really great that i don't have to do extra clicking in that way so here i am so the student list that's how you add students and i just wanted to note that part and then on the courses page so i'm just going to briefly go over this course page here um so on the course page now the tiling these banners at the top match exactly what is on our courses themselves so it has the languaging it has the skill level and then it'll tell you the specific course when you assign it to the class it'll say assigned here will tell you what grade levels it's great for what devices it works best on and my most favorite part is when you click on read more it'll also tell you the coding concepts that are covered within the course and the specific lesson plans are actually attached right here for you as well so if you don't want to go back to the teacher resources you have it all right here kind of in a nifty little square everything that you need and the same is true for our coding adventure course we have the standards here which i know this is true i just caught this today it's telling you exactly what functionalities and what will be covered in the course itself lesson plans and exactly to the standards so if you're wanting to know what standards are associated these are basic standards more general standards not specific state standards are the common core standards for math and language arts or ela and then we do have the csta standards and the national curriculum standards for our international standards as well so that's a really great thing that just also got released so we're very very excited about that um okay so now since i'm unable to get into my google classroom the way that i wanted to i'm gonna talk about um i'm going to go into our gradebook tab and then i'm going to show you some features and and functionalities of our progress page so in our gradebook as students are working through the course their grades are populating here for you so it's automatically graded you can export it as a csv file if you'd like and import it if you have assigned google classroom in the lessons tab which we're going to go to you're able to edit the grade it won't automatically report this grade to the google classroom um something that we are working on but google's a little bit tricky on their back side of things but that's there and then also here we have this proficiency tab and in the proficiency tab we have this new proficiency table and it's kind of hidden as you can see here it says by course and it says by proficiency but this is basically all of the coding concepts that are covered throughout all of the courses within code monkey's curriculum and so every single one of these is a different coding concept and basically as the students get more familiarize which in each and every single concept it's going to be reporting back to them the more that they practice a skill the more advanced they will be so if they only do one course you're not going to see that they're going to be advanced in that topic it's more about extra practice um and really getting them so if they've if they worked let's say they worked with variables in coding adventure they work with variables in beaver achiever and they worked with variables in the game design courses then they will have mastered that concept so it's just the more exposure that they have to those concepts the more you'll see this chart begin to fill out um and then i'll just quick mention about the showroom here just really quickly here so in the showroom is where students games and challenges will be populated for you so once they publish it to the classroom they'll show up here something i like to know is when you disable the the discover feature so discover is a worldwide publishing platform it is heavily vetted making sure no student information is shared there's no inappropriate things laced inside of there but basically when you discover when you disable the discover for your classroom the students don't have access to this discovery they won't actually see it there at all so that's just something that i like to note i think it's important until you introduce the concept that um my own personal opinion is that they don't have exposure to that right away okay so i've showed you the functionalities of those and now i want to go into the progress page so the progress page i like to always say is a teacher's best friend um and why do i say the progress page is a teacher's best friend well all of the solutions for the solutions are located in two places but this one here is where everything is contained like the holy grail i find of everything it's broken up into by coding concepts for each and every single course along the top and green is the teacher solutions for everything so you're not hunting and every single star within the gradebook or within the progress page actually contains a student solution so you can sort this by student progress and you can do a data dive and notice a data trend so if we look here specifically at challenge 15 or challenge 16 excuse me we can see there's a lot of blue stars a three star is the shortest most concise solution that a student could have done so that's kind of the goal a two star means there was an extra step and a one star is a struggle so they really didn't understand the concept but were able to pass the challenge when you click on any one of these student solutions it will tell you how many times they attempted it and like i said you can pull it up in a real life animation it also pulls up anonymously so really good for you know debugging a challenge altogether or some whole group instruction maybe you put it up in a jam board and the students solve it in the best way that they can after you've done some like small reteaching as well but not only that you can put this up a lot of teachers will put this up in their classroom and show the students progressing through the challenges obviously up to you but the biggest feature of this page especially for synchronous and asynchronous type of learning is that you can actually limit student progress so what that means is that maybe i don't want my students to have access to anything i'm starting the i'm starting my lesson i can put limit progress to zero they won't have access to any of the content at all um until i'm ready for them so typically i like to lock this down so i don't have students progressing beyond where i am so it just kind of gives you a little bit more control there the super hints here is only available for coding adventure basically the more a student fails a challenge um then gordo will pop up with an extra hint it will guide them to the answer but doesn't give them the full answer this is really good for remote style learning i also think that if a student has failed a challenge that many times that they probably need the right extra reinforcement so i personally like to turn it on that's just my own preference um i agree that limiting the students is amazing because it just keeps everyone together and you don't have kids that are all over the place as far as that goes so that's kind of the functionalities of behind the scene and then i'm going to show you one more thing here which is our lessons page so the lessons page is only available for coding adventure um depending on um where we go with this but coding adventure right now is the only course that is available for lesson mode but i do find this to be important it's really good for either using it in its full functionality keeping kids with you or being able to do some differentiation so i'll kind of talk about all three of those so here the lessons are so they are set up in the same structure as our regular lessons our lessons are always an intro which is a unplugged activity the play time is a dive into the platform itself and a debrief could be a walk through it could be a reflectionary period anything like that what's nice about this is that i know that in lesson eight just by looking at this these are the challenges that the students will be working on um and here's some other challenges that might be usually in a walkthrough it's something that might be a newer concept that they haven't worked on i also have exclusively the lesson plan for that specific lesson right here and if you have this synced with google classroom and i apologize that i wasn't able to pull that up um for some reason it's i'm using my associates account uh and so she needed to approve me again for that so anyway but um so if i were in a google classroom itself i would begin i would actually instead of beginning the lesson it would say assign the lesson and the students would see this on their side of the it would say assigned lesson 8 and it would show the challenges which they need to work on and so you can go in and manually grade it there but for all the rest of them when you begin the lesson this is my favorite part about it is that the screens of every single student it says that we are now in the introduction stage every single student will see a lock on their screen so they're actually not able to do anything until you're ready to unlock them so this is just good for going over any unplugged activities any intros maybe doing that small group teachable lesson on lesson 15 challenge 15 that the students were struggling so it's kind of nice to kind of keep everyone together and not have the ability for them to mess around while you're talking and then what is also really really nice about this is let's say i have students that are they're not achieving at the same level as everybody else when i'm in the specific lesson and i'm going over the specific concept when i assign the challenges to these students so now the students screens will be unlocked and they will be in play time and what they will see is only when they go into coding adventure only the challenges that are associated with this lesson so that can keep everybody all in the same place once i end playtime the students will go back to their place where they were before so this is really really good for introducing new concepts especially variables or some of the other concepts that are covered in coding mentioned that might be a little bit more challenging and that students can't keep up with that's just a way that you can kind of keep everyone together and kind of do some differentiation once you like i mentioned end play time um then the student screens go back to locked and then you can do your challenge walkthroughs or anything like that the reference cards those are going to talk about all of the the code blocks that are at the bottom so you know the blocks of code don't they're not drag and drop but they do contain text so this will tell each and every single student what those blocks are and what they mean and then the character review card this is something that i always like to mention the character review card will tell the students when they're meeting a character but it's also very very important for when the students do the challenge builder because ad students work through coding adventure these characters and objects open up as they go through and it's just nice for them to have a reminder like this is how you move the turtle so we tell them that we have to have an object tag this is this is how we move the turtle this is what we do when we move the beaver so it's just kind of some good reminders for students as well banana tails game builder they have the reference card all built in for them so but for our younger students we like to have them have access to that so then once i end the lesson now you can see it is green and it means that i've already done that lesson any of the lessons that i have yet to do are going to be in white so it's just good to kind of keep kind of keeps you on track especially when you're teaching hundreds of sections of that um okay so we've talked about the gradebook in the proficiencies tab and we've talked about all parts of the behind the scenes i'm just going to briefly mention this and then we'll get into total q a here with all of you in just a minute is i'm going to click on the teacher resources so i clicked on the teacher resources on the left hand side of the screen here we do have a certification course if you didn't get tired of me today um this is of course uh covering the concepts within the first part of coding adventure they're short they'll just walk you through the concepts that are there especially if you're not super familiar it might be a nice way to just kind of do a refresher for you our webinars any webinars that we host you found our webinars today but our webinars are also hosted there from previously and you can also find them on our youtube channel as well all the lesson plans for all of our courses are located here howto guides let's say you forgot how to do something you can find the howto guides locate our help center you can find the help center here or down here in the lefthand side of the screen and there's a classroom complete classroom management guide i like to to note this we everything basically anything that you ever wanted to know is going to live inside of this document it's also on our help center but it has everything pedagogical resources grades by course proficiency in computer science topics how to limit how to view challenge solutions just really anything that you want to know is is in that document it's a very large document but it contains a lot of information we do have getting started video guides so this will walk you through basically everything that i'm doing right now we do have some short video tutorials adding a teacher assigning courses all of that good stuff hour of code notes those really aren't going to be so necessary for you and then classroom resources all the student certificates are located here and the solutions are also located here so the student solutions are so solutions are located on the teacher resource page and in the progress tab so just know you have that um availability um the creation my creations is where all of your creations live nobody else's but yours and then the discover like i mentioned our worldwide discovery platform and then in the help center i'm just going to go there briefly in the help center here you'll see a getting started guide for code for for code monkey it has everything as a text guide how to create classrooms how to add coteachers there's some different advanced steps there if you're not sure and then we also have these student login guides which is what i was showing my screen was not showing you what i was showing um so the student login guides are on the help center they're at the bottom section and here it will talk about how to sign up with how to share basically it's a guide for your students on how they can join code monkey using a student walkthrough we have that in this web version or we have it as a pdf that you can share with your students as well so if they're not sure how to join using a class code or any of that if you get stuck ever on that you can always reach out to us and we're happy to help with that um and so that's all that we have for that today so we did the lesson features the grade book and the proficiency the q a um our webinars page we talked about that um and then now i'm going to answer a couple of questions that we had previously and then um i'll show you um i'll get into your questions so what is the best way to get k3 students started so it's either having them importing a google classroom typically is going to be the easiest way for them to kind of sign in as well but you can just share a class code or anything in that manner would be the quickest way and then if you're not sure about where students should get started i'll just come back to the slide here we do have this located on the course page but this is basically where every single student should begin so kindergarten will begin with kobunky junior i typically like to have first and second grade start with copenhagen junior i love the lesson plans they have some really great unplugged activities that you can actually change to make virtually and i just like to get the students excited about coding as well um okay so the next question is how do i know which standards code monkey are aligned to so i showed you that in the course page there specifically um you can find the course and then you can click on the standards and it'll take you right there directly if you need something more customized then just reach out to whoever your regional sales director is and they'll help you with that as well susan good question nothing yet for canada but i'll definitely put that as a request down to our product team um regarding those standards i know that it's important for you guys as well what does it mean to upgrade so this is a really good question so oftentimes when you first sign up for your account you'll see that um this will say that is either expired or you have a teacher trial so see here i have this super teacher account so what i will do is i will upgrade it and then when i hit continue i just need to make sure that i'm selecting the correct subscription and with the correct subscription then i select it and then i just upgrade and that means that now my students in the classroom are going to be attached to the correct subscription so that's just an important thing to know or if it's expired so i just clicked on the upgrade and i just selected it we do have use just note here there is a usage report here and then this data to the export data to a csv it's very robust it will it contains a lot of student information it shows you everything that basically is in the progress page but in a csv file so if you ever need that as well and then i forgot to mention this but if i'm in a classroom i'm just going to click on a classroom and i'll go to the students tab here let's say this student class has ended and i want to move them i can click on over here i can click on this and i can select i can either archive all the students in the classroom archive only means that the students move to a nonactive position all of their student data will still live there or i can move them to a classroom we the only way that you can delete a student ever is if a student has never used code monkey and so that only means that they can um that means that they can't be that they never took up your subscription see if you do if you archive them it does not reopen a seat the only way the archive works is if you have a flexible type of subscription um and that's the only way that you'll be able to reopen those seats so the question about if a student left from school how can you get the space back unfortunately if you have the subscription that's a per student subscription they occupy that seat for the lifetime of the account susan had a question can students be moved to a different school so if that is the case so we have a lot of students that move around just let us know um and we can help with that as well because we want the students contain their same coding language and things like that um so susan i would say get probably with zach and um he can help you with that and zac and talia they should be able to help you with that part of it um but we do have students that move around pretty regularly in within districts which is always interesting okay so that's that question and then how do i get students to collaborate so i just created a jamboard and i created i took a challenge that i know students struggle with which is the first time this is an assessment challenge for coding adventure and you can create just put the challenges here and then have the students each code it using different colors or you know show theirs each working together collaboratively sometimes you can put them in a breakout room or something like that i had a trial period but never had the opportunity to use it can i get the trial again antoinette if you just want to send a message to support codemonkey.com we can help work through that as well um okay let's see here this is a good question edward asked this question is there the ability to limit progress for code monkey junior unfortunately at this time we do not have the ability for students to occupy basically for you to be able to limit students progress but it is something that we have heard from teachers that is unique how can i delete students from google classroom can i get the space back so if you have your classroom synced with google classroom what you'll need to do is you need to go to your google classroom or not go to your google classroom up here it will say it's been synced with google classroom and you just need to make sure you resync it um as far as the space brought i think it's going to be best that you reach out to your your rep whoever you've been working with and they can work through with you on those details because i'm not very familiar with your subscription itself antoinette i did see your question here about doing a small demonstration on how to teach code monkey there is a webinar that i did a little while ago and it is um getting started with coding adventure and i did like a mini type of lesson of teaching i would say that would be a really good resource for how to teach with code monkey i definitely would recommend that as well okay and i see a couple of questions here i already created student accounts with their emails is it too late to sync with the google classroom patty if they've already logged in i would um i would say just reach out to whoever your rep is or to support codemonkey.com and we can look into that sometimes if the student accounts are already google related like they have a they're already google authenticated there is a way that we can we can help you with that if you would like so just um i would say just reach out to support codemonkey.com and we can help take care of that for you um will the recording be available after this it's always they're always available they always live on our website so let me just go there so you guys can see it they live on the webinars page on the code monkey webinars page so when you go to codemonkey you'll see there's a webinars page here there's also some student webinars that i personally did with students over cook19 and we did some for hour of code but here are some specific ones that will walk you through the office hours that we've done anytime you want to register and then all of ours that are available for you to be able to view are right here as well too so but we will definitely send out this recording afterwards as well okay sounds like we've had some really really amazing questions and we just want you to know how much we appreciate you and the time that you spend for both students and and just the time that you take every single day to put into your students and teaching with code monkey it's so greatly appreciated um please check out our blog and our help center sometimes there's there's also some coding concepts that are there some things that should hopefully be helpful and if at any time you're struggling with something you're not sure what to do um you're stuck you can either use the chat feature on on there that goes to our support as well or you can just email us at support.commonkey.com support codemonkey.com and we will get back with you as soon as we can and as soon as we have an answer for you okay so it sounds like there are not any more there are no more questions so once again we just want to thank you guys so much for joining us for today's webinar session we're ending a little bit early so that's exciting as well um any questions please feel free to reach out to us this recording will be available remember at the end of this recording you will get a survey
