00:04 - welcome to boolean opera let's learn
00:07 - about booleans
00:10 - boolean is true or false
00:13 - and is a boolean operator that combines
00:16 - two booleans
00:18 - it evaluates too true only when these
00:21 - two booleans are true
00:24 - so here we have an example of an if
00:26 - statement
00:27 - so if banana frozen and banana green
00:33 - because we're using a and
00:35 - an and boolean operator
00:38 - it means that both the banana must be
00:41 - frozen this must be true and the banana
00:45 - must be green this must be true
00:48 - both must be true
00:50 - in order for the indented code to run
00:54 - let's look at it a little bit more
00:56 - so here we have a table that explains
00:59 - all the different possibilities and what
01:01 - the condition
01:03 - would result in
01:05 - so here we have if banana frozen and
01:07 - banana green
01:09 - now sometimes the banana will be frozen
01:12 - so we'll have a true and when we it's
01:14 - not frozen it'll be false
01:16 - sometimes the banana will be green true
01:19 - but sometimes it won't be green that'll
01:20 - be false
01:22 - because we're using the boolean operator
01:25 - the boolean
01:26 - and operator
01:28 - only when
01:30 - both are true
01:31 - will this
01:32 - condition
01:34 - be true
01:36 - let's look at a challenge
01:39 - here's a challenge where the monkey
01:41 - wants to get those bananas
01:43 - but both the
01:45 - bear and the tiger are watching
01:48 - so
01:49 - the monkey wants to make sure they're
01:51 - both sleeping
01:52 - before getting the bananas
01:55 - so if we look at the code it says fix
01:57 - this condition until bear sleeping yeah
01:59 - we want that to be true
02:02 - but we also
02:04 - want the tiger to be sleeping we want
02:06 - both to be true so we're going to use
02:08 - the and not there
02:11 - so we're going to use
02:12 - the and
02:15 - tiger
02:16 - sleeping both being true
02:21 - and so this condition will only be true
02:23 - when both are true
02:25 - otherwise we'll just wait
02:28 - and once they're both true we'll move
02:30 - over to the for loop
02:32 - and get those bananas
02:36 - all right
02:38 - go sleeping now
02:44 - [Music]
02:47 - or
02:48 - is another boolean operator that
02:50 - combines two booleans
02:52 - it evaluates to true when at least one
02:56 - of these booleans is true
02:59 - so for example if banana frozen or
03:03 - banana green
03:05 - because we're using the or boolean
03:07 - operator only one of these needs to be
03:10 - true
03:11 - for the indented code to run
03:15 - here's our table again but this time we
03:18 - have it with the or boolean operator if
03:21 - banana frozen or banana green
03:25 - and you could see we have several true
03:29 - outcomes several true conditions
03:32 - for banana frozen or banana green
03:37 - when both are true but also when only
03:40 - one is true
03:42 - we still get a true
03:44 - condition let's look at a challenge
03:49 - here's a challenge where we want the
03:52 - goat to go to the banana however the
03:54 - bear is watching
03:56 - so we have to wait until the bear is
03:59 - distracted either by sleeping or
04:03 - by playing
04:05 - so if we look at the code it says fix
04:07 - the conditions we'll change this to
04:10 - until
04:12 - the bear is sleeping
04:16 - or
04:18 - the bears
04:20 - playing
04:22 - okay so only one of these needs to be
04:24 - true
04:26 - in order for us to go and get the have
04:28 - the goat get the banana
04:31 - okay but if you neither are true we're
04:34 - just gonna wait
04:36 - okay let's go ahead and run it
04:40 - okay waiting okay beer is playing
04:44 - [Music]
04:46 - now it's your turn to use booleans good
04:51 - [Music]
04:54 - luck you

welcome to boolean opera let's learn about booleans boolean is true or false and is a boolean operator that combines two booleans it evaluates too true only when these two booleans are true so here we have an example of an if statement so if banana frozen and banana green because we're using a and an and boolean operator it means that both the banana must be frozen this must be true and the banana must be green this must be true both must be true in order for the indented code to run let's look at it a little bit more so here we have a table that explains all the different possibilities and what the condition would result in so here we have if banana frozen and banana green now sometimes the banana will be frozen so we'll have a true and when we it's not frozen it'll be false sometimes the banana will be green true but sometimes it won't be green that'll be false because we're using the boolean operator the boolean and operator only when both are true will this condition be true let's look at a challenge here's a challenge where the monkey wants to get those bananas but both the bear and the tiger are watching so the monkey wants to make sure they're both sleeping before getting the bananas so if we look at the code it says fix this condition until bear sleeping yeah we want that to be true but we also want the tiger to be sleeping we want both to be true so we're going to use the and not there so we're going to use the and tiger sleeping both being true and so this condition will only be true when both are true otherwise we'll just wait and once they're both true we'll move over to the for loop and get those bananas all right go sleeping now or is another boolean operator that combines two booleans it evaluates to true when at least one of these booleans is true so for example if banana frozen or banana green because we're using the or boolean operator only one of these needs to be true for the indented code to run here's our table again but this time we have it with the or boolean operator if banana frozen or banana green and you could see we have several true outcomes several true conditions for banana frozen or banana green when both are true but also when only one is true we still get a true condition let's look at a challenge here's a challenge where we want the goat to go to the banana however the bear is watching so we have to wait until the bear is distracted either by sleeping or by playing so if we look at the code it says fix the conditions we'll change this to until the bear is sleeping or the bears playing okay so only one of these needs to be true in order for us to go and get the have the goat get the banana okay but if you neither are true we're just gonna wait okay let's go ahead and run it okay waiting okay beer is playing now it's your turn to use booleans good luck you
