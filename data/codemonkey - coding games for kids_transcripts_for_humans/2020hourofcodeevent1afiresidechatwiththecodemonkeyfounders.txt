03:58 - have been
03:59 - maybe learning about us in school we are
04:01 - a fully
04:02 - gamified coding platform really designed
04:04 - to put both students and teachers in the
04:06 - driver's seat
04:07 - it's really fun to play and we really
04:10 - want our students to learn a deep dive
04:12 - into the coding foundation
04:14 - so if you're not sure about that you can
04:15 - always
04:17 - visit us at our webpage at
04:19 - www.codemonkey.com
04:21 - and sign up for a free trial for both
04:22 - your students or if you're

04:33 - so the first thing we're going to go
04:34 - ahead and get started with jonathan and
04:36 - his
04:37 - first question from someone from the
04:39 - audience is
04:43 - is um jonathan if you could tell us
04:47 - what was your first job right out of
04:50 - college
04:52 - well um actually it was a job
04:57 - i had actually from
05:00 - since before college and during college
05:03 - as a software developer
05:05 - uh in a
05:11 - you know in a medium sized software firm
05:13 - here in israel so i actually started
05:14 - working for them right when graduating
05:16 - from high school
05:18 - um and
05:21 - it was actually my only job as a
05:24 - software developer
05:26 - before i started code monkey so
05:29 - all the way from the end of high school
05:31 - until i started cold monkey around 10
05:33 - years later
05:34 - okay great and jonathan do you want to
05:36 - tell us um
05:38 - exactly where you're joining us from
05:40 - because i bet many of our
05:41 - audience isn't sure where you are
05:43 - joining us from or where code monkey is
05:44 - based
05:46 - right yeah good good question yeah so
05:48 - i'm joining from tel aviv israel
05:50 - uh this is where we started code monkey
05:55 - uh israel is
05:58 - famous for its vibrant startup scene and
06:00 - code monkey is
06:01 - is another israeli startup company
06:04 - uh we do have offices in the u.s where i
06:07 - spent
06:08 - a year and a half while building the
06:10 - company
06:11 - um but now i'm back in tel aviv
06:15 - israel all right great and i see some
06:18 - questions rolling in so we got some
06:19 - great questions that we'll have
06:20 - um this is our um question from the
06:23 - audience this is from miss burroughs
06:25 - she's joining us from
06:26 - jericho new york what was the first
06:28 - thing that you coded
06:31 - it was um a computer game
06:35 - like many like many software developers
06:39 - started early uh in the 90s
06:42 - 1990s also for myself
06:47 - the motivation uh for
06:50 - starting to to learn to code early was
06:53 - wanting to create my own computer games
06:54 - and share them with my classmates so
06:56 - that's what i did
06:58 - uh it was like kind of a quest game
07:01 - which were
07:02 - it's a genre that was popular in the 90s
07:04 - and but the quest
07:06 - was happening in the houses of my my
07:09 - classroom buddies sort of so we had to
07:11 - go
07:12 - around their rooms and and
07:15 - and houses in the computer game and
07:19 - find all kind of treasures and hints and
07:23 - so mysteries and stuff
07:25 - oh very cool
07:28 - all right so let's go ahead with our
07:30 - next question and so
07:32 - where um what was the first programming
07:35 - language
07:36 - that you learned
07:39 - so that was called uh logo
07:43 - it actually provided a lot of
07:46 - inspiration also later for code monkey
07:49 - so logo is a programming language that
07:51 - was developed
07:52 - in the 70s in mit
07:56 - for the purpose of teaching kids to code
07:58 - so it's a special programming language
08:00 - that was designed to make it easy for
08:03 - children back then in the 70s and 80s
08:06 - to experiment with coding so computers
08:08 - back then were very basic they were only
08:10 - black and white screens and no advanced
08:13 - graphics and internet like you have
08:15 - today
08:16 - so basically what you would do on logo
08:18 - is write small programs like you see
08:20 - here on the screen
08:22 - that would just draw uh those
08:25 - simple geometric shapes on screen so
08:29 - i'm sure that's for kids today and for
08:30 - people today this looks far from
08:32 - exciting but
08:34 - uh you have to remember this was the 80s
08:36 - so
08:38 - anything happening on a computer was
08:40 - exciting for us back then
08:42 - and that was the way to learn to code
08:45 - for kids
08:46 - in those days okay
08:49 - great and another one from the audience
08:52 - this is mrs
08:53 - she she is joining us from richmond
08:55 - canada
08:56 - um and ms she have something in common
08:59 - zack is actually from canada himself as
09:01 - well um where did the idea
09:04 - for code monkey come from
09:07 - so like i said i started early both my
09:10 - parents are are were you were software
09:13 - engineers so
09:14 - they they put me on like us coding
09:16 - summer camp
09:17 - when i was like eight years old in here
09:21 - um and so i started early and then when
09:24 - i graduated high school i started my own
09:26 - coding courses for
09:28 - children in israel
09:31 - uh and it was like you know this sort of
09:34 - like uh
09:37 - community center uh in a town
09:40 - in the south of israel um
09:44 - and a lot of those kids uh were coming
09:47 - from
09:49 - like limited resources background sort
09:52 - of
09:55 - underprivileged communities and
09:58 - i created these these coding courses for
10:00 - for them which i gave them personally in
10:02 - class but before each class i created
10:04 - like those
10:05 - game like puzzles or challenges that you
10:08 - need to solve
10:09 - using code and i was still using the
10:11 - same programming language that i used
10:13 - for learning logo from mit but it had
10:16 - feature graphics already it was the year
10:18 - 2000
10:19 - 2001 and i was amazed to see how quickly
10:23 - kids
10:24 - can learn to code that way and how
10:28 - uh effective and how um
10:32 - teaching kids to code could be as a
10:34 - neighbor for
10:35 - like future career and uh
10:39 - and things like that so so that was that
10:42 - was that
10:43 - the main you know inspiration for
10:46 - starting code monkey as a company 10
10:47 - years later
10:54 - i realized i was muted sorry about that
10:56 - um so the idea for code monkey came from
10:58 - when you were working with
11:00 - students younger students and at-risk
11:03 - students
11:04 - so that's really great a good question
11:07 - i'm just going to skip around for just a
11:09 - second because another person had asked
11:10 - this question
11:12 - why did you choose a monkey for code
11:14 - monkey
11:15 - did you do any market research or are
11:18 - you just a super big fan
11:19 - of monkeys so
11:23 - that's a great question so actually the
11:27 - the the the specific concept of using uh
11:30 - monkey catching bananas and calling the
11:32 - game code monkey and the comedy called
11:33 - monkey
11:34 - this side specifically wasn't mine it
11:36 - was my brothers i started called monkey
11:38 - with my young brother
11:39 - who was the main game developer and the
11:42 - cto
11:43 - of the company uh and he came up with
11:46 - this idea because
11:48 - it's kind of a it's kind of like an
11:50 - internal joke so
11:51 - among pro uh stuff teams of software
11:54 - developers uh
11:56 - the term code monkey is used uh
12:00 - sort of like as a joke as a term to to
12:03 - describe the
12:05 - the most beginner coder in the group the
12:07 - one that you
12:08 - give the most simple coding tasks to so
12:10 - he's like the code monkey he's doing the
12:12 - the simple work uh like a friendly joke
12:16 - among coders so the the term already
12:19 - existed code monkey and we just decided
12:21 - to use it as
12:22 - as the theme and the title for for our
12:25 - game and company
12:30 - great um this one is from the audience
12:33 - this one is from
12:34 - miss c rodella she's joining us from
12:38 - chatham
12:38 - new jersey so sorry if i put your your
12:40 - name there um what is code monkey
12:42 - currently
12:43 - working on
12:47 - oh wow a lot of stuff so today
12:50 - code monkey is being used by a player
12:54 - 20 million students all over the world
12:56 - in israel in the usa
12:58 - in china
13:01 - in australia almost any country in the
13:04 - world
13:05 - um a lot of things we've been working on
13:08 - recently
13:10 - are solving needs that came as a result
13:12 - of
13:13 - frequent kobe 19 closures so a lot of
13:17 - features that would allow
13:19 - an easier experience for teaching
13:21 - remotely
13:22 - and for self-learning from home
13:26 - so a lot of the work naturally recently
13:30 - is focused around those special needs
13:33 - presented
13:34 - by the the corona pandemic
13:39 - okay great all right our next question
13:43 - is what is what was the most
13:46 - challenging part of starting your own
13:48 - company and
13:50 - what has been the most meaningful um
13:57 - so the most challenging part
14:00 - i guess uh was to convince
14:04 - because you need money to start a
14:06 - company like code monk
14:07 - developer osmani graphic designers web
14:11 - servers and all of that cloud servers
14:14 - marketing offices so you need money and
14:17 - uh
14:17 - so you need to sort of persuade i need
14:19 - to persuade
14:20 - uh investors uh
14:24 - that teaching kids to code or creating
14:26 - creating tools for teaching kids to code
14:28 - could become
14:29 - also a sustainable business like
14:31 - everyone agreed that it would be a very
14:33 - good product and children would
14:35 - enjoy it and teacher would enjoy it but
14:36 - the most challenging part was to
14:38 - convince
14:39 - investor that it could also create a
14:41 - good business
14:45 - so that was the most challenging part
14:48 - um and the most meaningful part
14:53 - when started the company so our first
14:56 - big success story was in our home
14:58 - country in israel
15:00 - so code monkey was adopted by by the
15:02 - national ministry of education here in
15:04 - israel
15:05 - and they used it to create like a
15:07 - national coding olympics
15:09 - between teams of students from from
15:11 - schools all over the country
15:13 - and what was very meaningful and
15:15 - exciting to see there
15:16 - uh that this many of the schools that
15:20 - did
15:20 - best on code monkey were actually
15:22 - schools from
15:23 - very far away villages in israel
15:26 - that again were school that are serving
15:29 - a
15:32 - community like low resources community a
15:34 - lot of students that didn't even have
15:36 - computers or internet connection at home
15:38 - they would go to school to school
15:41 - in the afternoon with their parents or
15:43 - volunteering teachers to
15:45 - to to develop their coding skills and
15:49 - and and compete in this national coding
15:53 - olympics
15:56 - great okay let's check out
16:00 - our next question why is
16:04 - coding important for future employment
16:10 - um so beyond
16:14 - you know the the increasing the the
16:18 - always increasing demand for software
16:21 - developer like
16:22 - you see more and more needing in
16:24 - software developers in the industry like
16:26 - the industries the software industry is
16:28 - growing every year
16:29 - uh learning to code is important for
16:32 - future employment because
16:34 - uh nowadays even if you don't pursue a
16:37 - career in coding
16:39 - almost anything you do uh
16:42 - interacts with with code either
16:46 - if you're working in marketing for
16:48 - example which used to be
16:51 - uh mainly offline but now most of the
16:54 - marketing budgets are spent online on
16:56 - online marketing
16:57 - and uh it doesn't mean that you have to
17:00 - write code yourself in order to work in
17:02 - marketing today but
17:03 - but if you don't understand how code
17:05 - work and how the internet works and how
17:06 - websites work
17:08 - it would be very hard for you to to be
17:11 - to excel
17:12 - in something like that and the same goes
17:14 - for research
17:16 - academia finance
17:20 - health medicine um
17:23 - [Music]
17:24 - there isn't a field today that is not
17:28 - interacting with with software
17:30 - constantly so
17:32 - so even if you don't plan to become a
17:34 - coder being able to
17:36 - understand how computers work and how
17:38 - computer programs operate
17:40 - uh would give you a very important
17:43 - advantage no matter what you choose as
17:46 - your future career
17:48 - great and this one is also from the
17:51 - audience as well this is mrs
17:52 - edison she is joining us for sorry
17:56 - she's joining us from new jersey what
17:58 - courses would you advise
18:00 - students to take in high school and in
18:02 - college
18:05 - oh wow so uh so actually my
18:08 - my best advice would be to take courses
18:12 - that really excite you and that are
18:15 - really interesting for you
18:17 - uh so as as much as i think learning to
18:21 - code
18:21 - is fun and important if if
18:25 - students if a certain student doesn't
18:27 - feel that way
18:28 - then i wouldn't recommend taking that as
18:30 - a high school course
18:31 - i think uh the most important thing is
18:33 - is to learn
18:35 - you know follow sort of your inner inner
18:37 - motivation and inner
18:39 - natural uh interest
18:46 - that would be my advice
18:50 - okay great um so can you tell us
18:54 - some of the other jobs that are um
18:56 - associated with codemonkey and
18:58 - can you tell us also your role within
19:00 - the organization
19:03 - yeah so my role today i'm the ceo i'm
19:06 - managing the organization so i
19:08 - i don't get to do any coding myself
19:10 - anymore which is a pity because i always
19:12 - enjoy that very much but uh
19:16 - yeah today today
19:20 - i'm doing strictly with managing the
19:23 - company and managing other employees and
19:25 - teams and
19:26 - uh setting goals and strategy
19:30 - uh and things like that
19:33 - um but other roles in the company so
19:36 - obviously we have a
19:38 - product team which consists mainly of
19:40 - software developers they
19:42 - develop and maintain the code monkey
19:43 - platform they develop the different
19:45 - games and courses
19:46 - we have the pedagogy team which is in
19:49 - charge of
19:50 - creating the coding courses on top of
19:53 - the coding platform
19:56 - so those are like computer science
19:57 - teachers usually
20:00 - we have the marketing team sales team
20:04 - and the customer success team uh which
20:07 - is doing
20:08 - uh maybe the most important job which is
20:10 - to make sure that
20:11 - schools and and families that chose to
20:14 - purchase
20:15 - uh code monkey subscription and use code
20:17 - monkey as their
20:18 - computer science education platform uh
20:22 - actually are actually successful in
20:24 - implementing
20:25 - uh our technology and content
20:29 - in their homes or or classrooms
20:34 - great all right so i
20:38 - am just having an issue here with my
20:41 - screen so sorry about that you guys
20:46 - okay
20:49 - all right so we are going to um
20:55 - ask another question here in five years
20:58 - where do you hope code monkey is
21:04 - um good question um
21:06 - [Music]
21:11 - well basically we want to continue what
21:14 - we're doing uh
21:16 - now but sort of to ex extend the
21:20 - curriculum
21:21 - uh we see a trend globally of computer
21:24 - science gradually becoming
21:26 - uh transitioning from being sort of uh
21:30 - an extracurricular optional course to
21:33 - gradually become part part of the core
21:35 - curriculum
21:37 - so as that happens i hope to see code
21:40 - monkey
21:42 - mature uh accordingly
21:45 - uh from sort of just uh
21:48 - uh like specific
21:52 - courses company a company that provides
21:55 - specific courses in computer science to
21:56 - a company that provides
21:58 - a full computer science curriculum for
22:01 - k-12
22:02 - uh including all the aspects that are
22:05 - required
22:06 - uh from from a full curriculum solution
22:09 - so that means also teacher training
22:11 - assessment
22:13 - and also of course a full pathway of
22:15 - courses from kindergarten
22:18 - all the way to 12th grade
22:30 - all right great i'm just pulling up
22:32 - another
22:33 - question here um if you could tell
22:37 - your younger self thing
22:40 - what would it be and if you could tell
22:42 - your future self one thing what would it
22:44 - be
22:46 - oh those are tough ones um
22:49 - my younger self what would it be um
23:01 - probably um
23:06 - to be uh patients
23:10 - more patients i i guess uh i remember
23:12 - when we
23:13 - wanted to start code monkey the first
23:15 - time it was too early it was the year
23:16 - 2007
23:18 - and nobody really cared that much about
23:21 - computer science education for our young
23:23 - kids and we just failed
23:24 - miserably uh and
23:27 - and about like seven years later coding
23:30 - for kids became a trend and and then we
23:32 - we
23:33 - managed to start the company
23:34 - successfully but in between
23:36 - the waiting was kind of frustrating for
23:38 - me because i always knew that's what i
23:40 - wanted to do
23:40 - so uh in retrospective you know if
23:44 - someone would have told me
23:45 - don't worry the time will come like uh
23:48 - just be patient uh
23:50 - i guess it would have been an easier
23:53 - experience for me
23:55 - um and
23:59 - um what can i tell my future self
24:03 - um i guess
24:06 - uh to always stop once in a while
24:10 - what you're doing and then try to to
24:12 - remember
24:14 - uh why did you start doing it in the
24:16 - first place like what was your initial
24:18 - motivation
24:19 - uh because it's easy sort of to lose
24:22 - track
24:23 - once you you get busy uh trying to
24:27 - achieve your different goals
24:28 - to lose track of your initial motivation
24:31 - why did you start this in the first
24:33 - place
24:34 - uh so i would sort of remind my future
24:37 - self
24:38 - uh why why why did we start this in the
24:41 - in the first place
24:44 - okay those are all really good um
24:47 - feedback
24:49 - and tips for our students um
24:52 - another question i'm gonna we have one
24:54 - question here now we're gonna open it up
24:56 - for q a
24:57 - for um our students and for our teachers
25:01 - and so because we're out of our own
25:03 - questions here and we want to
25:04 - leave time for your questions as well um
25:07 - one question that i know you already
25:09 - answered privately in the
25:10 - in our q a here is when was code monkey
25:14 - made
25:17 - so the first version was created
25:20 - late 2014
25:25 - it was really ridiculous we didn't have
25:27 - an animator in the team yet so my
25:29 - brother the
25:30 - the game designer the coder he did uh he
25:32 - drew the characters himself
25:35 - uh it was really amateur
25:38 - looking but but it has a charm you know
25:40 - like a sort of a
25:42 - homemade version of of code monkey
25:48 - very cool um what is your favorite part
25:52 - and this comes from paige bestop and her
25:55 - um
25:56 - in her classroom what is your favorite
25:58 - part of code monkey
26:00 - of the game or um
26:04 - i'm not exactly sure i know that
26:08 - i know that paige also raised her hand
26:10 - so maybe we can ask
26:12 - paige and have her answer that question
26:16 - find her oh there's quite a few of her
26:19 - there so paige if you want to raise your
26:21 - hand
26:22 - i can allow you to speak there so maybe
26:25 - we take another question why she's doing
26:27 - that um
26:28 - do you enjoy coding lion joke
26:31 - yeah i enjoyed coding very much i don't
26:34 - get to do this
26:35 - as much anymore but actually now my
26:38 - favorite part
26:40 - in my job in code monkey is meeting
26:42 - students like visiting
26:45 - classrooms that are using code monkey
26:49 - it's harder now with all the
26:51 - restrictions on travel and
26:53 - and schools in general but when we were
26:56 - still able to do that that was my
26:57 - favorite part meeting students that are
26:59 - in teacher that are using code monkey
27:01 - and
27:02 - hearing their feedback and their
27:03 - experience and the best ideas always
27:06 - come from teachers
27:07 - and their students great
27:11 - we have a question from samantha and she
27:14 - wanted to know
27:14 - how many people work for code monkey
27:20 - um that's a
27:23 - good question so um
27:27 - it's a small company actually um
27:32 - it's we have like full-time employees we
27:35 - have around
27:37 - 15 in israel uh creating the product and
27:40 - the platform and doing all the back
27:42 - office stuff and
27:43 - roughly another five in the us uh
27:46 - and actually code monkey became very big
27:49 - in in
27:49 - china recently the last two or three
27:52 - years
27:53 - so that's pretty amazing code
27:55 - [Music]
27:57 - code monkey classes in china are growing
28:00 - extremely fast and over
28:02 - there there are around
28:06 - 70 almost 100 full-time employees
28:11 - working in delivering code monkey
28:13 - courses
28:14 - to to after school students in china
28:19 - it's a lot of teachers which is a lot of
28:21 - people working
28:22 - there on that side of the that side of
28:24 - the world so it's great to see
28:25 - us being or that we are working with
28:28 - students all across the world
28:30 - we have another question here
28:33 - which of the code monkey courses are
28:37 - your favorite my personal favorite is
28:40 - dota does math but that's just my
28:42 - personal favorite so what is your
28:43 - favorite
28:45 - um my favorite will always be
28:48 - coding adventure part 1 because that
28:52 - course that i was still
28:56 - mostly personally involved in creating
28:58 - every
28:59 - small detail up because we were still
29:01 - just a very small company just like
29:02 - three or four people
29:04 - uh but it's just because my you know my
29:07 - personal
29:08 - uh part in creating that course i think
29:10 - all the courses are great
29:12 - and they're actually getting better and
29:14 - better as you go along
29:17 - great um another question is have you
29:20 - ever considered
29:21 - um making swag like t-shirts and things
29:24 - like that
29:26 - oh we have tons of swag it's just hard
29:28 - to get the swag across now with no
29:29 - conferences because of the
29:31 - the uh because of kobe uh
29:34 - but i'm sure that that's soon enough
29:38 - we'll be back on on the different
29:40 - easties and
29:41 - uh other other k-12 conferences
29:44 - and and we're all invited to visit our
29:47 - booth and and grab
29:48 - some t-shirts and and
29:51 - [Music]
29:52 - uh peens stickers we have them all
29:57 - back there we do we have quite quite a
30:00 - bit of that for
30:01 - our um for our teachers
30:05 - um so we already asked you this question
30:07 - is code monkey worldwide and we will say
30:09 - that code monkey is worldwide we do
30:12 - have about how many users you say
30:14 - jonathan now 20 million users
30:17 - 20 million worldwide yeah okay great
30:23 - so we do have quite a few uh users
30:27 - worldwide
30:28 - um so outside of coding and
30:31 - what you do at code monkey what are some
30:33 - of your favorite activities to do
30:35 - outside of code monkey
30:39 - um sorry can you repeat it like like
30:42 - what are some of your hobbies that you
30:44 - do outside of just
30:45 - owning and being in the monkey company
30:49 - well i became a father
30:51 - a few years ago so i think my my
30:54 - my favorite thing to do now is spending
30:56 - time with my daughter she
30:58 - she turned three recently she's amazing
31:01 - uh but inside of that i like
31:04 - snowboarding
31:05 - i play tennis and i started
31:08 - boxing recently oh very nice
31:13 - do any of the students or teachers have
31:16 - a question that they would like
31:18 - to ask that we can unmute you and you
31:21 - can
31:21 - join us and ask jonathan a question i
31:24 - know that we had
31:25 - a question um
31:29 - about how do you feel about the success
31:31 - of the hour of code
31:36 - um so the success of the hour of code
31:41 - that's an amazing thing and without the
31:43 - success of the hour of code and code.org
31:45 - the
31:47 - code monkey couldn't have been as
31:48 - successful
31:50 - it's just important to me that um
31:55 - the hour of code will be treated
31:58 - as a first step sort of means to an and
32:01 - not
32:02 - the ultimate uh sort of result of
32:05 - computer science education or the strand
32:07 - of teaching kids to code
32:09 - because the hour of code is is is
32:11 - amazing uh as
32:14 - an exposure event exposing teachers and
32:17 - students
32:18 - to coding but but it's important to go
32:21 - beyond that to go beyond just
32:23 - an hour of code and really try to
32:26 - to implement at least a semester-long
32:29 - course
32:32 - in a classroom great
32:36 - and another question and we do love the
32:38 - hour of code that's how i started coding
32:40 - myself
32:41 - how long did it take you to get
32:44 - good at coding and how many hours do you
32:47 - think you invested on your own time to
32:50 - learn
32:52 - huh that's that's a trick question
32:54 - because if you ask my brother i never
32:56 - got good at programming so uh
32:58 - [Music]
32:59 - that's why he's a cdo but uh
33:01 - [Music]
33:03 - do you want to tell them what a cto is
33:04 - because i i don't know a lot of the
33:06 - students know
33:07 - it's the the acronyms chief technology
33:10 - officer but he's like the the chief
33:12 - coder
33:13 - um yeah but but
33:17 - yeah to get real good at coding
33:20 - uh i remember reading an article once
33:23 - there used to be when
33:24 - when coding became like a very desirable
33:29 - sort of job skill so a lot of
33:32 - businesses started advertising
33:35 - courses saying become a developer in
33:38 - just
33:39 - uh two months or in just uh i don't know
33:42 - 60 you know two weeks or crazy promises
33:46 - like that
33:47 - become an expert coder in in just one
33:49 - semester
33:51 - and then i read an article saying the
33:53 - truth is to become a really good coder
33:55 - it's like
33:56 - it takes like 10 years like you need to
33:58 - learn and then you need to get a job and
34:00 - you need to learn from your
34:02 - the more ex the more experienced coders
34:04 - around you and you need to learn from
34:05 - mistakes and to see projects succeed and
34:07 - projects failing
34:10 - that job experience is is something that
34:13 - you cannot replace and
34:14 - you cannot fast forward it so
34:17 - [Music]
34:19 - it's like a lifelong
34:23 - craft that that you master and you
34:25 - become better and better in
34:28 - do you think that is that why you're so
34:31 - passionate about having students learn
34:33 - how to code at a
34:34 - much younger age or do you find
34:37 - that it doesn't matter at what age they
34:39 - begin coding
34:41 - um it does matter
34:44 - i remember in college i had a much
34:47 - easier time i started computer science
34:49 - major in computer science also in
34:50 - college and i thought it was much easier
34:52 - for me
34:52 - and for other students that had the
34:55 - early start
34:56 - then than it was for other brilliant
34:58 - students that were coding in college for
35:00 - the first time so it's like learning
35:02 - a language that the earlier you start
35:04 - the easier it is
35:05 - for you
35:09 - great okay so it seems that nobody's
35:13 - raising their hand to jump on here to
35:15 - ask us questions so we'll round out here
35:18 - with um
35:19 - just one more question
35:22 - and that would be
35:26 - [Music]
35:28 - um
35:31 - i don't know i was just sorry i just
35:33 - forgot i was gonna say
35:34 - um why did you guys choose to use
35:38 - coffeescript as the main language for
35:40 - coding adventure
35:42 - um i thought i still think it's the best
35:47 - gateway language because it's very
35:50 - it's a very user friendly like coder
35:53 - friendly language
35:54 - the syntax is very clean very
35:57 - compact uh no semicolons and other
36:01 - crazy characters that you need to to
36:04 - insert every line
36:05 - uh so it's very coder friendly very easy
36:09 - to learn on one hand and on the other
36:10 - end it's
36:11 - super useful because it's actually a
36:14 - version of
36:15 - javascript which is the most uh
36:18 - useful language uh in the world today
36:21 - because it's sort of like the
36:22 - programming language of the internet of
36:24 - the
36:24 - web browsers on every phone every tablet
36:27 - every
36:28 - laptop or computer so it's like the best
36:32 - of both world it's both
36:33 - very easy to use and very powerful so
36:36 - that's why we chose it
36:38 - great all right um
36:42 - well we just want to thank everybody so
36:45 - much for joining us and dealing with our
36:47 - technical difficulties we do have
36:48 - another webinar
36:49 - this wednesday with our other co-founder
36:52 - and that is
36:53 - idoshore and that's jonathan's brother
36:56 - so he'll tell his story and answer a few
36:58 - questions from his own perspective
37:00 - and we just want to thank jonathan so
37:02 - much for taking time out of his day and
37:04 - it's very late in israel so we're happy
37:06 - that he was able to join us

37:12 - joining us during
37:13 - this week's event and we hope that you
37:17 - spend some time this week
37:19 - exploring some coding courses and
37:20 - hopefully exploring the code monkey
37:22 - courses and our newest course our space
37:24 - monkey
37:25 - space adventure course as well and again
37:27 - we just want to thank you from everybody
37:29 - on the code monkey team for joining us

Cleaned transcript:

all right so this is our very first as i mentioned our very first coding webinar that is specifically for both students and for teachers and so we want to be able to give both our teachers and our students the ability to access today's webinar so today's webinar is for students and teachers the code monkey team wants to thank you so much for joining us for today's webinar and bringing your questions with you this webinar is something new and we are very excited to have you here with us today our goal of today's webinar is that you get the chance to see how learning to program can take you beyond the walls of your classroom this year has been anything but normal as we know for both students and for teachers and as if it's done anything during this time it's showing us the ability and the importance of going digital and if you would like to ask any questions during today's live event please just go ahead and raise your hand you'll see that along the bottom of the zoom and if we don't get to your questions we will have some time at the end for some q a we're going to be doing a live interview session with our founder and if you have any questions you can also enter those within the q a box so please follow us on twitter facebook instagram at codemonkeystu and let's get let's get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world so like we mentioned today is the hour of code of fireside chat with our founder jonathan shore and like i mentioned you can follow us on all of our social media channels but first we're going to go ahead and take some time to meet our team today and so in order to meet our team i'll first by introducing myself so you can know who i am and my name is lena saleh i am the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey you can email me or follow me alongside codemonkey's twitter i will be leading today's interview we also have zach isakao he is joining us from israel so we'll get a chance to talk a little bit about why he might be joining us oh there he is alongside the bottom there hi everyone and he is joining us from israel and he is our director of sales and then i'll let our next panelist jump in yeah hi everybody i'm brett esquileson vp of sales here so i'm excited to be a part of this and excited about bringing computer science education to more students so thank you great and last but not least we're gonna go ahead and meet today's founder or our founder that's joining us today and we're gonna get to hear a little bit more about his story and hear from all of you all right jonathan would you like to go ahead and introduce yourself yeah hi everybody i'm glad to be excited to to participate and share my story alrighty so we are going to go ahead and get started with today's um interview session with jonathan and so we're just really excited to be sharing this all with you as well like we mentioned so today is going to be an interview style of webinar where we have pulled you all on your questions and what types of things you wanted to see so first we're going to talk about what is code monkey our founder story in an interview and then some live q a so just a little bit about code monkey if none of you have been joining us during any of our hour code events or if you have been maybe learning about us in school we are a fully gamified coding platform really designed to put both students and teachers in the driver's seat it's really fun to play and we really want our students to learn a deep dive into the coding foundation so if you're not sure about that you can always visit us at our webpage at www.codemonkey.com and sign up for a free trial for both your students or if you're our parent joining us as well and then we're going to do a live q a here at the end so the first thing we're going to go ahead and get started with jonathan and his first question from someone from the audience is is um jonathan if you could tell us what was your first job right out of college well um actually it was a job i had actually from since before college and during college as a software developer uh in a you know in a medium sized software firm here in israel so i actually started working for them right when graduating from high school um and it was actually my only job as a software developer before i started code monkey so all the way from the end of high school until i started cold monkey around 10 years later okay great and jonathan do you want to tell us um exactly where you're joining us from because i bet many of our audience isn't sure where you are joining us from or where code monkey is based right yeah good good question yeah so i'm joining from tel aviv israel uh this is where we started code monkey uh israel is famous for its vibrant startup scene and code monkey is is another israeli startup company uh we do have offices in the u.s where i spent a year and a half while building the company um but now i'm back in tel aviv israel all right great and i see some questions rolling in so we got some great questions that we'll have um this is our um question from the audience this is from miss burroughs she's joining us from jericho new york what was the first thing that you coded it was um a computer game like many like many software developers started early uh in the 90s 1990s also for myself the motivation uh for starting to to learn to code early was wanting to create my own computer games and share them with my classmates so that's what i did uh it was like kind of a quest game which were it's a genre that was popular in the 90s and but the quest was happening in the houses of my my classroom buddies sort of so we had to go around their rooms and and and houses in the computer game and find all kind of treasures and hints and so mysteries and stuff oh very cool all right so let's go ahead with our next question and so where um what was the first programming language that you learned so that was called uh logo it actually provided a lot of inspiration also later for code monkey so logo is a programming language that was developed in the 70s in mit for the purpose of teaching kids to code so it's a special programming language that was designed to make it easy for children back then in the 70s and 80s to experiment with coding so computers back then were very basic they were only black and white screens and no advanced graphics and internet like you have today so basically what you would do on logo is write small programs like you see here on the screen that would just draw uh those simple geometric shapes on screen so i'm sure that's for kids today and for people today this looks far from exciting but uh you have to remember this was the 80s so anything happening on a computer was exciting for us back then and that was the way to learn to code for kids in those days okay great and another one from the audience this is mrs she she is joining us from richmond canada um and ms she have something in common zack is actually from canada himself as well um where did the idea for code monkey come from so like i said i started early both my parents are are were you were software engineers so they they put me on like us coding summer camp when i was like eight years old in here um and so i started early and then when i graduated high school i started my own coding courses for children in israel uh and it was like you know this sort of like uh community center uh in a town in the south of israel um and a lot of those kids uh were coming from like limited resources background sort of underprivileged communities and i created these these coding courses for for them which i gave them personally in class but before each class i created like those game like puzzles or challenges that you need to solve using code and i was still using the same programming language that i used for learning logo from mit but it had feature graphics already it was the year 2000 2001 and i was amazed to see how quickly kids can learn to code that way and how uh effective and how um teaching kids to code could be as a neighbor for like future career and uh and things like that so so that was that was that the main you know inspiration for starting code monkey as a company 10 years later i realized i was muted sorry about that um so the idea for code monkey came from when you were working with students younger students and atrisk students so that's really great a good question i'm just going to skip around for just a second because another person had asked this question why did you choose a monkey for code monkey did you do any market research or are you just a super big fan of monkeys so that's a great question so actually the the the the specific concept of using uh monkey catching bananas and calling the game code monkey and the comedy called monkey this side specifically wasn't mine it was my brothers i started called monkey with my young brother who was the main game developer and the cto of the company uh and he came up with this idea because it's kind of a it's kind of like an internal joke so among pro uh stuff teams of software developers uh the term code monkey is used uh sort of like as a joke as a term to to describe the the most beginner coder in the group the one that you give the most simple coding tasks to so he's like the code monkey he's doing the the simple work uh like a friendly joke among coders so the the term already existed code monkey and we just decided to use it as as the theme and the title for for our game and company great um this one is from the audience this one is from miss c rodella she's joining us from chatham new jersey so sorry if i put your your name there um what is code monkey currently working on oh wow a lot of stuff so today code monkey is being used by a player 20 million students all over the world in israel in the usa in china in australia almost any country in the world um a lot of things we've been working on recently are solving needs that came as a result of frequent kobe 19 closures so a lot of features that would allow an easier experience for teaching remotely and for selflearning from home so a lot of the work naturally recently is focused around those special needs presented by the the corona pandemic okay great all right our next question is what is what was the most challenging part of starting your own company and what has been the most meaningful um so the most challenging part i guess uh was to convince because you need money to start a company like code monk developer osmani graphic designers web servers and all of that cloud servers marketing offices so you need money and uh so you need to sort of persuade i need to persuade uh investors uh that teaching kids to code or creating creating tools for teaching kids to code could become also a sustainable business like everyone agreed that it would be a very good product and children would enjoy it and teacher would enjoy it but the most challenging part was to convince investor that it could also create a good business so that was the most challenging part um and the most meaningful part when started the company so our first big success story was in our home country in israel so code monkey was adopted by by the national ministry of education here in israel and they used it to create like a national coding olympics between teams of students from from schools all over the country and what was very meaningful and exciting to see there uh that this many of the schools that did best on code monkey were actually schools from very far away villages in israel that again were school that are serving a community like low resources community a lot of students that didn't even have computers or internet connection at home they would go to school to school in the afternoon with their parents or volunteering teachers to to to develop their coding skills and and and compete in this national coding olympics great okay let's check out our next question why is coding important for future employment um so beyond you know the the increasing the the always increasing demand for software developer like you see more and more needing in software developers in the industry like the industries the software industry is growing every year uh learning to code is important for future employment because uh nowadays even if you don't pursue a career in coding almost anything you do uh interacts with with code either if you're working in marketing for example which used to be uh mainly offline but now most of the marketing budgets are spent online on online marketing and uh it doesn't mean that you have to write code yourself in order to work in marketing today but but if you don't understand how code work and how the internet works and how websites work it would be very hard for you to to be to excel in something like that and the same goes for research academia finance health medicine um there isn't a field today that is not interacting with with software constantly so so even if you don't plan to become a coder being able to understand how computers work and how computer programs operate uh would give you a very important advantage no matter what you choose as your future career great and this one is also from the audience as well this is mrs edison she is joining us for sorry she's joining us from new jersey what courses would you advise students to take in high school and in college oh wow so uh so actually my my best advice would be to take courses that really excite you and that are really interesting for you uh so as as much as i think learning to code is fun and important if if students if a certain student doesn't feel that way then i wouldn't recommend taking that as a high school course i think uh the most important thing is is to learn you know follow sort of your inner inner motivation and inner natural uh interest that would be my advice okay great um so can you tell us some of the other jobs that are um associated with codemonkey and can you tell us also your role within the organization yeah so my role today i'm the ceo i'm managing the organization so i i don't get to do any coding myself anymore which is a pity because i always enjoy that very much but uh yeah today today i'm doing strictly with managing the company and managing other employees and teams and uh setting goals and strategy uh and things like that um but other roles in the company so obviously we have a product team which consists mainly of software developers they develop and maintain the code monkey platform they develop the different games and courses we have the pedagogy team which is in charge of creating the coding courses on top of the coding platform so those are like computer science teachers usually we have the marketing team sales team and the customer success team uh which is doing uh maybe the most important job which is to make sure that schools and and families that chose to purchase uh code monkey subscription and use code monkey as their computer science education platform uh actually are actually successful in implementing uh our technology and content in their homes or or classrooms great all right so i am just having an issue here with my screen so sorry about that you guys okay all right so we are going to um ask another question here in five years where do you hope code monkey is um good question um well basically we want to continue what we're doing uh now but sort of to ex extend the curriculum uh we see a trend globally of computer science gradually becoming uh transitioning from being sort of uh an extracurricular optional course to gradually become part part of the core curriculum so as that happens i hope to see code monkey mature uh accordingly uh from sort of just uh uh like specific courses company a company that provides specific courses in computer science to a company that provides a full computer science curriculum for k12 uh including all the aspects that are required uh from from a full curriculum solution so that means also teacher training assessment and also of course a full pathway of courses from kindergarten all the way to 12th grade all right great i'm just pulling up another question here um if you could tell your younger self thing what would it be and if you could tell your future self one thing what would it be oh those are tough ones um my younger self what would it be um probably um to be uh patients more patients i i guess uh i remember when we wanted to start code monkey the first time it was too early it was the year 2007 and nobody really cared that much about computer science education for our young kids and we just failed miserably uh and and about like seven years later coding for kids became a trend and and then we we managed to start the company successfully but in between the waiting was kind of frustrating for me because i always knew that's what i wanted to do so uh in retrospective you know if someone would have told me don't worry the time will come like uh just be patient uh i guess it would have been an easier experience for me um and um what can i tell my future self um i guess uh to always stop once in a while what you're doing and then try to to remember uh why did you start doing it in the first place like what was your initial motivation uh because it's easy sort of to lose track once you you get busy uh trying to achieve your different goals to lose track of your initial motivation why did you start this in the first place uh so i would sort of remind my future self uh why why why did we start this in the in the first place okay those are all really good um feedback and tips for our students um another question i'm gonna we have one question here now we're gonna open it up for q a for um our students and for our teachers and so because we're out of our own questions here and we want to leave time for your questions as well um one question that i know you already answered privately in the in our q a here is when was code monkey made so the first version was created late 2014 it was really ridiculous we didn't have an animator in the team yet so my brother the the game designer the coder he did uh he drew the characters himself uh it was really amateur looking but but it has a charm you know like a sort of a homemade version of of code monkey very cool um what is your favorite part and this comes from paige bestop and her um in her classroom what is your favorite part of code monkey of the game or um i'm not exactly sure i know that i know that paige also raised her hand so maybe we can ask paige and have her answer that question find her oh there's quite a few of her there so paige if you want to raise your hand i can allow you to speak there so maybe we take another question why she's doing that um do you enjoy coding lion joke yeah i enjoyed coding very much i don't get to do this as much anymore but actually now my favorite part in my job in code monkey is meeting students like visiting classrooms that are using code monkey it's harder now with all the restrictions on travel and and schools in general but when we were still able to do that that was my favorite part meeting students that are in teacher that are using code monkey and hearing their feedback and their experience and the best ideas always come from teachers and their students great we have a question from samantha and she wanted to know how many people work for code monkey um that's a good question so um it's a small company actually um it's we have like fulltime employees we have around 15 in israel uh creating the product and the platform and doing all the back office stuff and roughly another five in the us uh and actually code monkey became very big in in china recently the last two or three years so that's pretty amazing code code monkey classes in china are growing extremely fast and over there there are around 70 almost 100 fulltime employees working in delivering code monkey courses to to after school students in china it's a lot of teachers which is a lot of people working there on that side of the that side of the world so it's great to see us being or that we are working with students all across the world we have another question here which of the code monkey courses are your favorite my personal favorite is dota does math but that's just my personal favorite so what is your favorite um my favorite will always be coding adventure part 1 because that course that i was still mostly personally involved in creating every small detail up because we were still just a very small company just like three or four people uh but it's just because my you know my personal uh part in creating that course i think all the courses are great and they're actually getting better and better as you go along great um another question is have you ever considered um making swag like tshirts and things like that oh we have tons of swag it's just hard to get the swag across now with no conferences because of the the uh because of kobe uh but i'm sure that that's soon enough we'll be back on on the different easties and uh other other k12 conferences and and we're all invited to visit our booth and and grab some tshirts and and uh peens stickers we have them all back there we do we have quite quite a bit of that for our um for our teachers um so we already asked you this question is code monkey worldwide and we will say that code monkey is worldwide we do have about how many users you say jonathan now 20 million users 20 million worldwide yeah okay great so we do have quite a few uh users worldwide um so outside of coding and what you do at code monkey what are some of your favorite activities to do outside of code monkey um sorry can you repeat it like like what are some of your hobbies that you do outside of just owning and being in the monkey company well i became a father a few years ago so i think my my my favorite thing to do now is spending time with my daughter she she turned three recently she's amazing uh but inside of that i like snowboarding i play tennis and i started boxing recently oh very nice do any of the students or teachers have a question that they would like to ask that we can unmute you and you can join us and ask jonathan a question i know that we had a question um about how do you feel about the success of the hour of code um so the success of the hour of code that's an amazing thing and without the success of the hour of code and code.org the code monkey couldn't have been as successful it's just important to me that um the hour of code will be treated as a first step sort of means to an and not the ultimate uh sort of result of computer science education or the strand of teaching kids to code because the hour of code is is is amazing uh as an exposure event exposing teachers and students to coding but but it's important to go beyond that to go beyond just an hour of code and really try to to implement at least a semesterlong course in a classroom great and another question and we do love the hour of code that's how i started coding myself how long did it take you to get good at coding and how many hours do you think you invested on your own time to learn huh that's that's a trick question because if you ask my brother i never got good at programming so uh that's why he's a cdo but uh do you want to tell them what a cto is because i i don't know a lot of the students know it's the the acronyms chief technology officer but he's like the the chief coder um yeah but but yeah to get real good at coding uh i remember reading an article once there used to be when when coding became like a very desirable sort of job skill so a lot of businesses started advertising courses saying become a developer in just uh two months or in just uh i don't know 60 you know two weeks or crazy promises like that become an expert coder in in just one semester and then i read an article saying the truth is to become a really good coder it's like it takes like 10 years like you need to learn and then you need to get a job and you need to learn from your the more ex the more experienced coders around you and you need to learn from mistakes and to see projects succeed and projects failing that job experience is is something that you cannot replace and you cannot fast forward it so it's like a lifelong craft that that you master and you become better and better in do you think that is that why you're so passionate about having students learn how to code at a much younger age or do you find that it doesn't matter at what age they begin coding um it does matter i remember in college i had a much easier time i started computer science major in computer science also in college and i thought it was much easier for me and for other students that had the early start then than it was for other brilliant students that were coding in college for the first time so it's like learning a language that the earlier you start the easier it is for you great okay so it seems that nobody's raising their hand to jump on here to ask us questions so we'll round out here with um just one more question and that would be um i don't know i was just sorry i just forgot i was gonna say um why did you guys choose to use coffeescript as the main language for coding adventure um i thought i still think it's the best gateway language because it's very it's a very user friendly like coder friendly language the syntax is very clean very compact uh no semicolons and other crazy characters that you need to to insert every line uh so it's very coder friendly very easy to learn on one hand and on the other end it's super useful because it's actually a version of javascript which is the most uh useful language uh in the world today because it's sort of like the programming language of the internet of the web browsers on every phone every tablet every laptop or computer so it's like the best of both world it's both very easy to use and very powerful so that's why we chose it great all right um well we just want to thank everybody so much for joining us and dealing with our technical difficulties we do have another webinar this wednesday with our other cofounder and that is idoshore and that's jonathan's brother so he'll tell his story and answer a few questions from his own perspective and we just want to thank jonathan so much for taking time out of his day and it's very late in israel so we're happy that he was able to join us and so we just want to thank all of the teachers and all of the students for joining us during this week's event and we hope that you spend some time this week exploring some coding courses and hopefully exploring the code monkey courses and our newest course our space monkey space adventure course as well and again we just want to thank you from everybody on the code monkey team for joining us and all that you do to support us and um jonathan do you have anything to add uh i just want to thank everyone as well thank you leena for hosting this thank you brett and zach and and thanks uh thank you all the teachers and students that participated and asked questions like i said this is the the best part of my job interacting with our with our users we agree this is one of our favorite parts as well and if we missed any of your questions or you didn't feel something got answered please tweet out to us or you can email us at info codemonkey.com and as always remember to write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time bye bye
