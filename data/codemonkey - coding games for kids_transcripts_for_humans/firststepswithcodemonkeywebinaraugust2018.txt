00:01 - [Music]
00:03 - good afternoon and welcome to the first
00:05 - code monkey teaching experience today we
00:08 - are going to learn how to teach code
00:09 - monkey in the classroom to look forward
00:11 - to doing so one of the best parts about
00:13 - our platform is that as a teacher you
00:15 - don't need to have any prior experience
00:17 - coding to be able to teach it to your
00:19 - students the code monkey platform will
00:22 - give you all of the tips and tricks that
00:24 - you need to teach coding seamlessly to
00:26 - your students remember coding is not
00:28 - just for one but for all your first
00:31 - steps with code monkey let's just start
00:33 - off with Who I am my name is Lena Saleh
00:36 - and I'm the professional development
00:38 - manager here at code monkey I am a
00:41 - former stem teacher I taught in the
00:42 - classroom as well as I was the T in stem
00:46 - so basically what that means is I wrote
00:48 - scope and sequence for my district and
00:50 - really developed the coding curriculum
00:52 - and kind of what that looked like from K
00:54 - through 12 I also basically helped
00:56 - teachers with any part of T that they
00:58 - need it if they wanted to make a movie
01:00 - or a stop-motion film or any of those
01:01 - things that's what I helped them do I'm
01:04 - professional development leader and so
01:06 - basically what that means is that I've
01:07 - taught in person and online workshops
01:09 - prior to my experience actually here at
01:11 - code monkey I've taught a couple stem
01:14 - conferences and just some different
01:15 - places around the country
01:17 - I'm also an EdTech Austin organizer so
01:20 - here in Austin meetup groups are really
01:23 - thriving part of the culture here and so
01:25 - I am one of the organizers of EdTech
01:28 - Austin and so that basically means we
01:29 - take the merriment of the EdTech
01:31 - companies there's quite a lot of them
01:33 - here in Austin as well as teachers and
01:35 - we kind of marry the partnership amongst
01:37 - both of them I'm following some of the
01:39 - trends and needs that we see in the
01:41 - community I've been in education for
01:44 - well over a decade even when I was in
01:46 - high school I was going back and working
01:48 - inside of classrooms I would try to do
01:51 - as much tutoring as I could and really
01:53 - just wanted to get as much exposure as I
01:56 - could to education because I always knew
01:58 - from a very young age that I wanted to
01:59 - be a teacher and I wanted to learn as
02:02 - much as I could as fast as I could
02:05 - essentially and something else about me
02:07 - is that I'm just really passionate about
02:09 - computer science
02:11 - I coming from a family that isn't really
02:16 - college-educated
02:18 - I didn't really know anything about
02:20 - computer science I thought it was just
02:22 - something that the boys did or I didn't
02:25 - really have much exposure to what was
02:27 - available to me as a career choice or a
02:29 - career pathway and when I left the
02:32 - classroom I walked in and it was a very
02:34 - traditional setting and it was actually
02:36 - kind of sad to me and so I went to a
02:39 - training actually with a co.org I was
02:41 - like oh look at this really cool thing
02:43 - and I fell in love with computer science
02:45 - and ever since then I've just been
02:47 - extremely passionate about it I've
02:48 - taught myself to code back in him both
02:50 - front end as well as my students started
02:53 - surpassing me and I knew I needed to do
02:55 - something different and so that's kind
02:58 - of where my passion came bro all right
03:00 - so here are our objectives for this
03:02 - webinar today and we're gonna learn what
03:04 - CoffeeScript is how to run a lesson in
03:07 - your classroom using code monkey how to
03:09 - work your way through solving code
03:11 - monkey challenges but up to challenge 15
03:13 - is what our main focus will be of the
03:15 - day what a skill mode why we use it how
03:18 - do we keep track of students work and
03:22 - because this is a pre-recorded we're not
03:24 - gonna really do too much on the Q&A part
03:26 - of it but that's just the just an option
03:29 - usually we do with most our webinars
03:31 - what language so let's just start off
03:33 - with first what language to my students
03:36 - code in so if you you should already at
03:38 - this point kind of know what code monkey
03:39 - is but if you don't know code monkey is
03:42 - you program in a language called
03:44 - CoffeeScript and CoffeeScript is a real
03:47 - recognized computer language the golden
03:49 - rule of CoffeeScript is that it's just
03:51 - Java basically what that means is that
03:53 - it's straightforward it's easy to use
03:56 - there's no messy syntax if you've ever
03:57 - done any programming or ever seen it
03:59 - yourself and if you haven't I would
04:01 - recommend kind of maybe just taking a
04:03 - peek in gander at just so you can kind
04:05 - of have an understanding
04:06 - but basically CoffeeScript is the entre
04:09 - so think about like a steak dinner so
04:12 - CoffeeScript is your steak and you don't
04:15 - want to have dinner all by itself just
04:17 - have a steak you usually have potatoes
04:18 - or a side salad or whatever those are
04:20 - all the about are what I would call the
04:22 - syntax so there are things that sir
04:24 - surround the content of the language
04:29 - itself so the challenges that we're
04:32 - going to be looking at today our
04:34 - challenge is zero through four five
04:37 - eleven fourteen and fifteen and that's
04:39 - what we'll stop today
04:42 - so let's just talk about some teaching
04:45 - tips on how to actually teach code
04:48 - monkey and how to really just kind of
04:50 - introduce it to our students so to do so
04:55 - we're gonna need to go into the actual
04:57 - code monkey platform so let's go ahead
04:58 - and get started in and prior to doing so
05:01 - I don't really I'm not going to
05:03 - introduce my students to the platform
05:06 - until I'll kind of discuss what that is
05:09 - later but I'm gonna log in here under my
05:10 - demo account called miss birdie and I
05:13 - just really want the students to have an
05:15 - ease and comfort with the platform and
05:17 - kind of ease in coding with coding
05:20 - before I just set them free inside with
05:22 - the platform because we all know the
05:23 - kids are gonna figure it out but I want
05:25 - them to be able to feel that certain
05:26 - level of success so let's talk about
05:28 - what that looks like so here I am on the
05:30 - code monkey you I'm home page I logged
05:32 - in under my demo account miss birdie and
05:34 - as I scroll down you can see I have some
05:36 - active classrooms we'll talk about what
05:38 - that is we'll also talk about if you
05:39 - have any questions about how to set up
05:40 - your class or homer's where the teacher
05:42 - resources are located and all of that
05:44 - will touch back on that but the nice
05:46 - thing about code monkey is that you have
05:48 - access to all the same courses that your
05:50 - students have access to so what that
05:52 - means is you can code in real time
05:53 - alongside your students this is really
05:56 - great to get you just excited about
05:57 - coding as your students and it's a quick
05:59 - and fun way for you to learn too so the
06:02 - first thing that I'm going to do is I'm
06:04 - going to click on coding adventure part
06:05 - 1 our courses just recently split into 3
06:08 - so we have coding adventure part 1
06:10 - coding adventure part 2 and coding
06:12 - adventure part 3 we change this based on
06:15 - some of the needs of our teachers and
06:17 - just kind of how we were receiving
06:19 - feedback we just felt that it was better
06:21 - manageable in three sections rather than
06:24 - two large courses so here we are I just
06:28 - clicked on coding adventure and as you
06:30 - can see I've already actually completed
06:32 - this course but I'm going to click redo
06:33 - the course if that happens to it at
06:35 - least they redo or begin coding or
06:37 - that we just launched this new narration
06:40 - feature for right now I'm just gonna
06:43 - click out of this I'm going to turn down
06:44 - the sound because the sound can get
06:45 - quite loud I'm gonna leave the sound on
06:47 - just a little bit lower for us all the
06:50 - to get to that control I just clicked on
06:52 - the gears here you can change the game
06:54 - speed I like my game speed to be faster
06:56 - I don't really have the patience
06:58 - necessarily for the slower time so our
07:01 - game speed but a lot of other people do
07:03 - so it's kind of up to you and your
07:05 - preference of what you feel most
07:06 - comfortable so as you can see we're
07:08 - taken here to challenge number 75 and
07:10 - this is pretty challenging so that's not
07:12 - where you'd want to start with your
07:13 - students so the very first thing I start
07:15 - on challenge number zero what I do is I
07:17 - tell students that we're going to begin
07:19 - coding I will actually start by playing
07:22 - this trailer and so it's super cute the
07:25 - kids really like it and it really gives
07:26 - them that buy-in into the game and so
07:28 - basically what happens is that gorilla
07:31 - comes over and basically steals monkeys
07:34 - bananas he cries and that's how the game
07:37 - starts like I said super cute and that
07:41 - definitely a thing that you want to go
07:43 - with your students so something about
07:46 - this is that this is our directions I'm
07:48 - just gonna click out of the directions
07:49 - for now and then I'll refer back to how
07:51 - we kind of get there like I said this is
07:53 - a narration tool it will read the text
07:55 - back to you so in case you have students
07:59 - that are struggling readers or maybe
08:00 - learning English or any of that kind of
08:03 - come that that's there for you as well
08:05 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
08:07 - bring my students to wherever your
08:09 - teaching area is even with my 5th
08:12 - graders when I taught 5th grade and this
08:14 - last year I kind of had a space on the
08:17 - floor I wasn't lucky enough to have the
08:19 - primary grades with big carpets but I
08:23 - have used those in years past and so
08:25 - what I do is I bring all the students
08:28 - down and I step away and I put one of my
08:30 - students in the driver's seat
08:31 - and so in this case I really like to
08:34 - bring up a student who usually is a girl
08:36 - she's not she's not a she's not a coding
08:40 - superstar we don't want a coding
08:41 - superstar you don't want a coding
08:42 - superstar and I'm just gonna mute these
08:45 - sounds for right now can leave the
08:47 - narration on for now
08:49 - but basically I don't want to bring up a
08:51 - coding superstar you don't want to bring
08:53 - up a coding superstar because you want
08:54 - the students to know that you believe in
08:56 - them and if you always are bringing up
08:58 - that student that knows everything or
09:01 - knows at all you know that the students
09:02 - start to lose faith in themselves and
09:04 - they think that you don't trust them the
09:05 - same as you trust the student who's a
09:07 - rock star at everything so like I said
09:09 - I'll bring up a girl
09:10 - I'll have her solve the first two to
09:13 - three challenges and I want a girl that
09:14 - the students still trust they still you
09:17 - know they they trust that she will
09:19 - answer the right things but she's not
09:20 - gonna be the strongest person in the
09:22 - class and so I'm just gonna step away
09:23 - and in this case for me it's Jessica
09:25 - Jessica's gonna be in the driver's seat
09:27 - and I'm gonna step back and I'm gonna
09:28 - take an inquiry role I want to take an
09:31 - inquiry role because like I said I want
09:33 - the students to know that if you've ever
09:37 - met a computer programmer themselves
09:40 - they actually go on Sprint's and they're
09:43 - constantly if you her even look at the
09:44 - memes by themselves they'll basically
09:48 - show you that a lot of times the
09:50 - computer programmers don't understand
09:51 - why something works or why it doesn't
09:52 - work and they're constantly failing what
09:54 - I like to call failing forward so it's
09:57 - okay if they make a mistake then nothing
10:00 - happens but we want to know it's
10:02 - basically the failing forward so what do
10:04 - they do with the mistake that happens so
10:05 - anyway Jessica's sitting in the driver's
10:07 - seat and I at this point really for me I
10:10 - don't care if other kids are chiming in
10:12 - but I kind of train my students a little
10:15 - bit that if a student is kind of sharing
10:18 - out their answers I want Jessica in the
10:22 - driver's seat to maybe ask them okay
10:24 - well why do you think that because you
10:27 - know most the students will kind of
10:28 - figure it out and kind of go with the
10:29 - flow but sometimes you have some other
10:31 - students that have some other ways of
10:33 - solving and we kind of want to maybe
10:34 - they have a new way that we never
10:35 - thought about before
10:36 - so Jessica's sitting in the driver's
10:38 - seat and as you can see here monkeys arm
10:40 - is basically saying something and so in
10:42 - this case we say okay she's gonna figure
10:44 - out that she needs to do something
10:46 - because monkey doesn't move on his own
10:48 - and so she clicks run and her a success
10:52 - and so there's a really cool sound and
10:54 - we'll all open up the sound for this
10:55 - next one and I just want you to note
10:58 - that this is a three star solution for
11:00 - how we solved this answer I'll talk a
11:01 - little bit more about what that look
11:03 - like and then Gordo is our little TA he
11:06 - gives little tips and tricks' kind of
11:07 - along the way directions and some
11:11 - encouraging encouraging features right
11:12 - here so now we're going to go on to our
11:14 - next challenge and I like I said Jessica
11:17 - still in the driver's seat I'm gonna
11:18 - have her quickly click out of the
11:20 - directions in this case because I want
11:22 - her to try to figure out okay what to do
11:24 - so like I said I'll just turn on this
11:26 - rather low just so you can kind of hear
11:29 - the sound so she's gonna need to figure
11:32 - out something and maybe she decides she
11:34 - wants to click run like she had done in
11:35 - the last time and she'll see oops
11:37 - and so this will give essentially tips
11:40 - kind of where the students are in the on
11:44 - the editor so we have like I said in the
11:46 - whites part the editor on the right hand
11:48 - side and then we'll see the actual game
11:50 - running on the left hand side text
11:51 - editors look very similar to this where
11:53 - they have something happening on one
11:54 - side and something running on the other
11:55 - sometimes their flip directions but it
11:58 - doesn't really matter so she's gonna say
11:59 - okay yeah he didn't run fast enough and
12:03 - so this is telling us to do something
12:05 - and she might figure out okay the
12:07 - directions told me to step 15 or she
12:09 - might see this ruler and say hey I want
12:11 - to use that and figure out that I need
12:12 - to do some measurement alongside of
12:14 - there so then she clicks that and she
12:16 - feels success in yay and so the stars
12:19 - really just get the students excited as
12:21 - well as these noises they love the
12:23 - noises and that's great we want them to
12:26 - be just as excited about coding as we
12:28 - are so when we go to the next challenge
12:30 - and here is the introduction of the
12:34 - ruler and so if she hasn't used the
12:38 - ruler in the previous challenge she
12:40 - might be seeing that this is
12:41 - demonstrating and so at this point all
12:42 - the kids are getting excited step
12:43 - step-step we know you need a step and so
12:45 - she'll see here that you can't just step
12:47 - 0 she's gonna need to make a change and
12:49 - so she follows the directions and
12:51 - hopefully all the students are chiming
12:53 - in at this point getting super excited
12:54 - she was gonna say okay we need to step
12:56 - 20 and she's gonna see see kind of what
13:01 - that success looks like I'm gonna reap
13:03 - replay this for you just really quickly
13:05 - so let's say that Jessica didn't change
13:08 - this first one and she decided to type
13:10 - it out and she decided to type it out in
13:13 - this way let's take a look at kind of
13:15 - what happen
13:16 - here so we'll notice this was only a
13:22 - one-star solution and this is a one-star
13:25 - solution because it instead of taking on
13:28 - a much shorter pathway of step 20 which
13:31 - is a three star solution we see that
13:33 - Jessica had to basically span out so it
13:36 - wasn't the shortest most concise way now
13:38 - did she get the banana absolutely but
13:41 - she didn't get it in the shortest way
13:42 - possible and so at this time you could
13:45 - talk about that or we can just kind of
13:46 - keep going to kind of recognize kind of
13:49 - what that looks like and we could
13:50 - resolve this and say okay Jessica we
13:51 - really I really want you to try to get
13:53 - three stars in the solution and then
13:55 - hopefully she can see okay I need to be
13:58 - doing this and feel that sense of
13:59 - success so now Jessica's come up the
14:03 - students are getting pumped about this
14:04 - activity I'm gonna bring up another
14:05 - student and the student is Luis Luis is
14:09 - sorry I meant to click go to the next
14:12 - challenge so if that happens to you just
14:14 - go ahead and you can click three or you
14:15 - can click run again I just kind of type
14:17 - that into the browser and so this time
14:19 - I'm going to bring up Louise and louise
14:21 - has been watching he's been sitting in
14:23 - the audience and the students are also
14:25 - super jazzed and Luis is a non
14:28 - non-native English speaker he's still
14:31 - kind of truck struggles with reading
14:32 - concepts and that's okay because he can
14:37 - figure this out without needing to be
14:38 - the moat without needing to be the
14:40 - strongest reader in the classroom and so
14:42 - if he needs to he can read out there
14:43 - narration tool for Gordo or for himself
14:49 - and so the student can figure out fully
14:52 - from watching Jessica the last two times
14:54 - you see that he needs to run it oops we
14:57 - are actually doing a debugging here so
14:59 - there's code here but something is wrong
15:01 - with our code and so Luis is going to
15:03 - figure out that he's going to need to
15:04 - change that to bat challenge four and
15:07 - five are very similar they're just
15:09 - turning the other direction and so Gordo
15:11 - tells us I'm you wrote your first code
15:13 - that was longer than one line and so
15:16 - that we move on to the next challenge
15:18 - here and I'm gonna let him continue and
15:21 - here introduces the buttons that type it
15:23 - out for you so the actual step feature
15:25 - and so I'm hoping we hope that Louisa
15:29 - and the class will figure out that they
15:31 - need the hit run first and then figure
15:33 - out okay what is the distance and so in
15:36 - this case we do that and they celebrate
15:38 - and whoohoo we celebrate there and so at
15:40 - this point we've solved challenges zero
15:42 - through four together as a class and
15:44 - we've had some celebration so now we get
15:47 - to challenge number five challenge
15:50 - number five is the first time where
15:52 - students are writing basically more than
15:54 - one line of code but where they're
15:57 - actually seeing an algorithm so let's
15:59 - talk about what an algorithm is and now
16:03 - that we've kind of heard all of our
16:04 - sounds I'm just going to turn this off
16:05 - here just you you know keep it on
16:08 - however so now we saw a challenge it
16:10 - challenges zero through four we saw them
16:11 - together with the class everyone on the
16:13 - carpet basically remember this is an
16:15 - algorithms first time we're seeing an
16:16 - algorithm in challenge number five so
16:18 - let's talk about what is an algorithm an
16:20 - algorithm is a recipe so think about
16:24 - making cookies you have the cookie dough
16:26 - batter and you put the cookies in the
16:29 - oven and although they take delicious
16:32 - before going in the oven they're when
16:34 - they come out there's something entirely
16:36 - different
16:36 - cookies and so they look different than
16:39 - when they came in when they went in then
16:41 - when they came out so that's what we
16:43 - call an input/output so you put
16:44 - something in and you get something out
16:46 - so what I would do at this point is I
16:48 - would show this video to my students
16:50 - about what an algorithm is and hat and
16:52 - have a discussion as a class about what
16:54 - an algorithm is so I found this really
16:56 - great video that I love just an extra
16:58 - resource that I play with my students
17:00 - since I'm going to let you go ahead and
17:01 - listen to this now to do something that
17:27 - you need to show someone you've got your
17:29 - tape they like to do it themselves
17:40 - instructions would go like this rush
17:51 - your team nicely one sex smile
17:58 - it is important it's in the right steps
18:00 - in the right order so as we can see
18:10 - that's when an algorithm is so an
18:12 - algorithm is when you put something in
18:14 - you get something out and at this time
18:16 - usually I'll have the students talk
18:17 - about okay what is your steps for
18:19 - getting ready in the morning and kind of
18:20 - talking about and so now that we've done
18:23 - challenges 0 through 4 together I will
18:25 - release them to do challenge number 5
18:28 - and solve this challenge so we could
18:30 - definitely solve this challenge together
18:31 - but let's take a look at some of the
18:32 - other resources that are available to us
18:34 - to basically figure out okay how is this
18:37 - happening so I'm going to go back so I'm
18:40 - going to go back to my main teacher
18:42 - dashboard and to do so I can click on
18:44 - the three lines here and click home or I
18:47 - can click on the code monkey icon at any
18:49 - time and so now I'm back here and now I
18:56 - want to go into my classroom so good to
18:58 - get to my active classrooms I click see
19:00 - my classroom if you're not sure how to
19:01 - create a class add your students this is
19:06 - really some really great resources which
19:08 - I'll show you at the end that will help
19:09 - you with all of those things so don't
19:10 - get stressed about it you can also reach
19:12 - out to the code monkey team at any time
19:14 - to help you with any of these options so
19:17 - I click on this birdies class when I
19:19 - clicked on this British class you can
19:20 - see I already have students do you want
19:23 - to know about the print login cards or
19:24 - the classroom URL we're happy to show
19:27 - you that later on as well to bonus clip
19:29 - right along to the progress page the
19:32 - progress page is probably my most
19:35 - favorite when I was teaching but also
19:37 - teachers most favorite we hear that this
19:39 - is probably the best feature of code
19:41 - monkey outside the office of the coding
19:44 - part but this is one of the best
19:45 - teachers
19:46 - teacher tools for you that make your
19:48 - life so much easier so let's talk about
19:50 - why that is so first you see students
19:53 - here are populated in two in here by
19:56 - name you can sort them by name or by
19:58 - progress let's talk about the solutions
20:00 - and let's talk about some of their
20:01 - really cool components here so showed
20:03 - you what a one-star solution is and a
20:05 - one-star solution means that you were
20:07 - able to basically catch all of the
20:09 - bananas a two star solution means you
20:11 - were able to catch all the bananas and
20:13 - use what you learned and a 3 star
20:17 - solution means you were able to solve
20:20 - the challenge using the shortest most
20:22 - concise code possible remember when we
20:25 - had step 0 step 10 step 10 it was a fury
20:28 - wrong way of saying step 20 and so
20:31 - that's why we restart solution with step
20:33 - 20 and a one-star solution was the step
20:36 - 0 step 10 step 10 and sometimes the
20:38 - students will do this nothing wrong with
20:41 - that but there's always encouragement
20:42 - for them to basically grow a little bit
20:44 - okay
20:45 - so now that we know that all of the
20:48 - circle of yellow circles our system of
20:50 - challenges we'll take a look at what
20:51 - that looks like and then anything where
20:53 - you ever see a black line with a
20:54 - explanation inside of it basically means
20:57 - that the student just didn't understand
20:58 - it was not able to pass that on their
21:00 - own so what we see here is along the
21:04 - along the top these I like to call them
21:07 - units but really they're coding concepts
21:09 - the coding concepts match the story mode
21:12 - which we'll kind of talk about that will
21:14 - go back into the coding adventure course
21:18 - here in just a minute and I'll kind of
21:19 - talk a little bit more about that but
21:20 - basically this is each one of these
21:22 - isn't units so the very first ones
21:24 - stepping and turning is basically just
21:27 - an introduction it's exactly what it
21:28 - says they're learning how to step and
21:30 - learning how to turn the most beautiful
21:32 - part about this is that all of these
21:33 - green numbers along the top are your
21:35 - solutions so remember how I said okay
21:37 - let's solve challenge number 5 I can
21:39 - click on number 5 and I could see what
21:41 - the three star solution is so this is
21:43 - great for showcasing this with your
21:45 - students not to mention so I can see the
21:49 - three star solution but not to mention
21:50 - that I can also a students are solving
21:54 - this in real time it's showing me
21:57 - their progress right here in real-time I
21:59 - don't have to do any grading there's
22:01 - nothing that's making extra hard for me
22:03 - because at the end of the day cannot see
22:06 - what all of our students are doing at
22:07 - once oh I'm watching my class size was
22:09 - 25 it was very impossible in a computer
22:12 - lab or even with them sitting with
22:13 - Chromebooks that there does for me to
22:15 - see what every student was doing this is
22:17 - the way that I can then I can see okay
22:18 - this student is struggling now I need to
22:21 - go in conference with him so that's the
22:23 - that's why this is so beautiful the
22:24 - assessment challenges are all like I
22:26 - said listed here in yellow those
22:28 - solutions are here for you as well go
22:30 - mode also reports in the same way
22:31 - another feature that's super awesome
22:33 - here is the limit progress and so so I
22:35 - would get my students logged in and what
22:38 - I would do is I'm going to limit their
22:40 - progress now as you can see after
22:43 - challenge number five is now grayed out
22:45 - that means that once the students get
22:47 - past challenge number five or they
22:49 - cannot go anywhere further beyond that I
22:51 - have limited them I've limited them
22:53 - because I want to know that they're able
22:54 - to master that algorithm before I move
22:58 - on to the rest part of our lessons also
23:00 - the very first lesson colorburst
23:03 - challenges zero through five and so
23:05 - that's just a way to make sure I ensure
23:07 - for myself that my students are in the
23:08 - same pace that I want them to and
23:10 - hopefully we're seeing some success from
23:12 - the students solving zero through four
23:14 - that they're really able to challenge
23:15 - tackle challenge number five solo
23:17 - dough's are they're really awesome parts
23:19 - about the progress bar I always called
23:22 - the progress bar but it's really the
23:23 - progress page and in the progress page
23:25 - like I said it is a teacher's best
23:27 - friend you can also export data if
23:29 - you're not sure how to do that remember
23:30 - we're always here to help you with any
23:32 - of those parts alright let's go back to
23:34 - our main page here and let's kind of get
23:37 - moving so we took a look at what an
23:39 - algorithm was we just talked about what
23:41 - some of the features are in the progress
23:42 - page or progress tab you can access the
23:46 - skill mode and remember it's reported in
23:48 - the same way as the grade book now let's
23:50 - talk about the unplugged activities and
23:53 - then we'll go into what skill mode is so
23:55 - day one I introduce the lesson and I'll
23:59 - let the students we solve it together
24:00 - basically as a class and they solve
24:02 - challenge number five independently day
24:04 - two I open with an unplugged activity
24:07 - so I usually start out with this
24:10 - activity on the board doing something
24:12 - whole group I just feel like usually
24:14 - when you're able to do something for me
24:16 - obviously remember you can take anything
24:18 - that you want from this but these are
24:20 - just some ways that I found that really
24:21 - really work so I will pay something
24:25 - together just to kind of get their brain
24:26 - working a little bit so here on this one
24:30 - I'll showcase this and I showcase it
24:32 - with the grid lines on the back because
24:34 - I really want the students to understand
24:36 - that each square is a step so we use
24:39 - what we learned from yesterday and we
24:40 - talked about or from the previous day or
24:42 - whatever is working with your schedule
24:44 - so how does student a get to the ball so
24:46 - we're going to make sure we use the
24:47 - terms from the day before step turn
24:50 - right and turn left so the very first
24:52 - thing that the students are gonna
24:53 - remember from yesterday is that in order
24:55 - for monkey or the student aid to move
24:59 - they need to face the direction of which
25:01 - they walk so the student will need to
25:03 - turn right first and then if we count
25:05 - these steps it's turn six and then when
25:08 - they get here to the corner they'll need
25:09 - to turn left and then step two complete
25:11 - distance to eight all the while I'm
25:13 - dictating this code on the board or
25:15 - maybe I have student a student write
25:16 - that on the board or sometimes I'll have
25:18 - them depending on my class and their
25:20 - needs I'll have them dictate it on a
25:22 - whiteboard personalized whiteboard or
25:24 - for me I didn't have whiteboards they
25:25 - just wrote right on their desks
25:26 - I also remind them is that it's an
25:29 - algorithm because what do we have to do
25:31 - we had to plan how we got to the end not
25:33 - to mention we wrote we just did easily
25:36 - four lines of code and so the students
25:37 - can now see the correlation between
25:38 - something that's unplugged and plugged
25:41 - in another great unplugged coding
25:43 - example that I love to do with teachers
25:45 - and I love to do with students it's
25:47 - probably my most favorite thing is to do
25:49 - an activity whole group so once again I
25:50 - bring all my students down to the carpet
25:52 - I basically set up two desks or two
25:55 - tables or basically whatever is in your
25:57 - classroom and I put one Bowl on one
25:59 - table and one Bowl on the other and I'll
26:01 - bring up three students want to dictate
26:03 - the code on the board want to be the
26:05 - direction giver and one to be
26:07 - blindfolded so the student before bling'
26:10 - bond funnelled will see that on the
26:11 - table nearest to him there is or her or
26:14 - who whatever student you choose for me
26:16 - when I do it with teachers I fill it
26:17 - with beads it's just easier for me when
26:19 - I travel to conferences but I
26:21 - when I do it with students I usually for
26:23 - me last year my kids were super jazzed
26:24 - about unicorns and so I had a bowl full
26:27 - of unicorn erasers it's just a really
26:29 - good incentive at the end to give them
26:31 - something that they're interested in
26:33 - I've seen teachers use chocolate candy
26:35 - and there's really really there's no
26:37 - there's a rule of what you use so use
26:39 - whatever you think your students will
26:40 - want to have the goal is is that the
26:43 - student is going to take this bowl or
26:44 - cup or whatever it is that you have and
26:46 - they're going to be given directions to
26:48 - go to the other bowl and dump it in and
26:51 - that's how they reached the end so
26:53 - you'll be blindfolded
26:54 - now they've seen where it is and the
26:57 - other student that's the direction giver
26:58 - will need to give really clear
26:59 - directions so we say that before him
27:01 - like if it's going if the student is
27:03 - going to walk two steps and we're going
27:05 - to make sure that prior we set this up
27:06 - that is going to be walking heel to toe
27:09 - so - heel to toes as a student is
27:11 - dictating and so what the very first
27:13 - thing that you'll notice even yourself
27:15 - at night I'm traveling in any kind of
27:17 - dark spaces the very first thing you do
27:19 - is you put out your hand
27:20 - this is actually an if statement if
27:23 - something is not there or if something
27:25 - is in the way I'm not going to continue
27:26 - walking and so they'll you'll kind of
27:29 - note that and you can talk about that
27:30 - after as a reflection piece like oh this
27:33 - is really great if statement if
27:34 - something was not there and you can
27:35 - refer back to it in further lessons when
27:37 - the students do get to the if statements
27:39 - actually so the student will be
27:41 - blindfold everyone's gonna be super
27:42 - jazzed wanting to give directions
27:44 - oftentimes depending on my class I'll
27:46 - also have the students in the audience
27:48 - kind of dictating their own code just so
27:50 - that they're also writing the lines of
27:52 - code this too is an algorithm because
27:54 - there's lots of planning involved with
27:56 - getting one person who's blindfolded to
27:58 - the other side using only words so this
28:01 - is a really fun one and a really great
28:02 - way to open up day two now that we've
28:06 - talked about how we start out the lesson
28:07 - let's take a look at what skill mode is
28:09 - and why skill mode is an important
28:11 - feature I'm going to go back to coding
28:13 - adventure part one because remember this
28:15 - is the only part of our focus today
28:17 - remember this is going to take us right
28:19 - to the end but how do we navigate we
28:21 - click on the story map over here or the
28:24 - story icon and it brings us to the story
28:26 - map and so you can scroll quickly by
28:29 - doing the double arrows or squirrel
28:30 - between the worlds or between the
28:32 - concepts
28:33 - here so we start out at the very
28:35 - beginning and so here we see our first
28:37 - steps or stepping and turning now how do
28:40 - you access skill mode and why is skill
28:42 - mode important you access skill mode
28:44 - from the story map and it'll be right
28:47 - here it's also now accessible from the
28:49 - main from the main screen I'll show you
28:51 - that in just a moment but you can really
28:53 - access it here so what is skill mode and
28:55 - why is skill mode important in my
28:57 - opinion and in some of the teachers that
28:59 - I've talked to that have used it and not
29:02 - used it so they've used code monkey for
29:04 - a few years and they've used it the
29:05 - first year they didn't feel like it was
29:06 - very important and then they really
29:08 - realized for the second year so what is
29:09 - skill mode it reinforces what the
29:12 - student needs to know each set of skill
29:16 - mode assumes that the student has
29:18 - already had some depth of understanding
29:19 - so basically it's just a reinforcement
29:21 - of skills and concepts and so or extra
29:25 - practice what I find is that I do
29:27 - support on Fridays and sometimes some
29:29 - other days during the week and what I
29:30 - find is that students who the majority
29:34 - of students who reach out to us are
29:36 - students that have not used utilized
29:39 - skill mode to its fullest potential and
29:41 - what I mean by that is um do you notice
29:43 - what I mean by that is that students are
29:44 - not actually I'm utilizing to its full
29:47 - potential meaning that after they get
29:49 - done with a concept so at the very end
29:51 - of first steps once they get to
29:54 - challenge number ten skill mode will
29:56 - open up for that so this first steps of
30:00 - skill mode so each skill mode is
30:02 - associated to the set of concepts so
30:04 - here the students will actually practice
30:06 - so what does skill mode look like first
30:08 - skill mode is in a black editor more
30:10 - times than not skill mode doesn't have
30:12 - anything written inside of it basically
30:15 - as you can see here we have monkey but
30:17 - we have monkey that we need to do some
30:18 - planning for an algorithm so the need to
30:20 - have taken what they've learned and now
30:22 - apply it skill mode is also really great
30:24 - if you have a student like I have last
30:26 - year my student Brian was super fast at
30:28 - everything he always he would surpass
30:31 - everyone that's just who he was just the
30:33 - nature of him and so he would be if I
30:35 - let him go he'd be on challenge number
30:36 - 75 and I would have Sally and Lucy on
30:39 - challenge number one what I'd even have
30:41 - John and he be I'm challenge number five
30:43 - and we would have students all over I
30:46 - would a lemon
30:46 - his progress in the progress page or
30:48 - progress tab and then I would have him
30:51 - do some extra reinforcement of skills
30:53 - here in skill mode and so this is where
30:55 - the like extra enrichment piece comes in
30:58 - or extra practice and you solve it the
31:00 - same way we've solved all of our other
31:01 - challenges and now we're gonna stop or
31:03 - start talking about object-oriented
31:06 - programming and take a look at our
31:08 - lesson plans so here we are and I'm
31:10 - going to go to challenge number 11 you
31:12 - can shortcut is just type that there and
31:14 - the URL and this says turn - we'll make
31:18 - the monkey turn to an object so this is
31:21 - the first time that we see here but in
31:23 - this case the monkey is now not turning
31:26 - 180 degrees or turning left the monkey
31:29 - is actually going to turn directly to
31:31 - the banana we see here that monkey is
31:33 - turning to the banana so we're going to
31:35 - so we can see that the monkey gets to
31:36 - the banana so this will be a 2 star
31:38 - solution remember to get a 3 star
31:41 - solution the student would need to have
31:42 - written step 20 rather than step 10 so
31:45 - now we've seen solution what a blend
31:46 - star solution will look like a 2 star
31:48 - solution and a 3 star solution let's
31:50 - take a look at the lesson plan so we can
31:52 - kind of get an idea so I'm actually just
31:54 - going to open this up in a new tab so I
31:57 - can easily navigate back to it I haven't
32:00 - pretty downloaded lesson plans because I
32:01 - want to show you how to get to them and
32:03 - kind of how that works so here back on
32:07 - the teacher dashboard we click on lesson
32:10 - plans and I'm going to click on the
32:11 - first set of lesson plans because that
32:13 - matches the first course ok when I do so
32:16 - then it will download a pdf version of
32:19 - the lesson plans and so it'll say right
32:22 - here to let you know what lessons are
32:23 - associated and that's going to match the
32:25 - first coding adventure course I would
32:27 - highly recommend reading this first page
32:29 - here just kind of getting used to the
32:31 - lesson plan and then we're going to kind
32:32 - of jump right in so lesson 1 as you can
32:34 - see the lessons are broken up into
32:37 - basically two lessons per unit so
32:41 - stepping and turning will have to turn
32:43 - to and turtle will have to and it will
32:45 - continue going on from there so the very
32:47 - first lesson is just an intro lesson and
32:49 - the second lesson is a deeper dive so
32:51 - let's just take a look at our first
32:53 - lesson right off the bat here and our
32:56 - first lesson the very first thing we'll
32:59 - give you
33:00 - basically in intro into what the lesson
33:02 - is going to be about then I'll tell you
33:04 - objectives and so what I did was I have
33:06 - students I had students have like a tech
33:09 - notebook or like a computer science
33:12 - notebook or whatever it is that you want
33:14 - a name and I had them write out these
33:15 - objectives as student learning
33:17 - objectives so today I will be able to
33:19 - describe and define what coding is and
33:22 - computer programming I will be able to
33:24 - become familiar with the code monkey
33:26 - platform and I'll be able to complete
33:28 - challenges 0 through 5 on code monkey I
33:30 - did this because it was really great way
33:31 - to keep my students accountable as well
33:33 - as when it they weren't they couldn't
33:36 - remember a lot of concept was I can say
33:37 - oh well did you go and check your tech
33:39 - notebook first and so what I do with
33:41 - these components so what the students
33:43 - are actually going to be doing in the
33:44 - lesson step and turn and understand what
33:47 - a challenges and understand what
33:49 - CoffeeScript is is I would take these
33:50 - and I would do word work with them so
33:52 - it's a really great way to integrate my
33:54 - literacy into the lesson and so I would
33:56 - have them talk about what a step is and
33:59 - what a turn is and all we owe you some
34:01 - really great ways on where you can find
34:02 - that all of our lessons are common core
34:05 - line we are working on alignment with
34:07 - some other standards and we are also
34:09 - CTSA c s ta aligned as well so our
34:13 - lessons are broken up into three parts
34:15 - so part one is the introduction part two
34:18 - is the let's go or the play and part
34:20 - three is the reflection piece part one
34:23 - more times than not is going to be our
34:26 - is basically an unplugged activity so
34:29 - something that you're doing when you're
34:31 - not plugged in so in this case this was
34:33 - just introducing them to the lesson so
34:35 - you could use what I did or you can use
34:37 - to what directly comes from the lesson
34:38 - some years of your first time using code
34:41 - monkey you probably rely heavily on
34:43 - these lessons and then kind of go you
34:45 - know kind of skim off from there
34:47 - obviously not everything is a peel and
34:49 - all you use what works for you and
34:51 - what's going to work for your classroom
34:52 - so the let's go is the play and so in
34:54 - this one it told us to play to challenge
34:56 - number five also learn what Gordo was
34:58 - and the instructions the debriefing here
35:01 - will be our the debriefing what did you
35:04 - when you were stuck how do you get three
35:05 - stars what does that matter and then
35:08 - and like I said the second lesson will
35:11 - be a little bit deeper dive in which
35:12 - they're learning how to turn laughs that
35:15 - kind of thing so I really highly
35:17 - recommend for me I printed mine all out
35:19 - and I look at them like I was in a book
35:21 - just because I like to write notes and
35:23 - that kind of thing but obviously you
35:25 - kind of do what works best for you some
35:26 - people are strictly digital and some
35:29 - people kind of go from there on whatever
35:31 - works best for them so now we've taken a
35:33 - look at the lesson plans the second
35:35 - webinar jusino is going to do a little
35:36 - bit deeper dive into the lesson plans
35:38 - that I just wanted to give you a sneak
35:39 - peek so now let's talk about what it
35:42 - means by so we just did the turn two and
35:45 - now we're doing the object-oriented
35:47 - programming so object-oriented
35:48 - programming let's take a look at
35:50 - challenge number fourteen you can
35:51 - navigate between the worlds I just like
35:53 - to quickly navigate our using the story
35:55 - map but I'm just going to do it here we
35:57 - can see here that this is the first time
35:59 - that we're introducing a new object so
36:01 - the object has always been code monkey
36:03 - or our monkey and now we're introducing
36:06 - turtle so what we need to do is we need
36:08 - to get turtle we need to get monkey to
36:10 - get to turtle and turtle to move so that
36:13 - monkey can now get these bananas so the
36:15 - first thing that we would need to do is
36:16 - we need to have him step a certain set
36:19 - of directions something new that you'll
36:21 - learn out here is that I can I can hit
36:25 - an object and it will type it out for me
36:26 - we figure out here that we need to get
36:28 - the monkey to the turtle and the turtle
36:31 - the turtle is stepping ten so the monkey
36:34 - has been on the turtle's back now turtle
36:36 - is our object and now we're orienting
36:40 - him through the program to get to the
36:43 - bananas and so that's what object
36:45 - oriented programming looks as you can
36:47 - see code monkey starts off pretty basic
36:49 - in a sense just really getting the
36:51 - students introduced and it goes into
36:53 - some really in-depth concepts and it
36:55 - builds upon it students can't access
36:57 - challenges earlier than they were meant
36:59 - to
36:59 - everything goes in a linear build up all
37:02 - right so now we've taken a look at what
37:03 - object-oriented programming is when we
37:05 - program something other than our monkey
37:07 - in the game we just learned what step
37:10 - was what turning was turning to so
37:13 - instead of monkey turning left and
37:14 - stepping and turning right and stepping
37:16 - he can actually turn now to a specific
37:18 - object also what turtle step is so
37:20 - that's making the turtle step
37:22 - have to associate who the object is and
37:24 - who's stepping because the game
37:25 - automatically assumes the game
37:27 - automatically assumes that monkey is
37:29 - going to be doing all of the movement
37:30 - until we say what we want the object to
37:33 - do take a look at what an assessment
37:36 - challenge looks like all the other
37:37 - challenges that we've looked at have
37:39 - already had some kind of code in them so
37:41 - the students are doing a lot of
37:42 - debugging here it is completely empty
37:46 - meaning that there is no pre-built code
37:48 - loaded in here why is this important
37:51 - well knowing how your students are doing
37:53 - and where they're having difficulties is
37:56 - of great importance and it also allows
37:58 - you to showcase what the students are
38:00 - understanding and you can share that
38:02 - with parents and any stakeholders and
38:04 - really share it with them and kind of
38:05 - have that celebration of knowledge I
38:07 - allow my students to work
38:08 - collaboratively on the challenges until
38:10 - they get to the assessment challenges
38:12 - because if they're solving an assessment
38:14 - challenge collaboratively I never know
38:16 - what they know this is a chance for me
38:18 - to really understand where the students
38:21 - are and what they're struggling with and
38:22 - then I can check the progress page and I
38:25 - can say oh johnny is struggling I'll
38:27 - show you what a struggling student looks
38:28 - like because we talked about the
38:30 - progress page and I can say okay well
38:33 - this is how this is how they're scoring
38:35 - so I mentioned I forgot to mention the
38:38 - student part you can open this back up
38:40 - by clicking free play so I just went
38:42 - back to the teacher page and clicked on
38:44 - back to the classroom page clicked on
38:46 - the classroom I wanted and clicked on
38:47 - progress I mentioned that you can see
38:51 - all of the three star solutions as a
38:53 - teacher but I forgot to mention that
38:54 - when a student is struggling so let's
38:56 - say on 15 we can see that dodo-bird
38:58 - didn't score three star solution well
39:00 - why is that so let's click on his star
39:03 - we can see when he attempted the
39:04 - challenge and we can click on his
39:07 - solution and see okay well why was this
39:10 - why was that the case and remember that
39:13 - we want the shortest most concise code
39:15 - and so instead of writing step 15 he
39:19 - wrote step six and step nine so that's
39:21 - the reason why he didn't report back
39:24 - with a three star solution so it's a
39:26 - really great way to have those
39:27 - conversations and remember if you're
39:28 - running short on time or you're not
39:30 - really sure you can always check these
39:32 - solutions they're always available for
39:34 - you so that's how you can tell where a
39:35 - struggling
39:36 - studentís so we talked about what
39:38 - CoffeeScript was remember a real coding
39:40 - language how to run a lesson in your
39:43 - classroom with code monkeys so hopefully
39:44 - you got kind of an understanding of that
39:46 - how to work your way through solving a
39:48 - code monkey challenge up to challenges
39:51 - 15 so we went through all the we went
39:53 - through some challenges to help you get
39:55 - started what skill mode is and why do we
39:57 - use it what a skill mode it's an extra
39:59 - reinforcement of skills or extra
40:01 - practice we use it to reinforce the
40:02 - concepts to really give the students a
40:05 - deeper level of understanding how do we
40:07 - keep track of our students work that's
40:09 - in the progress page so we know where to
40:11 - find solutions what we don't know are
40:13 - where to find the how-to videos so I'm
40:16 - going to go back to my homepage here so
40:18 - go back to the teacher dashboard and
40:20 - let's talk about some teacher resources
40:21 - that are available to us all of our
40:23 - lesson plans are located under the
40:24 - lesson plans tab
40:27 - they are broken up coding adventurers
40:28 - broken up to 3 we have dota does math
40:30 - and we have some other lesson plans and
40:33 - things coming soon under the getting
40:36 - started there is this beginner's guide
40:38 - to code monkey and I highly suggest that
40:40 - if you're struggling on a concept check
40:42 - the beginner's guide has about classroom
40:44 - management how to set up your classroom
40:47 - maybe you need to select a different
40:48 - language you have different language
40:50 - learners in your classroom those are
40:52 - really great
40:52 - then these coding concepts remember how
40:55 - I said I did word work or vocabulary
40:57 - work with my students these coding
40:59 - concepts which are accessible right
41:00 - under the getting started are great they
41:03 - have some great vocabulary so you're not
41:05 - going searching for your vocabulary I'm
41:07 - very visual so I prefer to see the
41:09 - visuals and so I like to draw my little
41:11 - Cabul area and write just a couple notes
41:13 - but however it is that you're wanting to
41:15 - go to so what does this step turn left
41:18 - all of our concepts are right here and
41:20 - we have great graphics to go with them
41:22 - as well as text to go to them and
41:24 - students have access to this as well we
41:26 - also have some notes for our code so if
41:28 - you're kind of wanting to do some like
41:30 - hour of code stuff with your students
41:32 - since our code is coming up those are
41:34 - there for you we also have some really
41:36 - great Viette video tutorials how to
41:37 - create a classroom add your students how
41:39 - to share a classroom code these have to
41:41 - start out with a really cute graphic but
41:42 - they're short
41:44 - and almost all of them are under five
41:46 - minutes so they're really quick for you
41:47 - to check out all of our new features are
41:50 - here very often we get questions about
41:52 - what's going on that kind of thing you
41:56 - can click on what the new features are
41:58 - and we'll give you a quick summary of
42:00 - what's basically going on we also have
42:03 - certificates for our students
42:04 - certificates when you can finish coding
42:06 - adventure as well as soon to be our
42:08 - coderush competition our FAQ many
42:11 - teachers ask us questions and many of
42:14 - our users and it check out the how-to we
42:16 - have really great really great answers
42:19 - what is coding adventure they're really
42:20 - quick and short answers of course you
42:22 - can always contact us question corner is
42:25 - probably one of the most underutilized
42:27 - so student accounts these are really
42:29 - great because they're conversations
42:30 - usually between Gordo and the teacher
42:32 - kind of understanding what they are
42:34 - they're really great like little context
42:36 - bubbles and then we have just some
42:37 - classroom posters and things that are
42:39 - located under this part here one more
42:42 - thing I wanted to know is these three
42:43 - lines over here is where you can access
42:45 - our blog contact us help looking at some
42:48 - features of your account FAQ is also
42:51 - accessible here as well as home and the
42:54 - my classroom part or accessing your my
42:57 - classroom page so that's where you find
42:59 - all your lesson plans your how-to videos
43:01 - we went over how to find your solution
43:02 - thank you so much for joining us this
43:04 - evening I know that your time is
43:06 - precious and I hope you found some value

Cleaned transcript:

good afternoon and welcome to the first code monkey teaching experience today we are going to learn how to teach code monkey in the classroom to look forward to doing so one of the best parts about our platform is that as a teacher you don't need to have any prior experience coding to be able to teach it to your students the code monkey platform will give you all of the tips and tricks that you need to teach coding seamlessly to your students remember coding is not just for one but for all your first steps with code monkey let's just start off with Who I am my name is Lena Saleh and I'm the professional development manager here at code monkey I am a former stem teacher I taught in the classroom as well as I was the T in stem so basically what that means is I wrote scope and sequence for my district and really developed the coding curriculum and kind of what that looked like from K through 12 I also basically helped teachers with any part of T that they need it if they wanted to make a movie or a stopmotion film or any of those things that's what I helped them do I'm professional development leader and so basically what that means is that I've taught in person and online workshops prior to my experience actually here at code monkey I've taught a couple stem conferences and just some different places around the country I'm also an EdTech Austin organizer so here in Austin meetup groups are really thriving part of the culture here and so I am one of the organizers of EdTech Austin and so that basically means we take the merriment of the EdTech companies there's quite a lot of them here in Austin as well as teachers and we kind of marry the partnership amongst both of them I'm following some of the trends and needs that we see in the community I've been in education for well over a decade even when I was in high school I was going back and working inside of classrooms I would try to do as much tutoring as I could and really just wanted to get as much exposure as I could to education because I always knew from a very young age that I wanted to be a teacher and I wanted to learn as much as I could as fast as I could essentially and something else about me is that I'm just really passionate about computer science I coming from a family that isn't really collegeeducated I didn't really know anything about computer science I thought it was just something that the boys did or I didn't really have much exposure to what was available to me as a career choice or a career pathway and when I left the classroom I walked in and it was a very traditional setting and it was actually kind of sad to me and so I went to a training actually with a co.org I was like oh look at this really cool thing and I fell in love with computer science and ever since then I've just been extremely passionate about it I've taught myself to code back in him both front end as well as my students started surpassing me and I knew I needed to do something different and so that's kind of where my passion came bro all right so here are our objectives for this webinar today and we're gonna learn what CoffeeScript is how to run a lesson in your classroom using code monkey how to work your way through solving code monkey challenges but up to challenge 15 is what our main focus will be of the day what a skill mode why we use it how do we keep track of students work and because this is a prerecorded we're not gonna really do too much on the Q&A part of it but that's just the just an option usually we do with most our webinars what language so let's just start off with first what language to my students code in so if you you should already at this point kind of know what code monkey is but if you don't know code monkey is you program in a language called CoffeeScript and CoffeeScript is a real recognized computer language the golden rule of CoffeeScript is that it's just Java basically what that means is that it's straightforward it's easy to use there's no messy syntax if you've ever done any programming or ever seen it yourself and if you haven't I would recommend kind of maybe just taking a peek in gander at just so you can kind of have an understanding but basically CoffeeScript is the entre so think about like a steak dinner so CoffeeScript is your steak and you don't want to have dinner all by itself just have a steak you usually have potatoes or a side salad or whatever those are all the about are what I would call the syntax so there are things that sir surround the content of the language itself so the challenges that we're going to be looking at today our challenge is zero through four five eleven fourteen and fifteen and that's what we'll stop today so let's just talk about some teaching tips on how to actually teach code monkey and how to really just kind of introduce it to our students so to do so we're gonna need to go into the actual code monkey platform so let's go ahead and get started in and prior to doing so I don't really I'm not going to introduce my students to the platform until I'll kind of discuss what that is later but I'm gonna log in here under my demo account called miss birdie and I just really want the students to have an ease and comfort with the platform and kind of ease in coding with coding before I just set them free inside with the platform because we all know the kids are gonna figure it out but I want them to be able to feel that certain level of success so let's talk about what that looks like so here I am on the code monkey you I'm home page I logged in under my demo account miss birdie and as I scroll down you can see I have some active classrooms we'll talk about what that is we'll also talk about if you have any questions about how to set up your class or homer's where the teacher resources are located and all of that will touch back on that but the nice thing about code monkey is that you have access to all the same courses that your students have access to so what that means is you can code in real time alongside your students this is really great to get you just excited about coding as your students and it's a quick and fun way for you to learn too so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to click on coding adventure part 1 our courses just recently split into 3 so we have coding adventure part 1 coding adventure part 2 and coding adventure part 3 we change this based on some of the needs of our teachers and just kind of how we were receiving feedback we just felt that it was better manageable in three sections rather than two large courses so here we are I just clicked on coding adventure and as you can see I've already actually completed this course but I'm going to click redo the course if that happens to it at least they redo or begin coding or that we just launched this new narration feature for right now I'm just gonna click out of this I'm going to turn down the sound because the sound can get quite loud I'm gonna leave the sound on just a little bit lower for us all the to get to that control I just clicked on the gears here you can change the game speed I like my game speed to be faster I don't really have the patience necessarily for the slower time so our game speed but a lot of other people do so it's kind of up to you and your preference of what you feel most comfortable so as you can see we're taken here to challenge number 75 and this is pretty challenging so that's not where you'd want to start with your students so the very first thing I start on challenge number zero what I do is I tell students that we're going to begin coding I will actually start by playing this trailer and so it's super cute the kids really like it and it really gives them that buyin into the game and so basically what happens is that gorilla comes over and basically steals monkeys bananas he cries and that's how the game starts like I said super cute and that definitely a thing that you want to go with your students so something about this is that this is our directions I'm just gonna click out of the directions for now and then I'll refer back to how we kind of get there like I said this is a narration tool it will read the text back to you so in case you have students that are struggling readers or maybe learning English or any of that kind of come that that's there for you as well so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to bring my students to wherever your teaching area is even with my 5th graders when I taught 5th grade and this last year I kind of had a space on the floor I wasn't lucky enough to have the primary grades with big carpets but I have used those in years past and so what I do is I bring all the students down and I step away and I put one of my students in the driver's seat and so in this case I really like to bring up a student who usually is a girl she's not she's not a she's not a coding superstar we don't want a coding superstar you don't want a coding superstar and I'm just gonna mute these sounds for right now can leave the narration on for now but basically I don't want to bring up a coding superstar you don't want to bring up a coding superstar because you want the students to know that you believe in them and if you always are bringing up that student that knows everything or knows at all you know that the students start to lose faith in themselves and they think that you don't trust them the same as you trust the student who's a rock star at everything so like I said I'll bring up a girl I'll have her solve the first two to three challenges and I want a girl that the students still trust they still you know they they trust that she will answer the right things but she's not gonna be the strongest person in the class and so I'm just gonna step away and in this case for me it's Jessica Jessica's gonna be in the driver's seat and I'm gonna step back and I'm gonna take an inquiry role I want to take an inquiry role because like I said I want the students to know that if you've ever met a computer programmer themselves they actually go on Sprint's and they're constantly if you her even look at the memes by themselves they'll basically show you that a lot of times the computer programmers don't understand why something works or why it doesn't work and they're constantly failing what I like to call failing forward so it's okay if they make a mistake then nothing happens but we want to know it's basically the failing forward so what do they do with the mistake that happens so anyway Jessica's sitting in the driver's seat and I at this point really for me I don't care if other kids are chiming in but I kind of train my students a little bit that if a student is kind of sharing out their answers I want Jessica in the driver's seat to maybe ask them okay well why do you think that because you know most the students will kind of figure it out and kind of go with the flow but sometimes you have some other students that have some other ways of solving and we kind of want to maybe they have a new way that we never thought about before so Jessica's sitting in the driver's seat and as you can see here monkeys arm is basically saying something and so in this case we say okay she's gonna figure out that she needs to do something because monkey doesn't move on his own and so she clicks run and her a success and so there's a really cool sound and we'll all open up the sound for this next one and I just want you to note that this is a three star solution for how we solved this answer I'll talk a little bit more about what that look like and then Gordo is our little TA he gives little tips and tricks' kind of along the way directions and some encouraging encouraging features right here so now we're going to go on to our next challenge and I like I said Jessica still in the driver's seat I'm gonna have her quickly click out of the directions in this case because I want her to try to figure out okay what to do so like I said I'll just turn on this rather low just so you can kind of hear the sound so she's gonna need to figure out something and maybe she decides she wants to click run like she had done in the last time and she'll see oops and so this will give essentially tips kind of where the students are in the on the editor so we have like I said in the whites part the editor on the right hand side and then we'll see the actual game running on the left hand side text editors look very similar to this where they have something happening on one side and something running on the other sometimes their flip directions but it doesn't really matter so she's gonna say okay yeah he didn't run fast enough and so this is telling us to do something and she might figure out okay the directions told me to step 15 or she might see this ruler and say hey I want to use that and figure out that I need to do some measurement alongside of there so then she clicks that and she feels success in yay and so the stars really just get the students excited as well as these noises they love the noises and that's great we want them to be just as excited about coding as we are so when we go to the next challenge and here is the introduction of the ruler and so if she hasn't used the ruler in the previous challenge she might be seeing that this is demonstrating and so at this point all the kids are getting excited step stepstep we know you need a step and so she'll see here that you can't just step 0 she's gonna need to make a change and so she follows the directions and hopefully all the students are chiming in at this point getting super excited she was gonna say okay we need to step 20 and she's gonna see see kind of what that success looks like I'm gonna reap replay this for you just really quickly so let's say that Jessica didn't change this first one and she decided to type it out and she decided to type it out in this way let's take a look at kind of what happen here so we'll notice this was only a onestar solution and this is a onestar solution because it instead of taking on a much shorter pathway of step 20 which is a three star solution we see that Jessica had to basically span out so it wasn't the shortest most concise way now did she get the banana absolutely but she didn't get it in the shortest way possible and so at this time you could talk about that or we can just kind of keep going to kind of recognize kind of what that looks like and we could resolve this and say okay Jessica we really I really want you to try to get three stars in the solution and then hopefully she can see okay I need to be doing this and feel that sense of success so now Jessica's come up the students are getting pumped about this activity I'm gonna bring up another student and the student is Luis Luis is sorry I meant to click go to the next challenge so if that happens to you just go ahead and you can click three or you can click run again I just kind of type that into the browser and so this time I'm going to bring up Louise and louise has been watching he's been sitting in the audience and the students are also super jazzed and Luis is a non nonnative English speaker he's still kind of truck struggles with reading concepts and that's okay because he can figure this out without needing to be the moat without needing to be the strongest reader in the classroom and so if he needs to he can read out there narration tool for Gordo or for himself and so the student can figure out fully from watching Jessica the last two times you see that he needs to run it oops we are actually doing a debugging here so there's code here but something is wrong with our code and so Luis is going to figure out that he's going to need to change that to bat challenge four and five are very similar they're just turning the other direction and so Gordo tells us I'm you wrote your first code that was longer than one line and so that we move on to the next challenge here and I'm gonna let him continue and here introduces the buttons that type it out for you so the actual step feature and so I'm hoping we hope that Louisa and the class will figure out that they need the hit run first and then figure out okay what is the distance and so in this case we do that and they celebrate and whoohoo we celebrate there and so at this point we've solved challenges zero through four together as a class and we've had some celebration so now we get to challenge number five challenge number five is the first time where students are writing basically more than one line of code but where they're actually seeing an algorithm so let's talk about what an algorithm is and now that we've kind of heard all of our sounds I'm just going to turn this off here just you you know keep it on however so now we saw a challenge it challenges zero through four we saw them together with the class everyone on the carpet basically remember this is an algorithms first time we're seeing an algorithm in challenge number five so let's talk about what is an algorithm an algorithm is a recipe so think about making cookies you have the cookie dough batter and you put the cookies in the oven and although they take delicious before going in the oven they're when they come out there's something entirely different cookies and so they look different than when they came in when they went in then when they came out so that's what we call an input/output so you put something in and you get something out so what I would do at this point is I would show this video to my students about what an algorithm is and hat and have a discussion as a class about what an algorithm is so I found this really great video that I love just an extra resource that I play with my students since I'm going to let you go ahead and listen to this now to do something that you need to show someone you've got your tape they like to do it themselves instructions would go like this rush your team nicely one sex smile it is important it's in the right steps in the right order so as we can see that's when an algorithm is so an algorithm is when you put something in you get something out and at this time usually I'll have the students talk about okay what is your steps for getting ready in the morning and kind of talking about and so now that we've done challenges 0 through 4 together I will release them to do challenge number 5 and solve this challenge so we could definitely solve this challenge together but let's take a look at some of the other resources that are available to us to basically figure out okay how is this happening so I'm going to go back so I'm going to go back to my main teacher dashboard and to do so I can click on the three lines here and click home or I can click on the code monkey icon at any time and so now I'm back here and now I want to go into my classroom so good to get to my active classrooms I click see my classroom if you're not sure how to create a class add your students this is really some really great resources which I'll show you at the end that will help you with all of those things so don't get stressed about it you can also reach out to the code monkey team at any time to help you with any of these options so I click on this birdies class when I clicked on this British class you can see I already have students do you want to know about the print login cards or the classroom URL we're happy to show you that later on as well to bonus clip right along to the progress page the progress page is probably my most favorite when I was teaching but also teachers most favorite we hear that this is probably the best feature of code monkey outside the office of the coding part but this is one of the best teachers teacher tools for you that make your life so much easier so let's talk about why that is so first you see students here are populated in two in here by name you can sort them by name or by progress let's talk about the solutions and let's talk about some of their really cool components here so showed you what a onestar solution is and a onestar solution means that you were able to basically catch all of the bananas a two star solution means you were able to catch all the bananas and use what you learned and a 3 star solution means you were able to solve the challenge using the shortest most concise code possible remember when we had step 0 step 10 step 10 it was a fury wrong way of saying step 20 and so that's why we restart solution with step 20 and a onestar solution was the step 0 step 10 step 10 and sometimes the students will do this nothing wrong with that but there's always encouragement for them to basically grow a little bit okay so now that we know that all of the circle of yellow circles our system of challenges we'll take a look at what that looks like and then anything where you ever see a black line with a explanation inside of it basically means that the student just didn't understand it was not able to pass that on their own so what we see here is along the along the top these I like to call them units but really they're coding concepts the coding concepts match the story mode which we'll kind of talk about that will go back into the coding adventure course here in just a minute and I'll kind of talk a little bit more about that but basically this is each one of these isn't units so the very first ones stepping and turning is basically just an introduction it's exactly what it says they're learning how to step and learning how to turn the most beautiful part about this is that all of these green numbers along the top are your solutions so remember how I said okay let's solve challenge number 5 I can click on number 5 and I could see what the three star solution is so this is great for showcasing this with your students not to mention so I can see the three star solution but not to mention that I can also a students are solving this in real time it's showing me their progress right here in realtime I don't have to do any grading there's nothing that's making extra hard for me because at the end of the day cannot see what all of our students are doing at once oh I'm watching my class size was 25 it was very impossible in a computer lab or even with them sitting with Chromebooks that there does for me to see what every student was doing this is the way that I can then I can see okay this student is struggling now I need to go in conference with him so that's the that's why this is so beautiful the assessment challenges are all like I said listed here in yellow those solutions are here for you as well go mode also reports in the same way another feature that's super awesome here is the limit progress and so so I would get my students logged in and what I would do is I'm going to limit their progress now as you can see after challenge number five is now grayed out that means that once the students get past challenge number five or they cannot go anywhere further beyond that I have limited them I've limited them because I want to know that they're able to master that algorithm before I move on to the rest part of our lessons also the very first lesson colorburst challenges zero through five and so that's just a way to make sure I ensure for myself that my students are in the same pace that I want them to and hopefully we're seeing some success from the students solving zero through four that they're really able to challenge tackle challenge number five solo dough's are they're really awesome parts about the progress bar I always called the progress bar but it's really the progress page and in the progress page like I said it is a teacher's best friend you can also export data if you're not sure how to do that remember we're always here to help you with any of those parts alright let's go back to our main page here and let's kind of get moving so we took a look at what an algorithm was we just talked about what some of the features are in the progress page or progress tab you can access the skill mode and remember it's reported in the same way as the grade book now let's talk about the unplugged activities and then we'll go into what skill mode is so day one I introduce the lesson and I'll let the students we solve it together basically as a class and they solve challenge number five independently day two I open with an unplugged activity so I usually start out with this activity on the board doing something whole group I just feel like usually when you're able to do something for me obviously remember you can take anything that you want from this but these are just some ways that I found that really really work so I will pay something together just to kind of get their brain working a little bit so here on this one I'll showcase this and I showcase it with the grid lines on the back because I really want the students to understand that each square is a step so we use what we learned from yesterday and we talked about or from the previous day or whatever is working with your schedule so how does student a get to the ball so we're going to make sure we use the terms from the day before step turn right and turn left so the very first thing that the students are gonna remember from yesterday is that in order for monkey or the student aid to move they need to face the direction of which they walk so the student will need to turn right first and then if we count these steps it's turn six and then when they get here to the corner they'll need to turn left and then step two complete distance to eight all the while I'm dictating this code on the board or maybe I have student a student write that on the board or sometimes I'll have them depending on my class and their needs I'll have them dictate it on a whiteboard personalized whiteboard or for me I didn't have whiteboards they just wrote right on their desks I also remind them is that it's an algorithm because what do we have to do we had to plan how we got to the end not to mention we wrote we just did easily four lines of code and so the students can now see the correlation between something that's unplugged and plugged in another great unplugged coding example that I love to do with teachers and I love to do with students it's probably my most favorite thing is to do an activity whole group so once again I bring all my students down to the carpet I basically set up two desks or two tables or basically whatever is in your classroom and I put one Bowl on one table and one Bowl on the other and I'll bring up three students want to dictate the code on the board want to be the direction giver and one to be blindfolded so the student before bling' bond funnelled will see that on the table nearest to him there is or her or who whatever student you choose for me when I do it with teachers I fill it with beads it's just easier for me when I travel to conferences but I when I do it with students I usually for me last year my kids were super jazzed about unicorns and so I had a bowl full of unicorn erasers it's just a really good incentive at the end to give them something that they're interested in I've seen teachers use chocolate candy and there's really really there's no there's a rule of what you use so use whatever you think your students will want to have the goal is is that the student is going to take this bowl or cup or whatever it is that you have and they're going to be given directions to go to the other bowl and dump it in and that's how they reached the end so you'll be blindfolded now they've seen where it is and the other student that's the direction giver will need to give really clear directions so we say that before him like if it's going if the student is going to walk two steps and we're going to make sure that prior we set this up that is going to be walking heel to toe so heel to toes as a student is dictating and so what the very first thing that you'll notice even yourself at night I'm traveling in any kind of dark spaces the very first thing you do is you put out your hand this is actually an if statement if something is not there or if something is in the way I'm not going to continue walking and so they'll you'll kind of note that and you can talk about that after as a reflection piece like oh this is really great if statement if something was not there and you can refer back to it in further lessons when the students do get to the if statements actually so the student will be blindfold everyone's gonna be super jazzed wanting to give directions oftentimes depending on my class I'll also have the students in the audience kind of dictating their own code just so that they're also writing the lines of code this too is an algorithm because there's lots of planning involved with getting one person who's blindfolded to the other side using only words so this is a really fun one and a really great way to open up day two now that we've talked about how we start out the lesson let's take a look at what skill mode is and why skill mode is an important feature I'm going to go back to coding adventure part one because remember this is the only part of our focus today remember this is going to take us right to the end but how do we navigate we click on the story map over here or the story icon and it brings us to the story map and so you can scroll quickly by doing the double arrows or squirrel between the worlds or between the concepts here so we start out at the very beginning and so here we see our first steps or stepping and turning now how do you access skill mode and why is skill mode important you access skill mode from the story map and it'll be right here it's also now accessible from the main from the main screen I'll show you that in just a moment but you can really access it here so what is skill mode and why is skill mode important in my opinion and in some of the teachers that I've talked to that have used it and not used it so they've used code monkey for a few years and they've used it the first year they didn't feel like it was very important and then they really realized for the second year so what is skill mode it reinforces what the student needs to know each set of skill mode assumes that the student has already had some depth of understanding so basically it's just a reinforcement of skills and concepts and so or extra practice what I find is that I do support on Fridays and sometimes some other days during the week and what I find is that students who the majority of students who reach out to us are students that have not used utilized skill mode to its fullest potential and what I mean by that is um do you notice what I mean by that is that students are not actually I'm utilizing to its full potential meaning that after they get done with a concept so at the very end of first steps once they get to challenge number ten skill mode will open up for that so this first steps of skill mode so each skill mode is associated to the set of concepts so here the students will actually practice so what does skill mode look like first skill mode is in a black editor more times than not skill mode doesn't have anything written inside of it basically as you can see here we have monkey but we have monkey that we need to do some planning for an algorithm so the need to have taken what they've learned and now apply it skill mode is also really great if you have a student like I have last year my student Brian was super fast at everything he always he would surpass everyone that's just who he was just the nature of him and so he would be if I let him go he'd be on challenge number 75 and I would have Sally and Lucy on challenge number one what I'd even have John and he be I'm challenge number five and we would have students all over I would a lemon his progress in the progress page or progress tab and then I would have him do some extra reinforcement of skills here in skill mode and so this is where the like extra enrichment piece comes in or extra practice and you solve it the same way we've solved all of our other challenges and now we're gonna stop or start talking about objectoriented programming and take a look at our lesson plans so here we are and I'm going to go to challenge number 11 you can shortcut is just type that there and the URL and this says turn we'll make the monkey turn to an object so this is the first time that we see here but in this case the monkey is now not turning 180 degrees or turning left the monkey is actually going to turn directly to the banana we see here that monkey is turning to the banana so we're going to so we can see that the monkey gets to the banana so this will be a 2 star solution remember to get a 3 star solution the student would need to have written step 20 rather than step 10 so now we've seen solution what a blend star solution will look like a 2 star solution and a 3 star solution let's take a look at the lesson plan so we can kind of get an idea so I'm actually just going to open this up in a new tab so I can easily navigate back to it I haven't pretty downloaded lesson plans because I want to show you how to get to them and kind of how that works so here back on the teacher dashboard we click on lesson plans and I'm going to click on the first set of lesson plans because that matches the first course ok when I do so then it will download a pdf version of the lesson plans and so it'll say right here to let you know what lessons are associated and that's going to match the first coding adventure course I would highly recommend reading this first page here just kind of getting used to the lesson plan and then we're going to kind of jump right in so lesson 1 as you can see the lessons are broken up into basically two lessons per unit so stepping and turning will have to turn to and turtle will have to and it will continue going on from there so the very first lesson is just an intro lesson and the second lesson is a deeper dive so let's just take a look at our first lesson right off the bat here and our first lesson the very first thing we'll give you basically in intro into what the lesson is going to be about then I'll tell you objectives and so what I did was I have students I had students have like a tech notebook or like a computer science notebook or whatever it is that you want a name and I had them write out these objectives as student learning objectives so today I will be able to describe and define what coding is and computer programming I will be able to become familiar with the code monkey platform and I'll be able to complete challenges 0 through 5 on code monkey I did this because it was really great way to keep my students accountable as well as when it they weren't they couldn't remember a lot of concept was I can say oh well did you go and check your tech notebook first and so what I do with these components so what the students are actually going to be doing in the lesson step and turn and understand what a challenges and understand what CoffeeScript is is I would take these and I would do word work with them so it's a really great way to integrate my literacy into the lesson and so I would have them talk about what a step is and what a turn is and all we owe you some really great ways on where you can find that all of our lessons are common core line we are working on alignment with some other standards and we are also CTSA c s ta aligned as well so our lessons are broken up into three parts so part one is the introduction part two is the let's go or the play and part three is the reflection piece part one more times than not is going to be our is basically an unplugged activity so something that you're doing when you're not plugged in so in this case this was just introducing them to the lesson so you could use what I did or you can use to what directly comes from the lesson some years of your first time using code monkey you probably rely heavily on these lessons and then kind of go you know kind of skim off from there obviously not everything is a peel and all you use what works for you and what's going to work for your classroom so the let's go is the play and so in this one it told us to play to challenge number five also learn what Gordo was and the instructions the debriefing here will be our the debriefing what did you when you were stuck how do you get three stars what does that matter and then and like I said the second lesson will be a little bit deeper dive in which they're learning how to turn laughs that kind of thing so I really highly recommend for me I printed mine all out and I look at them like I was in a book just because I like to write notes and that kind of thing but obviously you kind of do what works best for you some people are strictly digital and some people kind of go from there on whatever works best for them so now we've taken a look at the lesson plans the second webinar jusino is going to do a little bit deeper dive into the lesson plans that I just wanted to give you a sneak peek so now let's talk about what it means by so we just did the turn two and now we're doing the objectoriented programming so objectoriented programming let's take a look at challenge number fourteen you can navigate between the worlds I just like to quickly navigate our using the story map but I'm just going to do it here we can see here that this is the first time that we're introducing a new object so the object has always been code monkey or our monkey and now we're introducing turtle so what we need to do is we need to get turtle we need to get monkey to get to turtle and turtle to move so that monkey can now get these bananas so the first thing that we would need to do is we need to have him step a certain set of directions something new that you'll learn out here is that I can I can hit an object and it will type it out for me we figure out here that we need to get the monkey to the turtle and the turtle the turtle is stepping ten so the monkey has been on the turtle's back now turtle is our object and now we're orienting him through the program to get to the bananas and so that's what object oriented programming looks as you can see code monkey starts off pretty basic in a sense just really getting the students introduced and it goes into some really indepth concepts and it builds upon it students can't access challenges earlier than they were meant to everything goes in a linear build up all right so now we've taken a look at what objectoriented programming is when we program something other than our monkey in the game we just learned what step was what turning was turning to so instead of monkey turning left and stepping and turning right and stepping he can actually turn now to a specific object also what turtle step is so that's making the turtle step have to associate who the object is and who's stepping because the game automatically assumes the game automatically assumes that monkey is going to be doing all of the movement until we say what we want the object to do take a look at what an assessment challenge looks like all the other challenges that we've looked at have already had some kind of code in them so the students are doing a lot of debugging here it is completely empty meaning that there is no prebuilt code loaded in here why is this important well knowing how your students are doing and where they're having difficulties is of great importance and it also allows you to showcase what the students are understanding and you can share that with parents and any stakeholders and really share it with them and kind of have that celebration of knowledge I allow my students to work collaboratively on the challenges until they get to the assessment challenges because if they're solving an assessment challenge collaboratively I never know what they know this is a chance for me to really understand where the students are and what they're struggling with and then I can check the progress page and I can say oh johnny is struggling I'll show you what a struggling student looks like because we talked about the progress page and I can say okay well this is how this is how they're scoring so I mentioned I forgot to mention the student part you can open this back up by clicking free play so I just went back to the teacher page and clicked on back to the classroom page clicked on the classroom I wanted and clicked on progress I mentioned that you can see all of the three star solutions as a teacher but I forgot to mention that when a student is struggling so let's say on 15 we can see that dodobird didn't score three star solution well why is that so let's click on his star we can see when he attempted the challenge and we can click on his solution and see okay well why was this why was that the case and remember that we want the shortest most concise code and so instead of writing step 15 he wrote step six and step nine so that's the reason why he didn't report back with a three star solution so it's a really great way to have those conversations and remember if you're running short on time or you're not really sure you can always check these solutions they're always available for you so that's how you can tell where a struggling studentís so we talked about what CoffeeScript was remember a real coding language how to run a lesson in your classroom with code monkeys so hopefully you got kind of an understanding of that how to work your way through solving a code monkey challenge up to challenges 15 so we went through all the we went through some challenges to help you get started what skill mode is and why do we use it what a skill mode it's an extra reinforcement of skills or extra practice we use it to reinforce the concepts to really give the students a deeper level of understanding how do we keep track of our students work that's in the progress page so we know where to find solutions what we don't know are where to find the howto videos so I'm going to go back to my homepage here so go back to the teacher dashboard and let's talk about some teacher resources that are available to us all of our lesson plans are located under the lesson plans tab they are broken up coding adventurers broken up to 3 we have dota does math and we have some other lesson plans and things coming soon under the getting started there is this beginner's guide to code monkey and I highly suggest that if you're struggling on a concept check the beginner's guide has about classroom management how to set up your classroom maybe you need to select a different language you have different language learners in your classroom those are really great then these coding concepts remember how I said I did word work or vocabulary work with my students these coding concepts which are accessible right under the getting started are great they have some great vocabulary so you're not going searching for your vocabulary I'm very visual so I prefer to see the visuals and so I like to draw my little Cabul area and write just a couple notes but however it is that you're wanting to go to so what does this step turn left all of our concepts are right here and we have great graphics to go with them as well as text to go to them and students have access to this as well we also have some notes for our code so if you're kind of wanting to do some like hour of code stuff with your students since our code is coming up those are there for you we also have some really great Viette video tutorials how to create a classroom add your students how to share a classroom code these have to start out with a really cute graphic but they're short and almost all of them are under five minutes so they're really quick for you to check out all of our new features are here very often we get questions about what's going on that kind of thing you can click on what the new features are and we'll give you a quick summary of what's basically going on we also have certificates for our students certificates when you can finish coding adventure as well as soon to be our coderush competition our FAQ many teachers ask us questions and many of our users and it check out the howto we have really great really great answers what is coding adventure they're really quick and short answers of course you can always contact us question corner is probably one of the most underutilized so student accounts these are really great because they're conversations usually between Gordo and the teacher kind of understanding what they are they're really great like little context bubbles and then we have just some classroom posters and things that are located under this part here one more thing I wanted to know is these three lines over here is where you can access our blog contact us help looking at some features of your account FAQ is also accessible here as well as home and the my classroom part or accessing your my classroom page so that's where you find all your lesson plans your howto videos we went over how to find your solution thank you so much for joining us this evening I know that your time is precious and I hope you found some value today remember to contact us if you have any questions also follow us on twitter at code monkey st you and hashtag code monkey webinar if you want some to give us some feedback on today also follow us on Instagram remember to write code catch bananas and save the world thank you so much for joining us today have a wonderful day
