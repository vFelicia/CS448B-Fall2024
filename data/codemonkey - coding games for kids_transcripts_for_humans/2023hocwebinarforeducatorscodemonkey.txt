03:31 - now um he just wanted like I said
03:32 - introduce himself um as well as tell you
03:35 - a little bit about code monkey and his
03:37 - passion for coding and the importance of
03:39 - coding and not only next week for hour
03:41 - of code but also like we said year round

04:24 - idea to follow us
04:25 - there so let's take a minute and look at
04:28 - our webinar outcomes for today um like
04:31 - Molly mentioned she'll be and livnat as
04:33 - well kind of Manning that Q&A although
04:35 - we reserve time at the end for Q&A
04:37 - please feel free at any time there at
04:39 - the bottom you have that tool that says
04:42 - Q&A and you can type in your questions
04:44 - there and we'll try to answer them as we
04:45 - go but we do have that designated time
04:48 - at the end um I'm really excited because
04:50 - yes we'll talk about the hour of code
04:52 - and the importance of coding um we'll
04:53 - look a little bit at code ny's Journey
04:55 - um and where we've kind of come and who
04:57 - we are um but we're going to kind of
05:00 - release or share with you our free
05:02 - courses as well as really highlight our
05:05 - new AI as a hoot which is the AI pose
05:08 - detection and so I'm really excited
05:10 - about that today to share that with you
05:11 - and how it works we'll do a couple of
05:13 - the exercises together so you feel
05:14 - comfortable with using it with your
05:16 - students um and then we'll kind of
05:18 - finish up with a little bit of guidance
05:20 - about how to prepare for hour of code in
05:21 - your classroom um whether might also be
05:24 - your school if you're a school leader or
05:25 - maybe you're a district leader and so
05:27 - you might need to prepare um that way as
05:30 - well so let's look a little bit at what
05:33 - hour of code is I cannot believe but
05:35 - hour of code actually started in
05:37 - December of 2013 so this is now the 11th
05:41 - year for hour of code which is
05:43 - absolutely amazing that we're providing
05:44 - our students this opportunity each year
05:47 - and we have now for 11 years um so what
05:50 - the hour code is if you're unfamiliar is
05:52 - that free opportunity that's hosted each
05:54 - year to provide kind of like an
05:55 - introduction to computer science and
05:57 - it's always done through those fun activ
05:59 - activities and also our of code has
06:01 - videos for Learners and it's at all
06:03 - skill levels because they know that some
06:04 - students get this opportunity just this
06:06 - once a year um some have it all during
06:09 - the year which is great and it's
06:10 - Incorporated so um they can kind of get
06:13 - started any way that they need to it
06:15 - just that right level for them um this
06:17 - year's celebration I think it's Unique
06:19 - even though I've participated many years
06:21 - because um yes we have coding but also
06:23 - AI is supported because we know AI is
06:26 - our world right now um so that theyve
06:29 - Incorporated that as well just like you
06:30 - see that our new course AI zahoot is in
06:33 - there as well um but also we have 400
06:36 - Partners this year 20,000 Educators have
06:39 - already signed up and then also 58,000
06:41 - volunteers as well um and then also 180
06:45 - countries are already signed up to
06:46 - participate and this is a kind of a neat
06:48 - graphic to kind of look and see how many
06:50 - people plan on next week participating
06:52 - in that hour of code so really
06:55 - cool so let's look at a little bit more
06:58 - about we have a promotional video about
07:00 - what the hour of codee is I'd like to
07:01 - share with you right now um but also
07:03 - keep in mind that this video is um on
07:06 - our YouTube channel um which can also be
07:09 - found in the description notes of this
07:11 - slide um so that you can follow us or
07:13 - add us there our Channel on YouTube and
07:15 - you can show this to your students next
07:17 - week other teachers um anyone in your
07:19 - District that might not know what hour
07:21 - of code is to help to explain to them so
07:23 - let's check out this
07:25 - video hey guys I bet you're wondering
07:27 - where I'm going today well we're all
07:30 - going to this special event and you can
07:32 - join in too you know they say a thousand
07:35 - monkeys with a thousand years can write
07:37 - the works of
07:38 - Shakespeare but we're not going to write
07:41 - Shakespeare we're going to write code
07:44 - because every year in December we get
07:46 - together it's called hour of code it's a
07:51 - worldwide event where teachers and
07:53 - students in 45 different languages
07:56 - across more than 180 countries come
07:59 - together to learn computer coding it's a
08:01 - chance to understand how the apps and
08:03 - Tech we use every day are made it's a
08:06 - chance for the next generation of
08:07 - Engineers and programmers to get a head
08:10 - start on all the wonderful things that
08:11 - we'll create I'm talking about you I
08:15 - know it looks a bit scary at first but
08:17 - don't worry you don't even need to know
08:20 - anything about coding yourself because
08:22 - code monkey has self-guided tutorials
08:24 - for you to choose from you've got
08:26 - everything you need to make your own
08:28 - games and applications
08:30 - and don't worry if you don't have your

10:02 - find this video and use it as well um so
10:06 - I hope you enjoyed that and like they
10:08 - said um the hour of code it's great
10:10 - because all level of Learners can use it
10:12 - it's that great exposure um whether
10:14 - you're computer science teacher and you
10:17 - are using coding every day or you're a
10:19 - classroom teacher and you only use it
10:21 - once a year for hour of code um we have
10:24 - resources that I'll show you here in
10:26 - just a minute to help you feel
10:27 - comfortable so that you can get started
10:31 - see you hey
10:33 - guys so let me take a moment just to
10:36 - tell you about Code Monkey as we have
10:38 - many participants here on um this
10:40 - webinar whether you're live or watching
10:42 - later and some of you are awesome
10:44 - existing customers and you know Code
10:45 - Monkey you love Code Monkey but some of
10:48 - you are potential new users here today
10:50 - and so I want to tell you a little bit
10:51 - about code monkey and what kind of sets
10:53 - us aside from some of the other
10:55 - subscriptions out there um so first we
10:58 - are are that leading kids program
11:00 - provided we provide an engaging online
11:03 - course um for students to learn coding
11:05 - um what's really neat about us that I
11:07 - think really sets us aside um is it was
11:10 - designed with schools and teachers in
11:11 - mind because it's easy to use um we have
11:14 - a informative student teacher and
11:16 - administrator dashboard so that you can
11:18 - fully see all of our courses access the
11:21 - resources monitor your students progress
11:24 - um to help you know provide next steps
11:26 - for them and so it's not just a a
11:29 - website where you assign courses and
11:31 - classes um it's very intentional um and
11:34 - so that students um are progressing at
11:36 - just the right level and you're pushing
11:37 - them even Beyond um it is standards
11:40 - aligned both with csta or computer
11:43 - science teacher Association standards
11:45 - and ISTA standards as well um and then
11:47 - we also have alignment documents for
11:50 - individual State Standards upon request
11:52 - so if that's something you're interested
11:53 - in we can provide that as well of how
11:55 - each and every one of our courses align
11:57 - with your individual state standards
11:59 - um also we are different because we're a
12:01 - full k through eight coding curriculum
12:04 - so we have that full curriculum that and
12:06 - actually I say you can use it free Cas
12:08 - I've used it with preschoolers all the
12:09 - way into High School depending on where
12:11 - your um students are kind of at with
12:13 - their coding skills um also there within
12:16 - the description or the speaker notes um
12:18 - you can find our full scope and sequence
12:20 - document so it's kind of like a
12:21 - curriculum map to show you which courses
12:24 - we recommend you use with which grade
12:26 - levels and um how they're used and then
12:28 - last but not least and there's no prior
12:30 - coding experience needed to teach it so
12:33 - um our Founders and CEOs we they know
12:36 - that they built this because they know
12:38 - teachers don't always have the
12:39 - background um in coding we're classroom
12:41 - teachers and we might have special ed
12:43 - backgrounds and we might have literacy
12:45 - or math backgrounds um but at times it's
12:48 - mandated and we want to provide our
12:50 - students that opportunity um so you
12:52 - don't have to have background knowledge
12:54 - and we have full resources full lesson
12:56 - plans on our website to help you every
12:58 - step of the way um so that you feel
13:01 - confident to teach that so that's just a
13:03 - little bit about Code Monkey who we are
13:05 - what our subscription is and like I said
13:07 - kind of what sets us apart from some of
13:09 - the other providers out
13:11 - there so let's get into the meat of our
13:13 - webinar today um let's look at our 2023
13:17 - I'm really excited to announce this hour
13:18 - of code course um courses and also
13:21 - activity offerings um you will see here
13:24 - we have 12 courses or sometimes we call
13:27 - them activity offerings this year for
13:29 - you um and then just released here as
13:32 - you can see is our new AI is a hoot pose
13:34 - detection that I'm going to actually
13:36 - guide and walk you through here in just
13:38 - a moment as well um I'm really excited I
13:40 - said there's 12 1hour courses that are
13:42 - free um that includes our new but that's
13:45 - really two over 207 challenges and over
13:48 - 12 hours of content you could use
13:51 - technically next week with your students
13:53 - if you wanted
13:55 - to so let's look at some people prefer
13:58 - to act access our courses and our
14:00 - resources directly through the hour of
14:02 - code site and if you want to do that
14:03 - that's perfectly fine um so how you can
14:06 - do that is you can go and this is all
14:07 - linked it'll be in the slides for you
14:10 - you can go to the hour of code website
14:12 - and then I do recommend if you are going
14:13 - to participate go ahead and click here
14:15 - for educators and hosts that they can
14:17 - document and see that um you are also
14:20 - participating to kind of get that track
14:22 - record so you can click there to access
14:24 - all of their
14:25 - resources also if you want to
14:27 - specifically find well how can I filter
14:29 - and find just Code Monkey um you can
14:32 - come here through activities and filter
14:33 - it um and let me click and show you how
14:35 - to do that so you can click here go to
14:38 - the our code website like we said um you
14:40 - can come to
14:42 - activities and once you're here on
14:44 - activities and you scroll down um they
14:48 - have R RS through if you come down to
14:51 - either you can come through code
14:55 - bunky here or they also have us as the
14:58 - the new one Code Monkey studio so they
15:01 - did kind of separate us into two but you
15:03 - can find most of our course offerings
15:05 - here through the hour of code website if
15:07 - you would rather come here that is one
15:10 - way you can get to it now in my opinion
15:13 - where else can you find us go directly
15:15 - to our website I truly feel like um this
15:19 - is the easiest way and the most
15:21 - efficient because you're going to get
15:22 - additional courses if you come through
15:24 - our website all 12 of them all of our
15:26 - resources the certificates all the
15:29 - things will be from right through here
15:31 - also you can send your students here as
15:33 - well um to access these courses so um I
15:38 - do want to kind of also emphasize yes
15:40 - these are available and we are really
15:42 - showing them today um but also these are
15:45 - actually available all year long either
15:48 - with your free teacher trial you can
15:50 - sign up for a paid subscription or just
15:53 - a guest from this marketing page you can
15:55 - access this actually year round so I did
15:56 - want to showcase that as well
15:59 - so let's um actually go into and let me
16:01 - show you so you can come here to our
16:04 - codem monkey.com website and then SL
16:06 - hour of code um and I'm going to click
16:08 - on it here for you so here we are if not
16:11 - if you went to codem monkey.com under
16:13 - resources and then hour of code this
16:15 - will also directly take you here um and
16:18 - then it's important that you scroll down
16:21 - so it's going to give you that video
16:23 - also if you want the video directly from
16:25 - here tells you a little bit about hour
16:28 - of code how it works but this is where
16:30 - you can get to all 12 of our courses and
16:34 - get started playing um this is a great
16:36 - way to kind of look and just see well
16:38 - what what is it for um what's it called
16:41 - who is it for is it block based or text
16:43 - based or is it python um and then also
16:46 - gives you a little um brief explanation
16:49 - but where the meat is is when you click
16:51 - on so let me click on Code Monkey
16:55 - Jr you can come here and as you can see
16:58 - you can start right here and you can
17:00 - start playing you do not have to sign up
17:02 - and your students can click here or you
17:04 - can sign up for a free trial and if you
17:07 - want to be able to have access to the
17:09 - full lesson plans as well as track
17:12 - student progress and have the saving as
17:14 - well this week next week um but from
17:16 - here you can like I said there's a
17:18 - million places to find information or
17:20 - start playing but it will also tell you
17:22 - a little bit more about that particular
17:24 - course so how many levels What age we
17:27 - recommend Concepts they'll be using if
17:30 - it's block based text base and python
17:33 - here's where you can find teacher notes
17:35 - um so that's really helpful to help
17:37 - inform yourself as a teacher to be able
17:39 - to explore it ahead of
17:41 - time and um so you can click
17:44 - there and then it'll walk you through
17:47 - even deeper more of an overview
17:49 - specifications and how to get started
17:51 - specific steps certificates can be found
17:54 - here um frequently asked questions if
17:56 - you have questions about this
17:58 - particular course um you can find that
18:02 - and yet again if at any time um you want
18:06 - your students to be able to save that um
18:09 - you can sign up for a free teacher trial
18:11 - for 30 days it does not require any type
18:14 - of information um like a credit card or
18:17 - anything to get started you just need
18:19 - your teacher email and you can log in by
18:21 - creating a password or using your single
18:23 - sign on you already have and you can get

18:54 - would like to spend about 10 the last 5
18:57 - to 10 minutes in wall o have time for a
18:58 - Q&A if you have any questions at the end
19:01 - um looking at our new offering that
19:02 - we're allowing everyone access to um as
19:05 - you can see there's livat there um using
19:08 - the pose detection um to program um
19:11 - Oliver the ow so let's take a look and
19:13 - talk about this new offering so this
19:16 - course it's really neat because it
19:17 - allows students to use their webcam to
19:20 - train that AI model and then you use
19:22 - those poses to get all over the ow
19:24 - between obstacles to get to the end of
19:26 - his route um so you do have to have a
19:30 - webcam on the device to be able to be
19:33 - successful on this um we do recommend
19:34 - you use it for ages 8 through 12 but
19:37 - with support or partnering them up I
19:39 - think you could use it at a younger um
19:40 - grade level the it is nine exercises so
19:44 - it is kind of on the shorter end I would
19:46 - say it took me a solid at least 30
19:48 - minutes as an adult who was kind of
19:50 - comfortable with coating um to get
19:52 - through it so kind of gauge your time
19:54 - maybe as a teacher practice it you know
19:55 - your students better than anyone else so
19:57 - that you can kind of see how long that
19:59 - might take or if you're signing in what
20:02 - would be great is you could use this all
20:03 - week long this student progress would be
20:05 - saved um it is using block coding um so
20:09 - that's something that is that lower
20:11 - level that help make students successful
20:13 - um and then something to definitely note
20:16 - is I want you to know that um all the
20:18 - images used to train the models are not
20:20 - stored and it's safe for student use so
20:22 - it is Copa compliant so um please don't
20:25 - worry about that we make sure that um we
20:27 - are Copa compant so that um it is safe
20:30 - for all of our users both teachers and
20:33 - for
20:35 - students so let's go ahead and take a
20:38 - moment and look at the first three
20:40 - exercises I'm going to go kind of fast
20:41 - but I want you to feel comfortable so
20:43 - that you can get on and explore it in
20:45 - case you do want to use it with your
20:46 - students next
20:48 - week so let me go ahead and this is a
20:51 - direct link to it but like I said you
20:52 - can find it right through our website
20:54 - and it's also available on that hour of
20:56 - code website as well
20:59 - so let's come on in here um to AI zahoot
21:02 - as you can see um like I mentioned this
21:05 - course is block based um it's nine
21:07 - exercises total um each exercise um it's
21:11 - great this over here I like to call this
21:13 - first section kind of the overview
21:15 - section with the instructions um it's
21:18 - great because it shows students what
21:19 - exercise they're on um there are great
21:23 - built-in accommodating features like you
21:25 - can listen if you'd like um but it gives
21:27 - students an overview of um kind of
21:30 - setting up the stage of well you know
21:32 - who is Oliver what are you going to be
21:33 - doing what's your task here in this
21:35 - course um and then it has an example
21:38 - videos instructions as well as it checks
21:41 - every single step of the way and can
21:43 - give them hints as well and so it's very
21:45 - user friendly um we develop this because
21:49 - we know a AI is our world and it's hands
21:52 - on AI with pose detection so students
21:55 - actually get to train the program and
21:57 - recognize as the poses to play the game
21:59 - at the end so um it's really neat I
22:01 - think you'll really enjoy it as well as
22:03 - your students um so let's take a second
22:06 - and get started um so as you can see
22:08 - here's the overview like I said here's
22:09 - that listen button I'll quickly click on
22:11 - it it's going to be an exciting M so
22:14 - that you can hear it but you can also
22:16 - click stop if you don't want to use that
22:17 - anymore and students can read um and
22:21 - then I'm going to skip down here to save
22:22 - us some time so also a feature I love
22:25 - about our courses is when it gives you a
22:27 - a command it also color coordinates it
22:30 - down here um within the second section
22:33 - this is the code editor so that when
22:35 - they the library of blocks they're
22:37 - categorized by color so that they're
22:39 - easy for students and for teachers to
22:41 - find um and then it also refers to that
22:44 - color over here in instructions so I
22:46 - think that's very helpful that you'll
22:47 - enjoy that and then this third section
22:49 - is the game area um where when we click
22:51 - run and its time it actually runs the
22:53 - game as well as it's the host there for
22:56 - the the tabs like the Sprites widget
22:58 - sounds in the games so let's get started
23:01 - so my first instructions as you can see
23:03 - it's very userfriendly like I said I
23:05 - could play it but I'm just going to
23:06 - quickly read it so let's start with
23:07 - moving Oliver it starts kind of very
23:10 - basic and moves students up and
23:11 - progresses them so it's asking me to
23:13 - drag the step block which is already
23:15 - here from the movement Library so if I
23:18 - was not in the movement Library it tells
23:20 - me to come here and prompts me to click
23:22 - on this tab and then attach it to that
23:25 - onrun block which is already there um
23:27 - within the code editor and you heard
23:30 - that little click I hope and then I can
23:33 - check yay so um very rewarding it lets
23:36 - students know great just very small
23:38 - steps it makes them feel successful I've
23:40 - been confident as a learner so now I can
23:42 - click on run and see what
23:44 - happens and then it says click on
23:47 - stop and hopefully you heard that um
23:50 - sound again so it lets me know I've
23:52 - completed that they're green and it's
23:54 - moving me on so now all are barely moved
23:57 - um we need to to keep him moving though
23:58 - so let's remove this step block and put
24:01 - it back um drag a loot block from the
24:04 - control so yet again the control is
24:06 - color coordinated for me so I need that
24:08 - loot block and I'm going to attach it to
24:10 - the on
24:12 - run and then I can drag a step block
24:14 - from the movement Library still guiding
24:16 - me one step at a time attached it
24:20 - perfect now as a learner I'm ready to
24:22 - check there we go now click on
24:25 - run yay I've moved them over
24:28 - here great job so that is the first
24:31 - exercise and it'll tell them great job
24:33 - and prompt them to go to the next so
24:35 - let's look at the second exercise here
24:38 - so this is where we're going to get to
24:39 - do the pose detection which I really
24:41 - wanted to get into to show you how it
24:42 - works um so we're have to create the AI
24:45 - model to be able to then use it later um
24:48 - so let's go ahead and create it so it
24:50 - says click add new model over
24:53 - here I have to give it a name I'm going
24:55 - to call power code webinar just real
24:58 - quick um and like I said you have to
25:00 - have a webcam for this and so when I'm
25:02 - ready I need to and I it is also case
25:05 - sensitive and um spelling as well counts
25:09 - so if name the first one raise hands it
25:11 - does need to be typed in exactly how you
25:14 - see it so it gave me that check because
25:17 - I spelled it correctly and had lowercase
25:20 - as well um and then now when I'm ready
25:23 - um this is where we need to use the
25:25 - webcam so it says click on record
25:28 - okay it might prompt students the first
25:30 - time I've used my webcam before here um
25:33 - but as you all know as Educators um you
25:35 - might need to help support students um
25:38 - with accepting using the webcam so you
25:41 - may need to do that so here I am um so
25:44 - I've clicked there um now I need to
25:46 - click on record and the timer icons I'm
25:48 - going to turn that on because it's
25:49 - helpful if you have to back away for the
25:52 - next one and then when I click to record
25:54 - it's going to take pictures I need to
25:56 - raise my hands and move a little little
25:57 - bit so that it gets versions of my pose
25:59 - so I'm going to be ready and that's why
26:01 - that timer is on just in case students
26:03 - need a second to prepare I'm going to
26:05 - kind of move around and it so you can
26:07 - see it's getting those samples raising
26:09 - my hand so that the computer can detect
26:12 - that so I've got my samples I'm good and
26:15 - gave me a check now I'm going to name
26:16 - the second one here stand same thing the
26:20 - spelling and capitalization matters and
26:22 - now I need to back up and stand that's
26:24 - why that also that timer is helpful um
26:27 - so I'm going to click on the timer icon
26:28 - I did it I'm going to click to record
26:30 - I'm going to start backing up I'm going
26:31 - to stand straight it says and try to
26:34 - move a little bit to make many versions
26:36 - of my pose so I'm going to stand up
26:39 - there we go and then kind of move around
26:41 - a little bit so it's detecting as you
26:43 - can see all of my samples till it stops
26:47 - okay 178 that should be good going to
26:49 - move back up here Lauren you actually um
26:54 - uh recorded on the same class instead of
26:56 - the one on the
26:58 - then oh ah thank you so much livnat
27:02 - she's right I did not come back down
27:04 - here thank you so I can it's a great
27:06 - teaching point right that happens I'm
27:08 - going to remove all these samples raise
27:11 - my hands again so it doesn't get
27:12 - confused right thank you livette and
27:15 - that would have happened to students so
27:16 - I'm glad that was a perfect teachable
27:17 - moment thank you for
27:19 - unmuting
27:21 - okay there we go so now I have my 102
27:23 - samples of my raising hand great now in
27:27 - stay and I need to record thank you so
27:30 - much now I'm going to back up again I'm
27:32 - going to try to stand up and get myself
27:34 - in the view I'm GNA move around a little
27:37 - bit there we go and now I got the check
27:41 - there we
27:43 - go so now I'm ready to train the model
27:45 - so I have to click train this might take
27:47 - a second so I'm going to go ahead and
27:48 - click train as I talk and so now it's
27:51 - taking those images and like I said
27:53 - those are um they're being into vectors
27:56 - so it's not it's Copa compliant not
27:58 - saving for students not traceable as you
28:01 - can see it's training it I click train
28:04 - yay and I can preview them if I want but
28:06 - for time I'm just going to say
28:08 - save yay so now I'm ready so it's a
28:11 - great job I'm ready for exercise 3 which
28:13 - is actually using this and I know we're
28:15 - getting towards the end of the webinar
28:16 - we have like two minutes so I'm going to
28:17 - quickly show you how this works um on
28:20 - exercise 3 and then take us back to our
28:22 - slides and then you can have fun
28:24 - exploring the rest of the exercises so
28:27 - um I have to choose the model so this
28:29 - was the webinar click check add the
28:32 - webcam widgets I'm need to come over
28:33 - here add I'm going to add my webcam
28:35 - wedget here and it says drag it up here
28:38 - so it's kind of out of the way of the
28:39 - game um and then I need to click on my
28:44 - ow so now I've got my Sprite owl now I'm
28:46 - coding the owl I need to do my on
28:49 - prediction and change it to raise hands
28:51 - it's already there go ahead and check
28:53 - drag my jump block from the movement
28:56 - Library I'm show you how it jumps and
28:58 - then there we
29:00 - go okay let's click run and now there we
29:05 - go I can use my hands come on Oliver get
29:07 - up
29:08 - there there we
29:11 - go so that's just kind of to let you see
29:13 - how that works so there's exercise
29:16 - three all right let's go on back for
29:19 - time so like I said it gets more complex
29:23 - and it allows you to add a third pose
29:25 - later um to use and play the game at the
29:28 - end which is really fun for everybody so
29:30 - I really hope you enjoy that so last but
29:33 - not least let's look at our final
29:35 - outcome of that guidance on preparing
29:37 - for hour of code um you know your
29:40 - students the best um you're with them
29:43 - every day so decide on their level is
29:45 - this the first time they've ever seen
29:46 - coding so do you need to start lower
29:47 - with a course like Code Monkey Jr or
29:50 - Beaver achiever or is it to advance
29:52 - their skills are they ready for AI as a
29:54 - hoot are they ready for banana tails
29:56 - with python so you kind of decide always
29:58 - always like all teachers over play I
30:00 - know they do plan ahead so if you want
30:03 - to use the courses um with saving you
30:06 - need to go ahead and sign up that 30-day
30:08 - free trial um the next coming day so
30:10 - that you can decide how you want
30:11 - students to sign on to be or to log in
30:15 - um to be able to save their progress if
30:17 - not that's fine too then you can go
30:19 - directly to our hour of code website or
30:22 - um also through our Code Monkey site and
30:24 - students can play without saving that's
30:26 - fine do you have enough to devices if
30:28 - not do they need to share um how will
30:30 - you pair them up what other equipment
30:32 - might you need um is it going to be loud
30:34 - do you want them to have headphones um
30:36 - do they need a mouse if we're doing some
30:37 - text Bas coding a um and a keyboard um
30:40 - what about a webcam if you're using AI a
30:42 - hoot so just think ahead check the
30:44 - internet connection I know you know that
30:46 - but um if you're using a particular
30:48 - space around the school sometimes we see
30:50 - teachers bringing together students for
30:52 - a really fun big event in a library or
30:55 - in a cafeteria or a gym but something
30:57 - they didn't quite think about ahead of
30:59 - time is what's the internet like in
31:01 - there until you get in there and it
31:02 - doesn't work and so go down there and
31:04 - give it a little trial run and see how
31:06 - that goes and if not um reach out to
31:09 - your school or District administrator
31:10 - for technology to help get some support
31:12 - with that before next week um make sure
31:15 - you access and review those free teacher
31:16 - resources of each course they're there
31:18 - for you um to help support you and last
31:21 - but not least if you need help please
31:23 - visit our help center and this link is
31:25 - here on the slides um but it is an
31:27 - amazing resource you can come here
31:29 - anytime for on demand support we have
31:31 - articles that are right here but also
31:34 - you can search at anytime like if you
31:35 - want student sign
31:38 - in you can also search for it and it's
31:40 - going to give you all of our articles
31:42 - about how students can sign in to help
31:44 - you great tutorials so check that out
31:47 - and last but not least celebrate your
31:49 - kids um we all like to be celebrated
31:51 - right so come here and get these student
31:54 - certificates and recognize them whether
31:55 - you send them home put them in the
31:57 - hallway take pictures of them and if
31:59 - they do take pictures with them U maybe
32:01 - post us and tag us on social media as

32:21 - that if you want to tag um hang with us
32:24 - or also tag us at COD Monkey St on any
32:27 - of our social media sites um visit our
32:29 - help center if you need support um and
32:31 - then also if you're interested in
32:33 - learning more and moving forward with a
32:35 - subscription please reach out to Molly
32:37 - um she'd love to help support you with
32:39 - that and her sales
32:41 - team so um let's see we're out of time
32:44 - but um let's check out Molly do you mind
32:47 - telling me any questions maybe they had
32:50 - there in the chat that maybe we could
32:51 - answer quickly yes there was a great
32:55 - question from Brian which
32:57 - uh he asked what are common formats for
32:59 - offering the hour of code to students
33:01 - schoolwide designated time and day what
33:04 - are some the options you'd recommend
33:06 - that I POs to my
33:08 - administrators that is a million dooll
33:11 - question there Brian um I see it used in
33:14 - all different ways I just you know
33:15 - formerly worked in a school district um
33:17 - here this past year and I saw sometimes
33:20 - an individual teacher was just
33:22 - passionate about it and she offered that
33:23 - time for one hour just during that week
33:27 - um on her own or his own um I sometimes
33:30 - saw a library media specialist at the
33:32 - school kind of man that and have a whole
33:35 - schoolwide event and they pulled
33:36 - students um you know during maybe a
33:38 - related arts time and they hosted it
33:41 - just one day that week when they saw
33:42 - them um or I've seen a whole school
33:46 - celebrate and I've seen them um you know
33:49 - have like like people do like drop
33:51 - everything and read like drop everything
33:53 - in code and for that hour which I know
33:55 - can be risky with internet um for that
33:57 - hour every teacher gets on and it's a
33:59 - whole schoolwide event especially if you
34:01 - have enough devices you could do
34:03 - something like that um and then also at
34:05 - the district level I've seen districts
34:07 - have really neat competitions and um for
34:10 - like every you know student or teacher
34:12 - that participates um they do some sort
34:14 - of fun reward and they you know post it
34:16 - and make a big deal about it on their
34:18 - social media so um I've seen it used all
34:21 - different ways and I think that they're
34:22 - all great just giving students the
34:24 - opportunity is um you know the purpose
34:27 - of it and so um Brian please reach out
34:29 - to me individually if you want to at
34:30 - lauren. rodem monkey.com if you want to
34:33 - know or if you want to partner and talk
34:35 - about that further um but like I said
34:37 - I've seen many options I know we're
34:39 - getting close it's about you know three
34:40 - or four instructional days away now at
34:42 - this point we're at the end of the day
34:43 - on Tuesday but I'd love to talk to you
34:45 - more about that as well so um or if
34:47 - anyone in the chat you know wants to pop
34:49 - in how they're using it that would be
34:50 - great as well thanks Molly for that
34:53 - question and
34:55 - Brian
34:59 - Molly are there any other burning
35:01 - questions people had or um are we ready

35:13 - reach out to us um if you have further
35:15 - questions or need support um but we're
35:17 - really excited and we appreciate you
35:19 - providing your students this coding
35:21 - opportunity next week bye
35:25 - everyone

then next we also have here is livette and I'll go ahead and let her unmute and introduce herself as well hi everyone my name is livnat I'm um the pedagogy and content developer at Codman um responsible for creating some of the hour of code that Lauren will present today uh and I'll answer any question relating to content or whatever else uh that you have thank you so much lat so first also um Jonathan Shore our Code Monkey one of the founders and CEO he wanted to be here um today this afternoon but for him it's 10 o'clock at night um so I have a little video instead for him that I'm going to play for you hello my name is John sh and I'm the founder and CEO here at COD monkey Studios thank you for joining us today for the hour code webinar for 2023 we hope that you and your students enjoy our free code monkey course offering next week to celebrate the annual hour of code coding boosts problem solving skills improve computational thinking encourages persistent teacher creativity improves confidence and communication skill as well as help to prepare children for the future although many Educators provide time for students students to code during this celebratory week it is important that we give our student the opportunity to code year round as well we hope that you join us next week to expose your students to our engaging coding courses as well as consider joining us year round with a subscription happy coding sorry also um well thank you Jonathan even though he's not here right now um he just wanted like I said introduce himself um as well as tell you a little bit about code monkey and his passion for coding and the importance of coding and not only next week for hour of code but also like we said year round um at any time if you want to stay up to date on all the latest information on all things codemonkey be sure to follow us on all of our social media Outlets um they're all at codemonkey s you and we'll share this slide Deck with you later um through the chat um as well as also um later within if you're watching the recording we'll have this in the description and you can click on any of these links if you want to directly to take you to Twitter or X Instagram Facebook or LinkedIn um and you can follow us um there and start tagging us as well um so please do make sure you do that like I said we post daily so to kind of stay up to date on Code Monkey and all of our offerings um it's a great idea to follow us there so let's take a minute and look at our webinar outcomes for today um like Molly mentioned she'll be and livnat as well kind of Manning that Q&A although we reserve time at the end for Q&A please feel free at any time there at the bottom you have that tool that says Q&A and you can type in your questions there and we'll try to answer them as we go but we do have that designated time at the end um I'm really excited because yes we'll talk about the hour of code and the importance of coding um we'll look a little bit at code ny's Journey um and where we've kind of come and who we are um but we're going to kind of release or share with you our free courses as well as really highlight our new AI as a hoot which is the AI pose detection and so I'm really excited about that today to share that with you and how it works we'll do a couple of the exercises together so you feel comfortable with using it with your students um and then we'll kind of finish up with a little bit of guidance about how to prepare for hour of code in your classroom um whether might also be your school if you're a school leader or maybe you're a district leader and so you might need to prepare um that way as well so let's look a little bit at what hour of code is I cannot believe but hour of code actually started in December of 2013 so this is now the 11th year for hour of code which is absolutely amazing that we're providing our students this opportunity each year and we have now for 11 years um so what the hour code is if you're unfamiliar is that free opportunity that's hosted each year to provide kind of like an introduction to computer science and it's always done through those fun activ activities and also our of code has videos for Learners and it's at all skill levels because they know that some students get this opportunity just this once a year um some have it all during the year which is great and it's Incorporated so um they can kind of get started any way that they need to it just that right level for them um this year's celebration I think it's Unique even though I've participated many years because um yes we have coding but also AI is supported because we know AI is our world right now um so that theyve Incorporated that as well just like you see that our new course AI zahoot is in there as well um but also we have 400 Partners this year 20,000 Educators have already signed up and then also 58,000 volunteers as well um and then also 180 countries are already signed up to participate and this is a kind of a neat graphic to kind of look and see how many people plan on next week participating in that hour of code so really cool so let's look at a little bit more about we have a promotional video about what the hour of codee is I'd like to share with you right now um but also keep in mind that this video is um on our YouTube channel um which can also be found in the description notes of this slide um so that you can follow us or add us there our Channel on YouTube and you can show this to your students next week other teachers um anyone in your District that might not know what hour of code is to help to explain to them so let's check out this video hey guys I bet you're wondering where I'm going today well we're all going to this special event and you can join in too you know they say a thousand monkeys with a thousand years can write the works of Shakespeare but we're not going to write Shakespeare we're going to write code because every year in December we get together it's called hour of code it's a worldwide event where teachers and students in 45 different languages across more than 180 countries come together to learn computer coding it's a chance to understand how the apps and Tech we use every day are made it's a chance for the next generation of Engineers and programmers to get a head start on all the wonderful things that we'll create I'm talking about you I know it looks a bit scary at first but don't worry you don't even need to know anything about coding yourself because code monkey has selfguided tutorials for you to choose from you've got everything you need to make your own games and applications and don't worry if you don't have your own computer you can even share equipment to make things together it's really good for team building we've got so many cool things to do for all ages can create a chat lot you can create your own physics you can make games about catching bananas you can even help my friend Bieber do all sorts of things and it's all free and there are short courses and big courses and there are even bigger challenges if you want you can do it your way however long you want how you want but even where you want and you don't even have to be a kid even adults can start learning how to c anyone can sign up and be part of the fun so do it today and get ready for December who knows where your adventures will take you what you do during the hour of code is up to you and there are so many possibilities that I know you'll make something great it's so easy even a monkey could do it please like this video share with your friends and don't forget to subscribe to our Channel thank you for watching like I said um this video is great for explaining to other Educators but also you can pull this video up and share this with your students next week if you want um here in just a second Molly's going to throw the slide deck Link in the chat um so that you can access it um and then also within that slide deck link um look for our YouTube channel link directly so that you can find this video and use it as well um so I hope you enjoyed that and like they said um the hour of code it's great because all level of Learners can use it it's that great exposure um whether you're computer science teacher and you are using coding every day or you're a classroom teacher and you only use it once a year for hour of code um we have resources that I'll show you here in just a minute to help you feel comfortable so that you can get started see you hey guys so let me take a moment just to tell you about Code Monkey as we have many participants here on um this webinar whether you're live or watching later and some of you are awesome existing customers and you know Code Monkey you love Code Monkey but some of you are potential new users here today and so I want to tell you a little bit about code monkey and what kind of sets us aside from some of the other subscriptions out there um so first we are are that leading kids program provided we provide an engaging online course um for students to learn coding um what's really neat about us that I think really sets us aside um is it was designed with schools and teachers in mind because it's easy to use um we have a informative student teacher and administrator dashboard so that you can fully see all of our courses access the resources monitor your students progress um to help you know provide next steps for them and so it's not just a a website where you assign courses and classes um it's very intentional um and so that students um are progressing at just the right level and you're pushing them even Beyond um it is standards aligned both with csta or computer science teacher Association standards and ISTA standards as well um and then we also have alignment documents for individual State Standards upon request so if that's something you're interested in we can provide that as well of how each and every one of our courses align with your individual state standards um also we are different because we're a full k through eight coding curriculum so we have that full curriculum that and actually I say you can use it free Cas I've used it with preschoolers all the way into High School depending on where your um students are kind of at with their coding skills um also there within the description or the speaker notes um you can find our full scope and sequence document so it's kind of like a curriculum map to show you which courses we recommend you use with which grade levels and um how they're used and then last but not least and there's no prior coding experience needed to teach it so um our Founders and CEOs we they know that they built this because they know teachers don't always have the background um in coding we're classroom teachers and we might have special ed backgrounds and we might have literacy or math backgrounds um but at times it's mandated and we want to provide our students that opportunity um so you don't have to have background knowledge and we have full resources full lesson plans on our website to help you every step of the way um so that you feel confident to teach that so that's just a little bit about Code Monkey who we are what our subscription is and like I said kind of what sets us apart from some of the other providers out there so let's get into the meat of our webinar today um let's look at our 2023 I'm really excited to announce this hour of code course um courses and also activity offerings um you will see here we have 12 courses or sometimes we call them activity offerings this year for you um and then just released here as you can see is our new AI is a hoot pose detection that I'm going to actually guide and walk you through here in just a moment as well um I'm really excited I said there's 12 1hour courses that are free um that includes our new but that's really two over 207 challenges and over 12 hours of content you could use technically next week with your students if you wanted to so let's look at some people prefer to act access our courses and our resources directly through the hour of code site and if you want to do that that's perfectly fine um so how you can do that is you can go and this is all linked it'll be in the slides for you you can go to the hour of code website and then I do recommend if you are going to participate go ahead and click here for educators and hosts that they can document and see that um you are also participating to kind of get that track record so you can click there to access all of their resources also if you want to specifically find well how can I filter and find just Code Monkey um you can come here through activities and filter it um and let me click and show you how to do that so you can click here go to the our code website like we said um you can come to activities and once you're here on activities and you scroll down um they have R RS through if you come down to either you can come through code bunky here or they also have us as the the new one Code Monkey studio so they did kind of separate us into two but you can find most of our course offerings here through the hour of code website if you would rather come here that is one way you can get to it now in my opinion where else can you find us go directly to our website I truly feel like um this is the easiest way and the most efficient because you're going to get additional courses if you come through our website all 12 of them all of our resources the certificates all the things will be from right through here also you can send your students here as well um to access these courses so um I do want to kind of also emphasize yes these are available and we are really showing them today um but also these are actually available all year long either with your free teacher trial you can sign up for a paid subscription or just a guest from this marketing page you can access this actually year round so I did want to showcase that as well so let's um actually go into and let me show you so you can come here to our codem monkey.com website and then SL hour of code um and I'm going to click on it here for you so here we are if not if you went to codem monkey.com under resources and then hour of code this will also directly take you here um and then it's important that you scroll down so it's going to give you that video also if you want the video directly from here tells you a little bit about hour of code how it works but this is where you can get to all 12 of our courses and get started playing um this is a great way to kind of look and just see well what what is it for um what's it called who is it for is it block based or text based or is it python um and then also gives you a little um brief explanation but where the meat is is when you click on so let me click on Code Monkey Jr you can come here and as you can see you can start right here and you can start playing you do not have to sign up and your students can click here or you can sign up for a free trial and if you want to be able to have access to the full lesson plans as well as track student progress and have the saving as well this week next week um but from here you can like I said there's a million places to find information or start playing but it will also tell you a little bit more about that particular course so how many levels What age we recommend Concepts they'll be using if it's block based text base and python here's where you can find teacher notes um so that's really helpful to help inform yourself as a teacher to be able to explore it ahead of time and um so you can click there and then it'll walk you through even deeper more of an overview specifications and how to get started specific steps certificates can be found here um frequently asked questions if you have questions about this particular course um you can find that and yet again if at any time um you want your students to be able to save that um you can sign up for a free teacher trial for 30 days it does not require any type of information um like a credit card or anything to get started you just need your teacher email and you can log in by creating a password or using your single sign on you already have and you can get started so I highly recommend you take advantage of that especially if you want to use it for hour of code go ahead and sign up today or this week so you can start exploring your teacher dashboard and you can assign those courses so students can sign in next week and save their progress as they go okay so let's get back to here we go our new offering which is AI zahoot so I would like to spend about 10 the last 5 to 10 minutes in wall o have time for a Q&A if you have any questions at the end um looking at our new offering that we're allowing everyone access to um as you can see there's livat there um using the pose detection um to program um Oliver the ow so let's take a look and talk about this new offering so this course it's really neat because it allows students to use their webcam to train that AI model and then you use those poses to get all over the ow between obstacles to get to the end of his route um so you do have to have a webcam on the device to be able to be successful on this um we do recommend you use it for ages 8 through 12 but with support or partnering them up I think you could use it at a younger um grade level the it is nine exercises so it is kind of on the shorter end I would say it took me a solid at least 30 minutes as an adult who was kind of comfortable with coating um to get through it so kind of gauge your time maybe as a teacher practice it you know your students better than anyone else so that you can kind of see how long that might take or if you're signing in what would be great is you could use this all week long this student progress would be saved um it is using block coding um so that's something that is that lower level that help make students successful um and then something to definitely note is I want you to know that um all the images used to train the models are not stored and it's safe for student use so it is Copa compliant so um please don't worry about that we make sure that um we are Copa compant so that um it is safe for all of our users both teachers and for students so let's go ahead and take a moment and look at the first three exercises I'm going to go kind of fast but I want you to feel comfortable so that you can get on and explore it in case you do want to use it with your students next week so let me go ahead and this is a direct link to it but like I said you can find it right through our website and it's also available on that hour of code website as well so let's come on in here um to AI zahoot as you can see um like I mentioned this course is block based um it's nine exercises total um each exercise um it's great this over here I like to call this first section kind of the overview section with the instructions um it's great because it shows students what exercise they're on um there are great builtin accommodating features like you can listen if you'd like um but it gives students an overview of um kind of setting up the stage of well you know who is Oliver what are you going to be doing what's your task here in this course um and then it has an example videos instructions as well as it checks every single step of the way and can give them hints as well and so it's very user friendly um we develop this because we know a AI is our world and it's hands on AI with pose detection so students actually get to train the program and recognize as the poses to play the game at the end so um it's really neat I think you'll really enjoy it as well as your students um so let's take a second and get started um so as you can see here's the overview like I said here's that listen button I'll quickly click on it it's going to be an exciting M so that you can hear it but you can also click stop if you don't want to use that anymore and students can read um and then I'm going to skip down here to save us some time so also a feature I love about our courses is when it gives you a a command it also color coordinates it down here um within the second section this is the code editor so that when they the library of blocks they're categorized by color so that they're easy for students and for teachers to find um and then it also refers to that color over here in instructions so I think that's very helpful that you'll enjoy that and then this third section is the game area um where when we click run and its time it actually runs the game as well as it's the host there for the the tabs like the Sprites widget sounds in the games so let's get started so my first instructions as you can see it's very userfriendly like I said I could play it but I'm just going to quickly read it so let's start with moving Oliver it starts kind of very basic and moves students up and progresses them so it's asking me to drag the step block which is already here from the movement Library so if I was not in the movement Library it tells me to come here and prompts me to click on this tab and then attach it to that onrun block which is already there um within the code editor and you heard that little click I hope and then I can check yay so um very rewarding it lets students know great just very small steps it makes them feel successful I've been confident as a learner so now I can click on run and see what happens and then it says click on stop and hopefully you heard that um sound again so it lets me know I've completed that they're green and it's moving me on so now all are barely moved um we need to to keep him moving though so let's remove this step block and put it back um drag a loot block from the control so yet again the control is color coordinated for me so I need that loot block and I'm going to attach it to the on run and then I can drag a step block from the movement Library still guiding me one step at a time attached it perfect now as a learner I'm ready to check there we go now click on run yay I've moved them over here great job so that is the first exercise and it'll tell them great job and prompt them to go to the next so let's look at the second exercise here so this is where we're going to get to do the pose detection which I really wanted to get into to show you how it works um so we're have to create the AI model to be able to then use it later um so let's go ahead and create it so it says click add new model over here I have to give it a name I'm going to call power code webinar just real quick um and like I said you have to have a webcam for this and so when I'm ready I need to and I it is also case sensitive and um spelling as well counts so if name the first one raise hands it does need to be typed in exactly how you see it so it gave me that check because I spelled it correctly and had lowercase as well um and then now when I'm ready um this is where we need to use the webcam so it says click on record okay it might prompt students the first time I've used my webcam before here um but as you all know as Educators um you might need to help support students um with accepting using the webcam so you may need to do that so here I am um so I've clicked there um now I need to click on record and the timer icons I'm going to turn that on because it's helpful if you have to back away for the next one and then when I click to record it's going to take pictures I need to raise my hands and move a little little bit so that it gets versions of my pose so I'm going to be ready and that's why that timer is on just in case students need a second to prepare I'm going to kind of move around and it so you can see it's getting those samples raising my hand so that the computer can detect that so I've got my samples I'm good and gave me a check now I'm going to name the second one here stand same thing the spelling and capitalization matters and now I need to back up and stand that's why that also that timer is helpful um so I'm going to click on the timer icon I did it I'm going to click to record I'm going to start backing up I'm going to stand straight it says and try to move a little bit to make many versions of my pose so I'm going to stand up there we go and then kind of move around a little bit so it's detecting as you can see all of my samples till it stops okay 178 that should be good going to move back up here Lauren you actually um uh recorded on the same class instead of the one on the then oh ah thank you so much livnat she's right I did not come back down here thank you so I can it's a great teaching point right that happens I'm going to remove all these samples raise my hands again so it doesn't get confused right thank you livette and that would have happened to students so I'm glad that was a perfect teachable moment thank you for unmuting okay there we go so now I have my 102 samples of my raising hand great now in stay and I need to record thank you so much now I'm going to back up again I'm going to try to stand up and get myself in the view I'm GNA move around a little bit there we go and now I got the check there we go so now I'm ready to train the model so I have to click train this might take a second so I'm going to go ahead and click train as I talk and so now it's taking those images and like I said those are um they're being into vectors so it's not it's Copa compliant not saving for students not traceable as you can see it's training it I click train yay and I can preview them if I want but for time I'm just going to say save yay so now I'm ready so it's a great job I'm ready for exercise 3 which is actually using this and I know we're getting towards the end of the webinar we have like two minutes so I'm going to quickly show you how this works um on exercise 3 and then take us back to our slides and then you can have fun exploring the rest of the exercises so um I have to choose the model so this was the webinar click check add the webcam widgets I'm need to come over here add I'm going to add my webcam wedget here and it says drag it up here so it's kind of out of the way of the game um and then I need to click on my ow so now I've got my Sprite owl now I'm coding the owl I need to do my on prediction and change it to raise hands it's already there go ahead and check drag my jump block from the movement Library I'm show you how it jumps and then there we go okay let's click run and now there we go I can use my hands come on Oliver get up there there we go so that's just kind of to let you see how that works so there's exercise three all right let's go on back for time so like I said it gets more complex and it allows you to add a third pose later um to use and play the game at the end which is really fun for everybody so I really hope you enjoy that so last but not least let's look at our final outcome of that guidance on preparing for hour of code um you know your students the best um you're with them every day so decide on their level is this the first time they've ever seen coding so do you need to start lower with a course like Code Monkey Jr or Beaver achiever or is it to advance their skills are they ready for AI as a hoot are they ready for banana tails with python so you kind of decide always always like all teachers over play I know they do plan ahead so if you want to use the courses um with saving you need to go ahead and sign up that 30day free trial um the next coming day so that you can decide how you want students to sign on to be or to log in um to be able to save their progress if not that's fine too then you can go directly to our hour of code website or um also through our Code Monkey site and students can play without saving that's fine do you have enough to devices if not do they need to share um how will you pair them up what other equipment might you need um is it going to be loud do you want them to have headphones um do they need a mouse if we're doing some text Bas coding a um and a keyboard um what about a webcam if you're using AI a hoot so just think ahead check the internet connection I know you know that but um if you're using a particular space around the school sometimes we see teachers bringing together students for a really fun big event in a library or in a cafeteria or a gym but something they didn't quite think about ahead of time is what's the internet like in there until you get in there and it doesn't work and so go down there and give it a little trial run and see how that goes and if not um reach out to your school or District administrator for technology to help get some support with that before next week um make sure you access and review those free teacher resources of each course they're there for you um to help support you and last but not least if you need help please visit our help center and this link is here on the slides um but it is an amazing resource you can come here anytime for on demand support we have articles that are right here but also you can search at anytime like if you want student sign in you can also search for it and it's going to give you all of our articles about how students can sign in to help you great tutorials so check that out and last but not least celebrate your kids um we all like to be celebrated right so come here and get these student certificates and recognize them whether you send them home put them in the hallway take pictures of them and if they do take pictures with them U maybe post us and tag us on social media as well so recognize those those friends so thank you all so much for joining us today um whether you are live right now or watching us recording um we're excited to partner with you and provide this special opportunity to your students during the week of December 4th um like I mentioned please make sure that if you want to tag um hang with us or also tag us at COD Monkey St on any of our social media sites um visit our help center if you need support um and then also if you're interested in learning more and moving forward with a subscription please reach out to Molly um she'd love to help support you with that and her sales team so um let's see we're out of time but um let's check out Molly do you mind telling me any questions maybe they had there in the chat that maybe we could answer quickly yes there was a great question from Brian which uh he asked what are common formats for offering the hour of code to students schoolwide designated time and day what are some the options you'd recommend that I POs to my administrators that is a million dooll question there Brian um I see it used in all different ways I just you know formerly worked in a school district um here this past year and I saw sometimes an individual teacher was just passionate about it and she offered that time for one hour just during that week um on her own or his own um I sometimes saw a library media specialist at the school kind of man that and have a whole schoolwide event and they pulled students um you know during maybe a related arts time and they hosted it just one day that week when they saw them um or I've seen a whole school celebrate and I've seen them um you know have like like people do like drop everything and read like drop everything in code and for that hour which I know can be risky with internet um for that hour every teacher gets on and it's a whole schoolwide event especially if you have enough devices you could do something like that um and then also at the district level I've seen districts have really neat competitions and um for like every you know student or teacher that participates um they do some sort of fun reward and they you know post it and make a big deal about it on their social media so um I've seen it used all different ways and I think that they're all great just giving students the opportunity is um you know the purpose of it and so um Brian please reach out to me individually if you want to at lauren. rodem monkey.com if you want to know or if you want to partner and talk about that further um but like I said I've seen many options I know we're getting close it's about you know three or four instructional days away now at this point we're at the end of the day on Tuesday but I'd love to talk to you more about that as well so um or if anyone in the chat you know wants to pop in how they're using it that would be great as well thanks Molly for that question and Brian Molly are there any other burning questions people had or um are we ready to wrap up that was it well thank every thank you everyone for joining us um like I said um please reach out to us um if you have further questions or need support um but we're really excited and we appreciate you providing your students this coding opportunity next week bye everyone
