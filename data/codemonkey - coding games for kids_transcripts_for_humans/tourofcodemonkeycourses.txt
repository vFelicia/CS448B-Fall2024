00:01 - so welcome
00:03 - all of you teachers and code monkey
00:05 - users to the second webinar of our back
00:07 - to school season how to set up and
00:08 - manage your classrooms the code monkey
00:10 - team wants to personally thank you for
00:12 - joining us for our webinar today
00:14 - and we know that your time obviously has
00:16 - been just turned upside down with
00:17 - everything that you're facing and how
00:19 - everything in education has been shaken
00:20 - up so our goal today is to make sure
00:22 - that you're getting
00:23 - what you need out of today's webinar to
00:24 - help better prepare you to teach
00:26 - code monkey with your students so if you
00:28 - have any questions
00:30 - um please feel free to ask them that's
00:32 - why we have a team um
00:34 - with us to kind of help guide you

01:42 - um following today's webinar we will
01:44 - also have a survey that will pop up and
01:46 - then that survey
01:47 - will be um your professional development
01:49 - certificate that will be a mailed
01:51 - immediately to you
01:52 - afterwards so let's go ahead get ready
01:54 - to write code catch bananas and save the
01:57 - world
02:00 - so today is going to be the tour of
02:02 - course's webinar so we are going to
02:04 - focus on the tour of courses
02:06 - but before we get started we always like

02:18 - professional development
02:19 - and sales manager here at codemonkey
02:21 - i've been in education for
02:23 - well almost 12 years now i was in the
02:25 - classroom for 10 of those
02:26 - i taught anything from all the way from
02:28 - kindergarten all the way through eighth
02:30 - grade wrote digital curriculum
02:32 - and i do a lot of work in the space so
02:35 - that's a little bit about me feel free

03:04 - connecticut and a bunch of others here
03:06 - to answer
03:07 - any questions you may have and if you're
03:08 - interested afterwards in moving forward
03:11 - to learn a little bit more about code
03:12 - monkey here's my details and they'll
03:14 - probably get emailed to you as well
03:16 - after this session so nice to meet
03:19 - everyone
03:22 - hi everybody i'm brett i'm the vp of
03:24 - sales here at codemonkey
03:27 - and so i've been in edtech for quite a
03:29 - while worked with several different
03:30 - companies and
03:32 - ultimately really love computer science
03:34 - and coding education and making sure
03:36 - that
03:37 - students have this opportunity to learn
03:39 - these necessary skills
03:41 - so thank you
03:47 - hi everyone i'm molly i'm also on at the
03:49 - sales
03:50 - team um started at code monkey back in
03:52 - january but have been in the industry
03:54 - for
03:55 - a little over six years i'm also here to
03:57 - help zach
03:58 - and brett answer questions so thanks
04:00 - again for joining us today
04:04 - all right great thank you so much i'm
04:06 - glad you guys got to meet the team a
04:07 - little bit there and so just remember
04:09 - that we are here to honor your time and
04:10 - honor your questions so
04:12 - feel free to shoot those in the q a box
04:15 - and then
04:16 - any informal questions in the chat and
04:18 - it's also a time for you to communicate
04:19 - with each other as well so we encourage
04:21 - that too
04:22 - before we kind of get started here i
04:24 - always like to start off each of the
04:26 - webinars with
04:27 - a poll just kind of seeing who you are
04:29 - and just kind of getting a feel for our
04:30 - audience for today so
04:32 - i'm going to go ahead and launch this
04:33 - poll and i'm going to give you just a
04:34 - few minutes to go ahead and take that
04:36 - and then we will go ahead and get
04:38 - started with our webinar
05:06 - all righty we'll get you just a couple
05:08 - more minutes here or just a couple
05:10 - more seconds i guess you would say to go
05:12 - ahead and complete this
05:13 - quiz here just to kind of get a feel for
05:16 - our audience for this afternoon
05:26 - uh katrina if you're having trouble um
05:28 - submitting for the poll you can
05:30 - feel free to either add that here in the
05:32 - chat box or
05:33 - um sometimes it's just a
05:37 - connect connection issue with zoom
05:58 - okay great looks like majority of you
06:00 - have had the chance to vote it sounds
06:01 - like some of you are having a little bit
06:02 - of issues with that which is totally
06:04 - fine
06:05 - but i'm just going to go ahead and share
06:08 - these
06:09 - i'm going to end the result or in the
06:10 - poll here and then i'm going to share
06:11 - the results with you just so you guys
06:13 - can kind of see so
06:14 - most of the people um just checking to
06:17 - see how you feel so far with code monkey
06:19 - and
06:20 - most of you are kind of somewhat in the
06:21 - middle which is great
06:23 - with majority of you needing a little
06:24 - bit of help so that's exactly what
06:26 - today's webinar is here for
06:28 - what is your role in the organization it
06:30 - seems like it's pretty
06:31 - tied up between most of the positions
06:33 - here so elementary middle school
06:36 - library and then some of you in the
06:39 - other category so probably technology
06:40 - teacher or something around
06:42 - that landscape how comfortable do you
06:46 - feel with
06:46 - coding it seems most of you are either
06:48 - in the middle or you
06:49 - are a novice so um
06:54 - so just wanted to share that too so so
06:57 - of course
06:57 - feel free to ask those questions and
06:59 - we'll give you some resources here at
07:00 - the end to just support you the best
07:01 - that we can
07:04 - all right great so now we're going to go
07:05 - ahead and get started and so we always
07:08 - like to start off with just talking
07:09 - about what code monkey is
07:11 - who are we and kind of what is our
07:13 - vision for the future
07:15 - so code monkey is a leading coding
07:19 - program for students to engage them
07:21 - in online courses to learn how to code
07:24 - it is made with schools and teachers in
07:27 - mind and then we are standards align and
07:29 - it is a coding curriculum for k through
07:31 - eight so we will go through that today
07:32 - and the best part about it is that
07:33 - there's no experience needed to teach
07:35 - our program
07:38 - um so code monkey does envision a global
07:42 - global i'm sorry excuse me global
07:44 - playful
07:45 - learning experience where the next
07:47 - generation of coders are born and raised
07:48 - we do have about 10 million users
07:50 - worldwide
07:51 - so we do have users you know all across
07:53 - the globe and hopefully some of you are
07:55 - joining us from around the world as well
07:57 - we aim part of our vision is that we aim
08:01 - to
08:01 - create a engaging platform where you're
08:04 - learning along
08:05 - learning knowledge alongside 21st
08:07 - century skills through collaboratively
08:08 - playing solving
08:10 - puzzles excuse me inventing creating and
08:13 - sharing
08:19 - um so today's webinar objectives are
08:22 - going to be that we're going to
08:23 - tour the courses we are going to
08:25 - showcase a few challenges from each and
08:27 - every single course to give you kind of
08:28 - a rundown and give you
08:30 - a little bit of chance to kind of
08:31 - explore what the platform looks like and
08:33 - have any questions along the way
08:34 - um then we'll tour the teacher resources
08:37 - and then we'll review limiting student
08:38 - progress and then we'll go
08:40 - ahead and have some time for some q a we
08:42 - also took some of the q a from your
08:43 - registration questions and we'll be sure
08:45 - to answer that
08:46 - um and we will answer some of your
08:48 - questions like i said along the way so
08:50 - keep an eye out in the chat box for some
08:52 - of the links and different things that
08:53 - we'll share for
08:54 - you for you as we get started so how
08:57 - does code monkey kind of work and what
08:59 - kind of
09:00 - courses do we offer so we are like i
09:02 - mentioned a coding curriculum for grades
09:04 - k
09:04 - through eight however we do have a lot
09:06 - of high school programs using
09:08 - code monkey for their intro to
09:10 - programming we like to think about
09:12 - language
09:13 - if i were to start learning a language
09:15 - today and you were to start learning the
09:16 - language today we would start both at
09:18 - the same place so sometimes that's
09:20 - exactly what how we like to think about
09:21 - coding
09:23 - throughout how we offer for our students
09:26 - so
09:26 - beginning at the beginning we will dive
09:28 - deeper into each of these courses but we
09:30 - have our code monkey junior course which
09:31 - is a block based course really about
09:33 - computational thinking and
09:34 - directionality
09:35 - then we have our beaver achiever course
09:37 - there are three
09:38 - courses within this one and they work
09:41 - through sequencing
09:42 - conditional statements and then if and
09:44 - else statements at the end
09:46 - so um that's the focus of that one then
09:49 - we have our coding adventure course and
09:50 - that's where we start coffeescript
09:52 - right away so coffeescript dota does
09:53 - math and game builder courses are all in
09:55 - coffeescript and coffeescript is a
09:57 - shorter version of javascript and python
09:59 - we found that working with students that
10:02 - the syntax sometimes would tie them up
10:04 - we know that it's really tricky for
10:06 - students to add a period or
10:08 - you know a question mark even where it
10:09 - needs to be so having syntax at an early
10:12 - age
10:12 - can be really troublesome for students
10:14 - to really get the foundations that they
10:15 - need for
10:16 - programming um and then we'll get into
10:19 - our banana tales which is our python
10:20 - course with geared for our upper
10:23 - elementary and middle school students
10:24 - and then we have our coding chatbot
10:26 - course which we'll briefly look out here
10:28 - as we get moving through so first let's
10:30 - start out with our code monkey junior
10:31 - course and let's take a look at exactly
10:34 - what that looks like so code monkey
10:35 - junior is geared for our pre-k
10:38 - k we call it for a pre-readers course
10:40 - there are 30 challenges that we have and
10:42 - they are divided into
10:44 - four chapters so there's basically four
10:49 - concepts that they're working on there
10:51 - each of the lessons
10:52 - within that are each 35 minutes and it
10:56 - takes about three months to complete if
10:58 - you are doing those lessons only once
10:59 - per week
11:00 - and it is a block-based program and they
11:03 - focus on logic
11:04 - loops sequencing algorithms counting and
11:07 - directionality like i had mentioned
11:09 - before so let's go ahead and let's take
11:10 - a look at what that actually looks like
11:12 - in the program itself so here i'm
11:14 - already logged in as you can see to the
11:15 - code monkey platform
11:17 - what i'm going to do is i'm in my
11:18 - classrooms dashboard page
11:20 - right here but i want to go to the
11:21 - courses so i'll click on the courses
11:24 - and the code monkey junior course is
11:26 - going to be
11:28 - located here sort of in the middle of
11:31 - the page here you'll see this little
11:32 - cute monkey holding the bananas with the
11:34 - treasure box
11:35 - um so if you were just beginning coding
11:38 - it would say beginning coding but here
11:39 - it said to continue coding because i've
11:41 - already
11:42 - began the process code monkey junior is
11:44 - the only program that we do have that's
11:46 - available
11:46 - on an app so the students will sign in
11:49 - and we'll save their progress and
11:50 - they'll report back to you which will
11:51 - see that
11:53 - feature as well so as that is
11:56 - um as the students are working through
12:00 - through this um it's just a really good
12:04 - course to talk about computational
12:06 - thinking so
12:07 - i am just going to
12:10 - do a little something here and i see
12:14 - that my
12:17 - i've been having computer type issues
12:19 - all day today so we'll go ahead and um
12:24 - we'll come back to this code monkey
12:25 - junior course here in just a minute i'm
12:28 - just gonna let that kind of load as we
12:30 - go through so we'll take a look at that
12:32 - i'll make sure i follow
12:33 - back with that at the end here um so
12:35 - then next we have our beaver achiever
12:37 - course and our beaver achiever course is
12:39 - for grades one through three
12:41 - beaver achiever has 55 challenges and
12:44 - that is divided into three courses like
12:46 - i have mentioned
12:47 - there are 11 35-minute lesson plans
12:51 - and if you go ahead and work through
12:53 - those it'll take about three months to
12:54 - complete if you were only
12:55 - teaching it once per week obviously
12:57 - there's a lot more
12:59 - opportunities to kind of expand upon
13:00 - that and
13:03 - you know take a little bit more time to
13:05 - deep dive into those concepts that are
13:06 - presented
13:07 - so the first concept the first course
13:09 - that i mentioned is sequencing loops and
13:11 - we do a little bit of repeat loops
13:13 - then we do conditionals and until loops
13:15 - and then we work into
13:17 - if and else conditions so let's take a
13:18 - look at what that looks like in the
13:19 - beaver achiever course
13:21 - since our code monkey junior purse
13:23 - doesn't seem to be loading here for me
13:25 - right now
13:27 - the joys of technology right always i
13:29 - gotta have something
13:31 - um so our beaver achiever course i'll
13:32 - start off here at the very beginning all
13:34 - the code monkey courses are set up in a
13:35 - similar manner
13:37 - they are fully gamified and it means
13:41 - that the students are able to
13:43 - work through in a linear manner so they
13:44 - can't skip around learn something before
13:46 - they're ready the goal is really to
13:48 - reinforce the coding concepts which are
13:50 - being presented
13:51 - we really want the students to build
13:52 - that strong foundation so that when they
13:54 - are ready to become
13:55 - those true web developers um that they
13:58 - have the
14:00 - the skill set really needed to move to
14:02 - that next step and a lot of times
14:04 - you know there's a lot of gaps when you
14:05 - work through the coding programs
14:07 - that way so here is our beaver he's one
14:10 - of my favorite characters
14:11 - throughout the coding adventure i mean
14:13 - throughout the code monkey platform
14:15 - he is super cute what you can see here
14:19 - is that
14:20 - every single one of our stories for the
14:22 - exception of coding chat bots
14:25 - and the exception of our game builder
14:27 - courses
14:29 - will have a story line so the storyline
14:30 - here at the very beginning
14:32 - is that the beaver here is um
14:35 - wants to go swimming so he needs to
14:36 - build a dam so we can see that
14:38 - each one of these rows mean one and then
14:40 - at the very beginning it's just kind of
14:42 - dragging and dropping so what's really
14:44 - nice is that there's pictures here also
14:45 - to support that for your
14:47 - for your students that might be
14:48 - struggling readers and then what you'll
14:50 - do is you'll hit the green button here
14:52 - and hit play if i were doing a lesson
14:54 - with students i would let them guide me
14:56 - through the process and see what we need
14:58 - to do here and how we can make this
15:00 - beaver
15:00 - fill up his dam you'll see those really
15:03 - fun
15:04 - little animations that are associated
15:06 - with that and then we'll see that we get
15:08 - a
15:08 - star scoring solution so a three star
15:11 - solution is our shortest most concise
15:13 - code
15:13 - a two star means that there was an extra
15:15 - step and a one star i always like to say
15:17 - are the struggle bussers um and that
15:19 - just means that they took
15:21 - probably didn't really understand the
15:22 - concept that was presented to them
15:24 - and then they um probably need a little
15:27 - bit of guidance and help from you so
15:28 - those will all report on the teacher
15:30 - side so we'll dive into that piece but
15:31 - right now i just want to dive into what
15:33 - the courses look like themselves
15:35 - so what you can see is we have a story
15:36 - map up here on the upper right hand
15:38 - corner
15:39 - and as the students progress through the
15:41 - challenges as teachers you can
15:42 - manipulate this you can move around but
15:43 - as students they have to move linearly
15:45 - through the concept that ensures
15:47 - that they're not skipping around and
15:48 - learning something before they're ready
15:50 - but they're building the foundation
15:51 - which is what we want to have
15:53 - you can't build a house without a strong
15:55 - foundation right
15:56 - so then we will go ahead and look at
16:00 - another one of these challenges here
16:01 - let's go ahead to challenge number 18.
16:03 - so i'm just going to show you what it
16:04 - kind of looks like as they progress
16:06 - you'll see that now we start to see a
16:07 - lot more pattern recognition
16:09 - a lot more computational thinking how do
16:11 - i break this down a lot more algorithmic
16:13 - thinking how do i plan this out step by
16:15 - step
16:16 - a student that is a struggle buster will
16:19 - not remember how to use a loop
16:21 - and might not really understand the
16:22 - concept of using a loop itself
16:25 - there are always multiple ways to solve
16:27 - some of our
16:28 - our coding exercises here but we really
16:31 - want to ensure that they
16:32 - really understand what a loop means and
16:34 - exactly how to utilize it and why do we
16:36 - use a loop
16:36 - and the goal is that we want to have the
16:38 - shortest most concise code always
16:40 - possible
16:41 - but it's like math there's always
16:42 - multiple ways to solve any of the coding
16:44 - challenges
16:45 - and so as we work through this we'll see
16:46 - that the code is highlighting as we go
16:48 - through the blocks
16:50 - it will also flash when we're going to
16:51 - be repeating the loop itself so
16:54 - so it gives the students a lot of things
16:56 - to kind of recognize
16:57 - the scene is on the right hand side
16:59 - where we're programming is in the middle
17:01 - and all of the features are on the
17:02 - left-hand side for them to use
17:04 - it is drag and drop we did used to only
17:07 - have tech space with these younger
17:08 - students but we just found that the
17:10 - they needed a little bit more support
17:12 - and so the block based course has been a
17:14 - really
17:15 - great addition for these students when
17:17 - we've done them in product testing and
17:18 - this is one of our newer courses so
17:20 - we're really excited to see teachers
17:22 - utilize this this year
17:24 - so that is part one of the beaver
17:27 - achiever course let's go ahead and let's
17:29 - go back to our story map and let's look
17:31 - at the conditional statement so part two
17:33 - is conditional statements
17:34 - when they go through conditionals here
17:36 - they're going to help the beaver build
17:37 - his house
17:39 - um it's raining he needs a house and so
17:41 - here there's something else that's
17:42 - happening so we see that there is a
17:44 - plank
17:44 - what do we need to do it tells us that
17:46 - we need to pick up a log and then we
17:48 - need to chop it so let's take a look at
17:50 - what happens and if like i said if i
17:51 - were a student and we're running this in
17:53 - a classroom i would have them run it
17:55 - but we can see here that we failed on
17:57 - the first attempt which is fine
17:58 - coding is all about feeling forward what
18:00 - i like to say here so
18:02 - we'll see that there is a super hint
18:04 - here and so we'll click on the hint here
18:06 - and the hint will let us know that we
18:07 - pick it up but we also need to chop the
18:09 - wood
18:09 - probably a little bit further than we
18:11 - chop the wood the first time to get the
18:13 - plank into the correct
18:14 - spot
18:20 - all right so now that we were able to
18:26 - go ahead and get that um
18:30 - we see that we had a three star solution
18:32 - as well the beaver is dancing
18:34 - um there are some fun
18:38 - anime i mean fun sounds that are also
18:40 - associated with this i was doing product
18:41 - testing with this when this first was
18:43 - launched with the students
18:44 - and they were dancing alongside the
18:46 - bieber and it was really great to see
18:48 - them
18:49 - having that lack of you know lack of
18:51 - inhibition they're so excited to kind of
18:52 - showcase
18:53 - um and celebrate with the beavers so
18:55 - that was a lot of fun um so
18:57 - here now we are on challenge 15. i just
18:59 - moved through the story map in the upper
19:01 - right hand corner to go to the last
19:03 - challenge within this coding map and
19:05 - we'll see that it's a little bit more
19:06 - complicated it's building in complexity
19:08 - as it goes
19:09 - and so we have different size
19:12 - we have different size uh planks as we
19:14 - go along so we can see what those look
19:16 - like and as the students have gotten to
19:18 - this point they'll kind of understand
19:19 - what each of the plank sizes mean and
19:21 - how they approach it
19:22 - and then we'll just go ahead and show
19:24 - the solution we can see we have
19:26 - a we have a loop and then we also have
19:29 - nested loops inside of there so there's
19:31 - a lot more thinking that's involved
19:33 - that kind of goes with this i see
19:35 - richard here you have a question about
19:37 - can the students skip around between
19:39 - challenges they cannot
19:40 - what they will see they're able to see
19:42 - their solutions on the map itself but
19:44 - they're not actually
19:46 - they are not actually skipping through
19:48 - the challenges we want to ensure that
19:49 - they have a mastery of understanding and
19:52 - that they're not just going from 1 to 15
19:54 - because if they did they would really
19:55 - miss a lot of the concepts in between
19:57 - and they that's when you have 9 000
19:59 - hands in the air
20:00 - really asking you those questions so we
20:02 - want to make sure that we
20:03 - are really supporting them and giving
20:05 - them that foundation
20:09 - but great questions so question we get a
20:11 - lot so
20:13 - all right so that's reporting back and
20:15 - now we're getting to my most favorite
20:17 - part of the beaver achiever course and
20:18 - that
20:19 - is our last one which is the if and else
20:21 - conditionals
20:22 - so here in this course the beaver
20:26 - basically the more likes that he gets
20:27 - the busier he's going to be at his
20:29 - smoothie shop
20:30 - um so we are going to be building our
20:33 - friends or our customers
20:35 - smoothies so what we can see here is
20:37 - it's very visual we can see we're going
20:39 - to have one customer which will match
20:41 - the button that we have over here we
20:43 - have our
20:44 - character or our customer and our
20:47 - customer in this case is going to be a
20:49 - monkey
20:50 - and the monkey is going to like bananas
20:51 - so what i'll do is i'll drag it over
20:53 - we can see we can also click between the
20:56 - different fruit options that are
20:57 - the fruit and honey options that are
20:59 - there and then what we'll do is we can
21:01 - drag out this button to blend and serve
21:02 - but let's say i don't do that
21:04 - i bring out this i can see that i have a
21:06 - monkey and i have the banana
21:07 - what's going to happen my character
21:09 - comes in this case it is a
21:11 - um the girl monkey i have my super hint
21:14 - that's here
21:15 - let's say i don't do that but now i know
21:16 - i need to blend and serve so there's
21:18 - another step that needs to be taken in
21:20 - the process to be able to solve this
21:22 - challenge
21:29 - um so then we go ahead and we get our
21:32 - three star solution here and then i'll
21:33 - just go ahead
21:35 - and show you what this looks like at the
21:37 - very end of this
21:38 - challenge just i mean the very end of
21:40 - this course so i'm just going to go to
21:42 - challenge 19 here
21:44 - and then katrina i see your question
21:45 - there i'll go ahead and answer that here
21:47 - in just a few minutes um so here is
21:50 - again our beaver and now we see it
21:52 - starts to get a little bit more
21:53 - complicated we have our bear we have our
21:55 - rabbit we have our
21:56 - mooser elk and we see that each one of
21:58 - them has something that they
21:59 - like but what we see is that the bear
22:02 - and the moose or the elk
22:03 - have the same preference except for the
22:07 - bear
22:07 - likes to have honey so here's where
22:09 - we'll see an if and else conditionals
22:11 - happen so we see if the rabbit comes
22:14 - we'll add carrots
22:15 - otherwise if anyone else comes they'll
22:17 - get strawberries but if the bear comes
22:19 - then he'll get honey specifically we'll
22:21 - see the same thing kind of running
22:23 - through here
22:25 - um the he'll make the combination you
22:28 - can see where it's being highlighted in
22:29 - the text which is really great to see as
22:31 - well so the students have an
22:32 - understanding of where the code is
22:33 - actually running i think sometimes the
22:35 - students just see it and they just think
22:36 - it's happening
22:37 - but here the highlighting portion really
22:39 - allows for them to see the code working
22:40 - through
22:41 - the way that it is um katrina had a
22:45 - question are the hint boxes
22:46 - audio activated or only text do the
22:49 - students have
22:50 - teacher support to this online coding
22:53 - experience so we'll talk about some of
22:54 - the ways that the teachers can support
22:55 - on the opposite side of things
22:57 - these hints are something that are
22:59 - automatically executed when the student
23:01 - fails the hint will
23:02 - pop up and there's some abilities in the
23:05 - teacher features that you can kind of
23:07 - control that but in this
23:08 - experience here these are automatically
23:11 - come up and if you saw they work
23:13 - actually there is audio for the sounds
23:16 - themselves but
23:17 - these buttons themselves don't actually
23:18 - narrate um
23:20 - but i just have the sounds turned off
23:22 - right now
23:23 - so that's what we're seeing here and now
23:25 - we can see the if and else conditionals
23:27 - and i turned the sound i realized the
23:29 - sound was off but now i can turn the
23:30 - sound on
23:31 - um so that's our beaver achiever course
23:34 - and like i mentioned i'll go back to
23:35 - that code monkey junior course here in
23:36 - just a little bit i see that
23:38 - my computer was not wanting to hang out
23:40 - with that for some reason
23:41 - okay so next we'll move on to our
23:43 - text-based coding course so let's take a
23:45 - look at
23:46 - what that looks like so we talked about
23:48 - our beaver achiever and now we have our
23:49 - coding adventure course so coding
23:51 - adventure is really geared for grades
23:52 - three through eight
23:53 - and you're probably thinking yourself oh
23:55 - my gosh that's such a huge gap between
23:57 - the students and the grade levels but
23:58 - actually it's not because it does
24:00 - it is very robust and builds in
24:02 - complexity as it goes so
24:04 - we do have many middle schoolers like i
24:05 - mentioned even some high school students
24:07 - that are taking this course because we
24:08 - think about coding as a language um here
24:11 - in this course itself there are 210
24:13 - story mode challenges and 210 skill
24:16 - modes so all in all there's about 420
24:18 - challenges that students can work
24:19 - through
24:20 - um it's a lot of content but it really
24:22 - prepares them
24:24 - strongly in those foundational concepts
24:26 - there are 48 lessons total basically
24:28 - there's 16
24:29 - per course and if you were to go ahead
24:32 - and teach those together if you only
24:34 - taught them once per week would be about
24:36 - a semester and
24:37 - a half worth of content typically
24:40 - it's really rare that we will see
24:42 - students go all the way through that
24:43 - when the teachers are delivering lessons
24:45 - to them so
24:47 - there's lots of ways that you can kind
24:48 - of scaffold that for years
24:51 - year over year um the programming
24:54 - language that i mentioned is
24:55 - coffeescript and encoding adventure
24:56 - we're going to focus on
24:57 - statements loops for loops ran indexing
25:00 - and then we'll get into functions and
25:01 - boolean operators and logic
25:03 - um and then at the end we'll get into
25:05 - more of the gamification
25:07 - and kind of how how you can program that
25:10 - using
25:11 - different triggering events within the
25:12 - code itself
25:14 - um so let's go ahead and let's take a
25:16 - look at that so what you'll see here is
25:18 - we have three coding adventure courses
25:20 - and we have three skill mode courses
25:22 - here
25:23 - each of these basically even if you have
25:25 - all of the courses and
25:26 - assigned to them they will not unlock
25:28 - until they progress through the
25:29 - challenges themselves and the same exact
25:31 - thing happens for skill mode
25:33 - skill mode challenges only open up as
25:35 - they work through the course themselves
25:36 - so that's just something to keep in mind
25:38 - and i'll show you exactly what that
25:40 - looks like so here you can see i've
25:41 - already finished the course so i'm gonna
25:42 - click redo here
25:44 - um it will bring me right to the
25:45 - beginning and the storyline here for
25:47 - this one
25:47 - is that the gorilla comes to steal this
25:49 - monkey's bananas that he's collected so
25:51 - he's sad
25:52 - and then he gets mad and that becomes
25:54 - the that becomes the
25:55 - mission for the game the coding game
25:58 - okay
25:59 - so we can see some different features
26:01 - here that i'll just kind of mention we
26:02 - have the stage on the
26:04 - left hand side where everything is
26:05 - taking place we have our editor on the
26:07 - right hand side
26:08 - and then every time you hover over the
26:10 - text here
26:11 - um it will actually type out for you so
26:14 - anything that hana kind of has white
26:15 - text will type out as well as the
26:17 - buttons here at the bottom so that
26:18 - really helps for students that are
26:20 - you know not so strong in spelling um a
26:23 - lot of times our ell students i've had
26:24 - dyslexia students have everyone
26:26 - come running up to me and they're so
26:27 - excited because they can code and
26:29 - program and they don't feel like they're
26:31 - doing what they call baby coding so it's
26:32 - really
26:33 - um nice to see that as well this one is
26:35 - set up a little bit more robustly than
26:36 - the previous
26:37 - concepts or the previous courses that we
26:39 - went over here gordo is the teacher
26:41 - assistant and he pops up with directions
26:43 - but if the kids don't
26:45 - read the directions as you know happens
26:47 - all the time
26:48 - he's always hanging out over here in the
26:50 - left-hand side of the screen so you
26:51 - always have the ability to click on him
26:53 - and make sure
26:53 - that the students are you know checking
26:55 - them out and seeing what he's doing
26:58 - we can also see that this is also set up
27:00 - in a story map
27:01 - the same way as our other courses were
27:05 - what happens here in this course
27:07 - specifically is that every
27:09 - story every map in the story is a
27:12 - different coding concept building
27:13 - complexity as it goes so let me just
27:15 - show you a couple of features here and
27:16 - then i'll show you what some
27:18 - how it builds and builds as it goes
27:21 - so here we're looking at this this tells
27:24 - us that we need to turn left and turn
27:26 - right it's the first time that the
27:27 - students are really learning the
27:28 - directionality piece
27:30 - um if i just run this as is we'll see
27:33 - that there will be a tip here and this
27:35 - tip tells me to turn right instead of
27:36 - turning left so what i'm actually going
27:38 - to do
27:39 - is i am also going to pick up this ruler
27:41 - measure the distance and ensure that
27:43 - that is in fact the distance what this
27:44 - ruler will also do in later challenges
27:46 - is also do angle measurements as well
27:49 - but let's say that i
27:51 - am a new coder don't understand how to
27:53 - do this so i erase it and i'm like oh
27:55 - this must be the solution so
27:57 - oops i forgot to change this first part
27:59 - here i say turn right and i got rid of
28:02 - that now we'll see that the tip will
28:03 - simulate for where i am as far as in
28:05 - the lines of code so that also helps
28:07 - scaffold that for those students who are
28:09 - going to be online
28:10 - you're not having that face-to-face
28:12 - interaction there's some extra supports
28:14 - built in to really
28:15 - prop them up and have that confidence
28:17 - that they can move through these
28:19 - challenges
28:20 - without 9 000 questions coming to you
28:22 - through whatever learning management
28:24 - system you're having or however you're
28:25 - communicating with your students
28:27 - and then we saw that that was 12 but
28:29 - what i'm going to do here is i'm going
28:30 - to spread that out and what you'll then
28:32 - see is that i won't get the full three
28:34 - stars for the solution because i didn't
28:35 - write the shortest most concise code
28:37 - possible
28:38 - will also give me a tip along that along
28:41 - those lines letting me know how i can
28:42 - actually get more efficient code as well
28:45 - um and then here it would just igorda
28:48 - will either cheerlead sometimes he
28:49 - introduced concepts that the students
28:51 - are working on so just some different
28:52 - capabilities that gordo has there
28:54 - in himself and then the next challenge
28:57 - that we're gonna
28:58 - go ahead and look at as we just talked
28:59 - about first steps and let me just show
29:01 - you an example of skill mode what
29:02 - happens is gordo turns less into a
29:04 - teacher assistant
29:05 - and more into a coach he basically turns
29:08 - into this really cute track suit that he
29:10 - has going on
29:11 - here um and if i turn
29:14 - let's see here you guys can kind of hear
29:16 - the sounds a little bit i have the
29:17 - narration turned off this one
29:19 - does have a narration feature into it um
29:21 - there are this course specifically
29:23 - is programmed also into a lot of
29:24 - different languages so you have to have
29:26 - different types of learners that are
29:27 - in different kinds of native languages
29:29 - what's wrong with receiving the
29:30 - instructions in a different
29:32 - in their native language but the coding
29:34 - itself is always english no matter where
29:36 - you are
29:36 - um we'll see that there's a lot more
29:38 - thinking that's involved there's a lot
29:39 - more algorithmic
29:40 - thinking that's happening here and how
29:43 - do we actually solve this challenge so
29:45 - those will report back to you in the
29:46 - same way as the other challenges
29:48 - do on the teacher side of it which i'll
29:50 - show you that as well so let's go ahead
29:52 - and let's
29:52 - explore
30:01 - and i'm just going to go ahead and mute
30:02 - that so let's go ahead and let's explore
30:04 - now through the next set of
30:08 - um challenges so i went through and we
30:10 - did um there's object-oriented
30:12 - programming and
30:13 - and some different things that come
30:15 - through here but you'll see in challenge
30:16 - 47 it starts to get pretty
30:18 - um robust in nature so now we start
30:20 - working with variables here
30:22 - what we see here is we have a variable
30:24 - statement so
30:26 - it's really an additive pattern so
30:27 - there's lots more math being taken into
30:29 - place so here we can see that the first
30:31 - time the monkey moves he needs to move
30:32 - four then he moves eight
30:34 - then he moves twelve then he moves 16
30:36 - and what we have here is a variable
30:38 - which has a container and so the
30:40 - container's value is 4
30:42 - and then what we'll see here is that
30:43 - he'll step that container value
30:45 - and then step backwards of that
30:46 - container value so if we run this the
30:48 - first time
30:49 - we'll see that his value something is
30:51 - changing here and it's hard to see
30:53 - because it's only changing
30:54 - by one here but it is changing a little
30:57 - bit so what we want to see is that we
30:59 - know that the difference between
31:00 - each of these is actually four so
31:03 - what happens is that the starting
31:05 - container value is four but when it gets
31:07 - to this
31:08 - variable statement at the end then it
31:11 - will add four and the next time it will
31:13 - start at that value so the first time it
31:15 - starts at four
31:16 - then it will go to 8 then it will go to
31:18 - 12
31:19 - and then it will go into 16. so you'll
31:21 - see um the variables are just there
31:23 - just so you can kind of see how that
31:25 - increases in complexity so
31:27 - that will report back to you on that
31:29 - side and then let's go ahead and see how
31:30 - that kind of advances
31:32 - through the concepts themselves so
31:35 - um just in the interest of time i'm not
31:37 - going to completely dive into
31:39 - all of these exactly but then you start
31:41 - seeing that you now have
31:43 - variable where you're actually defining
31:46 - the variables and exactly what those
31:47 - mean
31:48 - and then it just gets a little bit more
31:50 - robust as it goes along and then by time
31:53 - they get to the end here
31:55 - they will have done full gamification
31:58 - and
31:58 - like i said triggering events that are
32:00 - happening here and so now we're
32:03 - starting to do what is an on key if i
32:05 - press a certain key what happens if i
32:06 - click on the hippo what's going to
32:08 - happen so
32:09 - it just is going to be building as it
32:11 - goes so
32:12 - like i said that foundational building
32:14 - skill that's there
32:15 - all right so now we've taken a look at
32:17 - uh coding adventure i'm going to talk
32:19 - about
32:20 - i'll talk about lesson mode i know i
32:21 - mentioned i was going to talk about it
32:22 - here but i'll talk about it when we get
32:24 - into the teacher resource side of things
32:27 - next up we have our challenge builder
32:28 - and the challenge builder actually
32:30 - supports coding adventure and why would
32:32 - you use challenge builder
32:34 - the challenge builder is a free form
32:36 - creation tool and it's really good for
32:38 - shoots for students to show mastery of
32:40 - learning as well as extra practice you
32:41 - can differentiate here
32:44 - it's one thing for students to basically
32:46 - showcase
32:47 - what they've learned by progressing
32:48 - through the course itself but it's
32:50 - another thing for them to be able to
32:52 - build and create their own challenges to
32:53 - show mastery and so down underneath our
32:55 - creativity tool
32:57 - we'll see that challenge builder is here
33:00 - and basically as the students work
33:02 - through the challenges new characters
33:03 - and objects that are introduced so those
33:05 - will be
33:07 - they'll open up as they meet those
33:10 - challenges
33:10 - and here you'll see it's a really good
33:13 - place to talk about digital citizenship
33:14 - making sure you have appropriate
33:16 - language that you're using
33:17 - and the students will build and create
33:19 - their challenge
33:20 - for them to share so if they're
33:21 - struggling with simple loops it's a
33:23 - really good place for them to go ahead
33:24 - and show mastery of that learning so
33:26 - lots of places for them to basically
33:28 - have that additional practice
33:30 - okay what we can see is the
33:31 - configuration this is the background so
33:34 - the behind the scenes that the students
33:35 - don't typically see with the x and y
33:37 - coordinates and the rotational
33:39 - things of that you can add buttons that
33:41 - the students have been introduced to
33:42 - you can change the background just a lot
33:44 - of different features here we do have a
33:46 - challenge builder guide that is lesson
33:47 - 15 and coding adventure
33:50 - but if you don't want to wait before
33:51 - then i tend to like to do it after i
33:53 - feel like students have
33:54 - come to concepts that might be a little
33:55 - bit of struggle or maybe they really
33:57 - progress through them so i like to have
33:58 - them repeat that and share it out
34:00 - they can share it with the classroom we
34:01 - also have some features for them to
34:03 - share to discover so once you have this
34:05 - basically this link will pop up let's
34:07 - just say i have this here
34:10 - step 10 and i hit share
34:16 - or i hit save and then i hit share will
34:18 - share to the classroom or
34:20 - to um or to i can just save it
34:23 - and it will show on the teacher side or
34:25 - we do have a discover feature and that
34:26 - will
34:27 - be worldwide version of that where
34:29 - anyone can
34:30 - go ahead and play those challenges they
34:33 - are heavily vetted
34:34 - so we'll talk about that as well but i
34:35 - just wanted to mention that
34:37 - all right so then next up we had our
34:40 - challenge builder so what that's for we
34:42 - also have a dota does math course that's
34:44 - just a supplemental it's also coffee
34:45 - script as well i see there's a question
34:47 - about coffeescript i'll answer that here
34:48 - in a little bit as well
34:50 - um so with the with the dota does math
34:54 - course basically it is a supplemental
34:56 - so it has three courses of which
34:59 - there are here there's distances angles
35:01 - and multiplication students need to get
35:03 - through the first
35:04 - 30 challenges of coding adventure which
35:06 - is going to be
35:08 - what we consider an hour of code and
35:10 - then once they do then they'll work
35:12 - through those coding
35:13 - concepts with math heavy concepts here
35:15 - so we'll take a look at this
35:18 - there's also loops and different things
35:19 - that they work into but
35:21 - let's just say that we
35:24 - are in a challenge that we've done
35:26 - before this is the multiplication one
35:27 - the ruler the protractor one is really
35:29 - cool they pick up a ruler they do angle
35:30 - measurements and that kind of a thing so
35:32 - here we can see
35:33 - that each of these planks are worth five
35:35 - and that we have
35:36 - four of them so how far will he'll step
35:38 - he'll step 20
35:40 - and then what he'll do is he'll get to
35:41 - the end here and pick up his eggs so the
35:44 - dodo loses his eggs on a turtle's back
35:46 - he lays them there by accident
35:48 - and then he spends the rest of the time
35:49 - collecting his eggs what's really cool
35:51 - about this is that gorda will talk about
35:52 - distributive properties different
35:54 - types of math concepts that are here and
35:56 - here you can see that he
35:58 - describes what the equation is that we
36:00 - just did
36:01 - so that's also in the copy script and
36:03 - then directly following the dota this
36:05 - map like i mentioned there's three
36:06 - courses there
36:07 - um the first 30 adventures there's also
36:12 - six
36:13 - um 45-minute lessons that are there too
36:15 - and those will take less than a semester
36:17 - if you work through them once a week um
36:20 - the game builder course is what we're
36:21 - going to talk about
36:22 - next so this is really about the game
36:25 - design
36:26 - process so it's really teaching them the
36:29 - fundamentals of game design and then
36:31 - they will then work on the creation
36:33 - piece of it so there's three here
36:35 - there's a platformer course which is a
36:36 - super mario style of course
36:38 - then there's frogger traditional frogger
36:41 - game and then an
36:42 - animation course where they work on how
36:43 - to create animations within the game
36:45 - itself
36:46 - and like i said it's really designed to
36:48 - do the game mechanics
36:49 - game mechanics so let's look at the
36:51 - platformer course itself
36:53 - what you'll see here is there's also
36:54 - bonus tasks that are inside of here but
36:56 - what we'll see here is that this is now
36:58 - event driven programming so when i push
37:00 - a key
37:01 - something's going to happen and i make
37:03 - sure that
37:04 - there's different sprites that are here
37:06 - different characters we'll see
37:07 - on the right hand side is the stage and
37:09 - game where it's happening all the
37:10 - objects that we can insert into the game
37:12 - are right over here
37:13 - all of these buttons down here will also
37:14 - type out for students and why we suggest
37:17 - this for the older students it's very
37:18 - text heavy there's lots of reading
37:19 - that's involved
37:21 - and really a lot of the students
37:22 - struggle because they don't do the
37:24 - reading that's involved and they think
37:25 - that they just see this code example and
37:26 - then that's the
37:27 - the trick for them here um but it is
37:30 - very fun and they really do enjoy the
37:32 - game design process but they do need to
37:34 - have
37:35 - a little bit of skill set on the back
37:37 - end to be able to do that so by the time
37:39 - they get to the end here they'll have
37:40 - worked with
37:43 - different different components of game
37:46 - of the game
37:48 - that they have itself so they'll work
37:50 - with a
37:51 - excuse me here
37:55 - they will work with a chocolate bar
37:58 - you'll see that there is a tiger that
38:00 - will go back and forth there's a power
38:01 - up button that they interact with they
38:03 - have a timer
38:04 - widget there's also sounds that are here
38:06 - and then you can change the background
38:08 - of the game
38:08 - itself as well so there's some different
38:10 - capabilities that are within the course
38:12 - themselves i really suggest that they
38:14 - have at least some basis of
38:15 - at least finishing coding adventure
38:17 - before they start the game design
38:19 - because it can be quite challenging
38:20 - without having the concepts of what a
38:22 - for loop is or
38:24 - just different components there i'm not
38:26 - saying that's not doable that's just
38:27 - what we suggest
38:30 - or what i suggest based on my own
38:32 - experience um so like i mentioned
38:34 - there's the three games of the
38:35 - platformer
38:36 - um and now we'll move into our python
38:38 - course which is our banana tales course
38:40 - so the banana tales course
38:41 - is really for grades five through eight
38:44 - um because it is syntax it does have you
38:46 - know the curly brackets and
38:47 - things like that we do suggest it for
38:49 - the older grades um
38:51 - it just helps them have a stronger
38:52 - foundation like i mentioned there are 23
38:54 - 45-minute long lessons that go with that
38:56 - um it's in python and they work on lists
38:59 - and index and for loops if and else
39:01 - while if and else while loops
39:04 - boolean operators functions and then
39:07 - they work into like scopes and lists and
39:09 - bubble sorts and
39:10 - lots of concepts as far as that goes so
39:13 - let's take a look
39:14 - at what that course looks like itself
39:16 - it's going to have the same thing the
39:17 - storyline here is that these two
39:19 - there are twin baby monkeys okay these
39:21 - are chosen by
39:22 - kiddos here these monkeys they get
39:25 - separated and they have to work through
39:26 - the course basic
39:27 - the students have to work through the
39:28 - course to connect them um this
39:31 - baby monkey here is unable to feed
39:33 - himself so
39:34 - he needs us to feed him so this remote
39:36 - control car sometimes it's in a boat
39:39 - this object needs to get to our monkey
39:41 - itself to feed him or else he gets upset
39:43 - something that's really great about this
39:46 - game that i love is that you can see
39:48 - the coordinates that are here when you
39:50 - click on the level you can see exactly
39:52 - where the object is located so we can
39:53 - see exactly where the giraffe is located
39:55 - itself um and it's just nice to kind of
39:59 - have those components there
40:00 - there's also built-in reference cards
40:02 - i'll mention where to access those for
40:04 - the other courses as well but there are
40:05 - built-in reference cards so the first
40:07 - time they talk about height is in
40:08 - challenge two
40:09 - and those cards will open up as they
40:11 - progress through the game
40:12 - itself um so here we have the giraffe
40:15 - height so i drag another giraffe
40:17 - out and what i need to do is i need the
40:19 - neck of the giraffe to stretch
40:21 - and when he stretches and i click on the
40:23 - car and now the baby monkey can be fed
40:25 - and he
40:26 - is a happy camper
40:32 - and then as we progress through here
40:34 - let's just take a look
40:37 - and the same scoring system is happening
40:38 - throughout all the courses like i
40:40 - mentioned
40:40 - except for the game builder it's more of
40:42 - a pass fail with the stars for
40:44 - extra scoring um here we can see there's
40:46 - also the snake so the snake needs to
40:49 - do we need the snake what do we need to
40:51 - have happen we can see we need to add
40:52 - snake we need the
40:54 - giraffe's heads to shrink so this so the
40:56 - snakes heads can stretch out so we can
40:58 - actually get to the monkey himself and
41:00 - we'll see it working through on the
41:01 - left-hand side what's really nice is
41:02 - there's hints here
41:04 - and then when they work through some of
41:05 - the harder concepts you can see it
41:07 - working in the console itself which is
41:08 - also really great looks more so like a
41:10 - gamified
41:11 - um computer programmer would use and
41:14 - like i said it does build in complexity
41:16 - as it goes and they move through the
41:18 - story map and we can see where they're
41:19 - going to be approaching the different
41:21 - concepts that are here
41:22 - um and then by time they get to the end
41:24 - of this course they'll have worked with
41:26 - slicing and so that's just
41:28 - if you are a programmer yourself you'll
41:29 - kind of know that if you're not there's
41:30 - some really great notes for the python
41:32 - course itself
41:33 - that will really help support that so um
41:36 - you can just see how the levels are
41:38 - building in complexity as it goes
41:40 - um okay i'm just going to quick brief
41:43 - touch on these other two courses and
41:45 - then if you guys have follow-up
41:46 - questions we'll be happy to answer those
41:47 - just so i can get into the teacher
41:49 - resources
41:50 - um directly following that we recommend
41:52 - this coding chatbot
41:53 - course they work through the python
41:55 - concepts to build an interactive chat
41:57 - bot that plays
41:58 - a game of snowman formerly hangman
42:01 - it's not appropriate so we now call it
42:03 - snowman um so they're playing
42:06 - that type of a game with him and so
42:09 - they'll go through the process it's very
42:10 - similarly set up to the game design
42:12 - course itself where they're working
42:14 - through the challenges and as they
42:15 - progress the challenges are opening up
42:17 - and they're going to be able to interact
42:19 - and chat over here on the side by time
42:21 - they get to challenge 74
42:23 - you'll see because i'm on the teacher
42:24 - side of things you'll see that the
42:26 - they have worked through a lot of code
42:29 - to be able to create this chat bot
42:30 - itself so
42:31 - it is pretty complex and we do suggest
42:33 - it for the older grade levels just based
42:35 - on
42:36 - the experience level that they have
42:39 - um we do have some other courses that i
42:41 - forgot to mention the game builder has
42:42 - its own game builder platform
42:44 - similar to the challenge builder itself
42:46 - um and then there's just
42:47 - uh the other only other one that i
42:50 - missed here
42:51 - was the moonlander course and that's
42:53 - just going to be a
42:54 - similar to the game design one but with
42:57 - landing on the moon and physics and
42:59 - thrust and they work through some of
43:00 - those different concepts
43:03 - all right so that was a lot on that side
43:05 - of things and i'll be sure to leave some
43:07 - time for questions i just really want to
43:09 - honor your time as well so now let's
43:10 - talk about our teacher resources and how
43:12 - we can support you on the back end i've
43:14 - seen a lot of questions about experience
43:16 - level and some different things like
43:17 - that so i want to make sure that we're
43:18 - supporting you in that way as well
43:20 - so that was the tour of the courses and
43:22 - now let's talk about the teacher
43:23 - resources and how that will help you
43:25 - support i see a lot of people being like
43:28 - what if i what do i do if i'm not a
43:29 - coding teacher or i don't have a strong
43:31 - background let me show you what we can
43:33 - do to help support you so here i am in
43:35 - the mat
43:35 - and the classrooms page um we'll get
43:38 - into this side of
43:39 - their of things but on the left-hand
43:40 - side we have the teacher resources and
43:42 - in the teacher resources
43:44 - here is where you have everything that
43:45 - you're going to need so
43:47 - all of our fully guided lesson plans are
43:49 - located here
43:50 - our webinars from past webinars that
43:52 - we've had you can also visit our youtube
43:54 - channel for
43:55 - more of our webinars that we've done
43:57 - from years past like a few years ago as
43:59 - well
44:00 - i highly recommend this teaching with
44:02 - coding adventure course
44:03 - what it does is walk you through the
44:05 - first
44:07 - concepts that are in the first part of
44:08 - coding adventure all the way up to for
44:10 - loops it's me
44:11 - so you guys are welcome um and basically
44:14 - what we do is we work through what
44:15 - exactly is a for loop
44:17 - what does it mean what does it look like
44:19 - in these challenges so you have a firmer
44:20 - concept
44:22 - of understanding that you can you know
44:25 - that you can kind of grasp together so
44:27 - you can have a little bit more
44:28 - background knowledge when you're
44:30 - um
44:34 - when you're kind of working through that
44:35 - so i highly recommend it i think that
44:38 - it really gives you a strong skill point
44:40 - or you know skill set when i first
44:42 - started learning how to code myself i
44:43 - was able to work through it but i wasn't
44:45 - able to explain some of the concepts so
44:47 - i actually completed
44:48 - the original course that we had and then
44:50 - i was like oh okay i understand what
44:52 - these concepts are so if i can do it you
44:53 - can do it
44:54 - um so that's what that looks like let's
44:57 - take a look at one of the lesson plans
44:58 - just you kind of have an idea they are
45:00 - set up in a slide deck format
45:02 - um each of them has you know the
45:05 - what the lesson is going to be about
45:08 - they all have objectives in them and
45:09 - then they are
45:10 - all standards aligned and we will talk
45:12 - about the concepts that you're
45:13 - covering here um each of the lessons are
45:16 - set up in exactly the same way
45:17 - there's an intro which is an unplugged
45:19 - activity which you can do
45:21 - via remote instruction um so
45:24 - a lot of times people think you have to
45:25 - be directly like really unplugged but
45:27 - you can show
45:27 - an object on the screen and have the
45:29 - students write it out in a jam board or
45:31 - some
45:31 - you know maybe in a padlet or something
45:33 - like that to have them write out the
45:35 - instructions of how to solve a challenge
45:36 - or you can pop a challenge up there take
45:38 - a screenshot
45:39 - throw it up there and kind of you know
45:41 - work through that together
45:42 - in that way um and then the second part
45:44 - is going to be the play time where the
45:46 - students are actually playing the course
45:47 - itself and then the last part is going
45:49 - to be the debrief
45:51 - where they're actually going to be
45:53 - working through
45:54 - you know reflectionary questions what
45:56 - happens if you get stuck what did you
45:57 - notice about that and they'll work
45:59 - through those concepts
46:00 - as they go and that's like that same
46:02 - format for all of them
46:03 - except for on the beaver achiever course
46:06 - it does
46:06 - give you more so just a different it's
46:08 - just a little bit different of a format
46:10 - there
46:11 - we do have i do want to mention this
46:14 - only because
46:15 - it's it's important so we do have lesson
46:17 - plans for the banana tales
46:19 - and then we also have um
46:23 - these classroom slides so these are ones
46:25 - that you
46:26 - these lessons are basically um already
46:29 - created for you to share with your
46:30 - students like what do you do how do you
46:32 - write the code so there's a little bit
46:33 - more
46:34 - support on that so there's like the
46:36 - classroom notes that walk you through
46:37 - what everything means which i tend to
46:39 - rely upon
46:40 - quite a bit um so you can use these
46:43 - notes here or you can use the slide deck
46:45 - itself so just some extra features to
46:47 - kind of
46:48 - you know have in your back pocket um we
46:51 - do have this how-to guide these are just
46:53 - guides basically
46:54 - um for how to add students archive a
46:56 - class getting started
46:58 - um hour of code nodes and then classroom
46:59 - resources these are certificates here we
47:01 - have our media kit which is access to
47:03 - all of our images like course images and
47:05 - things like that that's
47:06 - cute like fun graphics and then we have
47:08 - our posters here these are just visual
47:10 - posters and we do have coloring sheets
47:12 - if you want as well um something new
47:14 - that we just added if you
47:16 - did my other webinar you already know
47:17 - this but um you can now
47:20 - access all of the solutions here and the
47:22 - teacher resources you don't actually
47:23 - have to go to the progress page itself
47:25 - all of the courses are here the skill
47:27 - mode challenges
47:28 - hour of code code monkey junior all of
47:30 - the courses themselves are exactly
47:32 - located here
47:33 - so i did mention that i would talk about
47:35 - the code monkey junior course
47:36 - so here is what it would look like and
47:38 - you basically pick up
47:40 - these um arrows and you would run
47:42 - through those courses so there's
47:44 - sequencing
47:44 - advanced sequencing loops and advanced
47:46 - loops and it's really cute and fun and
47:48 - the kids really enjoy that so just
47:50 - wanted to briefly touch that
47:52 - just in the interest so i can leave time
47:53 - for q a for you guys
47:56 - okay moving on now we're going to talk
47:58 - about
47:59 - um the lesson mode feature and then
48:02 - we're also going to talk about
48:04 - oh no we're also going to talk about um
48:09 - the sorry guys we're also going to talk
48:13 - about
48:13 - the um let me
48:17 - pull this up i actually got rid of my
48:19 - slide deck there so i'm just pulling
48:21 - this back up for you guys
48:22 - um we'll talk about the lesson mode
48:24 - which is something that i mentioned that
48:25 - we would talk about
48:28 - okay so we are
48:33 - on our classrooms page here
48:36 - and i will go into any of the classrooms
48:37 - that i created um we are integrated with
48:39 - google classroom in both clever if you
48:41 - want to import
48:42 - your if you want to import your classes
48:46 - there is the ability to do that with
48:48 - some really great help articles on that
48:49 - as well
48:50 - um let me just go to another classroom
48:54 - here oops excuse me so we'll go
48:57 - into this wow
49:01 - i'm on the struggle bus here you can see
49:03 - um
49:04 - so i'll go into my classroom that i've
49:06 - created here and
49:07 - what we'll see is right away it will pop
49:10 - us out at the progress page i personally
49:12 - find this to be the holy grail of
49:13 - everything that
49:14 - that we have on our pages because it
49:17 - contains everything every single star
49:19 - contains a student's solution and you
49:21 - can see it in real time if you click on
49:23 - it so we'll show you exactly how they
49:24 - solved it
49:25 - you can sort by student progress so
49:27 - you're able to see you know
49:28 - do a quick data dive and to see exactly
49:31 - how far students
49:32 - the students got where you see a lot of
49:34 - blue stars where you
49:35 - see a lot of red stars when you click on
49:39 - any of the stars any one of the stars
49:41 - you can see how many times the student
49:43 - attempted the challenge and if you pull
49:44 - it up you can pull
49:45 - you can see exactly how they solved it
49:47 - it's actually anonymous too which makes
49:49 - for really great
49:50 - instruction especially in a remote
49:51 - environment you guys can share that
49:53 - you know with your students on the
49:54 - screen and you can work through it
49:56 - together
49:57 - you can also limit the progress so you
49:58 - lock them down so they're not working
50:00 - too far
50:00 - in ahead which is why you see this part
50:02 - grayed out if i do free play it opens
50:04 - completely
50:05 - up we can also turn off the super hints
50:08 - so gordo i didn't show you that but
50:10 - gordo does have
50:11 - super hints that he has and he has an
50:14 - extra light bulb that pops up and that
50:15 - will guide the students more and never
50:17 - gives the answer but it will guide them
50:19 - you can also export all this data to a
50:21 - csv file and why i mention that is it
50:23 - will tell you exactly the times that the
50:25 - students logged
50:26 - in sometimes that's important i know i
50:28 - know in the spring when
50:30 - code first happened teachers were really
50:32 - trying to figure out how to take
50:33 - attendance and so they were using this
50:34 - data file to be able to do that
50:37 - and then up here in green are all the
50:38 - solutions that you saw on the
50:40 - teacher resource page but now they're
50:42 - also here for you on this page and it is
50:44 - reporting back to you in real time so
50:45 - that's pretty important
50:49 - now the lesson mode feature here this is
50:51 - only available for our coding adventure
50:53 - course it is set up exactly like our
50:55 - lessons and what happens is when you
50:56 - begin the lesson itself the student
50:58 - screens lock and they don't have access
51:00 - to the courses themselves
51:01 - there are reference cards and character
51:03 - review cards the character review card
51:05 - is very important for
51:08 - when you're doing the challenge builder
51:09 - so you can know exactly when those when
51:11 - those characters are introduced so we
51:13 - can see here in challenge 13 is when we
51:15 - meet our turtle and when we do
51:16 - object tag or object-oriented
51:18 - programming
51:20 - so the turtle will open up for use then
51:22 - then the beaver will open up in
51:23 - challenge 55 so it's just kind of
51:25 - good to know but it's also good for the
51:26 - students to understand how do i actually
51:28 - program and move these characters
51:30 - especially later on when they are
51:31 - working through
51:32 - through that itself and what's also
51:34 - really nice is that you have access to
51:36 - the challenges that are in the specific
51:37 - lesson right there
51:39 - you're not going to have to hunt and
51:40 - navigate multiple screens and then when
51:42 - you're ready you can assign those
51:43 - challenges and sometimes in the debrief
51:44 - like you can see here there's some
51:46 - challenges that you'll work through
51:48 - so just different components are located
51:50 - all right here for you and there is this
51:52 - short tutorial which um
51:54 - my team will pop here in the chat for
51:57 - you so you guys can see
51:58 - exactly how to do those lessons
52:00 - themselves
52:02 - on the student tab i'm not really going
52:03 - to mention months about the student tab
52:05 - not really much to do here except for
52:07 - there is a direct login url if you're
52:10 - in person you can do login cards but
52:12 - here is where you will add your
52:13 - co-teachers to your account so you can
52:15 - share
52:15 - the classroom and then
52:19 - just super quick you can assign courses
52:21 - here and then the gradebook
52:23 - is automatically graded the students as
52:25 - they're working through the challenges
52:26 - they do have a specific point value
52:28 - and then they'll be populated here
52:30 - what's nice about this is that at the
52:32 - bottom of the page the more students
52:33 - that struggle with the challenge the
52:35 - larger the circle is so that's just
52:36 - something to keep in mind
52:37 - and also makes for those great mini
52:39 - lessons for you to teach on
52:41 - without having to hunt through the
52:42 - progress page if you don't want as well
52:45 - you can also export this as a csv which
52:47 - is really nice
52:47 - as well um i know that's what i used to
52:50 - do exported csv and upload it into my
52:51 - gradebook so
52:52 - um you have that capability as well and
52:54 - then when we talked about the games and
52:55 - challenges earlier when the students
52:57 - publish them to the classrooms this is
52:59 - where they will be showcased for you
53:00 - yours are in the my creations but the
53:03 - students are
53:04 - here for you you can search by student
53:06 - you can also disable the discover
53:07 - feature
53:08 - just keep in mind with the discover that
53:12 - it is heavily vetted and it makes a copy
53:15 - of their
53:16 - of their gamer challenge so that they
53:18 - can't go back and edit it and try to be
53:20 - sneaky like they try to do
53:22 - so those are just some different things
53:23 - to keep in mind there
53:26 - okay so a lot of information and i see a
53:28 - lot of questions so we're gonna kind of
53:30 - go through that
53:32 - um so we talked about how to track
53:34 - student progress oh there was one thing
53:36 - that i wanted to mention our newest
53:37 - feature here
53:38 - under the grade book is we now have this
53:41 - um it's
53:42 - called a proficiency table and so in the
53:44 - proficiency it will show you the
53:45 - concepts
53:46 - that are without all throughout all of
53:48 - the coding adventure i mean throughout
53:49 - all of the code monkey platform
53:51 - and it will tell you exactly how the
53:53 - students did so we have a novice
53:55 - beginner intermediate and advanced it'll
53:57 - tell you how
53:58 - how proficient basically they are in
54:01 - those concepts just remember that these
54:02 - are concepts that are throughout all of
54:04 - the course like sort you only see
54:06 - obviously in banana tails so but you'll
54:08 - see sequencing in all the courses you'll
54:09 - see
54:10 - simple loops in all of the courses so
54:12 - just some different things that you'll
54:13 - see and it's just kind of nice to have
54:14 - something extra
54:17 - in your back pocket
54:21 - alrighty so now we've talked about
54:23 - tracking student progress we talked
54:24 - about the classroom dashboard
54:27 - and now we've went through the tour de
54:29 - courses
54:33 - and um
54:36 - we're going to leave some time for some
54:38 - q a but before we do the q a portion i
54:40 - see there's a lot of things
54:41 - that i'll go back here and answer for
54:43 - you um so i did
54:44 - want to talk about that we do have the
54:46 - code monkey webinar page my team is
54:48 - going to put that there in the chat box
54:49 - for you
54:50 - um so the webinars are located there as
54:52 - i mentioned it's also located on our
54:54 - youtube
54:54 - channel where you can see all of the
54:56 - past recordings that we've done and
54:57 - anything that's upcoming will be on the
54:59 - webinar page itself we do have some
55:01 - student guided lessons that we've done
55:03 - um during the covid period where we took
55:05 - over your classrooms and kind of taught
55:07 - some of the students so if you're
55:08 - looking for some examples i would
55:09 - suggest looking there as well
55:11 - i talked about the proficiency table the
55:13 - gradebook
55:15 - and then just one last thing that i did
55:16 - want to mention that will also
55:18 - be great for you is in the courses pic
55:20 - sorry into my classrooms page
55:24 - there is a place where you can generate
55:26 - a usage report so
55:27 - if you're the account admin or you just
55:29 - want to see your classrooms you'll
55:30 - basically pull this
55:32 - up here and it will show you exactly how
55:35 - often the kids are kids are using the
55:37 - program in each
55:38 - class so that's also something to just
55:40 - kind of keep in mind
55:42 - all right now i know we're pushing time
55:44 - here so i just want to make sure that i
55:46 - cover that now we're going to leave time
55:48 - for q a i am going to answer these
55:50 - questions that are here
55:51 - and then i'm also going to answer those
55:53 - there so if you
55:54 - are running short on time just know that
55:56 - we're just doing q a right now so
55:58 - um how would i use a tool like this to
56:00 - create lessons for three different
56:02 - grades so what you would do is you would
56:04 - create three your classrooms and then
56:05 - you would assign the specific courses to
56:07 - them
56:08 - i would suggest using like a learning
56:09 - management system like either google
56:12 - or canvas or something like that to
56:14 - create the lessons and i
56:15 - basically would just do let's say
56:18 - have them you're working on the coding
56:20 - adventure course you have them work
56:21 - through
56:23 - challenge 20 create a challenge build
56:26 - their own challenge in the challenge
56:28 - builder they share that with you
56:30 - and then you're able to see their
56:31 - progress in both places
56:34 - best best practices for hybrid or online
56:37 - learning
56:38 - using code monkey lessons i would say
56:40 - using those super hints
56:42 - doing some lessons whole group together
56:44 - i know that that sounds like oh
56:46 - i don't want to do that but really
56:47 - solving some challenges together using a
56:49 - jam board or a padlet or some other
56:50 - resource there
56:51 - to kind of work through that together is
56:53 - what i would suggest
56:54 - um can you add code monkey grades to the
56:57 - classroom what i didn't mention is that
56:59 - you can actually
57:00 - in the code monkey lessons itself you
57:02 - can actually assign
57:03 - the lessons to your google classroom and
57:06 - those grades will also report to your
57:08 - google classroom if i'm correct i
57:09 - believe i am
57:10 - um it will also report back there too
57:13 - and then
57:14 - how to teach a remotely while live
57:16 - integrating stem areas including
57:18 - technology into grades k through five
57:20 - like i mentioned i would do a lot of
57:21 - those unplugged activities using a
57:23 - jamboard
57:24 - or something like that and i would also
57:26 - try to you know
57:27 - maybe use a code monkey like challenge
57:30 - number seven in coding adventure has the
57:31 - first time that they're using
57:33 - um the ruler as an angle measurement or
57:35 - using the dota does math courses are
57:36 - really going to be good for those
57:38 - integration areas we have the moon
57:40 - lander for the older grades
57:41 - um that's really science driven
57:43 - personally i would create stories with
57:46 - the coding adventure
57:47 - challenge builders that's what i would
57:49 - do for those so
57:51 - i would use the challenge builder and
57:52 - have them use the save feature which
57:54 - they learn in like
57:55 - challenge challenge fit in around in the
57:58 - 50s and they would say something and
58:00 - they would use a story so i would
58:02 - make a math story personally with my
58:03 - challenge builder so there's lots of
58:05 - ways and abilities to do that
58:07 - um that you can kind of
58:10 - do that you can kind of progress okay so
58:12 - is it possible to see students answers
58:14 - even if the wrong attempts have been
58:16 - made
58:16 - um so that is true you can when you go
58:19 - into that progress page you can click on
58:21 - it it will show you exactly how the
58:22 - students solved it
58:23 - if they got the answer incorrect it will
58:26 - have a circle with like an exclamation
58:28 - point just means they failed the
58:29 - challenge
58:30 - typically that doesn't usually happen
58:31 - but excuse me
58:34 - you will be able to see that every time
58:36 - a student works through a challenge it's
58:37 - being held there in the progress page
58:41 - so thank you for that question um do i
58:44 - need to have a different lms or the code
58:46 - monkey as a self-sufficient platform i
58:48 - think that depends on you
58:49 - i personally would do an lms in addition
58:52 - to that i think that you can obviously
58:53 - do everything in the code monkey
58:54 - platform
58:55 - the only thing that you're not able to
58:57 - do is to do that communication so if
58:59 - you're doing the communication in google
59:00 - me
59:01 - or in zoom then i think you're fine i
59:04 - think just sometimes this
59:05 - the students you can also post
59:06 - discussion questions like post a
59:08 - challenge or an unplugged activity
59:10 - have them solve it maybe they do their
59:12 - own unplugged activity with like a tick
59:14 - tock video or something just some way
59:15 - for them to have some submission there's
59:17 - no place for you to do any kind of
59:18 - submission or assigning
59:20 - assignments really except for in the
59:22 - challenge except for in the lesson mode
59:23 - but that's only
59:24 - um during that short period of time so
59:26 - great question
59:29 - okay so i think um
59:32 - molly or brett do you guys want to pop
59:34 - on with any um
59:36 - questions that you guys that i might
59:38 - have missed here
59:42 - i think you've answered all of the
59:43 - questions the only thing to clarify
59:46 - is the integration with google classroom
59:49 - we unfortunately do not have the
59:50 - capabilities to do a great
59:52 - pass back from code monkey to google
59:55 - classroom but you can
59:56 - export your grades to a csv file and
59:59 - then use that file
60:01 - if you need to manipulate it somehow to
60:02 - get it back to google classroom
60:08 - okay great
60:14 - do you guys have does anyone else have
60:15 - any questions that we can help answer
60:19 - um i see there is a lot of good
60:20 - conversation happening here on the side
60:23 - okay well if you guys do have any
60:25 - questions that kind of um
60:26 - pop up here i do see a few questions
60:28 - here
60:30 - um
60:36 - there is a question here about emailing
60:37 - we will follow up with you
60:39 - um regarding
60:47 - um regarding the your question about
60:50 - your quote requests and things like that
60:52 - so we do have a couple of
60:53 - um questions that are um that will
60:56 - follow up with you
60:57 - that we've mentioned beforehand
61:01 - so um i apologize i see that everyone
61:03 - should
61:04 - hopefully be able to see each other's
61:05 - comments my my apologies
61:08 - roberto will follow up with you
61:09 - following um today's webinar
61:12 - we really really really want to thank
61:14 - you guys so much for everything that you
61:15 - do every single day we know that you
61:17 - guys are working harder than probably
61:19 - um we have all in years right um with
61:22 - transitioning to
61:23 - the way that the classrooms are running
61:24 - and online and such the uncertainty
61:27 - that we have um in front of us
61:30 - i know that we didn't throw this into
61:33 - the
61:33 - chat box but i did want to mention this
61:36 - just really briefly i think it's an
61:37 - important
61:38 - concept in the help center here there is
61:40 - some explanations
61:42 - on the coding adventure courses so if
61:44 - you type in coding adventure
61:45 - um you're able to see some of the
61:47 - concepts that are covered so if you're
61:48 - struggling on some of the concepts that
61:50 - are there or the terminology
61:52 - it's all located here in the help page
61:53 - so i would definitely recommend checking
61:55 - that out as well
61:57 - but like i mentioned we want to thank
61:58 - you so much for all of your questions
62:00 - your active engagement during this time
62:03 - we really enjoyed spending the afternoon
62:05 - with you and remember to follow us on
62:07 - all of our social platforms where you
62:10 - can get you know lots of update
62:11 - information and about our blogs
62:14 - um just remember that we're here for any
62:18 - questions that you have we really want
62:19 - to
62:20 - ensure that you have the best teaching
62:21 - experience possible by using code monkey
62:24 - and from our team to yours we want to
62:26 - thank you for all that you do today
62:28 - tomorrow and all the days in between to
62:30 - get your students future ready
62:32 - and remember to write code catch bananas
62:34 - and save the world
62:35 - until next time bye

Cleaned transcript:

so welcome all of you teachers and code monkey users to the second webinar of our back to school season how to set up and manage your classrooms the code monkey team wants to personally thank you for joining us for our webinar today and we know that your time obviously has been just turned upside down with everything that you're facing and how everything in education has been shaken up so our goal today is to make sure that you're getting what you need out of today's webinar to help better prepare you to teach code monkey with your students so if you have any questions um please feel free to ask them that's why we have a team um with us to kind of help guide you through that process um so be sure to follow us on all of our social media platforms we are on facebook instagram youtube um

immediately following today's webinar um okay great so um following today's webinar we will also have a survey that will pop up and then that survey will be um your professional development certificate that will be a mailed immediately to you afterwards so let's go ahead get ready to write code catch bananas and save the world so today is going to be the tour of course's webinar so we are going to focus on the tour of courses but before we get started we always like to introduce the team that is here and um so you can get familiar with who you'll be alongside this afternoon um so

with a poll just kind of seeing who you are and just kind of getting a feel for our audience for today so i'm going to go ahead and launch this poll and i'm going to give you just a few minutes to go ahead and take that and then we will go ahead and get started with our webinar all righty we'll get you just a couple more minutes here or just a couple more seconds i guess you would say to go ahead and complete this quiz here just to kind of get a feel for our audience for this afternoon uh katrina if you're having trouble um submitting for the poll you can feel free to either add that here in the chat box or um sometimes it's just a connect connection issue with zoom okay great looks like majority of you have had the chance to vote it sounds like some of you are having a little bit of issues with that which is totally fine but i'm just going to go ahead and share these i'm going to end the result or in the poll here and then i'm going to share the results with you just so you guys can kind of see so most of the people um just checking to see how you feel so far with code monkey and most of you are kind of somewhat in the middle which is great with majority of you needing a little bit of help so that's exactly what today's webinar is here for what is your role in the organization it seems like it's pretty tied up between most of the positions here so elementary middle school library and then some of you in the other category so probably technology teacher or something around that landscape how comfortable do you feel with coding it seems most of you are either in the middle or you are a novice so um so just wanted to share that too so so of course feel free to ask those questions and we'll give you some resources here at the end to just support you the best that we can all right great so now we're going to go ahead and get started and so we always like to start off with just talking about what code monkey is who are we and kind of what is our vision for the future so code monkey is a leading coding program for students to engage them in online courses to learn how to code it is made with schools and teachers in mind and then we are standards align and it is a coding curriculum for k through eight so we will go through that today and the best part about it is that there's no experience needed to teach our program um so code monkey does envision a global global i'm sorry excuse me global playful learning experience where the next generation of coders are born and raised we do have about 10 million users worldwide so we do have users you know all across the globe and hopefully some of you are joining us from around the world as well we aim part of our vision is that we aim to create a engaging platform where you're learning along learning knowledge alongside 21st century skills through collaboratively playing solving puzzles excuse me inventing creating and sharing um so today's webinar objectives are going to be that we're going to tour the courses we are going to showcase a few challenges from each and every single course to give you kind of a rundown and give you a little bit of chance to kind of explore what the platform looks like and have any questions along the way um then we'll tour the teacher resources and then we'll review limiting student progress and then we'll go ahead and have some time for some q a we also took some of the q a from your registration questions and we'll be sure to answer that um and we will answer some of your questions like i said along the way so keep an eye out in the chat box for some of the links and different things that we'll share for you for you as we get started so how does code monkey kind of work and what kind of courses do we offer so we are like i mentioned a coding curriculum for grades k through eight however we do have a lot of high school programs using code monkey for their intro to programming we like to think about language if i were to start learning a language today and you were to start learning the language today we would start both at the same place so sometimes that's exactly what how we like to think about coding throughout how we offer for our students so beginning at the beginning we will dive deeper into each of these courses but we have our code monkey junior course which is a block based course really about computational thinking and directionality then we have our beaver achiever course there are three courses within this one and they work through sequencing conditional statements and then if and else statements at the end so um that's the focus of that one then we have our coding adventure course and that's where we start coffeescript right away so coffeescript dota does math and game builder courses are all in coffeescript and coffeescript is a shorter version of javascript and python we found that working with students that the syntax sometimes would tie them up we know that it's really tricky for students to add a period or you know a question mark even where it needs to be so having syntax at an early age can be really troublesome for students to really get the foundations that they need for programming um and then we'll get into our banana tales which is our python course with geared for our upper elementary and middle school students and then we have our coding chatbot course which we'll briefly look out here as we get moving through so first let's start out with our code monkey junior course and let's take a look at exactly what that looks like so code monkey junior is geared for our prek k we call it for a prereaders course there are 30 challenges that we have and they are divided into four chapters so there's basically four concepts that they're working on there each of the lessons within that are each 35 minutes and it takes about three months to complete if you are doing those lessons only once per week and it is a blockbased program and they focus on logic loops sequencing algorithms counting and directionality like i had mentioned before so let's go ahead and let's take a look at what that actually looks like in the program itself so here i'm already logged in as you can see to the code monkey platform what i'm going to do is i'm in my classrooms dashboard page right here but i want to go to the courses so i'll click on the courses and the code monkey junior course is going to be located here sort of in the middle of the page here you'll see this little cute monkey holding the bananas with the treasure box um so if you were just beginning coding it would say beginning coding but here it said to continue coding because i've already began the process code monkey junior is the only program that we do have that's available on an app so the students will sign in and we'll save their progress and they'll report back to you which will see that feature as well so as that is um as the students are working through through this um it's just a really good course to talk about computational thinking so i am just going to do a little something here and i see that my i've been having computer type issues all day today so we'll go ahead and um we'll come back to this code monkey junior course here in just a minute i'm just gonna let that kind of load as we go through so we'll take a look at that i'll make sure i follow back with that at the end here um so then next we have our beaver achiever course and our beaver achiever course is for grades one through three beaver achiever has 55 challenges and that is divided into three courses like i have mentioned there are 11 35minute lesson plans and if you go ahead and work through those it'll take about three months to complete if you were only teaching it once per week obviously there's a lot more opportunities to kind of expand upon that and you know take a little bit more time to deep dive into those concepts that are presented so the first concept the first course that i mentioned is sequencing loops and we do a little bit of repeat loops then we do conditionals and until loops and then we work into if and else conditions so let's take a look at what that looks like in the beaver achiever course since our code monkey junior purse doesn't seem to be loading here for me right now the joys of technology right always i gotta have something um so our beaver achiever course i'll start off here at the very beginning all the code monkey courses are set up in a similar manner they are fully gamified and it means that the students are able to work through in a linear manner so they can't skip around learn something before they're ready the goal is really to reinforce the coding concepts which are being presented we really want the students to build that strong foundation so that when they are ready to become those true web developers um that they have the the skill set really needed to move to that next step and a lot of times you know there's a lot of gaps when you work through the coding programs that way so here is our beaver he's one of my favorite characters throughout the coding adventure i mean throughout the code monkey platform he is super cute what you can see here is that every single one of our stories for the exception of coding chat bots and the exception of our game builder courses will have a story line so the storyline here at the very beginning is that the beaver here is um wants to go swimming so he needs to build a dam so we can see that each one of these rows mean one and then at the very beginning it's just kind of dragging and dropping so what's really nice is that there's pictures here also to support that for your for your students that might be struggling readers and then what you'll do is you'll hit the green button here and hit play if i were doing a lesson with students i would let them guide me through the process and see what we need to do here and how we can make this beaver fill up his dam you'll see those really fun little animations that are associated with that and then we'll see that we get a star scoring solution so a three star solution is our shortest most concise code a two star means that there was an extra step and a one star i always like to say are the struggle bussers um and that just means that they took probably didn't really understand the concept that was presented to them and then they um probably need a little bit of guidance and help from you so those will all report on the teacher side so we'll dive into that piece but right now i just want to dive into what the courses look like themselves so what you can see is we have a story map up here on the upper right hand corner and as the students progress through the challenges as teachers you can manipulate this you can move around but as students they have to move linearly through the concept that ensures that they're not skipping around and learning something before they're ready but they're building the foundation which is what we want to have you can't build a house without a strong foundation right so then we will go ahead and look at another one of these challenges here let's go ahead to challenge number 18. so i'm just going to show you what it kind of looks like as they progress you'll see that now we start to see a lot more pattern recognition a lot more computational thinking how do i break this down a lot more algorithmic thinking how do i plan this out step by step a student that is a struggle buster will not remember how to use a loop and might not really understand the concept of using a loop itself there are always multiple ways to solve some of our our coding exercises here but we really want to ensure that they really understand what a loop means and exactly how to utilize it and why do we use a loop and the goal is that we want to have the shortest most concise code always possible but it's like math there's always multiple ways to solve any of the coding challenges and so as we work through this we'll see that the code is highlighting as we go through the blocks it will also flash when we're going to be repeating the loop itself so so it gives the students a lot of things to kind of recognize the scene is on the right hand side where we're programming is in the middle and all of the features are on the lefthand side for them to use it is drag and drop we did used to only have tech space with these younger students but we just found that the they needed a little bit more support and so the block based course has been a really great addition for these students when we've done them in product testing and this is one of our newer courses so we're really excited to see teachers utilize this this year so that is part one of the beaver achiever course let's go ahead and let's go back to our story map and let's look at the conditional statement so part two is conditional statements when they go through conditionals here they're going to help the beaver build his house um it's raining he needs a house and so here there's something else that's happening so we see that there is a plank what do we need to do it tells us that we need to pick up a log and then we need to chop it so let's take a look at what happens and if like i said if i were a student and we're running this in a classroom i would have them run it but we can see here that we failed on the first attempt which is fine coding is all about feeling forward what i like to say here so we'll see that there is a super hint here and so we'll click on the hint here and the hint will let us know that we pick it up but we also need to chop the wood probably a little bit further than we chop the wood the first time to get the plank into the correct spot all right so now that we were able to go ahead and get that um we see that we had a three star solution as well the beaver is dancing um there are some fun anime i mean fun sounds that are also associated with this i was doing product testing with this when this first was launched with the students and they were dancing alongside the bieber and it was really great to see them having that lack of you know lack of inhibition they're so excited to kind of showcase um and celebrate with the beavers so that was a lot of fun um so here now we are on challenge 15. i just moved through the story map in the upper right hand corner to go to the last challenge within this coding map and we'll see that it's a little bit more complicated it's building in complexity as it goes and so we have different size we have different size uh planks as we go along so we can see what those look like and as the students have gotten to this point they'll kind of understand what each of the plank sizes mean and how they approach it and then we'll just go ahead and show the solution we can see we have a we have a loop and then we also have nested loops inside of there so there's a lot more thinking that's involved that kind of goes with this i see richard here you have a question about can the students skip around between challenges they cannot what they will see they're able to see their solutions on the map itself but they're not actually they are not actually skipping through the challenges we want to ensure that they have a mastery of understanding and that they're not just going from 1 to 15 because if they did they would really miss a lot of the concepts in between and they that's when you have 9 000 hands in the air really asking you those questions so we want to make sure that we are really supporting them and giving them that foundation but great questions so question we get a lot so all right so that's reporting back and now we're getting to my most favorite part of the beaver achiever course and that is our last one which is the if and else conditionals so here in this course the beaver basically the more likes that he gets the busier he's going to be at his smoothie shop um so we are going to be building our friends or our customers smoothies so what we can see here is it's very visual we can see we're going to have one customer which will match the button that we have over here we have our character or our customer and our customer in this case is going to be a monkey and the monkey is going to like bananas so what i'll do is i'll drag it over we can see we can also click between the different fruit options that are the fruit and honey options that are there and then what we'll do is we can drag out this button to blend and serve but let's say i don't do that i bring out this i can see that i have a monkey and i have the banana what's going to happen my character comes in this case it is a um the girl monkey i have my super hint that's here let's say i don't do that but now i know i need to blend and serve so there's another step that needs to be taken in the process to be able to solve this challenge um so then we go ahead and we get our three star solution here and then i'll just go ahead and show you what this looks like at the very end of this challenge just i mean the very end of this course so i'm just going to go to challenge 19 here and then katrina i see your question there i'll go ahead and answer that here in just a few minutes um so here is again our beaver and now we see it starts to get a little bit more complicated we have our bear we have our rabbit we have our mooser elk and we see that each one of them has something that they like but what we see is that the bear and the moose or the elk have the same preference except for the bear likes to have honey so here's where we'll see an if and else conditionals happen so we see if the rabbit comes we'll add carrots otherwise if anyone else comes they'll get strawberries but if the bear comes then he'll get honey specifically we'll see the same thing kind of running through here um the he'll make the combination you can see where it's being highlighted in the text which is really great to see as well so the students have an understanding of where the code is actually running i think sometimes the students just see it and they just think it's happening but here the highlighting portion really allows for them to see the code working through the way that it is um katrina had a question are the hint boxes audio activated or only text do the students have teacher support to this online coding experience so we'll talk about some of the ways that the teachers can support on the opposite side of things these hints are something that are automatically executed when the student fails the hint will pop up and there's some abilities in the teacher features that you can kind of control that but in this experience here these are automatically come up and if you saw they work actually there is audio for the sounds themselves but these buttons themselves don't actually narrate um but i just have the sounds turned off right now so that's what we're seeing here and now we can see the if and else conditionals and i turned the sound i realized the sound was off but now i can turn the sound on um so that's our beaver achiever course and like i mentioned i'll go back to that code monkey junior course here in just a little bit i see that my computer was not wanting to hang out with that for some reason okay so next we'll move on to our textbased coding course so let's take a look at what that looks like so we talked about our beaver achiever and now we have our coding adventure course so coding adventure is really geared for grades three through eight and you're probably thinking yourself oh my gosh that's such a huge gap between the students and the grade levels but actually it's not because it does it is very robust and builds in complexity as it goes so we do have many middle schoolers like i mentioned even some high school students that are taking this course because we think about coding as a language um here in this course itself there are 210 story mode challenges and 210 skill modes so all in all there's about 420 challenges that students can work through um it's a lot of content but it really prepares them strongly in those foundational concepts there are 48 lessons total basically there's 16 per course and if you were to go ahead and teach those together if you only taught them once per week would be about a semester and a half worth of content typically it's really rare that we will see students go all the way through that when the teachers are delivering lessons to them so there's lots of ways that you can kind of scaffold that for years year over year um the programming language that i mentioned is coffeescript and encoding adventure we're going to focus on statements loops for loops ran indexing and then we'll get into functions and boolean operators and logic um and then at the end we'll get into more of the gamification and kind of how how you can program that using different triggering events within the code itself um so let's go ahead and let's take a look at that so what you'll see here is we have three coding adventure courses and we have three skill mode courses here each of these basically even if you have all of the courses and assigned to them they will not unlock until they progress through the challenges themselves and the same exact thing happens for skill mode skill mode challenges only open up as they work through the course themselves so that's just something to keep in mind and i'll show you exactly what that looks like so here you can see i've already finished the course so i'm gonna click redo here um it will bring me right to the beginning and the storyline here for this one is that the gorilla comes to steal this monkey's bananas that he's collected so he's sad and then he gets mad and that becomes the that becomes the mission for the game the coding game okay so we can see some different features here that i'll just kind of mention we have the stage on the left hand side where everything is taking place we have our editor on the right hand side and then every time you hover over the text here um it will actually type out for you so anything that hana kind of has white text will type out as well as the buttons here at the bottom so that really helps for students that are you know not so strong in spelling um a lot of times our ell students i've had dyslexia students have everyone come running up to me and they're so excited because they can code and program and they don't feel like they're doing what they call baby coding so it's really um nice to see that as well this one is set up a little bit more robustly than the previous concepts or the previous courses that we went over here gordo is the teacher assistant and he pops up with directions but if the kids don't read the directions as you know happens all the time he's always hanging out over here in the lefthand side of the screen so you always have the ability to click on him and make sure that the students are you know checking them out and seeing what he's doing we can also see that this is also set up in a story map the same way as our other courses were what happens here in this course specifically is that every story every map in the story is a different coding concept building complexity as it goes so let me just show you a couple of features here and then i'll show you what some how it builds and builds as it goes so here we're looking at this this tells us that we need to turn left and turn right it's the first time that the students are really learning the directionality piece um if i just run this as is we'll see that there will be a tip here and this tip tells me to turn right instead of turning left so what i'm actually going to do is i am also going to pick up this ruler measure the distance and ensure that that is in fact the distance what this ruler will also do in later challenges is also do angle measurements as well but let's say that i am a new coder don't understand how to do this so i erase it and i'm like oh this must be the solution so oops i forgot to change this first part here i say turn right and i got rid of that now we'll see that the tip will simulate for where i am as far as in the lines of code so that also helps scaffold that for those students who are going to be online you're not having that facetoface interaction there's some extra supports built in to really prop them up and have that confidence that they can move through these challenges without 9 000 questions coming to you through whatever learning management system you're having or however you're communicating with your students and then we saw that that was 12 but what i'm going to do here is i'm going to spread that out and what you'll then see is that i won't get the full three stars for the solution because i didn't write the shortest most concise code possible will also give me a tip along that along those lines letting me know how i can actually get more efficient code as well um and then here it would just igorda will either cheerlead sometimes he introduced concepts that the students are working on so just some different capabilities that gordo has there in himself and then the next challenge that we're gonna go ahead and look at as we just talked about first steps and let me just show you an example of skill mode what happens is gordo turns less into a teacher assistant and more into a coach he basically turns into this really cute track suit that he has going on here um and if i turn let's see here you guys can kind of hear the sounds a little bit i have the narration turned off this one does have a narration feature into it um there are this course specifically is programmed also into a lot of different languages so you have to have different types of learners that are in different kinds of native languages what's wrong with receiving the instructions in a different in their native language but the coding itself is always english no matter where you are um we'll see that there's a lot more thinking that's involved there's a lot more algorithmic thinking that's happening here and how do we actually solve this challenge so those will report back to you in the same way as the other challenges do on the teacher side of it which i'll show you that as well so let's go ahead and let's explore and i'm just going to go ahead and mute that so let's go ahead and let's explore now through the next set of um challenges so i went through and we did um there's objectoriented programming and and some different things that come through here but you'll see in challenge 47 it starts to get pretty um robust in nature so now we start working with variables here what we see here is we have a variable statement so it's really an additive pattern so there's lots more math being taken into place so here we can see that the first time the monkey moves he needs to move four then he moves eight then he moves twelve then he moves 16 and what we have here is a variable which has a container and so the container's value is 4 and then what we'll see here is that he'll step that container value and then step backwards of that container value so if we run this the first time we'll see that his value something is changing here and it's hard to see because it's only changing by one here but it is changing a little bit so what we want to see is that we know that the difference between each of these is actually four so what happens is that the starting container value is four but when it gets to this variable statement at the end then it will add four and the next time it will start at that value so the first time it starts at four then it will go to 8 then it will go to 12 and then it will go into 16. so you'll see um the variables are just there just so you can kind of see how that increases in complexity so that will report back to you on that side and then let's go ahead and see how that kind of advances through the concepts themselves so um just in the interest of time i'm not going to completely dive into all of these exactly but then you start seeing that you now have variable where you're actually defining the variables and exactly what those mean and then it just gets a little bit more robust as it goes along and then by time they get to the end here they will have done full gamification and like i said triggering events that are happening here and so now we're starting to do what is an on key if i press a certain key what happens if i click on the hippo what's going to happen so it just is going to be building as it goes so like i said that foundational building skill that's there all right so now we've taken a look at uh coding adventure i'm going to talk about i'll talk about lesson mode i know i mentioned i was going to talk about it here but i'll talk about it when we get into the teacher resource side of things next up we have our challenge builder and the challenge builder actually supports coding adventure and why would you use challenge builder the challenge builder is a free form creation tool and it's really good for shoots for students to show mastery of learning as well as extra practice you can differentiate here it's one thing for students to basically showcase what they've learned by progressing through the course itself but it's another thing for them to be able to build and create their own challenges to show mastery and so down underneath our creativity tool we'll see that challenge builder is here and basically as the students work through the challenges new characters and objects that are introduced so those will be they'll open up as they meet those challenges and here you'll see it's a really good place to talk about digital citizenship making sure you have appropriate language that you're using and the students will build and create their challenge for them to share so if they're struggling with simple loops it's a really good place for them to go ahead and show mastery of that learning so lots of places for them to basically have that additional practice okay what we can see is the configuration this is the background so the behind the scenes that the students don't typically see with the x and y coordinates and the rotational things of that you can add buttons that the students have been introduced to you can change the background just a lot of different features here we do have a challenge builder guide that is lesson 15 and coding adventure but if you don't want to wait before then i tend to like to do it after i feel like students have come to concepts that might be a little bit of struggle or maybe they really progress through them so i like to have them repeat that and share it out they can share it with the classroom we also have some features for them to share to discover so once you have this basically this link will pop up let's just say i have this here step 10 and i hit share or i hit save and then i hit share will share to the classroom or to um or to i can just save it and it will show on the teacher side or we do have a discover feature and that will be worldwide version of that where anyone can go ahead and play those challenges they are heavily vetted so we'll talk about that as well but i just wanted to mention that all right so then next up we had our challenge builder so what that's for we also have a dota does math course that's just a supplemental it's also coffee script as well i see there's a question about coffeescript i'll answer that here in a little bit as well um so with the with the dota does math course basically it is a supplemental so it has three courses of which there are here there's distances angles and multiplication students need to get through the first 30 challenges of coding adventure which is going to be what we consider an hour of code and then once they do then they'll work through those coding concepts with math heavy concepts here so we'll take a look at this there's also loops and different things that they work into but let's just say that we are in a challenge that we've done before this is the multiplication one the ruler the protractor one is really cool they pick up a ruler they do angle measurements and that kind of a thing so here we can see that each of these planks are worth five and that we have four of them so how far will he'll step he'll step 20 and then what he'll do is he'll get to the end here and pick up his eggs so the dodo loses his eggs on a turtle's back he lays them there by accident and then he spends the rest of the time collecting his eggs what's really cool about this is that gorda will talk about distributive properties different types of math concepts that are here and here you can see that he describes what the equation is that we just did so that's also in the copy script and then directly following the dota this map like i mentioned there's three courses there um the first 30 adventures there's also six um 45minute lessons that are there too and those will take less than a semester if you work through them once a week um the game builder course is what we're going to talk about next so this is really about the game design process so it's really teaching them the fundamentals of game design and then they will then work on the creation piece of it so there's three here there's a platformer course which is a super mario style of course then there's frogger traditional frogger game and then an animation course where they work on how to create animations within the game itself and like i said it's really designed to do the game mechanics game mechanics so let's look at the platformer course itself what you'll see here is there's also bonus tasks that are inside of here but what we'll see here is that this is now event driven programming so when i push a key something's going to happen and i make sure that there's different sprites that are here different characters we'll see on the right hand side is the stage and game where it's happening all the objects that we can insert into the game are right over here all of these buttons down here will also type out for students and why we suggest this for the older students it's very text heavy there's lots of reading that's involved and really a lot of the students struggle because they don't do the reading that's involved and they think that they just see this code example and then that's the the trick for them here um but it is very fun and they really do enjoy the game design process but they do need to have a little bit of skill set on the back end to be able to do that so by the time they get to the end here they'll have worked with different different components of game of the game that they have itself so they'll work with a excuse me here they will work with a chocolate bar you'll see that there is a tiger that will go back and forth there's a power up button that they interact with they have a timer widget there's also sounds that are here and then you can change the background of the game itself as well so there's some different capabilities that are within the course themselves i really suggest that they have at least some basis of at least finishing coding adventure before they start the game design because it can be quite challenging without having the concepts of what a for loop is or just different components there i'm not saying that's not doable that's just what we suggest or what i suggest based on my own experience um so like i mentioned there's the three games of the platformer um and now we'll move into our python course which is our banana tales course so the banana tales course is really for grades five through eight um because it is syntax it does have you know the curly brackets and things like that we do suggest it for the older grades um it just helps them have a stronger foundation like i mentioned there are 23 45minute long lessons that go with that um it's in python and they work on lists and index and for loops if and else while if and else while loops boolean operators functions and then they work into like scopes and lists and bubble sorts and lots of concepts as far as that goes so let's take a look at what that course looks like itself it's going to have the same thing the storyline here is that these two there are twin baby monkeys okay these are chosen by kiddos here these monkeys they get separated and they have to work through the course basic the students have to work through the course to connect them um this baby monkey here is unable to feed himself so he needs us to feed him so this remote control car sometimes it's in a boat this object needs to get to our monkey itself to feed him or else he gets upset something that's really great about this game that i love is that you can see the coordinates that are here when you click on the level you can see exactly where the object is located so we can see exactly where the giraffe is located itself um and it's just nice to kind of have those components there there's also builtin reference cards i'll mention where to access those for the other courses as well but there are builtin reference cards so the first time they talk about height is in challenge two and those cards will open up as they progress through the game itself um so here we have the giraffe height so i drag another giraffe out and what i need to do is i need the neck of the giraffe to stretch and when he stretches and i click on the car and now the baby monkey can be fed and he is a happy camper and then as we progress through here let's just take a look and the same scoring system is happening throughout all the courses like i mentioned except for the game builder it's more of a pass fail with the stars for extra scoring um here we can see there's also the snake so the snake needs to do we need the snake what do we need to have happen we can see we need to add snake we need the giraffe's heads to shrink so this so the snakes heads can stretch out so we can actually get to the monkey himself and we'll see it working through on the lefthand side what's really nice is there's hints here and then when they work through some of the harder concepts you can see it working in the console itself which is also really great looks more so like a gamified um computer programmer would use and like i said it does build in complexity as it goes and they move through the story map and we can see where they're going to be approaching the different concepts that are here um and then by time they get to the end of this course they'll have worked with slicing and so that's just if you are a programmer yourself you'll kind of know that if you're not there's some really great notes for the python course itself that will really help support that so um you can just see how the levels are building in complexity as it goes um okay i'm just going to quick brief touch on these other two courses and then if you guys have followup questions we'll be happy to answer those just so i can get into the teacher resources um directly following that we recommend this coding chatbot course they work through the python concepts to build an interactive chat bot that plays a game of snowman formerly hangman it's not appropriate so we now call it snowman um so they're playing that type of a game with him and so they'll go through the process it's very similarly set up to the game design course itself where they're working through the challenges and as they progress the challenges are opening up and they're going to be able to interact and chat over here on the side by time they get to challenge 74 you'll see because i'm on the teacher side of things you'll see that the they have worked through a lot of code to be able to create this chat bot itself so it is pretty complex and we do suggest it for the older grade levels just based on the experience level that they have um we do have some other courses that i forgot to mention the game builder has its own game builder platform similar to the challenge builder itself um and then there's just uh the other only other one that i missed here was the moonlander course and that's just going to be a similar to the game design one but with landing on the moon and physics and thrust and they work through some of those different concepts all right so that was a lot on that side of things and i'll be sure to leave some time for questions i just really want to honor your time as well so now let's talk about our teacher resources and how we can support you on the back end i've seen a lot of questions about experience level and some different things like that so i want to make sure that we're supporting you in that way as well so that was the tour of the courses and now let's talk about the teacher resources and how that will help you support i see a lot of people being like what if i what do i do if i'm not a coding teacher or i don't have a strong background let me show you what we can do to help support you so here i am in the mat and the classrooms page um we'll get into this side of their of things but on the lefthand side we have the teacher resources and in the teacher resources here is where you have everything that you're going to need so all of our fully guided lesson plans are located here our webinars from past webinars that we've had you can also visit our youtube channel for more of our webinars that we've done from years past like a few years ago as well i highly recommend this teaching with coding adventure course what it does is walk you through the first concepts that are in the first part of coding adventure all the way up to for loops it's me so you guys are welcome um and basically what we do is we work through what exactly is a for loop what does it mean what does it look like in these challenges so you have a firmer concept of understanding that you can you know that you can kind of grasp together so you can have a little bit more background knowledge when you're um when you're kind of working through that so i highly recommend it i think that it really gives you a strong skill point or you know skill set when i first started learning how to code myself i was able to work through it but i wasn't able to explain some of the concepts so i actually completed the original course that we had and then i was like oh okay i understand what these concepts are so if i can do it you can do it um so that's what that looks like let's take a look at one of the lesson plans just you kind of have an idea they are set up in a slide deck format um each of them has you know the what the lesson is going to be about they all have objectives in them and then they are all standards aligned and we will talk about the concepts that you're covering here um each of the lessons are set up in exactly the same way there's an intro which is an unplugged activity which you can do via remote instruction um so a lot of times people think you have to be directly like really unplugged but you can show an object on the screen and have the students write it out in a jam board or some you know maybe in a padlet or something like that to have them write out the instructions of how to solve a challenge or you can pop a challenge up there take a screenshot throw it up there and kind of you know work through that together in that way um and then the second part is going to be the play time where the students are actually playing the course itself and then the last part is going to be the debrief where they're actually going to be working through you know reflectionary questions what happens if you get stuck what did you notice about that and they'll work through those concepts as they go and that's like that same format for all of them except for on the beaver achiever course it does give you more so just a different it's just a little bit different of a format there we do have i do want to mention this only because it's it's important so we do have lesson plans for the banana tales and then we also have um these classroom slides so these are ones that you these lessons are basically um already created for you to share with your students like what do you do how do you write the code so there's a little bit more support on that so there's like the classroom notes that walk you through what everything means which i tend to rely upon quite a bit um so you can use these notes here or you can use the slide deck itself so just some extra features to kind of you know have in your back pocket um we do have this howto guide these are just guides basically um for how to add students archive a class getting started um hour of code nodes and then classroom resources these are certificates here we have our media kit which is access to all of our images like course images and things like that that's cute like fun graphics and then we have our posters here these are just visual posters and we do have coloring sheets if you want as well um something new that we just added if you did my other webinar you already know this but um you can now access all of the solutions here and the teacher resources you don't actually have to go to the progress page itself all of the courses are here the skill mode challenges hour of code code monkey junior all of the courses themselves are exactly located here so i did mention that i would talk about the code monkey junior course so here is what it would look like and you basically pick up these um arrows and you would run through those courses so there's sequencing advanced sequencing loops and advanced loops and it's really cute and fun and the kids really enjoy that so just wanted to briefly touch that just in the interest so i can leave time for q a for you guys okay moving on now we're going to talk about um the lesson mode feature and then we're also going to talk about oh no we're also going to talk about um the sorry guys we're also going to talk about the um let me pull this up i actually got rid of my slide deck there so i'm just pulling this back up for you guys um we'll talk about the lesson mode which is something that i mentioned that we would talk about okay so we are on our classrooms page here and i will go into any of the classrooms that i created um we are integrated with google classroom in both clever if you want to import your if you want to import your classes there is the ability to do that with some really great help articles on that as well um let me just go to another classroom here oops excuse me so we'll go into this wow i'm on the struggle bus here you can see um so i'll go into my classroom that i've created here and what we'll see is right away it will pop us out at the progress page i personally find this to be the holy grail of everything that that we have on our pages because it contains everything every single star contains a student's solution and you can see it in real time if you click on it so we'll show you exactly how they solved it you can sort by student progress so you're able to see you know do a quick data dive and to see exactly how far students the students got where you see a lot of blue stars where you see a lot of red stars when you click on any of the stars any one of the stars you can see how many times the student attempted the challenge and if you pull it up you can pull you can see exactly how they solved it it's actually anonymous too which makes for really great instruction especially in a remote environment you guys can share that you know with your students on the screen and you can work through it together you can also limit the progress so you lock them down so they're not working too far in ahead which is why you see this part grayed out if i do free play it opens completely up we can also turn off the super hints so gordo i didn't show you that but gordo does have super hints that he has and he has an extra light bulb that pops up and that will guide the students more and never gives the answer but it will guide them you can also export all this data to a csv file and why i mention that is it will tell you exactly the times that the students logged in sometimes that's important i know i know in the spring when code first happened teachers were really trying to figure out how to take attendance and so they were using this data file to be able to do that and then up here in green are all the solutions that you saw on the teacher resource page but now they're also here for you on this page and it is reporting back to you in real time so that's pretty important now the lesson mode feature here this is only available for our coding adventure course it is set up exactly like our lessons and what happens is when you begin the lesson itself the student screens lock and they don't have access to the courses themselves there are reference cards and character review cards the character review card is very important for when you're doing the challenge builder so you can know exactly when those when those characters are introduced so we can see here in challenge 13 is when we meet our turtle and when we do object tag or objectoriented programming so the turtle will open up for use then then the beaver will open up in challenge 55 so it's just kind of good to know but it's also good for the students to understand how do i actually program and move these characters especially later on when they are working through through that itself and what's also really nice is that you have access to the challenges that are in the specific lesson right there you're not going to have to hunt and navigate multiple screens and then when you're ready you can assign those challenges and sometimes in the debrief like you can see here there's some challenges that you'll work through so just different components are located all right here for you and there is this short tutorial which um my team will pop here in the chat for you so you guys can see exactly how to do those lessons themselves on the student tab i'm not really going to mention months about the student tab not really much to do here except for there is a direct login url if you're in person you can do login cards but here is where you will add your coteachers to your account so you can share the classroom and then just super quick you can assign courses here and then the gradebook is automatically graded the students as they're working through the challenges they do have a specific point value and then they'll be populated here what's nice about this is that at the bottom of the page the more students that struggle with the challenge the larger the circle is so that's just something to keep in mind and also makes for those great mini lessons for you to teach on without having to hunt through the progress page if you don't want as well you can also export this as a csv which is really nice as well um i know that's what i used to do exported csv and upload it into my gradebook so um you have that capability as well and then when we talked about the games and challenges earlier when the students publish them to the classrooms this is where they will be showcased for you yours are in the my creations but the students are here for you you can search by student you can also disable the discover feature just keep in mind with the discover that it is heavily vetted and it makes a copy of their of their gamer challenge so that they can't go back and edit it and try to be sneaky like they try to do so those are just some different things to keep in mind there okay so a lot of information and i see a lot of questions so we're gonna kind of go through that um so we talked about how to track student progress oh there was one thing that i wanted to mention our newest feature here under the grade book is we now have this um it's called a proficiency table and so in the proficiency it will show you the concepts that are without all throughout all of the coding adventure i mean throughout all of the code monkey platform and it will tell you exactly how the students did so we have a novice beginner intermediate and advanced it'll tell you how how proficient basically they are in those concepts just remember that these are concepts that are throughout all of the course like sort you only see obviously in banana tails so but you'll see sequencing in all the courses you'll see simple loops in all of the courses so just some different things that you'll see and it's just kind of nice to have something extra in your back pocket alrighty so now we've talked about tracking student progress we talked about the classroom dashboard and now we've went through the tour de courses and um we're going to leave some time for some q a but before we do the q a portion i see there's a lot of things that i'll go back here and answer for you um so i did want to talk about that we do have the code monkey webinar page my team is going to put that there in the chat box for you um so the webinars are located there as i mentioned it's also located on our youtube channel where you can see all of the past recordings that we've done and anything that's upcoming will be on the webinar page itself we do have some student guided lessons that we've done um during the covid period where we took over your classrooms and kind of taught some of the students so if you're looking for some examples i would suggest looking there as well i talked about the proficiency table the gradebook and then just one last thing that i did want to mention that will also be great for you is in the courses pic sorry into my classrooms page there is a place where you can generate a usage report so if you're the account admin or you just want to see your classrooms you'll basically pull this up here and it will show you exactly how often the kids are kids are using the program in each class so that's also something to just kind of keep in mind all right now i know we're pushing time here so i just want to make sure that i cover that now we're going to leave time for q a i am going to answer these questions that are here and then i'm also going to answer those there so if you are running short on time just know that we're just doing q a right now so um how would i use a tool like this to create lessons for three different grades so what you would do is you would create three your classrooms and then you would assign the specific courses to them i would suggest using like a learning management system like either google or canvas or something like that to create the lessons and i basically would just do let's say have them you're working on the coding adventure course you have them work through challenge 20 create a challenge build their own challenge in the challenge builder they share that with you and then you're able to see their progress in both places best best practices for hybrid or online learning using code monkey lessons i would say using those super hints doing some lessons whole group together i know that that sounds like oh i don't want to do that but really solving some challenges together using a jam board or a padlet or some other resource there to kind of work through that together is what i would suggest um can you add code monkey grades to the classroom what i didn't mention is that you can actually in the code monkey lessons itself you can actually assign the lessons to your google classroom and those grades will also report to your google classroom if i'm correct i believe i am um it will also report back there too and then how to teach a remotely while live integrating stem areas including technology into grades k through five like i mentioned i would do a lot of those unplugged activities using a jamboard or something like that and i would also try to you know maybe use a code monkey like challenge number seven in coding adventure has the first time that they're using um the ruler as an angle measurement or using the dota does math courses are really going to be good for those integration areas we have the moon lander for the older grades um that's really science driven personally i would create stories with the coding adventure challenge builders that's what i would do for those so i would use the challenge builder and have them use the save feature which they learn in like challenge challenge fit in around in the 50s and they would say something and they would use a story so i would make a math story personally with my challenge builder so there's lots of ways and abilities to do that um that you can kind of do that you can kind of progress okay so is it possible to see students answers even if the wrong attempts have been made um so that is true you can when you go into that progress page you can click on it it will show you exactly how the students solved it if they got the answer incorrect it will have a circle with like an exclamation point just means they failed the challenge typically that doesn't usually happen but excuse me you will be able to see that every time a student works through a challenge it's being held there in the progress page so thank you for that question um do i need to have a different lms or the code monkey as a selfsufficient platform i think that depends on you i personally would do an lms in addition to that i think that you can obviously do everything in the code monkey platform the only thing that you're not able to do is to do that communication so if you're doing the communication in google me or in zoom then i think you're fine i think just sometimes this the students you can also post discussion questions like post a challenge or an unplugged activity have them solve it maybe they do their own unplugged activity with like a tick tock video or something just some way for them to have some submission there's no place for you to do any kind of submission or assigning assignments really except for in the challenge except for in the lesson mode but that's only um during that short period of time so great question okay so i think um molly or brett do you guys want to pop on with any um questions that you guys that i might have missed here i think you've answered all of the questions the only thing to clarify is the integration with google classroom we unfortunately do not have the capabilities to do a great pass back from code monkey to google classroom but you can export your grades to a csv file and then use that file if you need to manipulate it somehow to get it back to google classroom okay great do you guys have does anyone else have any questions that we can help answer um i see there is a lot of good conversation happening here on the side okay well if you guys do have any questions that kind of um pop up here i do see a few questions here um there is a question here about emailing we will follow up with you um regarding um regarding the your question about your quote requests and things like that so we do have a couple of um questions that are um that will follow up with you that we've mentioned beforehand so um i apologize i see that everyone should hopefully be able to see each other's comments my my apologies roberto will follow up with you following um today's webinar we really really really want to thank you guys so much for everything that you do every single day we know that you guys are working harder than probably um we have all in years right um with transitioning to the way that the classrooms are running and online and such the uncertainty that we have um in front of us i know that we didn't throw this into the chat box but i did want to mention this just really briefly i think it's an important concept in the help center here there is some explanations on the coding adventure courses so if you type in coding adventure um you're able to see some of the concepts that are covered so if you're struggling on some of the concepts that are there or the terminology it's all located here in the help page so i would definitely recommend checking that out as well but like i mentioned we want to thank you so much for all of your questions your active engagement during this time we really enjoyed spending the afternoon with you and remember to follow us on all of our social platforms where you can get you know lots of update information and about our blogs um just remember that we're here for any questions that you have we really want to ensure that you have the best teaching experience possible by using code monkey and from our team to yours we want to thank you for all that you do today tomorrow and all the days in between to get your students future ready and remember to write code catch bananas and save the world until next time bye
