00:02 - 10 years of coding learning and fun join
00:05 - us as we celebrate a decade of Code
00:07 - Monkey the Innovative platform where
00:09 - kids learn to code through
00:13 - play my inspiration for COD monkey came
00:16 - when I hosted my own coding classes for
00:19 - kids I saw how effective game based
00:21 - learning is in computer science
00:23 - education my vision when starting Code
00:25 - Monkey was to scale this experience
00:28 - online to teachers in their class with
00:30 - their students all over the world we
00:32 - really wanted to give every child an
00:34 - opportunity to learn this amazing
00:36 - profession and skill of coding learning
00:39 - should be fun and accessible this is why
00:42 - we created an experience that is gender
00:44 - neutral lightweight easy to implement
00:47 - anywhere in the world with a basic
00:49 - laptop and a basic internet connection
00:51 - check out this game I created you
00:52 - created a game how with Code Monkey Code
00:56 - Monkey was easily adaptable into this
00:58 - school and what I've been using the
01:00 - lessons that come with Code Monkey are
01:02 - absolutely fantastic and allows me to
01:04 - also be creative and use my own teaching
01:07 - Style with
01:08 - it we believe every child should have
01:11 - some kind of digital literacy and coding
01:13 - literacy all the kids and I know that
01:15 - have been exposed to Code Monkey really
01:17 - love it and they are influenced by it it
01:19 - has a lot of value students have
01:20 - different abilities so they are able to
01:22 - go at their own pace it gives them the
01:25 - opportunity to be successful in their
01:29 - own ways we don't have to compare them
01:30 - to anybody
01:32 - else they very much like Code Monkey
01:35 - they're obsessed with it it's like a
01:36 - game to them but they're actually
01:37 - learning about conditionals things like
01:39 - that I love playing with my friends on
01:40 - Code Monkey we solve puzzles and help
01:43 - each other when I have a big problem
01:45 - Code Monkey helps me break it into
01:47 - smaller bits and then I can solve it one
01:49 - by
01:50 - one achieving student engagement is the
01:53 - key factor in achieving a continuous
01:55 - learning experience also outside of the
01:57 - classroom kids have a lot of screen time
02:00 - these days they can have educational
02:01 - screen time with code monkey and build
02:04 - their problem solving skills create
02:06 - games and who knows maybe open the door
02:09 - to new opportunities at the heart of
02:11 - Code Monkey are the countless stories of
02:17 - growth the biggest thing that we've
02:19 - noticed from students is that critical
02:21 - thinking skills that's important in
02:22 - every facet of their life so really
02:24 - making them stop think about what
02:26 - they're going to do see if that problem
02:28 - works sometimes you get stuck on a
02:29 - challenge that you just can't figure out
02:31 - you have to figure out different ways
02:32 - about it not only learning the problem
02:34 - solving aspect of it but they're
02:36 - persevering through those difficult
02:38 - coding Concepts they're also learning
02:40 - collaboration being able to work with
02:42 - each other and problem solve together it
02:44 - also allows them to be creative too
02:46 - especially with the game building
02:47 - courses and things like that the journey
02:49 - with Code Monkey doesn't just end in the
02:51 - classroom let's take a glimpse into the
02:53 - future where today's Young coders become
02:56 - tomorrow's Tech innovators through code
02:59 - monkey today's students take their first
03:02 - steps towards tomorrow's careers in
03:03 - robotics AI biotech and Tech startups
03:07 - embarking on a future rich with
03:09 - technological innovation and
03:11 - opportunities let's take a look back at
03:13 - how code monkey has evolved from our
03:15 - first coding challenges to our latest
03:17 - interactive courses our journey has been
03:19 - incredible Cod monkey was born in a
03:21 - classroom was created for classrooms and
03:23 - teachers first that's the way we
03:25 - continue to manage the Code Monkey
03:27 - experience we're here in our office is
03:29 - working very far away from the actual
03:32 - usage in the classroom so it's really
03:33 - important to us to hear what teachers
03:35 - have to say we rely on teachers feedback
03:38 - constantly to continue improve and
03:40 - enrich the product in 10 years we've
03:42 - reached mileston that once seemed like
03:44 - distant dreams today we celebrate this
03:47 - achievement and look forward to more in
03:49 - a decade code monkey has reached over 34
03:52 - million users solved over 600 million
03:55 - challenges and is now in more than 206
03:58 - countries and 18 th000 schools our
04:01 - beloved monkey has been a constant
04:03 - companion on our journey making friends
04:05 - along the way that reflect the growth
04:07 - and diversity of our Vibrant Community
04:09 - as we look back on these 10 years we are
04:12 - filled with gratitude and excitement
04:14 - here's to coding learning and growing
04:17 - together happy anniversary Code Monkey
04:20 - we love Cod monkey we love Cod monkey a
04:25 - heartfelt thank you to our community
04:27 - your passion to coding is what drives us
04:30 - forward keep exploring keep coding and
04:33 - keep dreaming
04:35 - monkey monkey thank you cold monkey N C
