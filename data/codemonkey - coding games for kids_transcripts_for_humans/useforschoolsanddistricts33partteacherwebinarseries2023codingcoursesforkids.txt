00:02 - hi everyone my name is uh Zach izakow I
00:06 - am the VP of sales at code monkey before
00:09 - I get started here just going to share
00:11 - my screen
00:15 - uh Tyler we can you can see my screen
00:21 - yes I can okay so welcome everyone uh
00:24 - this webinar it's a half hour webinar
00:27 - we'll get you out at uh 3 P.M Eastern
00:30 - Standard Time or wherever else you may
00:32 - be in the United States
00:35 - um we are on our third webinar the final
00:39 - uh series we've done a couple of them
00:41 - which I'll discuss in a second this one
00:43 - is specifically Code Monkey for schools
00:46 - and districts uh so welcome everyone
00:49 - we're really excited about this we've
00:50 - had a couple good webinars and now we're
00:52 - on our third and final one at least for
00:55 - these uh these these short webinars just
00:58 - to introduce myself again uh I'm Zach uh
01:02 - VP of sales at Code Monkey been working
01:04 - here for a number of years started to
01:06 - hear I think this will be my sixth
01:09 - theoret Code Monkey really looking
01:10 - forward to uh
01:12 - um
01:13 - presenting all of you uh specifically on
01:16 - this topic and then I'll let my
01:18 - colleague introduce himself as well
01:24 - Tyler maybe you gotta unmute yourself
01:27 - yep that's what you have to do so my
01:29 - name is
01:31 - um I've been with Code Monkey for
01:33 - several years now I'm a regional sales
01:36 - manager
01:38 - um just here to assist Zach there's any
01:40 - q a we'd love uh if you guys have any
01:42 - questions feel free to let us know and
01:45 - I'm looking forward to the presentation
01:47 - side Perfect all right so uh just so
01:50 - everyone should know if you have any
01:52 - questions you can always write on the um
01:55 - the the chat or the I'm pretty sure the
01:58 - Q a and Tyler will answer uh through
02:00 - writing and then maybe we'll deal if
02:02 - there's time for questions at the end
02:04 - um we'll do that so
02:08 - here's the uh the agenda for today so
02:12 - we're going to be looking at
02:14 - um what do we do the past
02:16 - webinars Tyler gave the one previously
02:19 - and then the one before that was given
02:20 - by by Molly then we're gonna figure out
02:24 - why why is coding in schools and I guess
02:26 - in districts hard
02:27 - how does coder monkeys support teachers
02:30 - our curriculum the weekly schedule and
02:33 - the admin dashboard
02:35 - um the focus of this particular webinar
02:41 - if I had to give it a slogan or a line
02:44 - is how to systematically implement a k
02:48 - to eight computer science program so
02:51 - whether you're a small school a large
02:54 - school a small District a large District
02:56 - or anything in between
02:58 - We Believe at code monkey and I'm sure
03:01 - many of you those of you who are joining
03:03 - in around the United States believe
03:05 - that computer science coding and I'll
03:08 - use those two words interchangeably
03:11 - believe that computer science should be
03:15 - taught as a subject just like you would
03:18 - be teaching any other topic whether it
03:21 - is English language math science history
03:24 - geography so on and so forth
03:27 - the way that coding has been done I
03:29 - would say in the last five six years
03:32 - has been done more sporadically you'll
03:34 - have a teacher here use this program
03:36 - another teacher there this and it's sort
03:38 - of been great as the computer science
03:41 - education has developed and improved
03:43 - throughout the United States it's very
03:46 - important additionally
03:48 - that now that we're growing in this
03:51 - space that we become a little bit more
03:52 - organized we come a little bit more
03:54 - systematic and do it in a way that
03:57 - really suits the needs of an institution
03:59 - because now are the teachers on the
04:02 - ground as well as those who are leading
04:04 - whether principals or superintendents or
04:06 - directors of curriculum they're also
04:09 - looking they're also looking at computer
04:12 - science in that way and that's what I
04:14 - want to show you how Code Monkey does
04:16 - that as well
04:17 - so before going into it before going
04:20 - into it what is Code Monkey so first and
04:24 - foremost Code Monkey is a leading coding
04:27 - program for students I personally like
04:29 - to use the term curriculum uh where a
04:32 - curriculum for kids all over the world
04:35 - um just a little couple things over here
04:37 - were made with schools and teachers in
04:40 - mind standards aligned
04:43 - um curriculum as well as a full K
04:45 - curriculum and the no prior coding
04:48 - experience needed to teach these are
04:49 - sort of like our four main added values
04:52 - pieces over here
04:54 - um and the idea there is we're going to
04:58 - show you how code monkey and these four
05:01 - specific aspects really impacts and
05:04 - allows you as a school or District to
05:07 - implement computer science in a real
05:09 - organized and systematic way
05:11 - so
05:12 - why is coding schools in heart
05:15 - what's Difficult about it why can't we
05:17 - just begin it why is it taking schools
05:20 - and districts years to properly
05:23 - implement the program
05:24 - and I would say the number one issue
05:27 - which in my time here at code monkey and
05:29 - I'm sure Tyler would say the same
05:31 - um and many of you is that there's a
05:33 - lack of teachers and I always joke you
05:37 - know computer science is a four-year
05:39 - degree in University or if you're doing
05:41 - now boot camps or anything like that
05:43 - it's like 10 months intensive full-time
05:46 - so teachers who are trained in history
05:49 - Math Science and all of the other
05:51 - subjects who are now being required to
05:54 - teach computer science we're asking
05:57 - really such a challenging thing for
06:00 - teachers to do and I've seen this
06:02 - teachers on the ground it doesn't matter
06:03 - if they're first starting or they've
06:05 - been teaching for 40 years they're all
06:06 - in the same place to ask teachers to
06:08 - learn not just to be able to teach a new
06:10 - topic but to learn an entire
06:13 - University degree is an extremely
06:16 - challenging task for schools all over
06:20 - the globe
06:21 - and that's very that's something which
06:23 - we see day in and day out and something
06:25 - which Tyler in his in his previous
06:27 - webinar really focused which we're not
06:30 - going to do today we'll talk about it a
06:32 - bit but a major Focus was on the teacher
06:34 - platform
06:36 - um and we'll send out that webinar as
06:38 - well will be on our website and you'll
06:39 - be able to access it next is timing in
06:42 - the weekly schedule there are states and
06:45 - meaning I don't know where everyone is
06:47 - from here today but there are states
06:49 - that are now for example in New York
06:51 - requiring that students learn K-12
06:54 - computer science but if it's not a
06:56 - requirement or even if it's something
06:58 - new where do you find time in the weekly
07:00 - schedule to do it
07:02 - so then let's see if you find teachers
07:03 - or you find timing which curriculum
07:06 - there's Code Monkey there's this there's
07:07 - that there's what the standards are
07:09 - there's so much and how do you choose
07:12 - which is the right one and then what I
07:14 - always like to talk about and I think
07:16 - it's something really important I think
07:17 - it's something that we always have to
07:19 - keep in mind because as Educators and I
07:21 - spent you know roughly 10 years in the
07:24 - classroom we have to think of the
07:25 - students we really have to think of the
07:27 - students and and if there's one thing
07:29 - that I can say absolutely about Code
07:31 - Monkey is they are we are student
07:34 - focused from the get-go meaning that we
07:37 - started off with a game-based computer
07:39 - science course now we're a full
07:41 - curriculum which I'll talk about but
07:43 - that's really where we Thrive and that's
07:45 - really what we try to do is solve that
07:48 - last part that's what we tried to solve
07:50 - first is coding's hard how do we get
07:52 - students to learn okay we created Code
07:53 - Monkey it doesn't seem so hard for
07:55 - students anymore with our program so
07:59 - now
08:00 - again you uh Tyler went a lot more in
08:03 - depth in the previous uh webinar but
08:06 - this is a major aspect when we're
08:09 - talking about how do we get
08:13 - um teachers how do we Implement a
08:15 - computer science program in a really
08:17 - organized way
08:19 - it really focuses and starts and ends
08:23 - with the teachers those are on the
08:25 - ground those are in front of the
08:26 - students
08:27 - and what we have done at Code Monkey is
08:28 - unbelievable we have created a platform
08:31 - a user experience for teachers despite
08:36 - their backgrounds we have have had
08:38 - teachers who are computer science
08:40 - experts they're teaching hundreds and
08:42 - hundreds of students within the district
08:43 - and we have some teachers who've never
08:46 - even thought about coding before and
08:48 - have started teaching it and have done
08:49 - so successfully and we have an entire
08:52 - dashboard again which I'm not going to
08:54 - focus on very much but again you could
08:58 - see the recording they're very short
08:59 - webinars 30 minutes we have lesson plans
09:02 - video tutorials we have everything
09:05 - technology wise and I'll show you here
09:08 - just a little bit this is our teacher
09:10 - dashboard we have
09:12 - all the lesson plans we have solutions
09:15 - to every single challenge that we have
09:18 - in each of our course we have video
09:20 - tutorials
09:21 - um in terms of the actual functionality
09:24 - we
09:25 - um have the ability to easily add
09:28 - classes to get into classes to see
09:31 - um where students are limit progress we
09:33 - have
09:34 - um answers also over here if I click
09:36 - over here it'll take me to a three-star
09:38 - solution which gives me the actual
09:40 - answer we have quizzes proficiency
09:44 - reports automated grading again not
09:46 - gonna go too much into it but what we
09:49 - have done is we have seriously focused
09:52 - after we we created our first few
09:54 - courses we realized okay we we've
09:57 - created something really great for
09:58 - students
10:00 - um and again in our I'm not going
10:01 - through our courses or showing that
10:03 - because in our first session with Molly
10:06 - um we went all into our courses and
10:08 - again that will be on our website and
10:09 - we'll share that afterwards
10:11 - um but what we have done here is on the
10:15 - tech side of it the technology we have
10:17 - automated everything from grading to
10:20 - videos to quizzes everything we've
10:23 - automated so that the teacher does not
10:26 - have to focus on the technology we
10:28 - realized very early on that if we can
10:31 - get the tech side of it to be automated
10:34 - now let's try to focus on the pedagogy
10:36 - and ensure that our teachers who despite
10:39 - the record know how to teach and so we
10:41 - created lesson plans video tutorials
10:44 - um little little short videos everything
10:46 - in order to help the teacher
10:48 - but more than that if I would continue
10:52 - the lack of teachers very much leads
10:55 - into professional development and Code
10:58 - Monkey is has created a professional
11:00 - development plan which we have we've
11:04 - suggested various types of
11:06 - um
11:07 - professional development options it
11:09 - could be webinars it could be short
11:11 - 45 minute PE sessions through the year
11:13 - you know the more focused one is
11:18 - um
11:19 - the the most focused one is maybe heavy
11:22 - PD in the summer which we know a lot of
11:25 - schools and districts do a lot of times
11:27 - I even suggest don't do any PD in your
11:31 - first year take the take the curriculum
11:34 - use it get re get ready for it learn how
11:38 - it goes and then after that in your next
11:41 - year when you realize when everyone
11:42 - understands the technology whenever
11:43 - anyone's on board or when you've done
11:45 - all that work then you can focus on PD
11:48 - additionally in a regular Code Monkey
11:50 - subscription there's already PD um Tyler
11:53 - showed this in the last one but if I go
11:56 - over here there's an asynchronous
11:59 - um asynchronous
12:01 - uh recording of a introduction to text
12:05 - based computer science which I'll talk
12:07 - about we have an entire page dedicated
12:09 - to webinars which all of our webinars as
12:11 - you can see will be posted up there and
12:14 - so on and so forth talking about
12:16 - technology maybe pedagogical so just
12:19 - built within our Code Monkey
12:21 - subscription you already have
12:23 - professional development options and
12:25 - it's so easy for teachers it really
12:28 - really is
12:29 - so when we're talking about how can we
12:31 - Implement a district-wide or school-wide
12:34 - computer science
12:36 - curriculum program however you want to
12:38 - define it you need to think of the
12:40 - teachers in Code Monkey very very early
12:43 - on like seven eight years ago has
12:45 - already started focusing on how we can
12:48 - make this best for every single teacher
12:52 - now I have to go into the curriculum now
12:55 - I mentioned how do you well when the
12:57 - hard things was how do we choose the
12:58 - curriculum and all that but I would even
13:00 - step
13:01 - take a step back and tell you that many
13:05 - of your teachers on the ground and a lot
13:07 - of you know this there's a lot of
13:08 - computer science coding programs
13:11 - curriculum maybe there are
13:13 - Hardware software a mix of everything
13:16 - and the question which you have to think
13:18 - about is what is an activity what is a
13:22 - program and what is a curriculum
13:25 - a connectivity or a program
13:27 - I would say is what's been happening the
13:31 - past few years teacher finds something
13:34 - that they really like they think it
13:35 - would be engaging to the kids so they
13:37 - bring it into the classroom and they use
13:39 - it twice in the year great check mark
13:41 - you've done coding
13:44 - that's not how we learn that's maybe how
13:46 - you get kids excited and I'm not
13:47 - downplaying those programs activities at
13:50 - all in fact there are many schools and
13:52 - districts that use Code Monkey as well
13:54 - as other maybe Hardware activities which
13:57 - are once or twice that they can pull it
13:59 - out
14:00 - um every single time maybe that there is
14:01 - a a extra time during the day or
14:04 - anything but curriculum that's the term
14:06 - that's the language we want to use when
14:08 - it comes to computer science we don't
14:10 - want to use activity we don't want to
14:12 - use program just like when we're talking
14:14 - about English or Spanish or math we use
14:17 - curriculum and what I'm showing you here
14:20 - just a couple of awards that we have won
14:23 - across the globe and I don't say this as
14:27 - like an ego boost to Code Monkey even
14:29 - though it sort of is
14:30 - I say that because the experts in
14:34 - computer science
14:35 - around the world
14:37 - have recognized Code Monkey
14:40 - as a leading computer science curriculum
14:43 - globally and that is really important
14:46 - it's very important because I've been I
14:49 - mean I'll be at iste and I hope everyone
14:51 - here if you're going to iste in
14:53 - Philadelphia in a few weeks you'll join
14:55 - us uh you'll come to our booth
14:57 - and I see when the when those who have
14:59 - learned computer science they see it and
15:02 - they instantly realize wow this is
15:04 - something unique this is something
15:06 - special this is something different and
15:09 - I'll explain why we're a full K8
15:12 - curriculum
15:13 - we go all the way from kindergarten with
15:16 - pretty simple easy to use courses
15:20 - all the way up to python courses which
15:22 - are quite difficult
15:23 - and this is a major difference in terms
15:26 - of what we are doing at code monkey
15:28 - versus what's happening maybe with some
15:31 - other programs and again no idea to
15:32 - compare contrast just trying to talk
15:34 - about the value of Code Monkey
15:37 - when you're looking at your curriculum
15:39 - for your school or District
15:41 - what's happening and I I don't know
15:43 - everyone's background here
15:45 - so I'm going to assume it's a little bit
15:47 - more that you would unknow what block
15:50 - based coding is I would say roughly
15:53 - between 90 to 95 of computer science
15:57 - maybe curriculum program activities
15:59 - whatever you want to say for the K to
16:01 - six
16:02 - is block based meaning it's the drag and
16:04 - dropping of code
16:06 - that's really really important there's
16:09 - no doubt about that
16:11 - but the question is until when do you do
16:13 - block based coding so Code Monkey
16:16 - meaning if I go to our courses you can
16:19 - see on our on our platform
16:21 - we have block based coding we have block
16:23 - based coding novice beginner but then
16:26 - you'll see that it's text-based coding
16:28 - and what does that look like so again
16:30 - not to delve into it because we've
16:32 - already done this but just to show you
16:36 - if I were to go and this is our courses
16:38 - and I'll get into sort of the students
16:41 - oh this is not a good example sorry
16:44 - let's just uh pick you over here
16:48 - the students over here they're writing a
16:50 - loop so let's say if they're writing
16:54 - over here
16:55 - um Step 13 turn right what you see is
16:58 - students are actually writing code as
17:02 - opposed to block based coding and that's
17:04 - really significant in terms of what we
17:06 - are doing
17:07 - and this is why it's really important I
17:10 - read today just as an example
17:12 - um csta and co.org they launch a every
17:17 - year a
17:18 - a yearly
17:20 - um CS overview of all of the United
17:22 - States and I I read today specifically
17:24 - like in terms of Connecticut five
17:27 - percent of high school students in
17:29 - Connecticut take computer science
17:31 - courses
17:32 - and the reason is because not enough
17:34 - students are probably doing it in
17:36 - elementary school but more than that
17:39 - even if they are doing in the middle in
17:41 - elementary middle school what are they
17:43 - doing if they're doing block based
17:44 - coding courses when they get to high
17:46 - school and they have to take AP Computer
17:48 - Science courses or maybe not even AP but
17:51 - regular computer science courses they're
17:54 - really really behind because
17:56 - the best example I always like to give
17:58 - is it's like you're teaching a language
18:00 - English Spanish whatever it may be if
18:03 - you took kindergarten in grade 8 and you
18:06 - only taught students grammar and then
18:08 - you get into ninth grade and you say go
18:10 - write an essay right
18:13 - um
18:14 - you say go write an essay
18:16 - they'll be like we've never written an
18:18 - essay we just learned about essays we
18:20 - learned grammar we learned exclamation
18:23 - points and verb but all of that
18:25 - but if they've never written
18:27 - then they're gonna have a very hard time
18:29 - in high school writing an essay and
18:30 - that's very much our belief in Code
18:32 - Monkey we want to make sure students are
18:36 - progressing year after year after year
18:38 - just like they are doing with other
18:40 - subjects math science again I'll sort of
18:43 - stress that that's extremely important
18:45 - to us
18:46 - we do not want to continue our students
18:49 - on block based coding when they're in
18:51 - Middle School
18:52 - right if they're doing that that's great
18:54 - but then the idea it's not great it's
18:56 - it's good that they're doing that as
18:57 - opposed to nothing but then where's the
19:00 - organization there where's the
19:01 - systematic approach there where is the
19:04 - thought processes in terms of ensuring
19:06 - that by the time they get to high school
19:08 - they're prepared like they are in other
19:10 - subjects and that's why our curriculum
19:13 - is extremely important right so when
19:16 - you're choosing a curriculum you have to
19:18 - think what curriculum prepares students
19:21 - for high school what curriculum takes
19:24 - students from kindergarten and ensures
19:25 - that they're progressing and building on
19:28 - their theoretical knowledge as well as
19:30 - their skill set year after year after
19:32 - year and that's what Code Monkey is
19:34 - doing so when you're thinking about your
19:36 - school or District that in terms of
19:38 - curriculum you have to be thinking how
19:40 - are the students progressing are they
19:42 - going to be ready for ischool and even
19:44 - more so and this may be this could be a
19:47 - school and a district are all the
19:49 - students learning the same thing are you
19:51 - giving them equal opportunity right if
19:54 - you have some students in schools in one
19:56 - area only doing Block Base and other
19:59 - schools doing Tech space the students
20:01 - who are doing text-based coding writing
20:03 - code and learning how to code are going
20:04 - to be way more advanced when you choose
20:07 - a curriculum for your school or for your
20:10 - District you're providing equal
20:11 - opportunity to all schools all students
20:15 - in terms of giving them the proper
20:17 - Computer Science Education
20:20 - and again I'm not I'm not there's we
20:22 - have 10 minutes here so uh I'll get to
20:24 - everything yeah I would be remiss if I
20:27 - talked about curriculum and don't talk
20:28 - about our our courses and and again we
20:31 - we did this
20:32 - so much in in one of them like you could
20:34 - see every one of our courses are our
20:36 - gamified and I I want to be very clear
20:38 - we do not have games Code Monkey is not
20:41 - a game code monkey has courses that are
20:44 - gamified and there's a very big
20:46 - difference there when you play a game
20:48 - you may learn you may not learn when
20:50 - you're doing a course you're learning
20:52 - the gamification in what we are doing is
20:57 - bringing the students in it's engaging
20:58 - them it's created in a way that is so
21:02 - special for them and so easy and
21:03 - intuitive
21:05 - they learn
21:06 - through osmosis they learn through play
21:08 - they learn just by doing and that's a
21:11 - very very unique aspect and I could even
21:13 - push it so far and I don't want to jump
21:15 - into this too much
21:17 - but
21:18 - we ventured this year out of coding we
21:22 - created two digital literacy courses
21:24 - which you can see on a Code Monkey Trial
21:27 - on www.codemonkey.com
21:30 - um
21:31 - digital literacy courses but in the Code
21:34 - Monkey way the pedagogy that we've done
21:36 - and this year after one year became our
21:39 - third most used course out of all of our
21:41 - courses because it was such a needed
21:44 - course but we were able to take that
21:46 - pedagogy this gamification these aspects
21:48 - and apply it to the field of
21:52 - technology digital literacy we have a
21:54 - digital use and a digital citizenship
21:57 - course
21:58 - but we did it in the Code Monkey way and
22:00 - it is unbelievable and we're only
22:01 - building on that and so when we talk
22:03 - about curriculum it's not just about
22:06 - you know systematic curriculum equal
22:08 - opportunity all these things are
22:10 - important it's also important about the
22:11 - individual student how are you
22:13 - supporting all of you became teachers
22:16 - Educators principals superintendents
22:18 - because you care about the large school
22:21 - the district but you also care about the
22:23 - individual student and we talk about
22:25 - Code Monkey being hard for students
22:26 - we've really solved that in in one of
22:29 - the most unbelievable Ed Tech or
22:31 - pedagogical ways that they've been just
22:34 - a couple of more things
22:35 - um that I think are just like good
22:36 - things about Code Monkey not you know I
22:39 - think it applies to the you know the
22:41 - what I'm trying to show is why code
22:42 - monkeys breed for schools and districts
22:44 - it's great for individuals or groups
22:47 - you know whether they're you know
22:48 - they're learning in in school by
22:50 - themselves I remember visiting a
22:51 - district in New Jersey where one student
22:54 - was up to challenge 50 another was up to
22:56 - challenge 20 the student and challenge
22:57 - 50 came up helped the student challenge
22:59 - 20. they can learn by themselves it's
23:02 - all web-based you don't need to download
23:03 - anything so students can even do it at
23:05 - home for homework so it's really great
23:09 - um some other things we have courses
23:11 - that you are learning and courses that
23:14 - you are creating I I won't have time to
23:16 - show that but of course is that I know
23:18 - that that's very important to have
23:21 - um results like okay so they're playing
23:23 - this course but how does that show in in
23:25 - in their actual skill sets so we have
23:27 - courses where they're challenge Builder
23:29 - they're building challenges they're
23:30 - building games they've built a chat bot
23:32 - in Python and so on and so forth so we
23:35 - have everything inclusive I think this
23:37 - is cannot be stressed enough I'm very
23:40 - happy to see sort of nowadays that that
23:43 - edtech companies are are becoming more
23:45 - inclusive adding more tools to be more
23:48 - inclusive of different types of students
23:50 - with different learning challenges and
23:52 - different backgrounds and we have a
23:54 - narration tool we have buttons that you
23:56 - know it's not drag and drop but it
23:58 - writes for the students that have a
23:59 - difficult time with maybe some motor
24:01 - functions and we're constantly trying to
24:03 - get better and better at that and I I
24:04 - don't think obviously I think I on a
24:07 - systematic level that is absolutely
24:09 - significant and we're only trying to do
24:11 - better and the more we partner with
24:13 - districts and schools the better
24:15 - feedback we get and the more we try to
24:17 - improve there
24:18 - thankfully this is not as relevant as it
24:21 - used to be but still relevant uh Code
24:23 - Monkey again you don't need to download
24:25 - anything it's all web-based it's
24:27 - fantastic program in school it's a great
24:30 - program outside or even both so if
24:33 - you're a virtual school or if you have
24:34 - virtual Cloud you know it's it's
24:36 - fantastic
24:37 - um have a few minutes here left
24:40 - this is really important and I think I
24:42 - only have a couple more slides and leave
24:44 - a few minutes for questions
24:46 - so if you're embarking
24:48 - on and I I had a meeting today really
24:51 - just an hour ago with a district of five
24:53 - schools that's really looking at
24:55 - improving their uh computer science
24:57 - program
24:59 - it's not mandatory in the state yet but
25:01 - they understand that it will be in a few
25:02 - years and they want to start
25:03 - implementing so how do you do that how
25:05 - do we do that so maybe there's not
25:07 - funding maybe there's not time you you
25:09 - have tax Schedule so these are the sort
25:11 - of if we if you sort of start with the
25:14 - most intensive and go down these are
25:17 - some of my suggestions so this is very
25:19 - um uh common in middle schools and Code
25:22 - Monkey again is K to eight
25:25 - um so we're in elementary and Road
25:26 - school so
25:27 - some do short rotations of six to eight
25:30 - classes throughout the year so maybe not
25:32 - everyone gets throughout the year but if
25:34 - they do eight classes in in in in eight
25:38 - weeks or whatever that may be that gives
25:40 - them you know a lot of time to use it
25:43 - practice go ahead and really build up
25:45 - their skills so that they can get to the
25:46 - next year that may be too much so maybe
25:49 - once per week 45 minutes to an hour
25:52 - once bi-weekly
25:54 - right that that sometimes we have a
25:57 - district with I think something like 75
25:59 - schools that has an after school in each
26:02 - School using Code Monkey and that's only
26:04 - grown and not only that that is probably
26:06 - going to grow and then that's gonna sort
26:08 - of seep into the weekly schedule where
26:11 - it's not going to be after school but
26:12 - it's going to be offered and then lastly
26:14 - and I see this internationally a lot I I
26:17 - you know uh just a little bit up north
26:19 - in Canada this is how they do it in many
26:21 - of their provinces which they integrate
26:23 - coding into their math every year they
26:27 - have like a a two-month coding
26:30 - um
26:31 - uh subject within their math course and
26:34 - that's when they do it and that these
26:36 - are all different ideas and and myself
26:38 - and whoever would be your rep in your
26:40 - state we would be happy to discuss this
26:42 - with you and more in depth and that's
26:44 - also I I didn't put this in the in the
26:46 - slide but very very important with Code
26:49 - Monkey is that every school and District
26:52 - gets a dedicated customer success
26:55 - manager to help you with this how many
26:58 - times a week do you want to do this
27:00 - um all of that and that's that's really
27:03 - important point about Code Monkey which
27:04 - cannot be stressed our customer success
27:06 - people are there for you to ensure the
27:09 - we have a the the curriculum that you
27:12 - can Implement to be systematic encoding
27:14 - in in your District or school they
27:17 - ensure that that happens and now sort of
27:19 - just the last thing and this is really
27:22 - important I left a few minutes for this
27:24 - is our admin dashboard so sort of to
27:27 - show it you in uh in in real time
27:30 - um let me just go back
27:33 - this is an example of our admin
27:35 - dashboard so
27:37 - there are so many aspects to this
27:40 - what is important for administrator
27:43 - whether of a district or of a school so
27:45 - we talked about teachers students we
27:47 - talked about the inclusivity we talked
27:50 - about the importance of curriculum but
27:52 - now we talk about you and your job and
27:54 - ensuring this a success so first of all
27:56 - I think it's really important
27:59 - we have added as I mentioned like 70 we
28:02 - add hundreds of thousands of students we
28:04 - have ministries of Education around the
28:06 - world using our program we have SSO
28:09 - class link clever Microsoft Google to
28:12 - really eliminate any type of issue when
28:16 - it comes to rostering so first and
28:18 - foremost this District that I just spoke
28:21 - to they use Google easy that's really
28:24 - really important we want to make sure
28:25 - that the rostering capabilities of our
28:27 - districts are and schools super super
28:29 - simple additionally we have a scope and
28:33 - sequence and I'm happy to share that we
28:35 - talk about curriculum we have a scope
28:37 - and sequence we which goes K to eight we
28:40 - can tell you how to implement the
28:41 - computer science program per grade we
28:44 - can really consult with you on how to do
28:46 - that properly we have PD options
28:48 - available which I've mentioned before
28:49 - for your teachers but we also have data
28:52 - we can tell you how many schools you
28:53 - have
28:54 - your classrooms this is just our initial
28:57 - and we're constantly improving this this
28:59 - is your dashboard you can see the total
29:01 - sites on minutes the active students how
29:03 - many solutions were submitted how much
29:05 - progress the active classrooms you have
29:07 - your subscription details then you can
29:09 - go into more you can see your schools
29:11 - you can see the names of your schools
29:12 - how many students per School how many
29:15 - teachers per school where are your
29:17 - teachers what are their functionalities
29:19 - you can see all of the classrooms so we
29:22 - have usage reports which
29:25 - um you could see it generate but that
29:26 - would just take a little bit more time
29:27 - we have proficiency reports to see not
29:30 - just how much they're using it but what
29:32 - are the grades that they're getting and
29:33 - so on and so forth we provide the data
29:36 - so that you as an administrator if you
29:39 - choose to do Code Monkey you can make an
29:42 - informed decision the following year is
29:44 - you know is this a good program are we
29:46 - actually using it are teachers using it
29:48 - and we look at this and we say Okay
29:50 - three months into this hey uh
29:52 - administrator from you know there this
29:55 - school district the flower School
29:56 - District there's flowers right in front
29:58 - of me as an example like
30:00 - we see that you know you you purchased
30:02 - for 10 schools but you've only added
30:04 - four we look at that and share that with
30:06 - you so the data that we provide you
30:08 - allows you to see and make sure that
30:09 - it's going well we allow you to do SSO
30:12 - to roster very very easily you can add
30:15 - teachers add students we're aligned this
30:18 - is really important we're aligned with
30:19 - csda and iste and we're aligned I think
30:22 - very with so many states like roughly 60
30:25 - 70 percent of U.S states we have aligned
30:28 - our curriculum to those specific States
30:31 - so all of that really makes it for the
30:35 - administrator really really important
30:38 - that you have the proper tools to have a
30:41 - successful launch of Code Monkey year
30:44 - after year after year so
30:48 - um
30:50 - the benefits and I always like to say
30:53 - this because I think it's really
30:54 - important and I'm sorry I came a couple
30:56 - minutes over
30:57 - great for students make it easy engaging
31:00 - and fun for our teachers it's intuitive
31:02 - so many resources plenty of help on the
31:05 - platform and for administrators the
31:08 - rostering usage reports the data
31:10 - everything it's web-based the rostering
31:12 - when it comes to your school when it
31:14 - comes to your District
31:15 - we make it really really simple to be
31:19 - able to launch a successful computer
31:21 - science K-8 computer science program and
31:24 - that's what we're trying to do
31:26 - um I would say our Niche is those that
31:29 - have done nothing and those that have
31:31 - done a little bit of something and are
31:32 - making their way want to improve that's
31:34 - those are the districts that we've
31:36 - really helped if your District already
31:37 - using something and it's going great I'm
31:39 - sure we could do well for you and I'm
31:41 - sure that would be still we still be a
31:42 - good program but I don't know if you
31:45 - know maybe it'd be great but it's not
31:47 - going to necessarily solve any of the
31:48 - issues if you have everything in place
31:49 - if you're looking to improve if you're
31:51 - looking to upgrade if you're looking to
31:53 - implement if you're looking to really
31:55 - systematically approach computer science
31:57 - like you do other courses Code Monkey
32:00 - solves all of that I really appreciate
32:02 - your time I would suggest either you as
32:05 - an administrator or your teachers going
32:06 - on Code Monkey and signing up for a
32:08 - teacher trial if you're interested in an
32:10 - actual subscription here's an email that
32:12 - you can do and we're launching as of
32:15 - today a special offer that if you get a
32:18 - PO in if we send you a quote and you get
32:21 - a PO signed and you can also sign our
32:22 - quotes you can get a free subscription
32:24 - for the rest of the year
32:26 - um
32:27 - and then next year you'll start your
32:29 - actual subscription so I want to thank
32:31 - you all I appreciate it when a couple
32:33 - minutes over time uh Tyler thank you for
32:36 - your time
32:37 - and um I'm gonna stop sharing and are
32:42 - there any questions
32:46 - wait a a minute or so if there's any
32:48 - questions
32:52 - not seeing any in the chat here
32:55 - I'll allow these individuals to talk if
32:58 - they do have something
33:00 - see here
33:04 - all right all right well thank you very
33:07 - much everyone Tyler again thank you for
33:09 - everyone who who came on
33:11 - um we'll put these recordings all on our
33:14 - webinar page which we will send out to
33:16 - you guys in the next week thank you so
33:18 - much for your time have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone my name is uh Zach izakow I am the VP of sales at code monkey before I get started here just going to share my screen uh Tyler we can you can see my screen yes I can okay so welcome everyone uh this webinar it's a half hour webinar we'll get you out at uh 3 P.M Eastern Standard Time or wherever else you may be in the United States um we are on our third webinar the final uh series we've done a couple of them which I'll discuss in a second this one is specifically Code Monkey for schools and districts uh so welcome everyone we're really excited about this we've had a couple good webinars and now we're on our third and final one at least for these uh these these short webinars just to introduce myself again uh I'm Zach uh VP of sales at Code Monkey been working here for a number of years started to hear I think this will be my sixth theoret Code Monkey really looking forward to uh um presenting all of you uh specifically on this topic and then I'll let my colleague introduce himself as well Tyler maybe you gotta unmute yourself yep that's what you have to do so my name is um I've been with Code Monkey for several years now I'm a regional sales manager um just here to assist Zach there's any q a we'd love uh if you guys have any questions feel free to let us know and I'm looking forward to the presentation side Perfect all right so uh just so everyone should know if you have any questions you can always write on the um the the chat or the I'm pretty sure the Q a and Tyler will answer uh through writing and then maybe we'll deal if there's time for questions at the end um we'll do that so here's the uh the agenda for today so we're going to be looking at um what do we do the past webinars Tyler gave the one previously and then the one before that was given by by Molly then we're gonna figure out why why is coding in schools and I guess in districts hard how does coder monkeys support teachers our curriculum the weekly schedule and the admin dashboard um the focus of this particular webinar if I had to give it a slogan or a line is how to systematically implement a k to eight computer science program so whether you're a small school a large school a small District a large District or anything in between We Believe at code monkey and I'm sure many of you those of you who are joining in around the United States believe that computer science coding and I'll use those two words interchangeably believe that computer science should be taught as a subject just like you would be teaching any other topic whether it is English language math science history geography so on and so forth the way that coding has been done I would say in the last five six years has been done more sporadically you'll have a teacher here use this program another teacher there this and it's sort of been great as the computer science education has developed and improved throughout the United States it's very important additionally that now that we're growing in this space that we become a little bit more organized we come a little bit more systematic and do it in a way that really suits the needs of an institution because now are the teachers on the ground as well as those who are leading whether principals or superintendents or directors of curriculum they're also looking they're also looking at computer science in that way and that's what I want to show you how Code Monkey does that as well so before going into it before going into it what is Code Monkey so first and foremost Code Monkey is a leading coding program for students I personally like to use the term curriculum uh where a curriculum for kids all over the world um just a little couple things over here were made with schools and teachers in mind standards aligned um curriculum as well as a full K curriculum and the no prior coding experience needed to teach these are sort of like our four main added values pieces over here um and the idea there is we're going to show you how code monkey and these four specific aspects really impacts and allows you as a school or District to implement computer science in a real organized and systematic way so why is coding schools in heart what's Difficult about it why can't we just begin it why is it taking schools and districts years to properly implement the program and I would say the number one issue which in my time here at code monkey and I'm sure Tyler would say the same um and many of you is that there's a lack of teachers and I always joke you know computer science is a fouryear degree in University or if you're doing now boot camps or anything like that it's like 10 months intensive fulltime so teachers who are trained in history Math Science and all of the other subjects who are now being required to teach computer science we're asking really such a challenging thing for teachers to do and I've seen this teachers on the ground it doesn't matter if they're first starting or they've been teaching for 40 years they're all in the same place to ask teachers to learn not just to be able to teach a new topic but to learn an entire University degree is an extremely challenging task for schools all over the globe and that's very that's something which we see day in and day out and something which Tyler in his in his previous webinar really focused which we're not going to do today we'll talk about it a bit but a major Focus was on the teacher platform um and we'll send out that webinar as well will be on our website and you'll be able to access it next is timing in the weekly schedule there are states and meaning I don't know where everyone is from here today but there are states that are now for example in New York requiring that students learn K12 computer science but if it's not a requirement or even if it's something new where do you find time in the weekly schedule to do it so then let's see if you find teachers or you find timing which curriculum there's Code Monkey there's this there's that there's what the standards are there's so much and how do you choose which is the right one and then what I always like to talk about and I think it's something really important I think it's something that we always have to keep in mind because as Educators and I spent you know roughly 10 years in the classroom we have to think of the students we really have to think of the students and and if there's one thing that I can say absolutely about Code Monkey is they are we are student focused from the getgo meaning that we started off with a gamebased computer science course now we're a full curriculum which I'll talk about but that's really where we Thrive and that's really what we try to do is solve that last part that's what we tried to solve first is coding's hard how do we get students to learn okay we created Code Monkey it doesn't seem so hard for students anymore with our program so now again you uh Tyler went a lot more in depth in the previous uh webinar but this is a major aspect when we're talking about how do we get um teachers how do we Implement a computer science program in a really organized way it really focuses and starts and ends with the teachers those are on the ground those are in front of the students and what we have done at Code Monkey is unbelievable we have created a platform a user experience for teachers despite their backgrounds we have have had teachers who are computer science experts they're teaching hundreds and hundreds of students within the district and we have some teachers who've never even thought about coding before and have started teaching it and have done so successfully and we have an entire dashboard again which I'm not going to focus on very much but again you could see the recording they're very short webinars 30 minutes we have lesson plans video tutorials we have everything technology wise and I'll show you here just a little bit this is our teacher dashboard we have all the lesson plans we have solutions to every single challenge that we have in each of our course we have video tutorials um in terms of the actual functionality we um have the ability to easily add classes to get into classes to see um where students are limit progress we have um answers also over here if I click over here it'll take me to a threestar solution which gives me the actual answer we have quizzes proficiency reports automated grading again not gonna go too much into it but what we have done is we have seriously focused after we we created our first few courses we realized okay we we've created something really great for students um and again in our I'm not going through our courses or showing that because in our first session with Molly um we went all into our courses and again that will be on our website and we'll share that afterwards um but what we have done here is on the tech side of it the technology we have automated everything from grading to videos to quizzes everything we've automated so that the teacher does not have to focus on the technology we realized very early on that if we can get the tech side of it to be automated now let's try to focus on the pedagogy and ensure that our teachers who despite the record know how to teach and so we created lesson plans video tutorials um little little short videos everything in order to help the teacher but more than that if I would continue the lack of teachers very much leads into professional development and Code Monkey is has created a professional development plan which we have we've suggested various types of um professional development options it could be webinars it could be short 45 minute PE sessions through the year you know the more focused one is um the the most focused one is maybe heavy PD in the summer which we know a lot of schools and districts do a lot of times I even suggest don't do any PD in your first year take the take the curriculum use it get re get ready for it learn how it goes and then after that in your next year when you realize when everyone understands the technology whenever anyone's on board or when you've done all that work then you can focus on PD additionally in a regular Code Monkey subscription there's already PD um Tyler showed this in the last one but if I go over here there's an asynchronous um asynchronous uh recording of a introduction to text based computer science which I'll talk about we have an entire page dedicated to webinars which all of our webinars as you can see will be posted up there and so on and so forth talking about technology maybe pedagogical so just built within our Code Monkey subscription you already have professional development options and it's so easy for teachers it really really is so when we're talking about how can we Implement a districtwide or schoolwide computer science curriculum program however you want to define it you need to think of the teachers in Code Monkey very very early on like seven eight years ago has already started focusing on how we can make this best for every single teacher now I have to go into the curriculum now I mentioned how do you well when the hard things was how do we choose the curriculum and all that but I would even step take a step back and tell you that many of your teachers on the ground and a lot of you know this there's a lot of computer science coding programs curriculum maybe there are Hardware software a mix of everything and the question which you have to think about is what is an activity what is a program and what is a curriculum a connectivity or a program I would say is what's been happening the past few years teacher finds something that they really like they think it would be engaging to the kids so they bring it into the classroom and they use it twice in the year great check mark you've done coding that's not how we learn that's maybe how you get kids excited and I'm not downplaying those programs activities at all in fact there are many schools and districts that use Code Monkey as well as other maybe Hardware activities which are once or twice that they can pull it out um every single time maybe that there is a a extra time during the day or anything but curriculum that's the term that's the language we want to use when it comes to computer science we don't want to use activity we don't want to use program just like when we're talking about English or Spanish or math we use curriculum and what I'm showing you here just a couple of awards that we have won across the globe and I don't say this as like an ego boost to Code Monkey even though it sort of is I say that because the experts in computer science around the world have recognized Code Monkey as a leading computer science curriculum globally and that is really important it's very important because I've been I mean I'll be at iste and I hope everyone here if you're going to iste in Philadelphia in a few weeks you'll join us uh you'll come to our booth and I see when the when those who have learned computer science they see it and they instantly realize wow this is something unique this is something special this is something different and I'll explain why we're a full K8 curriculum we go all the way from kindergarten with pretty simple easy to use courses all the way up to python courses which are quite difficult and this is a major difference in terms of what we are doing at code monkey versus what's happening maybe with some other programs and again no idea to compare contrast just trying to talk about the value of Code Monkey when you're looking at your curriculum for your school or District what's happening and I I don't know everyone's background here so I'm going to assume it's a little bit more that you would unknow what block based coding is I would say roughly between 90 to 95 of computer science maybe curriculum program activities whatever you want to say for the K to six is block based meaning it's the drag and dropping of code that's really really important there's no doubt about that but the question is until when do you do block based coding so Code Monkey meaning if I go to our courses you can see on our on our platform we have block based coding we have block based coding novice beginner but then you'll see that it's textbased coding and what does that look like so again not to delve into it because we've already done this but just to show you if I were to go and this is our courses and I'll get into sort of the students oh this is not a good example sorry let's just uh pick you over here the students over here they're writing a loop so let's say if they're writing over here um Step 13 turn right what you see is students are actually writing code as opposed to block based coding and that's really significant in terms of what we are doing and this is why it's really important I read today just as an example um csta and co.org they launch a every year a a yearly um CS overview of all of the United States and I I read today specifically like in terms of Connecticut five percent of high school students in Connecticut take computer science courses and the reason is because not enough students are probably doing it in elementary school but more than that even if they are doing in the middle in elementary middle school what are they doing if they're doing block based coding courses when they get to high school and they have to take AP Computer Science courses or maybe not even AP but regular computer science courses they're really really behind because the best example I always like to give is it's like you're teaching a language English Spanish whatever it may be if you took kindergarten in grade 8 and you only taught students grammar and then you get into ninth grade and you say go write an essay right um you say go write an essay they'll be like we've never written an essay we just learned about essays we learned grammar we learned exclamation points and verb but all of that but if they've never written then they're gonna have a very hard time in high school writing an essay and that's very much our belief in Code Monkey we want to make sure students are progressing year after year after year just like they are doing with other subjects math science again I'll sort of stress that that's extremely important to us we do not want to continue our students on block based coding when they're in Middle School right if they're doing that that's great but then the idea it's not great it's it's good that they're doing that as opposed to nothing but then where's the organization there where's the systematic approach there where is the thought processes in terms of ensuring that by the time they get to high school they're prepared like they are in other subjects and that's why our curriculum is extremely important right so when you're choosing a curriculum you have to think what curriculum prepares students for high school what curriculum takes students from kindergarten and ensures that they're progressing and building on their theoretical knowledge as well as their skill set year after year after year and that's what Code Monkey is doing so when you're thinking about your school or District that in terms of curriculum you have to be thinking how are the students progressing are they going to be ready for ischool and even more so and this may be this could be a school and a district are all the students learning the same thing are you giving them equal opportunity right if you have some students in schools in one area only doing Block Base and other schools doing Tech space the students who are doing textbased coding writing code and learning how to code are going to be way more advanced when you choose a curriculum for your school or for your District you're providing equal opportunity to all schools all students in terms of giving them the proper Computer Science Education and again I'm not I'm not there's we have 10 minutes here so uh I'll get to everything yeah I would be remiss if I talked about curriculum and don't talk about our our courses and and again we we did this so much in in one of them like you could see every one of our courses are our gamified and I I want to be very clear we do not have games Code Monkey is not a game code monkey has courses that are gamified and there's a very big difference there when you play a game you may learn you may not learn when you're doing a course you're learning the gamification in what we are doing is bringing the students in it's engaging them it's created in a way that is so special for them and so easy and intuitive they learn through osmosis they learn through play they learn just by doing and that's a very very unique aspect and I could even push it so far and I don't want to jump into this too much but we ventured this year out of coding we created two digital literacy courses which you can see on a Code Monkey Trial on www.codemonkey.com um digital literacy courses but in the Code Monkey way the pedagogy that we've done and this year after one year became our third most used course out of all of our courses because it was such a needed course but we were able to take that pedagogy this gamification these aspects and apply it to the field of technology digital literacy we have a digital use and a digital citizenship course but we did it in the Code Monkey way and it is unbelievable and we're only building on that and so when we talk about curriculum it's not just about you know systematic curriculum equal opportunity all these things are important it's also important about the individual student how are you supporting all of you became teachers Educators principals superintendents because you care about the large school the district but you also care about the individual student and we talk about Code Monkey being hard for students we've really solved that in in one of the most unbelievable Ed Tech or pedagogical ways that they've been just a couple of more things um that I think are just like good things about Code Monkey not you know I think it applies to the you know the what I'm trying to show is why code monkeys breed for schools and districts it's great for individuals or groups you know whether they're you know they're learning in in school by themselves I remember visiting a district in New Jersey where one student was up to challenge 50 another was up to challenge 20 the student and challenge 50 came up helped the student challenge 20. they can learn by themselves it's all webbased you don't need to download anything so students can even do it at home for homework so it's really great um some other things we have courses that you are learning and courses that you are creating I I won't have time to show that but of course is that I know that that's very important to have um results like okay so they're playing this course but how does that show in in in their actual skill sets so we have courses where they're challenge Builder they're building challenges they're building games they've built a chat bot in Python and so on and so forth so we have everything inclusive I think this is cannot be stressed enough I'm very happy to see sort of nowadays that that edtech companies are are becoming more inclusive adding more tools to be more inclusive of different types of students with different learning challenges and different backgrounds and we have a narration tool we have buttons that you know it's not drag and drop but it writes for the students that have a difficult time with maybe some motor functions and we're constantly trying to get better and better at that and I I don't think obviously I think I on a systematic level that is absolutely significant and we're only trying to do better and the more we partner with districts and schools the better feedback we get and the more we try to improve there thankfully this is not as relevant as it used to be but still relevant uh Code Monkey again you don't need to download anything it's all webbased it's fantastic program in school it's a great program outside or even both so if you're a virtual school or if you have virtual Cloud you know it's it's fantastic um have a few minutes here left this is really important and I think I only have a couple more slides and leave a few minutes for questions so if you're embarking on and I I had a meeting today really just an hour ago with a district of five schools that's really looking at improving their uh computer science program it's not mandatory in the state yet but they understand that it will be in a few years and they want to start implementing so how do you do that how do we do that so maybe there's not funding maybe there's not time you you have tax Schedule so these are the sort of if we if you sort of start with the most intensive and go down these are some of my suggestions so this is very um uh common in middle schools and Code Monkey again is K to eight um so we're in elementary and Road school so some do short rotations of six to eight classes throughout the year so maybe not everyone gets throughout the year but if they do eight classes in in in in eight weeks or whatever that may be that gives them you know a lot of time to use it practice go ahead and really build up their skills so that they can get to the next year that may be too much so maybe once per week 45 minutes to an hour once biweekly right that that sometimes we have a district with I think something like 75 schools that has an after school in each School using Code Monkey and that's only grown and not only that that is probably going to grow and then that's gonna sort of seep into the weekly schedule where it's not going to be after school but it's going to be offered and then lastly and I see this internationally a lot I I you know uh just a little bit up north in Canada this is how they do it in many of their provinces which they integrate coding into their math every year they have like a a twomonth coding um uh subject within their math course and that's when they do it and that these are all different ideas and and myself and whoever would be your rep in your state we would be happy to discuss this with you and more in depth and that's also I I didn't put this in the in the slide but very very important with Code Monkey is that every school and District gets a dedicated customer success manager to help you with this how many times a week do you want to do this um all of that and that's that's really important point about Code Monkey which cannot be stressed our customer success people are there for you to ensure the we have a the the curriculum that you can Implement to be systematic encoding in in your District or school they ensure that that happens and now sort of just the last thing and this is really important I left a few minutes for this is our admin dashboard so sort of to show it you in uh in in real time um let me just go back this is an example of our admin dashboard so there are so many aspects to this what is important for administrator whether of a district or of a school so we talked about teachers students we talked about the inclusivity we talked about the importance of curriculum but now we talk about you and your job and ensuring this a success so first of all I think it's really important we have added as I mentioned like 70 we add hundreds of thousands of students we have ministries of Education around the world using our program we have SSO class link clever Microsoft Google to really eliminate any type of issue when it comes to rostering so first and foremost this District that I just spoke to they use Google easy that's really really important we want to make sure that the rostering capabilities of our districts are and schools super super simple additionally we have a scope and sequence and I'm happy to share that we talk about curriculum we have a scope and sequence we which goes K to eight we can tell you how to implement the computer science program per grade we can really consult with you on how to do that properly we have PD options available which I've mentioned before for your teachers but we also have data we can tell you how many schools you have your classrooms this is just our initial and we're constantly improving this this is your dashboard you can see the total sites on minutes the active students how many solutions were submitted how much progress the active classrooms you have your subscription details then you can go into more you can see your schools you can see the names of your schools how many students per School how many teachers per school where are your teachers what are their functionalities you can see all of the classrooms so we have usage reports which um you could see it generate but that would just take a little bit more time we have proficiency reports to see not just how much they're using it but what are the grades that they're getting and so on and so forth we provide the data so that you as an administrator if you choose to do Code Monkey you can make an informed decision the following year is you know is this a good program are we actually using it are teachers using it and we look at this and we say Okay three months into this hey uh administrator from you know there this school district the flower School District there's flowers right in front of me as an example like we see that you know you you purchased for 10 schools but you've only added four we look at that and share that with you so the data that we provide you allows you to see and make sure that it's going well we allow you to do SSO to roster very very easily you can add teachers add students we're aligned this is really important we're aligned with csda and iste and we're aligned I think very with so many states like roughly 60 70 percent of U.S states we have aligned our curriculum to those specific States so all of that really makes it for the administrator really really important that you have the proper tools to have a successful launch of Code Monkey year after year after year so um the benefits and I always like to say this because I think it's really important and I'm sorry I came a couple minutes over great for students make it easy engaging and fun for our teachers it's intuitive so many resources plenty of help on the platform and for administrators the rostering usage reports the data everything it's webbased the rostering when it comes to your school when it comes to your District we make it really really simple to be able to launch a successful computer science K8 computer science program and that's what we're trying to do um I would say our Niche is those that have done nothing and those that have done a little bit of something and are making their way want to improve that's those are the districts that we've really helped if your District already using something and it's going great I'm sure we could do well for you and I'm sure that would be still we still be a good program but I don't know if you know maybe it'd be great but it's not going to necessarily solve any of the issues if you have everything in place if you're looking to improve if you're looking to upgrade if you're looking to implement if you're looking to really systematically approach computer science like you do other courses Code Monkey solves all of that I really appreciate your time I would suggest either you as an administrator or your teachers going on Code Monkey and signing up for a teacher trial if you're interested in an actual subscription here's an email that you can do and we're launching as of today a special offer that if you get a PO in if we send you a quote and you get a PO signed and you can also sign our quotes you can get a free subscription for the rest of the year um and then next year you'll start your actual subscription so I want to thank you all I appreciate it when a couple minutes over time uh Tyler thank you for your time and um I'm gonna stop sharing and are there any questions wait a a minute or so if there's any questions not seeing any in the chat here I'll allow these individuals to talk if they do have something see here all right all right well thank you very much everyone Tyler again thank you for everyone who who came on um we'll put these recordings all on our webinar page which we will send out to you guys in the next week thank you so much for your time have a great day
