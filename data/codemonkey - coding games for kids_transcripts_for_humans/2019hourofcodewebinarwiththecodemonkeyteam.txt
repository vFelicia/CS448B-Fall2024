00:09 - all righty welcome everyone to the hour
00:14 - of code our 2019 hour of code with code
00:16 - monkey we thank you for joining us I
00:20 - know we have some people from kind of
00:23 - all over Mountain Time and East Coaster
00:25 - hi Michael how's it going and some of

00:44 - I'm the professional development manager
00:45 - here at code monkey I have a former
00:51 - teacher I taught in the classroom for
00:53 - just about around 10 years and spent
00:55 - some time in my even when I was in high
00:57 - school going into the classroom and kind
00:58 - of learning from there I've been with
01:00 - code monkey for about two years now
01:01 - helps leaving the professional
01:03 - development you can reach me here via
01:06 - email or you can reach out to me on
01:07 - Twitter at Lena at code my everyone as

01:21 - ecwid lucky I've been in that role for
01:24 - about past four months it's an awesome
01:27 - team basically my role here is to help
01:29 - you any questions throughout the school
01:32 - year whether it's based on the platform
01:35 - or the setup or anything in that room
01:39 - prior to joining code lucky I was also a
01:41 - teacher myself for about 16 years and I
01:45 - do remember this hour of code week being
01:47 - the most exciting time I said if you're
01:50 - new to this I would add your kids are
01:53 - gonna love it and for those of you that
01:54 - have done this before just remember you
01:56 - could always use this as a way to sort
01:58 - of we Kendall that fire when it comes to
02:00 - coding so thanks Lena thanks mark hi
02:07 - everyone I'm Brett s Wilson I'm the VP
02:10 - of Sales here at code monkey and so my
02:13 - main role is to help schools and
02:15 - teachers learn about code monkey find
02:19 - out how they can implement it in their
02:21 - classrooms to help students
02:23 - ultimately just make the teachers lives
02:27 - easier with one less thing on their
02:29 - plate
02:30 - by utilizing code monkey and so I've
02:33 - been in EdTech for quite a while working
02:35 - with several different companies and
02:37 - ultimately I'm very passionate about
02:40 - bringing technology to the classroom to
02:43 - make things easier on teachers and then
02:46 - allow students better ways to learn
02:50 - thanks everybody
02:56 - I'm J Bloodworth I'm the curriculum
02:57 - developer here at code monkey like most
03:01 - people I have a background in teaching I
03:02 - taught math for 20 years although my
03:04 - degrees actually computer science and so
03:07 - now I'm writing computer science
03:09 - curriculum here at code monkey so I'm
03:12 - mostly behind the scenes but you know
03:13 - I'm a poke my head in some these
03:15 - webinars now and then to contribute what
03:17 - I can I want to really echo what Mark
03:20 - said when I was at the classroom power
03:23 - of code and computer science education
03:24 - week was my favorite time of the year so
03:26 - I think your students enjoy it let them
03:29 - enjoy it and enjoy it yourself it's a
03:31 - good time awesome
03:34 - well that's our team so we want to just
03:38 - thank you again for joining us for our
03:40 - 2019 hour of code webinar we know that
03:43 - there are is a vast majority of choices
03:46 - that you have for hour of code week and
03:48 - I share the sentiment with the rest of
03:50 - our team that that was always my
03:51 - favorite time and I even started doing
03:54 - our code week back in 2012 even before
03:56 - it was officially the code org adoption
03:59 - of our of code but if you have any
04:02 - questions during today's session please
04:04 - send them in the Q&A or in the chat box
04:07 - along the side also please tweet at us
04:10 - using hashtag code monkey you'll see it
04:12 - along the bottom of everything and then
04:14 - always remember to write code catch
04:17 - bananas and save the world and I will
04:18 - tell you that after today's webinar
04:21 - there will be a survey that will pop up
04:24 - at the end and it will be your
04:25 - professional development certificate for
04:27 - today so thank you so you can see you
04:30 - can follow us here on twitter facebook
04:31 - instagram and/or follow us along on our
04:34 - blog
04:35 - so today's web
04:36 - our objectives are to discuss code
04:39 - monkeys story what is the hour of code
04:41 - where to find us some of the courses
04:44 - that we offer and then setting up for
04:46 - the hour of code the requirements and
04:48 - kind of going through all of that kind
04:50 - of stuff and then exploring courses and
04:51 - then we always leave time for you at the
04:53 - end for QA there is nothing more
04:56 - powerful than your questions so if you
04:57 - have any during this time please ask it
05:00 - and we'll do our best to answer you so
05:03 - we always like to start off talking
05:05 - about what code monkey is and kind of
05:11 - the story behind code monkey oops excuse
05:13 - me so code monkey was founded in 2014
05:16 - there's actually a tea there are two
05:19 - brothers and their best friend they
05:21 - founded code monkey after they went in
05:24 - and they were volunteering their time
05:25 - working with students and found that
05:26 - students just really didn't love
05:29 - learning the traditional coding I mean
05:31 - so when they started to animate it and
05:33 - bring code monkey and that's they found
05:36 - that students just love the coding
05:37 - concepts much more when it was gamified
05:39 - and fun and who doesn't love our monkey
05:42 - so that's kind of how code monkey was
05:43 - born so today code monkey is a very fun
05:47 - and engaging and we program in a few
05:48 - different languages now and our company
05:50 - has been growing so we're happy to have
05:52 - you alongside us
05:54 - so what really makes code monkey
05:56 - different than other programs or
05:58 - platforms kind of that you use code
06:01 - monkey is a is intuitive it's very
06:06 - gamified even from the very beginning
06:08 - it's a very user friendly and really
06:11 - we're designed to put you the teacher
06:13 - and the driver seats are really giving
06:14 - you the tools that you need to really
06:16 - become successful when teaching with
06:18 - code monkey and it's also very easy to
06:20 - roll out
06:24 - right so what is the hour of code
06:26 - obviously you hour of codes been around
06:29 - for quite some time and it's just
06:31 - growing every single year and the course
06:33 - availability options are just growing
06:35 - but hour of code is really not designed
06:38 - to be a computer science course it's not
06:40 - designed to teach the students at full
06:43 - fundamentals they're not coming in the
06:44 - hour of code week and walking out being
06:46 - developers ready for Google it's really
06:48 - just designed to give students the
06:49 - opportunity to get basically a taste of
06:52 - what computer science it's kind of like
06:54 - the first time you try ice cream it's so
06:56 - delicious you can't stop and you keep
06:58 - going back for more and so that's really
06:59 - what does that live code monkey I mean
07:01 - what the hour of code week is really for
07:03 - Bob obviously you know that the
07:06 - landscape of the job market scene for
07:09 - students is vastly changing it's very
07:11 - different from when I was a kid when
07:12 - really we only knew about you know a few
07:15 - different opportunities and we know that
07:16 - the jobs half the jobs that our students
07:18 - have will have access to aren't even
07:19 - invented yet
07:21 - but there are about 500,000 openings
07:23 - throughout the country for computer jobs
07:26 - I live here in Austin and the texting
07:28 - every single day you see is growing more
07:30 - companies are bringing their companies
07:33 - actually to the city landscape and that
07:34 - means there's more jobs for students and
07:36 - more opportunity for them so it's just a
07:39 - and I believe it's a very timeless skill
07:42 - set so
07:45 - we offer many different courses for hour
07:49 - of code week our newest one is code
07:51 - monkey jr. it is a peso just kind of
07:54 - keep that in mind we have our coding
07:56 - adventure our dota does math course game
07:59 - builder and our brand-new banana Tales
08:01 - Python course our trivia choppa which is
08:03 - also Python and then our moon lander
08:05 - course so I'm gonna talk a little bit
08:07 - about kind of where those are and kind
08:09 - of what they are but first let's discuss
08:10 - how do we even find these hour of code
08:14 - courses for hour of code you don't need
08:16 - a student login you don't have to have a
08:18 - subscription it's just really a place
08:20 - for you to try out code monkey with your
08:22 - students so how do you even get there
08:24 - you can find us on the co.org web page
08:27 - and I don't know if you guys know this
08:29 - or not the code org used to be used to
08:32 - be code org slash learn and now there is
08:35 - actually an hour of code page so I'll
08:37 - kind of show you where that is here in
08:39 - just a moment but when you get there to
08:41 - the course you select the activities and
08:43 - you just select the created by code
08:46 - monkey studios and then there is a
08:48 - beginner and a comfortable and that's
08:50 - with all the course options that are
08:51 - available not only that but we do have a
08:54 - specific page for code monkey to find us
08:56 - so you can go to code monkey comm slash
08:58 - hour of code and that's how you get
09:01 - there but let me just show you a little
09:02 - bit how you get there so here I am on
09:04 - the hour of code page you can see us as
09:08 - hour of code comm which is great you
09:09 - click on activities and then you can
09:11 - select the creative by section and so
09:13 - when you select created by we click on
09:15 - code monkey studios we can see our
09:18 - courses that are available
09:20 - like I said code monkey junior is great
09:22 - the pre readers love it but it is an app
09:25 - it is an app so just kind of keeping
09:28 - that in mind and then our banana tails
09:30 - is beginner I suggest it mostly for the
09:32 - later grades but why not have them try
09:34 - it during this time and then coding
09:36 - adventure and then like I said in the
09:38 - comfortable section are our other
09:39 - courses it's either that or you can go
09:42 - to the code monkey hour of code course
09:43 - page and you'll see the different
09:45 - courses here as well as suggested ages
09:47 - so just something to kind of keep in
09:50 - mind
09:52 - so how do the courses work and where
09:54 - should I use them with my students well
09:55 - code monkey jr. is really designed for
09:57 - that pre-k early reader up to like first
10:00 - grade age the doted as math courses kind
10:03 - of works through the distances angle
10:06 - measurement and multiplication so that's
10:07 - really meant for a second through fifth
10:09 - graders as well as the coding adventure
10:11 - course both doted as math and coding
10:14 - adventure on a language called
10:15 - CoffeeScript and CoffeeScript is a real
10:17 - recognized language but it is a shorter
10:20 - version of JavaScript and Python without
10:21 - all the heavy syntax our banana tales
10:24 - course says second through eighth grade
10:28 - here I would suggest using it with like
10:29 - a little bit of the older grades unless
10:31 - you feel like they're super confident in
10:32 - the Python but why not try it and then
10:37 - the game builder course where they work
10:40 - through the game game mechanics working
10:44 - through a Super Mario style game and
10:46 - then our trivia chat pod is full Python
10:47 - working through a game basically it's a
10:50 - game of hangman which we don't call it
10:52 - hangman anymore we call it snowman so
10:54 - it's building that trivia game out and
10:56 - then a moon lander is a physics based
10:58 - course it's really great even for like
11:00 - the high schoolers the monkey has to you
11:03 - learn how to land a moon lander on the
11:05 - launching pad working with thrust and
11:07 - really interworking the very a lot of
11:11 - science ii topics throughout there
11:16 - so before we get into the courses what
11:18 - should i prepare for the hour of code so
11:20 - I think of myself always thinking like
11:22 - I'm always very prepared for the
11:24 - situation I think about I'm just working
11:26 - one to one of my students are super calm
11:28 - but actually what happens during the
11:30 - hour of code week as you know oftentimes
11:32 - the websites crash or you know I may not
11:34 - have everything prepped the way that I
11:36 - thought I would have everything prepped
11:37 - and I often feel like I'm fighting off
11:40 - dinosaurs like you like you are here
11:42 - like this picture here on the bottom so
11:44 - it's really great and highly suggested
11:47 - an island that's a hard way myself the
11:49 - first year when I watch it with 500 kids
11:50 - and I thought oh this is just gonna work
11:52 - seamlessly the website went down like
11:54 - all kinds of things happen so it's
11:56 - always good to make sure that you're
11:57 - testing out the specs before you are
12:00 - launching it you just really want a
12:01 - seamless transition you also want the
12:03 - kids have as much
12:04 - possible coding to really get that
12:06 - excitement so just something to kind of
12:08 - keep in mind with all of our hour of
12:11 - code courses we do have teacher notes so
12:14 - when you select a course any of our
12:17 - courses here we do have the teacher
12:19 - notes and when you go to the teacher
12:21 - notes you just kind of scroll down here
12:22 - at the bottom you can access the notes
12:24 - just keep in mind all of our courses are
12:25 - also standards aligned to CS ta and
12:27 - several other several other alignment so
12:30 - you can check that out too if that's
12:32 - something that's necessary for you
12:33 - within the teacher notes are the specs
12:35 - so it tells you the suggested ages if
12:38 - it's web base if you need to install
12:40 - anything all the courses except for code
12:43 - monkey junior do not need to do like any
12:45 - kind of installation or anything like
12:47 - that highly suggest to do headphones
12:49 - because there's some fun sounds and
12:51 - things like that and then just always
12:53 - making sure that it does work with your
12:54 - most updated version of your web browser
12:58 - so that's always an important thing I
12:59 - know that sometimes seems like it's easy
13:02 - to do it and then it will tell you kind
13:03 - of a little bit about it like how how
13:07 - long it is how many levels what kinds of
13:09 - things what can you kind of expect the
13:10 - prep there's also student certificates
13:13 - so I suggest printing these out because
13:15 - the hour of code is a really great way
13:17 - to tie in all your parent volunteers
13:19 - stakeholders the more the merrier to
13:21 - kind of help you have all hands on deck
13:24 - and this is really the best way to
13:25 - really integrate that community in with
13:27 - your classroom okay so now that we have
13:34 - kind of explored that part of it I know
13:37 - that it's always like a little bit fast
13:39 - and serious does anyone have any now's
13:42 - the time to ask any questions if you
13:44 - have anything about like tag get set up
13:46 - or the our code or anything like that
13:49 - [Music]
13:50 - okay
13:52 - great if not feel free to ask my team
13:55 - they're here for your help okay
14:01 - and the code monkey certificates are
14:04 - really great for student portfolios and
14:07 - all that kind of thing as well so I
14:08 - always suggest printing those out also
14:10 - parents love certificates right as much
14:12 - as the kids do so why not award them for
14:15 - all the hard work that they've done okay
14:19 - so we're gonna talk about a few of the
14:21 - courses not all of the courses we don't
14:22 - have time to explore every single course
14:24 - but I suggest that you kind of check
14:26 - them out but we're gonna go over some of
14:27 - them so our coding adventure course like
14:29 - I said for the hour of code you don't
14:31 - need to do anything logging in you can
14:33 - create a teacher trial it's 30 days 30
14:35 - students you have the ability to track
14:37 - all the students progress and see all
14:39 - the lesson plans and all the stuff that
14:40 - kind of goes with that I kind of make it
14:42 - a little bit longer for your students
14:43 - but you can just click right here on the
14:46 - start playing code monkey starts out
14:49 - with a trailer basically gorilla comes
14:51 - and steals his bananas and he gets sad
14:53 - and then he gets mad and he's ready to
14:55 - go how code monkey is set up let me turn
14:59 - down the sound I never know if you guys
15:01 - can hear the sound but just turn off the
15:05 - sound for the sake of this so just some
15:07 - kind of things to note this the text
15:09 - editor is on the right the stage is on
15:10 - the left the monkey is here and these
15:12 - buttons type out for the students it's
15:14 - not a drag-and-drop it just is really
15:16 - easy for them to not get so tied down
15:18 - with spelling or anything like that
15:20 - and then we can pick up the ruler and
15:22 - kind of measure the distance so I'm
15:23 - gonna pull up the story map here so the
15:26 - students work linearly through the
15:28 - coding concepts so if if for some reason
15:33 - I was doing an hour code in a school and
15:34 - something happened with their their
15:36 - internet if a student gets exited out of
15:39 - this just know that they do have to
15:40 - start from the beginning when playing
15:42 - the hour of code version this happens
15:44 - with a lot of websites that we we are
15:46 - not saving their progress except well
15:48 - for while they're in it so basically we
15:51 - go through and we click run here and it
15:55 - will oh shoot
16:02 - so sorry I just realized that my screen
16:04 - was frozen so let me retrain what I was
16:11 - talking about so so sorry guys sometimes
16:14 - you forget you know okay so what I was
16:18 - saying here is that you is that when you
16:22 - click on the course here you can just
16:25 - start logging in and playing right here
16:27 - from the very beginning so here we are
16:28 - in the code monkey platform and the
16:30 - there's a quick trailer that will kind
16:33 - of show which is what I discuss which
16:34 - sorry that I miss that was stuck on the
16:37 - other screen sometimes happens but what
16:40 - you can see here is that we have the
16:41 - ruler we can pick up the ruler these
16:43 - buttons type out for students like I
16:45 - said before so I'm just gonna run this
16:47 - one it's very scaffolded at the
16:49 - beginning and just really kind of like a
16:52 - clickbait like really getting them
16:53 - excited and excited about what they can
16:55 - experience here so it's really designed
16:59 - to start off easier so that it can
17:01 - present more challenge kind of as they
17:03 - go through and they're getting more
17:04 - confidence as they're going through so
17:05 - here we see there's some tips and tricks
17:08 - kind of along the bottom Gordo is our
17:10 - teacher assistant oh sorry excuse me so
17:12 - he pops up with any directions he's
17:14 - always hanging out here there is a
17:15 - narration feature and there's also
17:17 - different languages if you need to have
17:18 - that as well that you can kind of change
17:21 - that but let's say that I type this out
17:23 - here and I'm maybe learning math I'm not
17:27 - really great at knowing that I just need
17:29 - to do that a lot of kids will just be
17:30 - like oh I see it's 15 this is already
17:32 - here it must need to be here so what
17:35 - we'll see here is we are also there's
17:37 - also a rating system so three stars the
17:39 - shortest most concise answer a two star
17:41 - it means that I took an extra step and a
17:43 - one star I like to say is there on the
17:45 - struggle bus and they were able to get
17:46 - the banana but probably didn't master
17:49 - the concept at hand um so it always
17:52 - gives them a little bit of suggestion
17:54 - Gordo as pops up with those tips and
17:56 - tricks to make their lives a little bit
17:58 - easier
18:00 - and then the student mode so now I'm
18:02 - gonna go to the next challenge and we'll
18:04 - see that it starts to kind of build in
18:06 - complexity as it goes introducing new
18:08 - tools and things like that so that's
18:10 - coding adventure and they move through
18:12 - the story map and each world is a
18:14 - different story
18:15 - so that's just for you guys to know too
18:20 - okay so the next course that we're going
18:22 - to look at is going to be our banana
18:24 - tails course and so banana tails is our
18:27 - newest course the goal is to help this
18:30 - baby monkey eat his bananas you can't
18:33 - really catch bananas himself so he has
18:37 - to do that that way so the very first
18:41 - thing that we're introduced here is
18:42 - there's also a trailer it's super cute I
18:44 - suggest watching it for the interest of
18:47 - time we won't and then it says oh no the
18:50 - twins are separated and then we need to
18:52 - help feed the baby monkey so we need to
18:54 - build a path so first it just introduces
18:56 - them what I love most about this
18:58 - specifically is it really does look like
19:00 - a real true programmer we have different
19:03 - tabs and we have a console and hints
19:05 - down here and the ability to mute and
19:07 - unmute the sound and then it also has a
19:10 - graph here where you can see the single
19:12 - squares because all programming runs
19:16 - also on a x and y coordinate something
19:19 - to know about computer programming
19:20 - itself as zero zeros up in the upper
19:22 - left-hand corner so that's just
19:23 - something also note for your students
19:25 - but I love that you can see the grid
19:26 - here on this one it's just introducing
19:29 - them that they can click on this and
19:30 - kind of what happens next
19:32 - baby's hungry now he gets fed by the
19:34 - remote-control car so this is also
19:37 - scored in the same similar manner that
19:40 - coding adventure is scored in which you
19:42 - have the three star to start and one
19:44 - star solutions and then now we're
19:48 - introduced to more of the Python
19:50 - concepts as we kind of go so we can run
19:53 - this see what happens
19:55 - as we go through and when we click on so
19:59 - you saw that I said that giraffe dot
20:00 - height and when that happened the
20:02 - giraffes head pops up and he becomes the
20:04 - bridge because otherwise the banana
20:07 - cannot get to the monkey in the way that
20:09 - we would like it to
20:11 - and then it proceeds and scaffolds in
20:14 - the same way this one is also in a story
20:17 - map similar to coin adventure where they
20:19 - work through in the linear way where
20:21 - they can't skip around something else I
20:22 - like to note here is there are reference
20:24 - cards located here which are really nice
20:26 - to look at the students have a question
20:29 - or they can't remember what the concept
20:30 - is it is right here and there's also the
20:33 - teacher notes for every single course
20:34 - like I mentioned before okay
20:41 - okay so the next course that we're going
20:44 - to discuss is the game builder this is
20:47 - always a very favorited course by our
20:50 - students like I said we can just start
20:55 - playing right here or access the teacher
20:56 - notes and making sure that we're kind of
20:58 - prepped for what we need dota does math
21:02 - is set up in the same way as coding
21:04 - adventure is and the moon lander is set
21:08 - up in the same way that this game
21:09 - builder course is set up as well so
21:11 - basically what you see over here and why
21:13 - we suggest it for the older grades you
21:15 - can tell it's a little bit it's a little
21:17 - bit different in that there's a lot more
21:18 - reading involved the kids love it but
21:21 - they do need to read and so that's just
21:23 - why I say for the suggested for the much
21:26 - older grades and so here we have as an
21:29 - upper elementary here we have the
21:31 - directions and kind of what we're
21:33 - supposed to do as we go through we click
21:36 - run
21:36 - when we click something we don't have
21:39 - anything program so our monkey won't
21:41 - actually move so we have to do something
21:44 - and here it tells us that we need to add
21:46 - a step inside of this inside the on key
21:51 - now when I step and I get him to the
21:53 - banana you'll see that the texts are
21:55 - running along the bottom all of our
21:57 - courses move through in a linear manner
21:59 - so the kids really are building in
22:01 - footing as they're going but having fun
22:03 - as they do it then we introduce
22:06 - something else here with the if key
22:09 - statement and now the monkey will move
22:11 - forward and backwards and by time he
22:13 - gets to the end of the game but to the
22:15 - end of this course he's working with
22:17 - chocolate and when he eats chocolate the
22:21 - score goes down so they work on some
22:22 - different like widgets and things like
22:24 - that throughout the course
22:27 - [Music]
22:33 - okay so like I said coding adventure and
22:36 - dota does math they're basically like
22:37 - little partners in crime we work through
22:40 - those different math concepts game
22:42 - builder and moon lander are set up in
22:43 - the same way and then trivia chat bot is
22:45 - also the same kind of screen where
22:47 - there's the code where there's the
22:48 - directions on the Left we're coding in
22:50 - the middle and then are programming in
22:53 - the middle and then on the right-hand
22:54 - side you're either building or creating
22:56 - or kind of working through that on the
22:57 - right hand side and then banana tales
23:00 - set similar to coding adventure but full
23:02 - Python and then we have the code monkey
23:04 - jr. and code monkey jr. is app based
23:06 - there's no reading it's just symbols
23:09 - actually arrows to kind of get the
23:11 - monkey to where he needs to be to
23:12 - collect the bananas okay
23:29 - you
23:31 - oops okay so now that we have explored
23:40 - some of the courses of coding adventure
23:44 - we just like to kind of discuss a little
23:46 - bit about how if you have a teacher
23:51 - account you're able to basically track
23:55 - students progress so I do want to show
23:57 - you a little bit of that just so you
23:59 - have kind of the ability to kind of see
24:00 - that you just get there really quickly
24:05 - you
24:09 - and I'm also gonna answer this question
24:12 - Debbie this is a great question she
24:15 - wanted to know what is the cost for the
24:16 - hour of code courses and the hour of
24:18 - code courses do not have cost they are
24:20 - completely free we offer those through
24:23 - out the throughout actually the whole
24:30 - year so it's always there for you
24:39 - so there's never a time
24:42 - course is because our of code really we
24:44 - like to say doesn't always have to be
24:46 - only during the computer science week
24:50 - okay so here I am on the code monkey
24:53 - platform and I just wanted to like
24:55 - quickly run through things nothing there
24:57 - we do have like I said fully guided
24:58 - lesson plans for you for everything in
25:01 - case you needed it we also have
25:03 - certificates for things like that and
25:05 - tutorials to help you kind of get set up
25:07 - and all of that it's pretty easy but
25:12 - what's nice about the hour of code
25:14 - at-least signing up for a teacher trial
25:17 - and kind of checking out the platform is
25:18 - for this progress page because if you
25:20 - have any questions about student
25:21 - solutions you're not able to actually
25:23 - see it during the hour of code so in
25:24 - case this really helps like your parent
25:26 - volunteers be able to kind of see that
25:28 - so how to skip through we have a lesson
25:30 - mode easy ability to add students all
25:32 - that good kind of stuff but the progress
25:34 - page here is when the students have a
25:36 - log and created their progress there's
25:40 - being reported back to you so you have
25:42 - the ability to see exactly how it is
25:43 - that they're doing and then up here in
25:45 - green for all of our courses we have the
25:47 - solutions for you so you're not going
25:49 - and hunting any of that kind of stuff
25:51 - down so that's just something to note
25:53 - and something we like to keep in mind
25:54 - throughout the course or throughout the
25:57 - hour of code week just in case of them
25:59 - that way you're not you know hunting for
26:01 - information I know kids would ask me a
26:02 - question I'd be like and I don't want to
26:06 - be like that I really want to know that
26:09 - that's there for them
26:18 - you
26:21 - okay as I'm gonna say
26:25 - [Music]
26:29 - okay
26:31 - awesome I print training that you can
26:32 - also extend these activities a little
26:34 - bit longer so with the teacher trial you
26:36 - have access also to the tracking of all
26:38 - of the hour of code courses so you can
26:41 - also limit the students progress so
26:42 - maybe they see you for the whole week
26:44 - and you only want them to do ten
26:45 - challenges and then ten challenges the
26:47 - next day so then they won't be able to
26:50 - move to progressively or you can just
26:52 - open it up for them or you can do a
26:55 - lesson plan for them as well
26:58 - I do see I'm just gonna stop and take
27:03 - this question just now before we cut
27:06 - we're kind of nearing the end here but
27:07 - just so you know where can you get the
27:10 - certificates of the code monkey game is
27:12 - it after challenges completed or the
27:15 - hour of code within all of the teacher
27:17 - notes
27:21 - you can find the certificates there so
27:24 - there's no like guessing or checking
27:26 - during I mean not guessing there's no
27:28 - you not needing to login or anything
27:31 - like that it's just right there on
27:32 - within the hour of code notes page
27:36 - but great question
27:40 - um so we do have a fully so we went over
27:45 - the progress page and then we do have
27:46 - this lesson mode here so let's say you
27:48 - really wanted to extend the hour of code
27:50 - a little bit longer you really wanted
27:52 - students to be able to try the platform
27:54 - itself we do have a lesson mode with all
27:56 - of our lessons within our courses they
27:59 - always start out with an unplugged
28:00 - activity then there's playtime and then
28:02 - there's some time for debrief so once
28:03 - you begin a lesson then the students go
28:05 - into lesson mode and only can access the
28:08 - challenges within that lesson so that's
28:10 - just kind of something to keep in mind
28:12 - for you as well
28:23 - just switching my screens here
28:28 - all right so we've explored the courses
28:31 - and we've talked about the courses the
28:33 - code monkey jr. remember is for our pre
28:35 - readers coding adventure dota does math
28:39 - game builder banana tales trivia chat
28:43 - bot
28:45 - and the moon lander now we're going to
28:48 - leave some time for questions and for
28:56 - you two for some questions okay
29:00 - so
29:04 - cool I'm a michael had sent a question
29:09 - regarding can you see the solutions
29:11 - other than on the progress tab
29:13 - unfortunately you can only see the
29:14 - student solutions I mean as the students
29:17 - are going through you can always see
29:18 - their solutions as they're working on
29:20 - the page but unfortunately you cannot
29:22 - see the student solutions except for in
29:26 - the progress page you're able to see the
29:28 - answers for the solutions and the
29:30 - student solutions as well you can click
29:32 - on any of the stars within the progress
29:34 - tab and you'll actually be able to see
29:36 - exactly how they solve the inner
29:37 - real-life animation so that's kind of
29:38 - cool
29:46 - you
29:49 - this was another great question is there
29:51 - a limit to how many classes you can set
29:53 - up during the trial you get each teacher
29:57 - is allotted when you sign up for the
30:02 - teacher trial 30 students 30 days but
30:07 - you can access the hour of code
30:09 - throughout the rest of the year also if
30:12 - you have a co teacher you can add them
30:14 - to it and then you guys can both have
30:15 - access to that student data and
30:18 - information as well
30:23 - you
30:27 - are there there's a good question here
30:30 - are there any unplugged activities there
30:34 - was one there throughout the lesson
30:37 - plans encoding adventure there are
30:39 - unplugged Allah there are unplugged
30:41 - lessons
30:45 - but specifically for like our code we
30:50 - don't have anything like specifically
30:51 - unplugged for students and then Shelley
30:55 - a good question I found that sites like
30:57 - scratch in co.org are sometimes very
30:58 - hard to access during cs ed week due to
31:01 - heavy traffic and I agree I know that
31:04 - when I was in the teaching in the
31:05 - classroom that I know that that was a
31:07 - very hard
31:09 - a hard thing that kind of happened we
31:13 - have not experienced issues I can't say
31:15 - that it won't happen as there are
31:17 - thousands of people across the country
31:20 - doing the hour of code it's now
31:23 - worldwide it started very small but now
31:25 - worldwide everyone is using it during
31:27 - the during not the our code week the cs
31:30 - ed week
31:31 - so like I said I could not a hundred
31:35 - percent promise that there hasn't been
31:37 - anything but typically there has not
31:39 - been any issues with that during the
31:42 - week but I think you can always kind of
31:44 - expect it during the CSF week but I do
31:47 - know sites like scratch and co.org I'm
31:49 - very often do experience that so I think
31:51 - it's nice to have something external
31:53 - kind of there you have to think that
31:55 - everyone's funneling into hour of code I
31:57 - mean to code org for those activities so
32:00 - I think if you have some things
32:01 - bookmarked separately it makes a little
32:02 - bit easier
32:13 - you
32:25 - mark did you have a chance to
32:31 - that document
32:35 - I'll do that right now okay great mark
32:39 - is also sharing a great resource for you
32:41 - for hour of code week so just suggest
32:55 - big I caught him off guard
32:57 - oops that was the wrong week
33:01 - [Laughter]
33:20 - and I will
33:24 - oh that's not the right one mark okay
33:40 - we'll fix this okay so just one second
33:44 - we'll send that document to you this
33:46 - document that Marsh printout was
33:49 - accidental it was a my notes page so I
33:51 - don't think any of you guys need that my
33:53 - outline sometimes it happens though do
34:01 - you see it mark I am doing a deep dive
34:06 - to my email here
34:07 - I apologize everyone so good I found it
34:12 - we're ready to go
34:20 - okay so this is a blog created by our
34:24 - marketing team on some steps to have a
34:27 - successful hour of code so just some
34:28 - extra tips and tricks for you during
34:30 - this great fun event so to honor that
34:39 - and if there are no other questions
34:42 - today we want to just thank you for
34:45 - joining our webinar for the 2019 hour of
34:48 - code remember to follow us on twitter
34:51 - facebook instagram at code monkey s tu
34:53 - and then if there's any questions or
34:56 - anything that you guys have please feel
34:58 - free to reach out to myself or anyone on
35:00 - our team we're happy to help you assist
35:02 - for the hour of code and we hope that
35:04 - you have a amazing hour of code week and
35:07 - remember to write code catch bananas and
35:11 - save the world bye everybody

Cleaned transcript:

all righty welcome everyone to the hour of code our 2019 hour of code with code monkey we thank you for joining us I know we have some people from kind of all over Mountain Time and East Coaster hi Michael how's it going and some of our other attendees so we're gonna go ahead and kind of get started and we're gonna start off with introducing the team so I always like to start off with knowing who we are just so if you guys have any questions or kind of want to know anything my name is Lena Saleh and I'm the professional development manager here at code monkey I have a former teacher I taught in the classroom for just about around 10 years and spent some time in my even when I was in high school going into the classroom and kind of learning from there I've been with code monkey for about two years now helps leaving the professional development you can reach me here via email or you can reach out to me on Twitter at Lena at code my everyone as you can see there my name is Mark Dozier I am the art of the customer success as part of their customer success team ecwid lucky I've been in that role for about past four months it's an awesome team basically my role here is to help you any questions throughout the school year whether it's based on the platform or the setup or anything in that room prior to joining code lucky I was also a teacher myself for about 16 years and I do remember this hour of code week being the most exciting time I said if you're new to this I would add your kids are gonna love it and for those of you that have done this before just remember you could always use this as a way to sort of we Kendall that fire when it comes to coding so thanks Lena thanks mark hi everyone I'm Brett s Wilson I'm the VP of Sales here at code monkey and so my main role is to help schools and teachers learn about code monkey find out how they can implement it in their classrooms to help students ultimately just make the teachers lives easier with one less thing on their plate by utilizing code monkey and so I've been in EdTech for quite a while working with several different companies and ultimately I'm very passionate about bringing technology to the classroom to make things easier on teachers and then allow students better ways to learn thanks everybody I'm J Bloodworth I'm the curriculum developer here at code monkey like most people I have a background in teaching I taught math for 20 years although my degrees actually computer science and so now I'm writing computer science curriculum here at code monkey so I'm mostly behind the scenes but you know I'm a poke my head in some these webinars now and then to contribute what I can I want to really echo what Mark said when I was at the classroom power of code and computer science education week was my favorite time of the year so I think your students enjoy it let them enjoy it and enjoy it yourself it's a good time awesome well that's our team so we want to just thank you again for joining us for our 2019 hour of code webinar we know that there are is a vast majority of choices that you have for hour of code week and I share the sentiment with the rest of our team that that was always my favorite time and I even started doing our code week back in 2012 even before it was officially the code org adoption of our of code but if you have any questions during today's session please send them in the Q&A or in the chat box along the side also please tweet at us using hashtag code monkey you'll see it along the bottom of everything and then always remember to write code catch bananas and save the world and I will tell you that after today's webinar there will be a survey that will pop up at the end and it will be your professional development certificate for today so thank you so you can see you can follow us here on twitter facebook instagram and/or follow us along on our blog so today's web our objectives are to discuss code monkeys story what is the hour of code where to find us some of the courses that we offer and then setting up for the hour of code the requirements and kind of going through all of that kind of stuff and then exploring courses and then we always leave time for you at the end for QA there is nothing more powerful than your questions so if you have any during this time please ask it and we'll do our best to answer you so we always like to start off talking about what code monkey is and kind of the story behind code monkey oops excuse me so code monkey was founded in 2014 there's actually a tea there are two brothers and their best friend they founded code monkey after they went in and they were volunteering their time working with students and found that students just really didn't love learning the traditional coding I mean so when they started to animate it and bring code monkey and that's they found that students just love the coding concepts much more when it was gamified and fun and who doesn't love our monkey so that's kind of how code monkey was born so today code monkey is a very fun and engaging and we program in a few different languages now and our company has been growing so we're happy to have you alongside us so what really makes code monkey different than other programs or platforms kind of that you use code monkey is a is intuitive it's very gamified even from the very beginning it's a very user friendly and really we're designed to put you the teacher and the driver seats are really giving you the tools that you need to really become successful when teaching with code monkey and it's also very easy to roll out right so what is the hour of code obviously you hour of codes been around for quite some time and it's just growing every single year and the course availability options are just growing but hour of code is really not designed to be a computer science course it's not designed to teach the students at full fundamentals they're not coming in the hour of code week and walking out being developers ready for Google it's really just designed to give students the opportunity to get basically a taste of what computer science it's kind of like the first time you try ice cream it's so delicious you can't stop and you keep going back for more and so that's really what does that live code monkey I mean what the hour of code week is really for Bob obviously you know that the landscape of the job market scene for students is vastly changing it's very different from when I was a kid when really we only knew about you know a few different opportunities and we know that the jobs half the jobs that our students have will have access to aren't even invented yet but there are about 500,000 openings throughout the country for computer jobs I live here in Austin and the texting every single day you see is growing more companies are bringing their companies actually to the city landscape and that means there's more jobs for students and more opportunity for them so it's just a and I believe it's a very timeless skill set so we offer many different courses for hour of code week our newest one is code monkey jr. it is a peso just kind of keep that in mind we have our coding adventure our dota does math course game builder and our brandnew banana Tales Python course our trivia choppa which is also Python and then our moon lander course so I'm gonna talk a little bit about kind of where those are and kind of what they are but first let's discuss how do we even find these hour of code courses for hour of code you don't need a student login you don't have to have a subscription it's just really a place for you to try out code monkey with your students so how do you even get there you can find us on the co.org web page and I don't know if you guys know this or not the code org used to be used to be code org slash learn and now there is actually an hour of code page so I'll kind of show you where that is here in just a moment but when you get there to the course you select the activities and you just select the created by code monkey studios and then there is a beginner and a comfortable and that's with all the course options that are available not only that but we do have a specific page for code monkey to find us so you can go to code monkey comm slash hour of code and that's how you get there but let me just show you a little bit how you get there so here I am on the hour of code page you can see us as hour of code comm which is great you click on activities and then you can select the creative by section and so when you select created by we click on code monkey studios we can see our courses that are available like I said code monkey junior is great the pre readers love it but it is an app it is an app so just kind of keeping that in mind and then our banana tails is beginner I suggest it mostly for the later grades but why not have them try it during this time and then coding adventure and then like I said in the comfortable section are our other courses it's either that or you can go to the code monkey hour of code course page and you'll see the different courses here as well as suggested ages so just something to kind of keep in mind so how do the courses work and where should I use them with my students well code monkey jr. is really designed for that prek early reader up to like first grade age the doted as math courses kind of works through the distances angle measurement and multiplication so that's really meant for a second through fifth graders as well as the coding adventure course both doted as math and coding adventure on a language called CoffeeScript and CoffeeScript is a real recognized language but it is a shorter version of JavaScript and Python without all the heavy syntax our banana tales course says second through eighth grade here I would suggest using it with like a little bit of the older grades unless you feel like they're super confident in the Python but why not try it and then the game builder course where they work through the game game mechanics working through a Super Mario style game and then our trivia chat pod is full Python working through a game basically it's a game of hangman which we don't call it hangman anymore we call it snowman so it's building that trivia game out and then a moon lander is a physics based course it's really great even for like the high schoolers the monkey has to you learn how to land a moon lander on the launching pad working with thrust and really interworking the very a lot of science ii topics throughout there so before we get into the courses what should i prepare for the hour of code so I think of myself always thinking like I'm always very prepared for the situation I think about I'm just working one to one of my students are super calm but actually what happens during the hour of code week as you know oftentimes the websites crash or you know I may not have everything prepped the way that I thought I would have everything prepped and I often feel like I'm fighting off dinosaurs like you like you are here like this picture here on the bottom so it's really great and highly suggested an island that's a hard way myself the first year when I watch it with 500 kids and I thought oh this is just gonna work seamlessly the website went down like all kinds of things happen so it's always good to make sure that you're testing out the specs before you are launching it you just really want a seamless transition you also want the kids have as much possible coding to really get that excitement so just something to kind of keep in mind with all of our hour of code courses we do have teacher notes so when you select a course any of our courses here we do have the teacher notes and when you go to the teacher notes you just kind of scroll down here at the bottom you can access the notes just keep in mind all of our courses are also standards aligned to CS ta and several other several other alignment so you can check that out too if that's something that's necessary for you within the teacher notes are the specs so it tells you the suggested ages if it's web base if you need to install anything all the courses except for code monkey junior do not need to do like any kind of installation or anything like that highly suggest to do headphones because there's some fun sounds and things like that and then just always making sure that it does work with your most updated version of your web browser so that's always an important thing I know that sometimes seems like it's easy to do it and then it will tell you kind of a little bit about it like how how long it is how many levels what kinds of things what can you kind of expect the prep there's also student certificates so I suggest printing these out because the hour of code is a really great way to tie in all your parent volunteers stakeholders the more the merrier to kind of help you have all hands on deck and this is really the best way to really integrate that community in with your classroom okay so now that we have kind of explored that part of it I know that it's always like a little bit fast and serious does anyone have any now's the time to ask any questions if you have anything about like tag get set up or the our code or anything like that okay great if not feel free to ask my team they're here for your help okay and the code monkey certificates are really great for student portfolios and all that kind of thing as well so I always suggest printing those out also parents love certificates right as much as the kids do so why not award them for all the hard work that they've done okay so we're gonna talk about a few of the courses not all of the courses we don't have time to explore every single course but I suggest that you kind of check them out but we're gonna go over some of them so our coding adventure course like I said for the hour of code you don't need to do anything logging in you can create a teacher trial it's 30 days 30 students you have the ability to track all the students progress and see all the lesson plans and all the stuff that kind of goes with that I kind of make it a little bit longer for your students but you can just click right here on the start playing code monkey starts out with a trailer basically gorilla comes and steals his bananas and he gets sad and then he gets mad and he's ready to go how code monkey is set up let me turn down the sound I never know if you guys can hear the sound but just turn off the sound for the sake of this so just some kind of things to note this the text editor is on the right the stage is on the left the monkey is here and these buttons type out for the students it's not a draganddrop it just is really easy for them to not get so tied down with spelling or anything like that and then we can pick up the ruler and kind of measure the distance so I'm gonna pull up the story map here so the students work linearly through the coding concepts so if if for some reason I was doing an hour code in a school and something happened with their their internet if a student gets exited out of this just know that they do have to start from the beginning when playing the hour of code version this happens with a lot of websites that we we are not saving their progress except well for while they're in it so basically we go through and we click run here and it will oh shoot so sorry I just realized that my screen was frozen so let me retrain what I was talking about so so sorry guys sometimes you forget you know okay so what I was saying here is that you is that when you click on the course here you can just start logging in and playing right here from the very beginning so here we are in the code monkey platform and the there's a quick trailer that will kind of show which is what I discuss which sorry that I miss that was stuck on the other screen sometimes happens but what you can see here is that we have the ruler we can pick up the ruler these buttons type out for students like I said before so I'm just gonna run this one it's very scaffolded at the beginning and just really kind of like a clickbait like really getting them excited and excited about what they can experience here so it's really designed to start off easier so that it can present more challenge kind of as they go through and they're getting more confidence as they're going through so here we see there's some tips and tricks kind of along the bottom Gordo is our teacher assistant oh sorry excuse me so he pops up with any directions he's always hanging out here there is a narration feature and there's also different languages if you need to have that as well that you can kind of change that but let's say that I type this out here and I'm maybe learning math I'm not really great at knowing that I just need to do that a lot of kids will just be like oh I see it's 15 this is already here it must need to be here so what we'll see here is we are also there's also a rating system so three stars the shortest most concise answer a two star it means that I took an extra step and a one star I like to say is there on the struggle bus and they were able to get the banana but probably didn't master the concept at hand um so it always gives them a little bit of suggestion Gordo as pops up with those tips and tricks to make their lives a little bit easier and then the student mode so now I'm gonna go to the next challenge and we'll see that it starts to kind of build in complexity as it goes introducing new tools and things like that so that's coding adventure and they move through the story map and each world is a different story so that's just for you guys to know too okay so the next course that we're going to look at is going to be our banana tails course and so banana tails is our newest course the goal is to help this baby monkey eat his bananas you can't really catch bananas himself so he has to do that that way so the very first thing that we're introduced here is there's also a trailer it's super cute I suggest watching it for the interest of time we won't and then it says oh no the twins are separated and then we need to help feed the baby monkey so we need to build a path so first it just introduces them what I love most about this specifically is it really does look like a real true programmer we have different tabs and we have a console and hints down here and the ability to mute and unmute the sound and then it also has a graph here where you can see the single squares because all programming runs also on a x and y coordinate something to know about computer programming itself as zero zeros up in the upper lefthand corner so that's just something also note for your students but I love that you can see the grid here on this one it's just introducing them that they can click on this and kind of what happens next baby's hungry now he gets fed by the remotecontrol car so this is also scored in the same similar manner that coding adventure is scored in which you have the three star to start and one star solutions and then now we're introduced to more of the Python concepts as we kind of go so we can run this see what happens as we go through and when we click on so you saw that I said that giraffe dot height and when that happened the giraffes head pops up and he becomes the bridge because otherwise the banana cannot get to the monkey in the way that we would like it to and then it proceeds and scaffolds in the same way this one is also in a story map similar to coin adventure where they work through in the linear way where they can't skip around something else I like to note here is there are reference cards located here which are really nice to look at the students have a question or they can't remember what the concept is it is right here and there's also the teacher notes for every single course like I mentioned before okay okay so the next course that we're going to discuss is the game builder this is always a very favorited course by our students like I said we can just start playing right here or access the teacher notes and making sure that we're kind of prepped for what we need dota does math is set up in the same way as coding adventure is and the moon lander is set up in the same way that this game builder course is set up as well so basically what you see over here and why we suggest it for the older grades you can tell it's a little bit it's a little bit different in that there's a lot more reading involved the kids love it but they do need to read and so that's just why I say for the suggested for the much older grades and so here we have as an upper elementary here we have the directions and kind of what we're supposed to do as we go through we click run when we click something we don't have anything program so our monkey won't actually move so we have to do something and here it tells us that we need to add a step inside of this inside the on key now when I step and I get him to the banana you'll see that the texts are running along the bottom all of our courses move through in a linear manner so the kids really are building in footing as they're going but having fun as they do it then we introduce something else here with the if key statement and now the monkey will move forward and backwards and by time he gets to the end of the game but to the end of this course he's working with chocolate and when he eats chocolate the score goes down so they work on some different like widgets and things like that throughout the course okay so like I said coding adventure and dota does math they're basically like little partners in crime we work through those different math concepts game builder and moon lander are set up in the same way and then trivia chat bot is also the same kind of screen where there's the code where there's the directions on the Left we're coding in the middle and then are programming in the middle and then on the righthand side you're either building or creating or kind of working through that on the right hand side and then banana tales set similar to coding adventure but full Python and then we have the code monkey jr. and code monkey jr. is app based there's no reading it's just symbols actually arrows to kind of get the monkey to where he needs to be to collect the bananas okay you oops okay so now that we have explored some of the courses of coding adventure we just like to kind of discuss a little bit about how if you have a teacher account you're able to basically track students progress so I do want to show you a little bit of that just so you have kind of the ability to kind of see that you just get there really quickly you and I'm also gonna answer this question Debbie this is a great question she wanted to know what is the cost for the hour of code courses and the hour of code courses do not have cost they are completely free we offer those through out the throughout actually the whole year so it's always there for you so there's never a time course is because our of code really we like to say doesn't always have to be only during the computer science week okay so here I am on the code monkey platform and I just wanted to like quickly run through things nothing there we do have like I said fully guided lesson plans for you for everything in case you needed it we also have certificates for things like that and tutorials to help you kind of get set up and all of that it's pretty easy but what's nice about the hour of code atleast signing up for a teacher trial and kind of checking out the platform is for this progress page because if you have any questions about student solutions you're not able to actually see it during the hour of code so in case this really helps like your parent volunteers be able to kind of see that so how to skip through we have a lesson mode easy ability to add students all that good kind of stuff but the progress page here is when the students have a log and created their progress there's being reported back to you so you have the ability to see exactly how it is that they're doing and then up here in green for all of our courses we have the solutions for you so you're not going and hunting any of that kind of stuff down so that's just something to note and something we like to keep in mind throughout the course or throughout the hour of code week just in case of them that way you're not you know hunting for information I know kids would ask me a question I'd be like and I don't want to be like that I really want to know that that's there for them you okay as I'm gonna say okay awesome I print training that you can also extend these activities a little bit longer so with the teacher trial you have access also to the tracking of all of the hour of code courses so you can also limit the students progress so maybe they see you for the whole week and you only want them to do ten challenges and then ten challenges the next day so then they won't be able to move to progressively or you can just open it up for them or you can do a lesson plan for them as well I do see I'm just gonna stop and take this question just now before we cut we're kind of nearing the end here but just so you know where can you get the certificates of the code monkey game is it after challenges completed or the hour of code within all of the teacher notes you can find the certificates there so there's no like guessing or checking during I mean not guessing there's no you not needing to login or anything like that it's just right there on within the hour of code notes page but great question um so we do have a fully so we went over the progress page and then we do have this lesson mode here so let's say you really wanted to extend the hour of code a little bit longer you really wanted students to be able to try the platform itself we do have a lesson mode with all of our lessons within our courses they always start out with an unplugged activity then there's playtime and then there's some time for debrief so once you begin a lesson then the students go into lesson mode and only can access the challenges within that lesson so that's just kind of something to keep in mind for you as well just switching my screens here all right so we've explored the courses and we've talked about the courses the code monkey jr. remember is for our pre readers coding adventure dota does math game builder banana tales trivia chat bot and the moon lander now we're going to leave some time for questions and for you two for some questions okay so cool I'm a michael had sent a question regarding can you see the solutions other than on the progress tab unfortunately you can only see the student solutions I mean as the students are going through you can always see their solutions as they're working on the page but unfortunately you cannot see the student solutions except for in the progress page you're able to see the answers for the solutions and the student solutions as well you can click on any of the stars within the progress tab and you'll actually be able to see exactly how they solve the inner reallife animation so that's kind of cool you this was another great question is there a limit to how many classes you can set up during the trial you get each teacher is allotted when you sign up for the teacher trial 30 students 30 days but you can access the hour of code throughout the rest of the year also if you have a co teacher you can add them to it and then you guys can both have access to that student data and information as well you are there there's a good question here are there any unplugged activities there was one there throughout the lesson plans encoding adventure there are unplugged Allah there are unplugged lessons but specifically for like our code we don't have anything like specifically unplugged for students and then Shelley a good question I found that sites like scratch in co.org are sometimes very hard to access during cs ed week due to heavy traffic and I agree I know that when I was in the teaching in the classroom that I know that that was a very hard a hard thing that kind of happened we have not experienced issues I can't say that it won't happen as there are thousands of people across the country doing the hour of code it's now worldwide it started very small but now worldwide everyone is using it during the during not the our code week the cs ed week so like I said I could not a hundred percent promise that there hasn't been anything but typically there has not been any issues with that during the week but I think you can always kind of expect it during the CSF week but I do know sites like scratch and co.org I'm very often do experience that so I think it's nice to have something external kind of there you have to think that everyone's funneling into hour of code I mean to code org for those activities so I think if you have some things bookmarked separately it makes a little bit easier you mark did you have a chance to that document I'll do that right now okay great mark is also sharing a great resource for you for hour of code week so just suggest big I caught him off guard oops that was the wrong week [Laughter] and I will oh that's not the right one mark okay we'll fix this okay so just one second we'll send that document to you this document that Marsh printout was accidental it was a my notes page so I don't think any of you guys need that my outline sometimes it happens though do you see it mark I am doing a deep dive to my email here I apologize everyone so good I found it we're ready to go okay so this is a blog created by our marketing team on some steps to have a successful hour of code so just some extra tips and tricks for you during this great fun event so to honor that and if there are no other questions today we want to just thank you for joining our webinar for the 2019 hour of code remember to follow us on twitter facebook instagram at code monkey s tu and then if there's any questions or anything that you guys have please feel free to reach out to myself or anyone on our team we're happy to help you assist for the hour of code and we hope that you have a amazing hour of code week and remember to write code catch bananas and save the world bye everybody
