00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - welcome to who moved my mouse let's
00:07 - learn about mouse move events
00:11 - mouse events occur when you move or
00:13 - click your mouse
00:15 - for the next few challenges we're
00:17 - focusing on the events that occur when
00:19 - you move your mouse
00:22 - the function
00:23 - on mouse move is automatically called
00:26 - when you move your mouse
00:28 - and in the function you can code what
00:31 - should happen as a result
00:33 - so here's an example we have the on
00:35 - mouse move function and it has the
00:38 - parameter pause
00:41 - and you could see we're using the pause
00:43 - within the function
00:45 - so
00:47 - we are telling the monkey
00:50 - to turn to
00:52 - that position to wherever your
00:54 - mouse cursor is the monkey should turn
00:57 - to it
01:00 - the parameter pause
01:02 - holds the position of your mouse cursor
01:06 - so when you move the mouse
01:08 - pause is changed it's automatically
01:11 - updated as you move your mouse cursor
01:16 - you can access
01:17 - the x and y coordinates like separately
01:21 - access those coordinates of your cursor
01:24 - by using pause.x
01:26 - and pause.y
01:29 - let's look at a challenge
01:32 - here's a challenge with the monkey a
01:34 - crocodile and three bananas
01:37 - the code has two functions in it
01:40 - the on mouse move function which is
01:43 - called whenever you move your mouse
01:45 - and it has the parameter pause
01:48 - and the on key function which is called
01:50 - whenever you press a key on your
01:52 - keyboard
01:53 - it has the parameter key
01:56 - and in this case we're having the monkey
01:58 - step one
02:00 - so we're having the monkey step one when
02:03 - any key is pressed
02:06 - so how are we going to use the on mouse
02:08 - move function to complete this challenge
02:12 - so if we look at the challenge
02:15 - we need that crocodile to turn
02:18 - towards the monkey
02:21 - and maybe towards other things later
02:24 - so maybe we can use
02:26 - the position of your cursor to turn the
02:29 - crocodile
02:31 - so let's try that crocodile turn
02:34 - two the parameter pause
02:38 - so if we run this
02:40 - we could see look at that the
02:42 - crocodile's following my cursor
02:44 - so i can line it up with the monkey
02:49 - and now i'm pressing any key to get the
02:51 - monkey to move
02:53 - and
02:56 - there we go
03:00 - here's an example with the monkey a bat
03:03 - and three bananas
03:05 - we have the function on mouse move and
03:08 - the parameter pause
03:10 - within we have
03:13 - the bat dot set x this means we're
03:15 - setting the x position of the bat
03:19 - to the x position of your cursor pause
03:23 - dot x
03:25 - and we're setting the
03:27 - y position of the bat
03:30 - to 100
03:33 - then our on key function which has the
03:35 - parameter key is checking to see if the
03:38 - key is g
03:39 - that you pressed and if so
03:42 - have the bat grab
03:44 - what
03:45 - underneath it
03:47 - okay so let's just run this as is
03:53 - okay when we run this we could see the
03:55 - bats moving
03:57 - in the x position following my mouse
04:00 - but if i move my mouse in the y position
04:03 - the bat's not moving it's staying
04:06 - at that 100
04:08 - because that's what we have in the code
04:11 - so let's change that
04:12 - let's change the 100
04:17 - to be
04:19 - pause dot y
04:21 - so the y position of the bat
04:24 - tracks the y position of your cursor
04:28 - so let's go ahead and run it
04:31 - and now the bat is right underneath my
04:33 - cursor
04:35 - so now i can bring it to the banana
04:37 - press g
04:38 - bring it over to the monkey
04:41 - so grab
04:42 - and bring it to the monkey
04:46 - nice
04:49 - now it's your turn to use mouse move
04:52 - events good luck
04:54 - [Music]
04:59 - you

welcome to who moved my mouse let's learn about mouse move events mouse events occur when you move or click your mouse for the next few challenges we're focusing on the events that occur when you move your mouse the function on mouse move is automatically called when you move your mouse and in the function you can code what should happen as a result so here's an example we have the on mouse move function and it has the parameter pause and you could see we're using the pause within the function so we are telling the monkey to turn to that position to wherever your mouse cursor is the monkey should turn to it the parameter pause holds the position of your mouse cursor so when you move the mouse pause is changed it's automatically updated as you move your mouse cursor you can access the x and y coordinates like separately access those coordinates of your cursor by using pause.x and pause.y let's look at a challenge here's a challenge with the monkey a crocodile and three bananas the code has two functions in it the on mouse move function which is called whenever you move your mouse and it has the parameter pause and the on key function which is called whenever you press a key on your keyboard it has the parameter key and in this case we're having the monkey step one so we're having the monkey step one when any key is pressed so how are we going to use the on mouse move function to complete this challenge so if we look at the challenge we need that crocodile to turn towards the monkey and maybe towards other things later so maybe we can use the position of your cursor to turn the crocodile so let's try that crocodile turn two the parameter pause so if we run this we could see look at that the crocodile's following my cursor so i can line it up with the monkey and now i'm pressing any key to get the monkey to move and there we go here's an example with the monkey a bat and three bananas we have the function on mouse move and the parameter pause within we have the bat dot set x this means we're setting the x position of the bat to the x position of your cursor pause dot x and we're setting the y position of the bat to 100 then our on key function which has the parameter key is checking to see if the key is g that you pressed and if so have the bat grab what underneath it okay so let's just run this as is okay when we run this we could see the bats moving in the x position following my mouse but if i move my mouse in the y position the bat's not moving it's staying at that 100 because that's what we have in the code so let's change that let's change the 100 to be pause dot y so the y position of the bat tracks the y position of your cursor so let's go ahead and run it and now the bat is right underneath my cursor so now i can bring it to the banana press g bring it over to the monkey so grab and bring it to the monkey nice now it's your turn to use mouse move events good luck you
