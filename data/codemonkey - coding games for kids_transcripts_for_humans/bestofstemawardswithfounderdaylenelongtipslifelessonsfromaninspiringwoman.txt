00:02 - hey there Educators parents and all
00:05 - lovers of computer science welcome to
00:08 - the code monkey banana cast where we
00:10 - talk about the important issues you care
00:12 - about from edtech stem education
00:15 - reducing your teacher workload being a
00:18 - working parent and all that goes along
00:20 - with that Co monk is an award-winning K
00:23 - througha curriculum here to make
00:24 - learning computer science a blast for
00:26 - kids everywhere so let's swing into this
00:29 - adventure to together and talk about the
00:31 - stuff that
00:35 - matters welcome to the banana cast I'm
00:38 - Karen your host from code monkey and
00:40 - today we have denen long she is the
00:43 - founder of best of stem and Deen nice to
00:47 - have you on and can you tell us a little
00:50 - bit about let's start with maybe your
00:53 - background sure so best of stem is a
00:56 - actually a program that's run by my
00:57 - company which is catapult X
01:00 - and um I started catapult X six years
01:05 - ago and it has just been a great journey
01:09 - so it was 2018 when I started it and
01:14 - with regards to best of stem one of the
01:17 - things that I wanted to be able to do
01:19 - was I had I've been the chief marketing
01:23 - officer at verer software and technology
01:25 - for 15 years great company very welln um
01:30 - and really well
01:34 - respected we entered a lot of awards and
01:37 - um what I found was they weren't they
01:41 - were what I kind of called handshake
01:43 - Awards meaning that if you knew somebody
01:48 - in the
01:49 - organization um or you were connected
01:52 - with the right people in the
01:53 - organization you were much more likely
01:55 - to win and I really wanted something
01:58 - that was judged by teachers
02:00 - I
02:01 - wanted I wanted to put the teachers on
02:05 - on in the spotlight and say what is that
02:09 - you like about these products would you
02:11 - recommend these to a friend uh and I
02:14 - wanted to give them the same kind of
02:16 - agency that they have when they're
02:18 - actually selecting products where they
02:21 - can say you know what that's a deal
02:23 - breaker for us in our district that's a
02:26 - complete deal
02:27 - breaker no matter what it is um and I'll
02:31 - give you an example one of our judges um
02:34 - he had a product that he was he was
02:36 - judging that he liked but he wasn't
02:39 - super excited about it but then he came
02:41 - across some imagery in it that um was
02:46 - unsafe for Science and for
02:49 - him that was a deal breaker he said if I
02:52 - were in a recommendation committee at my
02:55 - district anything that was unsafe for
02:59 - science any
03:01 - that
03:03 - um was discriminatory or that was um
03:08 - didn't represent the population of his
03:13 - district meaning like you know
03:16 - everybody's Caucasian or something like
03:18 - like those he said we kick those out
03:22 - um and I wanted to be able to teachers
03:25 - to have that agency
03:28 - so um so when I started catapult X best
03:31 - of stem is one of the things that that I
03:33 - really wanted to to build alongside of
03:37 - it the core of our business is market
03:40 - research we say that we amplify educator
03:43 - voices through market research that um
03:46 - edtech companies can trust right but
03:49 - best of stem um becomes this SE
03:53 - celebratory moment in the middle of the
03:55 - Year too and it's a wonderful way for me
03:57 - to um build relationships with some of
03:59 - the Ed tech companies would you say that
04:03 - um you kind of started in marketing and
04:06 - kind of evolved into this
04:08 - edtech uh world or or or one or one came
04:12 - before the next I so I started there's a
04:17 - local company uh here in Oregon that was
04:20 - called porman Douglas and it was a
04:23 - privately owned company and I started
04:26 - there and I was really fortunate to get
04:28 - to work um with a man named Jeff Baker
04:33 - and Jeff was the president of porman
04:35 - Douglas
04:37 - and as I kind of grew and evolved I
04:41 - realized that marketing was something
04:42 - that I was naturally good at it just
04:46 - came easily to me and I was naturally
04:48 - good at it and so I started studying and
04:51 - do taking courses and things like that
04:54 - is that because you're a more creative
04:56 - brain or cuz you're really more into the
04:58 - data right your company catapult X so
05:01 - what what side of marketing are you you
05:04 - know personally personally that's a
05:06 - great question I tell people that if
05:10 - marketing is a spectrum with like super
05:14 - creative over here like you know your ad
05:16 - people that are coming up with headlines
05:19 - and videos and super analytical over
05:23 - here your data scientists strict data
05:26 - science I'm probably here I'm creating
05:31 - but creativity only get you so far if
05:35 - you don't have good
05:37 - analytics right good data to make your
05:40 - decisions on so right yeah it's
05:43 - important yeah so then so I got into
05:47 - edtech when I left um porman Douglas I
05:50 - took a job at a small company called
05:52 - educational Productions as their
05:54 - marketing director and that's when I
05:57 - fell in love with edtech that's when I
05:58 - fell in love with with um being in
06:02 - education technology and doing marketing
06:05 - at education technology um it's funny
06:09 - you know and I'm sure you've experienced
06:10 - this
06:12 - too when you're on life's journey
06:14 - sometimes you you hit these points that
06:16 - you're like okay this makes sense this
06:19 - is where I fit this is what I love and
06:22 - it's almost like it was for a reason
06:24 - that you bumped onto this path you know
06:27 - so random but it just it feels right
06:30 - exactly that's exactly the way I felt
06:33 - with this company uh it was a small
06:36 - company it was um maybe a million in
06:40 - revenue and just a handful of people all
06:42 - women actually it was a woman owned and
06:44 - run
06:46 - company um I was there for three years
06:49 - and when the job opportunity reneer came
06:53 - along it was kind of like all my
06:56 - background came together because
07:00 - I had studied science in college I'd
07:03 - studied biology and I originally kind of
07:06 - wanted to go into the Health Sciences um
07:10 - I studied biology and chemistry and
07:13 - organic chemistry and
07:16 - um statistics and calculus and those
07:19 - kinds of things so for me when the job
07:22 - came up at verer it was another one of
07:24 - those moments where it kind of hones
07:26 - everything together um because I at
07:29 - least understood the language of science
07:31 - I understood the purpose of science I
07:33 - was by no means a scientist but I was
07:36 - definitely a marketer but I underst
07:39 - understand and respect science and so um
07:43 - so things really came together for me
07:45 - when I was when I was there at berer so
07:50 - um if we can talk a little bit about uh
07:52 - the best of stem it's award program um
07:56 - for um a tech company and Educators for
08:01 - their for their programs
08:03 - um uh maybe tell us a little bit about
08:07 - um maybe the impact you've seen it made
08:10 - on Educators and edte companies um and
08:15 - and and um has has there been any shifts
08:18 - you know in the years that um you've
08:20 - done it as far as how the technology has
08:23 - progressed um in edtech and in
08:26 - schools well yeah that was our first
08:30 - really big pivot was we introduced best
08:34 - of stem in
08:36 - 2020 and um we were doing it alongside
08:41 - nsta um and then the whole world changed
08:44 - and so what became what started off as
08:48 - an in-person
08:49 - event quickly switched to dig lonely
08:54 - which has been great that has been much
08:56 - better in the long run for the Ed tech
09:00 - companies and so that's been
09:04 - terrific so I mentioned earlier and I
09:06 - probably had jumped the gun there that
09:09 - um that I started it because I wanted
09:13 - teachers to be able to to be the ones
09:17 - who were making decisions about which
09:19 - products were best for the
09:21 - classroom and um and that's been
09:25 - terrific and the judges that we recruit
09:29 - and that we work with are amazing and
09:35 - for them they like being able to they
09:38 - tell us what they're interested in what
09:39 - their background is what their area of
09:41 - expertise and for them a lot of them
09:46 - really like to tout that they are a best
09:47 - of stem judge they also like to explore
09:53 - the products and get to know some of the
09:56 - the vendor companies um and how do you
09:59 - ensure fairness and impartiality you
10:03 - know during the judging process like
10:04 - maybe they know somebody in that company
10:07 - or you there's a couple things there the
10:11 - first is that when I started this
10:13 - program it was really clear that I
10:16 - didn't want catapult X to pick the
10:17 - winners I didn't want our partners like
10:21 - nsta or nabt or MCH strategic data to
10:27 - pick the winners and they didn't want to
10:29 - either either so I contacted a longtime
10:32 - friend of mine Annie Galvan tyke and she
10:36 - had been really instrumental in putting
10:37 - together the um teachers Choice Awards
10:40 - with learning ma magazine so I asked if
10:43 - she wanted to work on this with me and
10:46 - she was excited to do so so the first
10:48 - step of making sure everything is fair
10:51 - and impartial is that Annie deals with
10:54 - all of the the judges um so that
11:01 - in the very end what we get is a piece
11:03 - of paper that says these are the
11:05 - finalists these are the winners so
11:07 - that's the very first step is we have a
11:10 - wall where it's really clear what Annie
11:14 - deals with and it's really clear what I
11:16 - deal with um the second is you mentioned
11:20 - like maybe they know somebody at the
11:22 - company well our judges are really
11:29 - they're really upfront they're really
11:30 - transparent and so they'll tell us I
11:33 - can't judge this company because I do
11:37 - workshops for them in the summer or I
11:39 - can't judge this company because um I'm
11:42 - a consultant for them on a product um
11:47 - that
11:48 - helps right yeah and um what kind of
11:52 - products are are you or the judges
11:54 - looking for like uh for the winner
11:59 - basically what what advice would you
12:00 - give to applicants maybe to increase
12:04 - their chances of being selected as a
12:06 - winner if we can get that tip
12:09 - from I think the only one that I can
12:11 - really provide is
12:15 - that it it works best when a judge who
12:20 - is a teacher at heart and in
12:23 - practice gets to talk to somebody at
12:26 - your company about the product that is
12:30 - also a teacher or a former teacher or an
12:34 - educator someone who's still they may be
12:37 - working in edtech but they still
12:39 - primarily identify as I'm a teacher I'm
12:42 - an educator um the reason that
12:46 - becomes magic is
12:48 - because those people in your company can
12:52 - say hey here's how I would have used it
12:55 - in my classroom or um or here's what I
13:00 - found were problems or barriers when I
13:03 - was a teacher and here's how this
13:05 - product solved it so a couple of things
13:08 - happen one there's just a better
13:10 - communication that happens between the
13:12 - judge and the edtech
13:15 - company um but the second thing is too
13:18 - that the judges don't feel like
13:20 - somebody's trying to sell them on
13:21 - something that they're trying to say oh
13:25 - you know what I noticed you're in this
13:26 - District um and those kind kinds of
13:29 - things
13:30 - so that's my best piece of advice is
13:33 - when you choose the person that's going
13:35 - to be interacting with your
13:36 - judge choose somebody who's had time
13:41 - recently in the classroom and when I say
13:44 - recently in the last five six years is
13:48 - really where you want to be right that's
13:50 - that's a great piece of advice thank you
13:53 - yeah for sharing that um can you share
13:56 - any maybe can you think of any success
13:58 - story
13:59 - from previous best of some winners that
14:02 - maybe stand out to you you know um there
14:06 - have been some really fun ones there's
14:11 - been um stem Sports last year was a fun
14:14 - one they're a smaller organization but
14:17 - when they won they they did this really
14:20 - super cute Tick Tock Style video and of
14:26 - them like kicking a soccer ball around
14:28 - and being all it in that kind of stuff
14:30 - and that was really that was really neat
14:34 - and it leveraged their promotion for it
14:36 - because they had a a video that was
14:38 - engaging that they could post on social
14:40 - media and that kind of stuff so that was
14:43 - kind of a little one that was fun um the
14:47 - other one that that comes to mind is
14:49 - early on we had a best customer service
14:52 - category oh and we also
14:56 - had um Educators could could do
14:59 - write-ins we don't do this quite like
15:02 - this anymore but Educators could do
15:04 - write-ins too and we started seeing that
15:08 - a bunch of people were writing in the
15:10 - company
15:11 - biorad and what was interesting about
15:14 - that is Bored hadn't entered that
15:18 - category and but they were getting a lot
15:21 - for it and we started talking to
15:24 - teachers about why they were mentioning
15:27 - bio and they said you know it's not so
15:30 - much that they have great like technical
15:32 - support they do but it's more that when
15:36 - I get my stuff it always works it always
15:40 - works and so to them that was what best
15:44 - customer service meant was they could
15:47 - consistently and reliably look at these
15:49 - products and say it's always going to
15:51 - work for my me and my classroom and if I
15:53 - have questions they would go to their
15:56 - the website and their answers would be
15:57 - there so it was a new Twist on um what
16:03 - customer support meant to them that it's
16:05 - not picking up the phone necessarily
16:07 - anymore it's also what are your online
16:09 - resources what are the resources in the
16:12 - product what are all the things that
16:14 - make this really teacher friendly so
16:18 - right those are those are two that
16:21 - really kind of come to mind off the top
16:24 - of my head that have been interesting
16:26 - stories so I just want want to say you
16:30 - know like it just popped into my head
16:34 - but uh your your marketing toolkit that
16:38 - that you guys offer to the winners um
16:41 - which is really great guys it's um you
16:43 - know it has all the all the um logos you
16:46 - can use for best of stem and everything
16:49 - like that you know what you should do on
16:50 - your social posts it was it was the
16:53 - Catalyst actually for our marketing
16:55 - toolkit we don't use it in the same
16:58 - exact way you know we have images like
17:01 - for our characters and all that kind of
17:02 - stuff but I just wanted to just tell you
17:05 - that that that is it's just a great
17:08 - program it's just it's very well thought
17:10 - out and organized and it was actually
17:13 - helpful for
17:15 - me well two interesting things about
17:17 - that one is that was one of our first
17:20 - goals with best of stem and with
17:21 - catapult X we wanted to be able to
17:24 - provide resources for companies that
17:27 - we're working with that make it easy for
17:29 - them to get um to get that kind of
17:32 - marketing that becomes organic right
17:37 - and so the toolkit itself has evolved
17:40 - over time and last year was the first
17:42 - time we partnered with uh Leon
17:45 - Consulting Group who specializes in
17:48 - social media and they specialize in um
17:52 - uh Community platforms and so they
17:58 - helped us take what we were doing and
18:00 - then up at a level and really give um a
18:04 - lot of super healthy tips in there and
18:07 - so and we're using
18:10 - um we're using the same format with the
18:13 - toolkit and we are partnering again this
18:16 - year with Leon Consulting Group on that
18:18 - to help us build things out because they
18:22 - they stay on top of all of those things
18:25 - yeah and it it's it's great to be part
18:27 - of best of stem because just makes it
18:29 - easy you know as a marketing
18:33 - department um you know that's part of
18:36 - the reason we're we're we're entering
18:40 - yeah so yeah that's exactly it and yeah
18:43 - we try to those hooks in place we try to
18:45 - get a little bit better each year too so
18:48 - yeah it's
18:50 - awesome um and uh any new categories we
18:54 - can look forward to this year well one
18:57 - of our for
18:59 - um suggested that we have a category
19:03 - of um best of stem for AI and looking at
19:09 - how it impacts teaching and learning I
19:11 - can tell you who that person ised if you
19:14 - like because he's on this
19:16 - podcast I'm not I'm not trying to P
19:19 - myself on the back but it's a good
19:21 - question no I just wanted you to tell
19:23 - everybody for real that's that's one of
19:26 - them and that one has been really
19:28 - interesting because everybody knows AI
19:31 - has just been exploding and so I really
19:33 - appreciated that um suggestion and again
19:38 - we wanted to frame it in terms of
19:41 - teaching and learning what are teachers
19:44 - finding that actually works that
19:47 - actually helps because there's so much
19:49 - that's out there right now it's really
19:51 - hard to
19:52 - discern what is going to be helpful and
19:56 - what might be a trend and what might
19:57 - fade and all other kind of things yeah
19:59 - it's so new you know and it's like yes
20:02 - some of it is actual really worthy you
20:06 - know of using for the classroom tools I
20:09 - mean I don't I don't look at AI as a bad
20:13 - as a bad thing I think I I mean I use it
20:15 - myself now every day chat
20:17 - GPT um everything I'm doing is sayi now
20:23 - but uh I don't know I don't know well I
20:26 - guess I guess it'll be interesting to
20:28 - see to see who you who you get because
20:31 - um how people are using it if they're
20:33 - using it in a good way if they're using
20:35 - it in a bad way we'll find out we're
20:37 - reaching out as far as we we we can with
20:40 - this to um contact companies that are
20:43 - using Ai and encouraging them to win and
20:46 - we'd gone to the um the asug GSB show
20:51 - that had um they had what they called
20:53 - the air show which was the the AI
20:56 - Revolution and it was their first year
21:00 - um and so we met some people there to
21:03 - and we're trying to reach out as far as
21:05 - possible we really want a lot of
21:06 - applicants in that category for the
21:09 - judges to to judge so AI is one of them
21:14 - um what else did we add this year we
21:16 - added a category for entrepreneurship
21:20 - and we along side of that to one for
21:25 - invention education for uh companies who
21:29 - develop products that help students to
21:33 - both think of themselves as inventors
21:35 - but also to learn the the steps along
21:38 - the way of what it takes to
21:42 - invent um so those are interesting
21:46 - ones we've got like eight or nine
21:49 - different new ones um yeah all the
21:52 - categories are listed on the website
21:54 - guys and you can just check it out and
21:57 - see if one
21:59 - maybe you would like to you know enter
22:01 - maybe something fits yeah yeah there's
22:04 - there's some really interesting ones too
22:07 - right our and what we do each year too
22:10 - like for
22:11 - 2025 um we put out a call at the
22:14 - beginning of the year to say hey what do
22:16 - we need to be adding this year based on
22:17 - Trends and people like yourself um write
22:20 - back and tell us what it is they think
22:23 - need to be added and if we see that that
22:25 - is fitting a trend in the market We'll
22:28 - add it
22:29 - this week was actually the week that we
22:31 - said we can't take any more categories
22:33 - after Friday because we need to be able
22:35 - to give um edtech companies a whole
22:38 - month at least to see that there are new
22:40 - categories to compete in right um it's
22:45 - exciting it's exciting to see um who
22:49 - we'll be hearing from this year right
22:52 - yeah things are just moving at such a
22:56 - crazy Pace now that AI has kind of come
23:00 - about who knows what will be in a year
23:03 - in five
23:04 - years um interesting there's a parallel
23:10 - with when Google first came on the scene
23:12 - too and people were like oh man students
23:15 - can now just put into the search you
23:17 - know what does an acid-based titration
23:20 - graph look like and and you know that's
23:23 - cheating but and so I hear people saying
23:27 - that about chat GPT but you really
23:29 - nailed it when you said I use it every
23:31 - day I use this part of my work if
23:34 - students are going to be using it in
23:35 - their jobs when they from school they
23:39 - need to know yeah they need to know how
23:40 - to use it they do and they need to know
23:43 - how to use it ethically and responsibly
23:45 - and um it's actually a great way for for
23:51 - educators to teach critical thinking
23:53 - skills and and that kind of thing
23:56 - because you know this how many times do
23:58 - you use use chat GPT and you're like no
24:01 - yeah that doesn't sound right it doesn't
24:05 - sound right I better check that out
24:06 - because it's you know it's our
24:08 - reputation when we use that content
24:10 - right it's it's it's got its pluses and
24:14 - minuses I mean and you just have to kind
24:16 - of
24:17 - learn learn what those are and how to
24:19 - use them ethically like you said you
24:22 - know I mean it can make up any
24:24 - information out of the blue but you know
24:27 - we can't be doing that but yes it saves
24:30 - me so much time now that I mean I use it
24:35 - as like an a writing assistant you know
24:38 - um just ideas I um you still have to be
24:42 - the the the person behind the wheel
24:46 - that's telling it what to do and
24:48 - thinking about what to ask you know and
24:51 - those are all interesting skills to
24:53 - build you know I I find that it helps me
24:56 - think you know deep in a deeper way
24:59 - actually because it gets me going in a
25:01 - you know a whole path of directions that
25:05 - I wouldn't even have thought of but no
25:07 - you can use it verbatim guys and also
25:11 - the yeah do you find that it helps
25:14 - you when you're writing a prompt think
25:18 - through like the specificity of language
25:22 - like what words do I use that are really
25:24 - correct and specific as opposed to
25:27 - colloquial right right like sometimes I
25:30 - have to readjust what I ask it you know
25:34 - in a more specific way kind of because
25:37 - it's not exactly it's not getting it
25:39 - it's not getting what I what I'm what
25:41 - I'm getting at and then you you kind of
25:44 - just learn to really Define what you're
25:46 - trying to say
25:50 - um yeah I I think I think I use it as a
25:53 - tool kids need to be learning how to use
25:56 - it because like you said every job
25:59 - that they're going to apply for it's
26:01 - it's crazy I heard that people start
26:03 - putting chat GPT on their resumés now
26:06 - like I know how to use chat GPT and it's
26:09 - not just chat GPT I mean there's all
26:11 - these apps that are like AI apps and
26:14 - there's I mean I'm also like in design
26:17 - and
26:17 - there's design app the design aspect of
26:20 - AI I'm not so happy with personally as a
26:23 - designer just
26:24 - because um not that I'm like oh you know
26:28 - know they're going to take the job from
26:29 - the artists no I I just I don't think it
26:34 - does what a human can do yet it just
26:37 - cannot it just can't you know it's going
26:40 - to give you some madeup thing but it
26:41 - cannot replicate exactly what you need
26:43 - it to do and that I think as marketers
26:46 - you know we really need to say hey take
26:48 - my logo and put it with this kind of and
26:51 - like make it exactly how you want in
26:52 - your mind it's not there yet but maybe
26:55 - it will
26:56 - be you know I know I think it gets back
27:01 - to um the specificity of language too in
27:05 - order to make the image programs work
27:09 - you have to to know the terminology of a
27:12 - designer of an art director to be able
27:15 - to say you know style lighting
27:19 - perspective um perspective balance and
27:24 - and grids and and colors of Hues and
27:27 - those kinds of things and so it's
27:29 - interesting from that perspective but it
27:31 - does come up with some weird things one
27:33 - of my friend posted on Facebook he he
27:36 - did this beautiful image of this cabin
27:38 - in the woods and it was just gorgeous
27:41 - but the two biggest problems with it is
27:43 - there was snow outside and then there
27:45 - was also snow in the house right around
27:50 - and there was a Stairway that went to
27:53 - nothing um so I mean sometimes it just
27:56 - puts in these bizarre things
27:58 - yeah it's not there yet but it's it's
28:01 - good to just start I think a lot of
28:04 - companies are trying to push it as um
28:07 - you know a finished product and it's
28:09 - really not so whenever you see those ads
28:12 - social media for some somebody's gonna
28:14 - solve all your problems with their new
28:16 - AI thing ignore it it's not happening I
28:20 - totally yeah but it's good it's good to
28:23 - to get your you know hands in there and
28:27 - see see what's what's going to be and
28:29 - how we can use it for sure some of the
28:33 - I've seen have been horrifying oh I
28:37 - that's what I'm saying like I'll I'll be
28:39 - like here make me this per and it'll be
28:41 - perfect except they have six fingers you
28:43 - know on their hand and then yeah just
28:46 - not doing
28:49 - it yeah um on another note interesting
28:54 - you're a swimmer I am a swimmer yeah
28:58 - that's so cool my son is a swimmer too
29:00 - so I was like oh she's a
29:02 - swimmer I I've always been a swimmer I
29:05 - grew up in California so I um so I I
29:10 - swam in the ocean a lot as a kid I
29:12 - wasn't on a swim team or anything like
29:13 - that and I didn't really learn to swim
29:17 - with like good stroke and good form
29:20 - actually till the last few years I'm
29:23 - definitely self-taught but I've I've
29:24 - worked with coaches along the way but
29:27 - mostly for me I it's quiet underw it's
29:33 - quiet and I can exercise and breathe
29:36 - it's almost like a it's almost like a
29:39 - meditation I think um when you're
29:42 - swimming and you get into this Rhythm
29:45 - where you're concentrating on your
29:46 - breath and you're concentrating on your
29:47 - stroke and you're staring at a black
29:49 - line for a long time and that's so
29:51 - important I mean like we need that we
29:55 - need that healthy physical meditative
29:58 - state to be able to to work really to
30:03 - use our minds in in in in our jobs we
30:07 - have to it's so important to balance
30:08 - that physical mental yeah and it's one
30:13 - of the reasons that I actually founded
30:15 - catapult X too is I
30:18 - wanted um I wanted truly to be able
30:21 - to balance my my health my family my son
30:27 - my work my friendships and it's really
30:30 - hard to do when you have a big role when
30:33 - I was a chief marketing officer it
30:35 - that's a big job and there are a lot of
30:37 - people that depend on you and it's
30:40 - very difficult to balance um and I
30:45 - wanted I just realized and it took me a
30:49 - long time to realize this I'm Gen X so
30:53 - kind of taught to work hard and grind
30:55 - and get it done and that kind of stuff
30:58 - but you know when it comes down to it
31:00 - time is our most precious resource and
31:03 - how we choose to use that time and who
31:05 - we spend it with and how we take care of
31:08 - our bodies is the most important thing
31:11 - we do in a day even if we love our work
31:14 - right yeah I'm finding that I need to
31:18 - think more about that balance because my
31:21 - mind is so into my work and not even
31:25 - because anybody's pressuring me it's for
31:27 - my own you know passion to do it and get
31:30 - things done the right way and how I want
31:32 - it to you know come out but it's it's
31:36 - really hard for me to make that
31:37 - disconnect like I come home I have three
31:39 - kids little kids and it's hard because I
31:43 - like still want to check my phone you
31:44 - know I'm answering an email or look
31:46 - doing Social Media stuff or whatever it
31:49 - is that you know and then I realize like
31:51 - I'm I'm a little bit neglecting my
31:53 - kids when I come home I need to shut it
31:56 - down uh oh my bosses are be watching
31:58 - this maybe I
32:00 - should just kidding yeah I think your
32:04 - bosses are uh gonna say that putting
32:06 - your kids first is also the right of
32:09 - course yeah they're not pressuring me
32:11 - I'm just putting that out there they're
32:12 - not telling me to do that yeah I I
32:15 - totally hear you you know it becomes
32:16 - internal drive for for those of us that
32:19 - love the work that we do and yeah want
32:22 - to keep growing and learning it becomes
32:24 - this internal drive um where we just
32:27 - kind of have to cut it off and say no
32:29 - this is my time to focus on what a
32:32 - four-year-old needs or a six-year-old
32:34 - needs or those types of things or for me
32:36 - now a 21 year old my son's 21 so oh cool
32:40 - yeah I I can't imagine when my mine are
32:43 - three nine and
32:46 - 10 so I can't wait for those days when I
32:50 - can have a nice adult conversation at
32:52 - the dinner table with them you know you
32:56 - say that now but if there do you have
32:58 - girls or boys or I I have one girl and
33:01 - two boys yeah um the girl the girls tend
33:06 - to share more at least in my experience
33:09 - of what's going on my son is 21 and when
33:12 - he wants to have this nice adult
33:15 - conversation it's typically on something
33:18 - that's controversial in the world and
33:19 - I'm like
33:23 - oh because he's learning about all of
33:25 - those things in college and so that's
33:27 - what he wants to
33:28 - to talk right so and do you tend to
33:30 - agree with him or do you tend to say oh
33:33 - God here we go again you know I think
33:36 - that it's more complex than he does
33:38 - because I've been around for longer um
33:43 - so I don't want to get into politics but
33:47 - um and I won't
33:50 - but sometimes what he sees as more
33:52 - simple and
33:54 - straightforward I kind of step back and
33:56 - say you know
33:58 - I've been learning about that for 50
34:02 - years and I see it as complex and
34:07 - nuanced and there's it Shades of Gray
34:11 - and there's no good people and bad
34:13 - people
34:16 - it's it's complex and I think that
34:21 - college students see it
34:25 - as H the they learn about it from one
34:29 - perspective and they get really excited
34:31 - about knowing that perspective and the
34:34 - that they learn and they're surrounded
34:36 - by that group of people that are all
34:38 - also honed in on that idea they start to
34:41 - have their blinders
34:43 - on yeah whereas it does get more complex
34:47 - and
34:48 - um and there and I'm also smart enough
34:51 - to know when I shouldn't have an opinion
34:53 - on things because I'm not knowledgeable
34:57 - enough in that area so well that's a
35:03 - wise statement to say because many many
35:06 - people many people don't realize that
35:09 - maybe they don't know everything yeah
35:12 - it's true yeah I think that's one of the
35:14 - gifts of being um farther along in my
35:18 - career yeah but it's nice that you're
35:20 - it's nice that your son is is looking to
35:23 - you you know for those conversations and
35:25 - for that advice you know I mean it could
35:28 - go it could go the opposite like oh my
35:30 - mom she doesn't you know my mom no it
35:33 - trust me it goes that rout sometimes
35:35 - where where it's not that he's
35:37 - necessarily wanting my opinion it's that
35:39 - he wants to show me how much he knows
35:41 - and how independent he's getting and how
35:43 - smart he's getting in those kinds of
35:45 - things and one of the ways to do that is
35:47 - like Mom you don't know what you're
35:49 - talking
35:50 - about and that's so wait when you say
35:52 - you're a mama geek I think I read that
35:55 - somewhere what do you what do you mean
35:56 - by that well my son's a computer science
35:59 - major oh and he has been interested in
36:05 - um engineering and computer science for
36:08 - a long time like he started making his
36:10 - own little web web apps and things like
36:13 - that when he was like nine or 10 um and
36:17 - he's been interested in technology for a
36:19 - long time I actually I will never forget
36:21 - he was little little like four and we
36:25 - were walking through the office is at
36:28 - verer and David verer was in his office
36:31 - and his door open and daav is it Dave is
36:36 - very creative from a technical
36:38 - standpoint he's like really creative and
36:40 - he's got technology all over his office
36:42 - and that kind of stuff we walked into
36:44 - Dave's office so that I could uh you
36:47 - know have my son say hi to him and my
36:51 - son looked at all the stuff that was in
36:54 - Dave's office and he was like his eyes
36:59 - got big and His Hands kind of started to
37:01 - like and I'm like no don't touch things
37:04 - but he was so excited about it so when I
37:07 - say I'm a mom mam geek um it's both my
37:12 - own interest in science but it's also
37:16 - that that I've needed to nurture this
37:19 - person who came out of my body who is so
37:23 - interested in things that I never
37:26 - thought about before or or truly am not
37:31 - innately interested in and so nurturing
37:34 - his curiosity nurturing his ability to
37:37 - understand um
37:40 - that like failure in invention is a
37:45 - wonderful learning tool that Engineers
37:48 - don't fear failure they look at it as a
37:52 - learning process how do I iterate next
37:55 - so it's both kind of an in internal
37:58 - thing that um I love I personally love
38:01 - the life sciences but I have needed to
38:04 - nurture this little person
38:07 - who is interested in things just beyond
38:10 - what I've ever thought about so that's
38:13 - geek has always kind of meant to me so
38:16 - he's taught you to be a a
38:18 - geek he or at least how things work
38:23 - because before I had him I was very
38:25 - utilitarian in the way that I used
38:28 - technology I wanted it to just do what I
38:31 - wanted it to do and he's interested in
38:35 - how it works how it was developed um how
38:39 - it functions and those kinds of things
38:41 - so I've learned from him in in terms of
38:45 - that and I've learned from him in terms
38:47 - of um you know wanting to spark that
38:51 - interest and creativity with him um so
38:56 - it's been it's been a journey that if
38:59 - you had told me when I was
39:01 - 25 that I would be on I don't know that
39:04 - I would have believed you
39:06 - so yeah wait before
39:10 - we uh we we we close up I I got to ask
39:13 - you about your concussion story that you
39:17 - kind of hinted at I didn't hear the
39:19 - whole story can you tell about you know
39:22 - it's one of the reasons that I founded
39:23 - catapult X is that as I mentioned before
39:26 - I really wanted to um I really wanted to
39:30 - have my own agency and be able to take
39:32 - care of my health because I had gotten
39:34 - to the point um in my career where I was
39:39 - just running myself raging and um I
39:44 - was I was working really hard we had a
39:48 - new um we had some new administration at
39:51 - the company I was with
39:53 - and that was adding a lot of new
39:55 - products and I was I was doing too much
39:59 - and I was also working on I was just
40:02 - working on a lot of things all at the
40:04 - same time and I was at the isty show I
40:06 - don't know if you've been to isty before
40:07 - but yeah we're going we're going this
40:09 - year as a company to Denver yeah so I
40:13 - went to the IST that was in San Antonio
40:15 - and this was in
40:17 - 2017 and uh there were a bunch of things
40:22 - that contributed to it working too much
40:25 - but also I um
40:28 - I'd go it i' gone outside I was sit
40:31 - sitting outside in San Antonio I was
40:33 - listening to beautiful music on the
40:35 - waterfront I had lunch it was out there
40:38 - for a couple of hours it didn't really
40:40 - seem hot I walked up the stairs to go
40:42 - back to my
40:44 - hotel and I was really dizzy and I
40:48 - blacked out I completely blacked out and
40:51 - fainted and I hit my head face forward
40:55 - on the concrete like right here and
40:59 - because I had fainted you know you don't
41:01 - put out your arms for anything
41:04 - you stop it and I have broad shoulders
41:08 - and and a big rib cage so a lot of my
41:11 - weight is above my waist and
41:14 - I I just hit face first and
41:19 - um and I had a
41:21 - concussion and
41:24 - concussions concussions are weird
41:27 - um one I learned that a lot of doctors
41:31 - don't even really know that much about
41:32 - concussions and a lot of doctors that
41:34 - even specialize in concussions are still
41:37 - learning a lot of things
41:40 - um but I looked fine and normal to
41:43 - everybody so that was part of the thing
41:45 - is I was at work and I looked fine and
41:47 - normal to everybody but I was not fine
41:48 - and normal and I did you feel that you
41:51 - your memory was missing or things were
41:54 - foggy to you or you know the first time
41:57 - time I knew something was wrong was I
42:00 - went into work and I went to go put my
42:04 - um my code into the keypad to get into
42:08 - work and it was I do that though well
42:12 - but it was a code I had used for my
42:15 - entire time there right and I didn't
42:18 - know what it was and I I mean I couldn't
42:22 - even get close and I was trying it over
42:24 - and over again and I thought okay
42:26 - something's wrong here here that was the
42:28 - first time that I knew something was
42:30 - wrong and then I started to get
42:31 - headaches and then I started to um get
42:34 - nausea and and vision problems the
42:37 - vision problems were probably the worst
42:39 - um but on the outside I looked fine and
42:44 - I would tell people I was that's always
42:47 - a trigger word for me is when people say
42:49 - they're fine I'm like oo are
42:52 - you
42:53 - right so so it ended up and it was on
42:58 - the job because I was at isty and so it
43:02 - ended up that it took about five months
43:04 - for workman's comp to even come up with
43:07 - paperwork that said yes she's had a
43:09 - traumatic brain
43:11 - injury but by
43:13 - then
43:15 - oh by then then I had still had a lot to
43:18 - heal from so the it's a much much longer
43:24 - story than that but the the short end of
43:26 - it is I I stepped away from my role as
43:30 - Chief marketing officer um there's a lot
43:34 - more to that story as well but I stepped
43:37 - away I started catapult a and you know
43:40 - the first year I just you started after
43:42 - you were like really healed or I no I
43:45 - wasn't um wow that's
43:48 - amazing well to start a company is hard
43:51 - enough to start a company with a
43:53 - concussion I know well that you know
43:57 - that first year I just went really slow
43:59 - and did what I could and I worked short
44:04 - days I would work four or five hours a
44:06 - day but I would work seven days a week
44:08 - because um that's what I needed to do
44:12 - but I also you know if if you're looking
44:14 - at it and you're saying okay I'm G to
44:16 - work five hours a day seven days a week
44:19 - I can break it up I can um get out in
44:22 - the sunshine I can go to all my doctor's
44:24 - appointments I can do all of those kinds
44:27 - of things um but it it did it took a
44:31 - long time to really fully
44:34 - hear heal from um and I had some just
44:38 - great companies that worked with me that
44:43 - I am so grateful for today because they
44:45 - took a chance on me and said let's do
44:48 - this project let's do that project and
44:51 - those kinds of things and so for me it
44:53 - really took off more ironically in 2020
44:58 - um so that's amazing and it probably I
45:03 - mean sometimes traumatic events like
45:05 - that are turning points that really
45:08 - light a fire you know under you and
45:11 - amazing things come out of it it's true
45:15 - and I tell people I wouldn't
45:18 - say um I do it all over again because if
45:23 - I had fallen
45:25 - differently I could have I could have
45:27 - died right and um and it was also a
45:30 - wakeup call that I was just handling far
45:33 - too much right but it was a turning
45:37 - point and where I am now oh my gosh I
45:39 - work with just some of the most amazing
45:42 - companies as clients and I love having
45:45 - my own business and I love being able to
45:49 - um build my business around values that
45:52 - are important to me of good science
45:54 - education and people being healthy and I
45:57 - don't have employees I have
45:58 - collaborators and that I mean I
46:01 - literally work with other people who
46:04 - have their own Consulting business and
46:06 - we collaborate on projects together as
46:08 - opposed to having employees and I love
46:11 - that um yeah that's great yeah it works
46:14 - really well for me so um so I am com

Cleaned transcript:

hey there Educators parents and all lovers of computer science welcome to the code monkey banana cast where we talk about the important issues you care about from edtech stem education reducing your teacher workload being a working parent and all that goes along with that Co monk is an awardwinning K througha curriculum here to make learning computer science a blast for kids everywhere so let's swing into this adventure to together and talk about the stuff that matters welcome to the banana cast I'm Karen your host from code monkey and today we have denen long she is the founder of best of stem and Deen nice to have you on and can you tell us a little bit about let's start with maybe your background sure so best of stem is a actually a program that's run by my company which is catapult X and um I started catapult X six years ago and it has just been a great journey so it was 2018 when I started it and with regards to best of stem one of the things that I wanted to be able to do was I had I've been the chief marketing officer at verer software and technology for 15 years great company very welln um and really well respected we entered a lot of awards and um what I found was they weren't they were what I kind of called handshake Awards meaning that if you knew somebody in the organization um or you were connected with the right people in the organization you were much more likely to win and I really wanted something that was judged by teachers I wanted I wanted to put the teachers on on in the spotlight and say what is that you like about these products would you recommend these to a friend uh and I wanted to give them the same kind of agency that they have when they're actually selecting products where they can say you know what that's a deal breaker for us in our district that's a complete deal breaker no matter what it is um and I'll give you an example one of our judges um he had a product that he was he was judging that he liked but he wasn't super excited about it but then he came across some imagery in it that um was unsafe for Science and for him that was a deal breaker he said if I were in a recommendation committee at my district anything that was unsafe for science any that um was discriminatory or that was um didn't represent the population of his district meaning like you know everybody's Caucasian or something like like those he said we kick those out um and I wanted to be able to teachers to have that agency so um so when I started catapult X best of stem is one of the things that that I really wanted to to build alongside of it the core of our business is market research we say that we amplify educator voices through market research that um edtech companies can trust right but best of stem um becomes this SE celebratory moment in the middle of the Year too and it's a wonderful way for me to um build relationships with some of the Ed tech companies would you say that um you kind of started in marketing and kind of evolved into this edtech uh world or or or one or one came before the next I so I started there's a local company uh here in Oregon that was called porman Douglas and it was a privately owned company and I started there and I was really fortunate to get to work um with a man named Jeff Baker and Jeff was the president of porman Douglas and as I kind of grew and evolved I realized that marketing was something that I was naturally good at it just came easily to me and I was naturally good at it and so I started studying and do taking courses and things like that is that because you're a more creative brain or cuz you're really more into the data right your company catapult X so what what side of marketing are you you know personally personally that's a great question I tell people that if marketing is a spectrum with like super creative over here like you know your ad people that are coming up with headlines and videos and super analytical over here your data scientists strict data science I'm probably here I'm creating but creativity only get you so far if you don't have good analytics right good data to make your decisions on so right yeah it's important yeah so then so I got into edtech when I left um porman Douglas I took a job at a small company called educational Productions as their marketing director and that's when I fell in love with edtech that's when I fell in love with with um being in education technology and doing marketing at education technology um it's funny you know and I'm sure you've experienced this too when you're on life's journey sometimes you you hit these points that you're like okay this makes sense this is where I fit this is what I love and it's almost like it was for a reason that you bumped onto this path you know so random but it just it feels right exactly that's exactly the way I felt with this company uh it was a small company it was um maybe a million in revenue and just a handful of people all women actually it was a woman owned and run company um I was there for three years and when the job opportunity reneer came along it was kind of like all my background came together because I had studied science in college I'd studied biology and I originally kind of wanted to go into the Health Sciences um I studied biology and chemistry and organic chemistry and um statistics and calculus and those kinds of things so for me when the job came up at verer it was another one of those moments where it kind of hones everything together um because I at least understood the language of science I understood the purpose of science I was by no means a scientist but I was definitely a marketer but I underst understand and respect science and so um so things really came together for me when I was when I was there at berer so um if we can talk a little bit about uh the best of stem it's award program um for um a tech company and Educators for their for their programs um uh maybe tell us a little bit about um maybe the impact you've seen it made on Educators and edte companies um and and and um has has there been any shifts you know in the years that um you've done it as far as how the technology has progressed um in edtech and in schools well yeah that was our first really big pivot was we introduced best of stem in 2020 and um we were doing it alongside nsta um and then the whole world changed and so what became what started off as an inperson event quickly switched to dig lonely which has been great that has been much better in the long run for the Ed tech companies and so that's been terrific so I mentioned earlier and I probably had jumped the gun there that um that I started it because I wanted teachers to be able to to be the ones who were making decisions about which products were best for the classroom and um and that's been terrific and the judges that we recruit and that we work with are amazing and for them they like being able to they tell us what they're interested in what their background is what their area of expertise and for them a lot of them really like to tout that they are a best of stem judge they also like to explore the products and get to know some of the the vendor companies um and how do you ensure fairness and impartiality you know during the judging process like maybe they know somebody in that company or you there's a couple things there the first is that when I started this program it was really clear that I didn't want catapult X to pick the winners I didn't want our partners like nsta or nabt or MCH strategic data to pick the winners and they didn't want to either either so I contacted a longtime friend of mine Annie Galvan tyke and she had been really instrumental in putting together the um teachers Choice Awards with learning ma magazine so I asked if she wanted to work on this with me and she was excited to do so so the first step of making sure everything is fair and impartial is that Annie deals with all of the the judges um so that in the very end what we get is a piece of paper that says these are the finalists these are the winners so that's the very first step is we have a wall where it's really clear what Annie deals with and it's really clear what I deal with um the second is you mentioned like maybe they know somebody at the company well our judges are really they're really upfront they're really transparent and so they'll tell us I can't judge this company because I do workshops for them in the summer or I can't judge this company because um I'm a consultant for them on a product um that helps right yeah and um what kind of products are are you or the judges looking for like uh for the winner basically what what advice would you give to applicants maybe to increase their chances of being selected as a winner if we can get that tip from I think the only one that I can really provide is that it it works best when a judge who is a teacher at heart and in practice gets to talk to somebody at your company about the product that is also a teacher or a former teacher or an educator someone who's still they may be working in edtech but they still primarily identify as I'm a teacher I'm an educator um the reason that becomes magic is because those people in your company can say hey here's how I would have used it in my classroom or um or here's what I found were problems or barriers when I was a teacher and here's how this product solved it so a couple of things happen one there's just a better communication that happens between the judge and the edtech company um but the second thing is too that the judges don't feel like somebody's trying to sell them on something that they're trying to say oh you know what I noticed you're in this District um and those kind kinds of things so that's my best piece of advice is when you choose the person that's going to be interacting with your judge choose somebody who's had time recently in the classroom and when I say recently in the last five six years is really where you want to be right that's that's a great piece of advice thank you yeah for sharing that um can you share any maybe can you think of any success story from previous best of some winners that maybe stand out to you you know um there have been some really fun ones there's been um stem Sports last year was a fun one they're a smaller organization but when they won they they did this really super cute Tick Tock Style video and of them like kicking a soccer ball around and being all it in that kind of stuff and that was really that was really neat and it leveraged their promotion for it because they had a a video that was engaging that they could post on social media and that kind of stuff so that was kind of a little one that was fun um the other one that that comes to mind is early on we had a best customer service category oh and we also had um Educators could could do writeins we don't do this quite like this anymore but Educators could do writeins too and we started seeing that a bunch of people were writing in the company biorad and what was interesting about that is Bored hadn't entered that category and but they were getting a lot for it and we started talking to teachers about why they were mentioning bio and they said you know it's not so much that they have great like technical support they do but it's more that when I get my stuff it always works it always works and so to them that was what best customer service meant was they could consistently and reliably look at these products and say it's always going to work for my me and my classroom and if I have questions they would go to their the website and their answers would be there so it was a new Twist on um what customer support meant to them that it's not picking up the phone necessarily anymore it's also what are your online resources what are the resources in the product what are all the things that make this really teacher friendly so right those are those are two that really kind of come to mind off the top of my head that have been interesting stories so I just want want to say you know like it just popped into my head but uh your your marketing toolkit that that you guys offer to the winners um which is really great guys it's um you know it has all the all the um logos you can use for best of stem and everything like that you know what you should do on your social posts it was it was the Catalyst actually for our marketing toolkit we don't use it in the same exact way you know we have images like for our characters and all that kind of stuff but I just wanted to just tell you that that that is it's just a great program it's just it's very well thought out and organized and it was actually helpful for me well two interesting things about that one is that was one of our first goals with best of stem and with catapult X we wanted to be able to provide resources for companies that we're working with that make it easy for them to get um to get that kind of marketing that becomes organic right and so the toolkit itself has evolved over time and last year was the first time we partnered with uh Leon Consulting Group who specializes in social media and they specialize in um uh Community platforms and so they helped us take what we were doing and then up at a level and really give um a lot of super healthy tips in there and so and we're using um we're using the same format with the toolkit and we are partnering again this year with Leon Consulting Group on that to help us build things out because they they stay on top of all of those things yeah and it it's it's great to be part of best of stem because just makes it easy you know as a marketing department um you know that's part of the reason we're we're we're entering yeah so yeah that's exactly it and yeah we try to those hooks in place we try to get a little bit better each year too so yeah it's awesome um and uh any new categories we can look forward to this year well one of our for um suggested that we have a category of um best of stem for AI and looking at how it impacts teaching and learning I can tell you who that person ised if you like because he's on this podcast I'm not I'm not trying to P myself on the back but it's a good question no I just wanted you to tell everybody for real that's that's one of them and that one has been really interesting because everybody knows AI has just been exploding and so I really appreciated that um suggestion and again we wanted to frame it in terms of teaching and learning what are teachers finding that actually works that actually helps because there's so much that's out there right now it's really hard to discern what is going to be helpful and what might be a trend and what might fade and all other kind of things yeah it's so new you know and it's like yes some of it is actual really worthy you know of using for the classroom tools I mean I don't I don't look at AI as a bad as a bad thing I think I I mean I use it myself now every day chat GPT um everything I'm doing is sayi now but uh I don't know I don't know well I guess I guess it'll be interesting to see to see who you who you get because um how people are using it if they're using it in a good way if they're using it in a bad way we'll find out we're reaching out as far as we we we can with this to um contact companies that are using Ai and encouraging them to win and we'd gone to the um the asug GSB show that had um they had what they called the air show which was the the AI Revolution and it was their first year um and so we met some people there to and we're trying to reach out as far as possible we really want a lot of applicants in that category for the judges to to judge so AI is one of them um what else did we add this year we added a category for entrepreneurship and we along side of that to one for invention education for uh companies who develop products that help students to both think of themselves as inventors but also to learn the the steps along the way of what it takes to invent um so those are interesting ones we've got like eight or nine different new ones um yeah all the categories are listed on the website guys and you can just check it out and see if one maybe you would like to you know enter maybe something fits yeah yeah there's there's some really interesting ones too right our and what we do each year too like for 2025 um we put out a call at the beginning of the year to say hey what do we need to be adding this year based on Trends and people like yourself um write back and tell us what it is they think need to be added and if we see that that is fitting a trend in the market We'll add it this week was actually the week that we said we can't take any more categories after Friday because we need to be able to give um edtech companies a whole month at least to see that there are new categories to compete in right um it's exciting it's exciting to see um who we'll be hearing from this year right yeah things are just moving at such a crazy Pace now that AI has kind of come about who knows what will be in a year in five years um interesting there's a parallel with when Google first came on the scene too and people were like oh man students can now just put into the search you know what does an acidbased titration graph look like and and you know that's cheating but and so I hear people saying that about chat GPT but you really nailed it when you said I use it every day I use this part of my work if students are going to be using it in their jobs when they from school they need to know yeah they need to know how to use it they do and they need to know how to use it ethically and responsibly and um it's actually a great way for for educators to teach critical thinking skills and and that kind of thing because you know this how many times do you use use chat GPT and you're like no yeah that doesn't sound right it doesn't sound right I better check that out because it's you know it's our reputation when we use that content right it's it's it's got its pluses and minuses I mean and you just have to kind of learn learn what those are and how to use them ethically like you said you know I mean it can make up any information out of the blue but you know we can't be doing that but yes it saves me so much time now that I mean I use it as like an a writing assistant you know um just ideas I um you still have to be the the the person behind the wheel that's telling it what to do and thinking about what to ask you know and those are all interesting skills to build you know I I find that it helps me think you know deep in a deeper way actually because it gets me going in a you know a whole path of directions that I wouldn't even have thought of but no you can use it verbatim guys and also the yeah do you find that it helps you when you're writing a prompt think through like the specificity of language like what words do I use that are really correct and specific as opposed to colloquial right right like sometimes I have to readjust what I ask it you know in a more specific way kind of because it's not exactly it's not getting it it's not getting what I what I'm what I'm getting at and then you you kind of just learn to really Define what you're trying to say um yeah I I think I think I use it as a tool kids need to be learning how to use it because like you said every job that they're going to apply for it's it's crazy I heard that people start putting chat GPT on their resumés now like I know how to use chat GPT and it's not just chat GPT I mean there's all these apps that are like AI apps and there's I mean I'm also like in design and there's design app the design aspect of AI I'm not so happy with personally as a designer just because um not that I'm like oh you know know they're going to take the job from the artists no I I just I don't think it does what a human can do yet it just cannot it just can't you know it's going to give you some madeup thing but it cannot replicate exactly what you need it to do and that I think as marketers you know we really need to say hey take my logo and put it with this kind of and like make it exactly how you want in your mind it's not there yet but maybe it will be you know I know I think it gets back to um the specificity of language too in order to make the image programs work you have to to know the terminology of a designer of an art director to be able to say you know style lighting perspective um perspective balance and and grids and and colors of Hues and those kinds of things and so it's interesting from that perspective but it does come up with some weird things one of my friend posted on Facebook he he did this beautiful image of this cabin in the woods and it was just gorgeous but the two biggest problems with it is there was snow outside and then there was also snow in the house right around and there was a Stairway that went to nothing um so I mean sometimes it just puts in these bizarre things yeah it's not there yet but it's it's good to just start I think a lot of companies are trying to push it as um you know a finished product and it's really not so whenever you see those ads social media for some somebody's gonna solve all your problems with their new AI thing ignore it it's not happening I totally yeah but it's good it's good to to get your you know hands in there and see see what's what's going to be and how we can use it for sure some of the I've seen have been horrifying oh I that's what I'm saying like I'll I'll be like here make me this per and it'll be perfect except they have six fingers you know on their hand and then yeah just not doing it yeah um on another note interesting you're a swimmer I am a swimmer yeah that's so cool my son is a swimmer too so I was like oh she's a swimmer I I've always been a swimmer I grew up in California so I um so I I swam in the ocean a lot as a kid I wasn't on a swim team or anything like that and I didn't really learn to swim with like good stroke and good form actually till the last few years I'm definitely selftaught but I've I've worked with coaches along the way but mostly for me I it's quiet underw it's quiet and I can exercise and breathe it's almost like a it's almost like a meditation I think um when you're swimming and you get into this Rhythm where you're concentrating on your breath and you're concentrating on your stroke and you're staring at a black line for a long time and that's so important I mean like we need that we need that healthy physical meditative state to be able to to work really to use our minds in in in in our jobs we have to it's so important to balance that physical mental yeah and it's one of the reasons that I actually founded catapult X too is I wanted um I wanted truly to be able to balance my my health my family my son my work my friendships and it's really hard to do when you have a big role when I was a chief marketing officer it that's a big job and there are a lot of people that depend on you and it's very difficult to balance um and I wanted I just realized and it took me a long time to realize this I'm Gen X so kind of taught to work hard and grind and get it done and that kind of stuff but you know when it comes down to it time is our most precious resource and how we choose to use that time and who we spend it with and how we take care of our bodies is the most important thing we do in a day even if we love our work right yeah I'm finding that I need to think more about that balance because my mind is so into my work and not even because anybody's pressuring me it's for my own you know passion to do it and get things done the right way and how I want it to you know come out but it's it's really hard for me to make that disconnect like I come home I have three kids little kids and it's hard because I like still want to check my phone you know I'm answering an email or look doing Social Media stuff or whatever it is that you know and then I realize like I'm I'm a little bit neglecting my kids when I come home I need to shut it down uh oh my bosses are be watching this maybe I should just kidding yeah I think your bosses are uh gonna say that putting your kids first is also the right of course yeah they're not pressuring me I'm just putting that out there they're not telling me to do that yeah I I totally hear you you know it becomes internal drive for for those of us that love the work that we do and yeah want to keep growing and learning it becomes this internal drive um where we just kind of have to cut it off and say no this is my time to focus on what a fouryearold needs or a sixyearold needs or those types of things or for me now a 21 year old my son's 21 so oh cool yeah I I can't imagine when my mine are three nine and 10 so I can't wait for those days when I can have a nice adult conversation at the dinner table with them you know you say that now but if there do you have girls or boys or I I have one girl and two boys yeah um the girl the girls tend to share more at least in my experience of what's going on my son is 21 and when he wants to have this nice adult conversation it's typically on something that's controversial in the world and I'm like oh because he's learning about all of those things in college and so that's what he wants to to talk right so and do you tend to agree with him or do you tend to say oh God here we go again you know I think that it's more complex than he does because I've been around for longer um so I don't want to get into politics but um and I won't but sometimes what he sees as more simple and straightforward I kind of step back and say you know I've been learning about that for 50 years and I see it as complex and nuanced and there's it Shades of Gray and there's no good people and bad people it's it's complex and I think that college students see it as H the they learn about it from one perspective and they get really excited about knowing that perspective and the that they learn and they're surrounded by that group of people that are all also honed in on that idea they start to have their blinders on yeah whereas it does get more complex and um and there and I'm also smart enough to know when I shouldn't have an opinion on things because I'm not knowledgeable enough in that area so well that's a wise statement to say because many many people many people don't realize that maybe they don't know everything yeah it's true yeah I think that's one of the gifts of being um farther along in my career yeah but it's nice that you're it's nice that your son is is looking to you you know for those conversations and for that advice you know I mean it could go it could go the opposite like oh my mom she doesn't you know my mom no it trust me it goes that rout sometimes where where it's not that he's necessarily wanting my opinion it's that he wants to show me how much he knows and how independent he's getting and how smart he's getting in those kinds of things and one of the ways to do that is like Mom you don't know what you're talking about and that's so wait when you say you're a mama geek I think I read that somewhere what do you what do you mean by that well my son's a computer science major oh and he has been interested in um engineering and computer science for a long time like he started making his own little web web apps and things like that when he was like nine or 10 um and he's been interested in technology for a long time I actually I will never forget he was little little like four and we were walking through the office is at verer and David verer was in his office and his door open and daav is it Dave is very creative from a technical standpoint he's like really creative and he's got technology all over his office and that kind of stuff we walked into Dave's office so that I could uh you know have my son say hi to him and my son looked at all the stuff that was in Dave's office and he was like his eyes got big and His Hands kind of started to like and I'm like no don't touch things but he was so excited about it so when I say I'm a mom mam geek um it's both my own interest in science but it's also that that I've needed to nurture this person who came out of my body who is so interested in things that I never thought about before or or truly am not innately interested in and so nurturing his curiosity nurturing his ability to understand um that like failure in invention is a wonderful learning tool that Engineers don't fear failure they look at it as a learning process how do I iterate next so it's both kind of an in internal thing that um I love I personally love the life sciences but I have needed to nurture this little person who is interested in things just beyond what I've ever thought about so that's geek has always kind of meant to me so he's taught you to be a a geek he or at least how things work because before I had him I was very utilitarian in the way that I used technology I wanted it to just do what I wanted it to do and he's interested in how it works how it was developed um how it functions and those kinds of things so I've learned from him in in terms of that and I've learned from him in terms of um you know wanting to spark that interest and creativity with him um so it's been it's been a journey that if you had told me when I was 25 that I would be on I don't know that I would have believed you so yeah wait before we uh we we we close up I I got to ask you about your concussion story that you kind of hinted at I didn't hear the whole story can you tell about you know it's one of the reasons that I founded catapult X is that as I mentioned before I really wanted to um I really wanted to have my own agency and be able to take care of my health because I had gotten to the point um in my career where I was just running myself raging and um I was I was working really hard we had a new um we had some new administration at the company I was with and that was adding a lot of new products and I was I was doing too much and I was also working on I was just working on a lot of things all at the same time and I was at the isty show I don't know if you've been to isty before but yeah we're going we're going this year as a company to Denver yeah so I went to the IST that was in San Antonio and this was in 2017 and uh there were a bunch of things that contributed to it working too much but also I um I'd go it i' gone outside I was sit sitting outside in San Antonio I was listening to beautiful music on the waterfront I had lunch it was out there for a couple of hours it didn't really seem hot I walked up the stairs to go back to my hotel and I was really dizzy and I blacked out I completely blacked out and fainted and I hit my head face forward on the concrete like right here and because I had fainted you know you don't put out your arms for anything you stop it and I have broad shoulders and and a big rib cage so a lot of my weight is above my waist and I I just hit face first and um and I had a concussion and concussions concussions are weird um one I learned that a lot of doctors don't even really know that much about concussions and a lot of doctors that even specialize in concussions are still learning a lot of things um but I looked fine and normal to everybody so that was part of the thing is I was at work and I looked fine and normal to everybody but I was not fine and normal and I did you feel that you your memory was missing or things were foggy to you or you know the first time time I knew something was wrong was I went into work and I went to go put my um my code into the keypad to get into work and it was I do that though well but it was a code I had used for my entire time there right and I didn't know what it was and I I mean I couldn't even get close and I was trying it over and over again and I thought okay something's wrong here here that was the first time that I knew something was wrong and then I started to get headaches and then I started to um get nausea and and vision problems the vision problems were probably the worst um but on the outside I looked fine and I would tell people I was that's always a trigger word for me is when people say they're fine I'm like oo are you right so so it ended up and it was on the job because I was at isty and so it ended up that it took about five months for workman's comp to even come up with paperwork that said yes she's had a traumatic brain injury but by then oh by then then I had still had a lot to heal from so the it's a much much longer story than that but the the short end of it is I I stepped away from my role as Chief marketing officer um there's a lot more to that story as well but I stepped away I started catapult a and you know the first year I just you started after you were like really healed or I no I wasn't um wow that's amazing well to start a company is hard enough to start a company with a concussion I know well that you know that first year I just went really slow and did what I could and I worked short days I would work four or five hours a day but I would work seven days a week because um that's what I needed to do but I also you know if if you're looking at it and you're saying okay I'm G to work five hours a day seven days a week I can break it up I can um get out in the sunshine I can go to all my doctor's appointments I can do all of those kinds of things um but it it did it took a long time to really fully hear heal from um and I had some just great companies that worked with me that I am so grateful for today because they took a chance on me and said let's do this project let's do that project and those kinds of things and so for me it really took off more ironically in 2020 um so that's amazing and it probably I mean sometimes traumatic events like that are turning points that really light a fire you know under you and amazing things come out of it it's true and I tell people I wouldn't say um I do it all over again because if I had fallen differently I could have I could have died right and um and it was also a wakeup call that I was just handling far too much right but it was a turning point and where I am now oh my gosh I work with just some of the most amazing companies as clients and I love having my own business and I love being able to um build my business around values that are important to me of good science education and people being healthy and I don't have employees I have collaborators and that I mean I literally work with other people who have their own Consulting business and we collaborate on projects together as opposed to having employees and I love that um yeah that's great yeah it works really well for me so um so I am com completely healed now um and and really started to be like around 2020 so it's been good it's been um it's been really good um I'm grateful for that you're a role model you really are because just you know everything you know you can read about denen is impressive enough but now to know that she had a concussion while she was doing some of this stuff you have no excuses guys I know no really the the two longest things that took the longest to heal and doctors will tell you this is not uncommon um is one I had incredible fatigue just kind of like where I felt like somebody turned turned the off button um and concussions are are known for that that was one of the that took me the longest to heal from and the second was my vision you don't realize how much energy goes into all the things that you need to see and um and my vision was really off and I spent a long time with a neuro optometrist retraining my vision and um so those were kind of the two things in the the first two years of my my company that I had to concentrate on the most with my health was the fatigue and my vision right sounds like covid well yeah not really probably a lot worse um it was a lot worse worse yeah but but just like Co I mean it kind of it changed us you know it changed the world it changed our perspective and I mean it's kind of crazy we were talking about before you know like spending more time on the things that matter and and those kind of things shake you up and wake you up to where like during the time you know in um like where I'm from it just was really uh we were on lockdown and we couldn't even leave the house and we had to I had to make up all the I couldn't go to work make up creative games with my kids like let's paint shells okay five minutes later let's do this let's do that you know but it it it kind of makes you realize that it's not so bad it's kind of it's kind of good it's good to to to think about those things a little bit harder I embrace my more introverted side during covid I enjoyed yeah um I enjoyed kind of that lockdown to tell you the truth and my son was he was class of 2020 in high school um so you know he went off for spring break and then didn't come back to school and but the mom's side of me and hopefully he never watches this video or listens to this podcast but the mom side of me I loved being home with him that year and he spent his first year of college doing it doing his studies from his bedroom here in the house but I got an extra year with him it was good bonding time I mean some some you know Mom friends were complaining and oh wo is me and wo was me but I was kind of secretly like this is a great chance to be with our kids that we might never get you know I mean it was maddening let's be honest with little kids it was a little maddening at times but you know it was it was also like like you said I kind of appreciated it that that time I don't know how we got on the co topic Co is over it's over never again it's not though it's it's no it's not it's going around again yeah yeah yeah it's it's day yeah but it's also a good lesson just like how we have to keep on trucking too you know like the world cannot stop even um natural disasters pandemics concussions we got to keep on going you know we do and just being so grateful too for the the time that we have and um and how we get to make those choices is so important I always tell people that I work with and that I collaborate with it's not about money money is not your most precious resource time is your most precious resource because it's nonrenewable you can't just um you know add time it back yeah you can't so yeah this is really refreshing to have this conversation with you because you know this is the first time I'm really talking to you yeah and and you're such a hard worker obviously and you've done so much but the fact that you understand that you know I thought I was going to meet somebody that's just like work work work marketing marketing marketing best of nope I do love marketing and I do think about it a lot but it is definitely not the most important thing to me um yeah so and that's that's what I built my company on is that it's not the most important thing and that's why it's successful I mean you have that other perspective you know thank you so much denen it was amazing talking to you head over to best best of stem awards.com and find the perfect
