00:00 - okay
00:02 - all right
00:04 - awesome so yeah today our main focus is
00:07 - going to be how to use Code Monkey for
00:10 - teachers why is it important for
00:12 - teachers to have the opportunity to be
00:14 - able to utilize Code Monkey
00:16 - um and we'll just go ahead and jump
00:18 - straight into it so let me go ahead and
00:21 - share my screen here
00:26 - all right
00:50 - alrighty
00:54 - yeah okay can everyone see my screen
01:00 - Molly you can see it excellent okay
01:02 - perfect
01:04 - awesome
01:06 - um and Lauren Amy uh cleansing have any
01:09 - of you had the chance to look at some of
01:12 - our curriculum
01:14 - um
01:15 - online maybe utilizing our free trial is
01:18 - this looking all new to everyone
01:25 - yes I'm on the free trial and I've been
01:27 - looking at Code Monkey Junior
01:28 - specifically for some preschoolers
01:30 - gotcha okay
01:32 - Amy anything on your end
01:39 - basically it's like uh
01:44 - new for you as well okay perfect so
01:46 - we'll just start here from the beginning
01:49 - um so right here for some of our younger
01:52 - students kindergarten first second grade
01:54 - we start them off with block based
01:55 - coding
01:57 - um this is really our bread and butter
01:58 - for Code Monkey we started 12 years ago
02:00 - we focused on Block Base and Tech space
02:03 - for elementary school students we're
02:06 - currently providing Code Monkey for k
02:09 - through eight we even have some high
02:10 - schools that use us as well because of
02:12 - we do offer python
02:15 - but what separates Code Monkey from
02:17 - other platforms such as you know
02:19 - code.org for instance is the way that
02:23 - we're introducing these topics so you
02:25 - can't just jump Straight Ahead uh into
02:27 - text-based coding or into the 20th
02:31 - lesson within Block Base you have to
02:33 - prove your conceptual understanding in
02:35 - each one of those lessons come fluidly
02:37 - so students aren't getting stuck right
02:39 - they're having fun they're engaged and
02:41 - I'll show you what this looks like here
02:43 - quickly
02:44 - so Code Monkey Junior
02:46 - as we can see here if it wants to load
02:50 - this is going to be Challenge number
02:52 - five
02:57 - all right I'm going to mute that and as
03:00 - you can see here if you were in
03:01 - kindergarten or first grade and you jump
03:03 - straight into Challenge number five you
03:05 - wouldn't know what to do right this
03:06 - looks a little bit Advanced uh and again
03:08 - this is Challenge number five so
03:10 - students wouldn't see this they would
03:11 - first start off something very basic
03:14 - challenge number one uh drag and drop
03:17 - block based introduction and then each
03:19 - one of these lessons we're going to
03:21 - introduce
03:22 - um a new piece to block coding and our
03:26 - goal is to get students into actually
03:30 - writing code
03:32 - um as quickly as possible
03:34 - and I'll show you what this looks like
03:36 - on a higher level here so we're going to
03:38 - jump into our
03:43 - text base
03:44 - here we go
03:47 - all right so this is called coding
03:49 - adventures part one and this is where
03:51 - Elementary School students are actually
03:53 - going to be writing code as you can see
03:55 - here this looks very Advanced similar
03:58 - concept this is Challenge number 41.
04:01 - um we do have these tutorial videos but
04:04 - we notice most students probably aren't
04:05 - going to watch the tutorial right so
04:09 - uh we're gonna start students at a very
04:12 - basic introduction especially when
04:14 - they're moving right from block into
04:16 - text and I'll show you what this looks
04:19 - like here
04:20 - so we have a little animation we'll skip
04:23 - that just for time again we do have our
04:25 - our first steps tutorial
04:27 - here step 15. it's pointing at uh run so
04:31 - we'll go ahead and click it
04:33 - all right we got that correct we're not
04:37 - sure why we just click run and now it's
04:39 - telling us hey you can change the amount
04:41 - of steps
04:43 - we'll click run it's not correct it says
04:47 - use step 15 we're still not sure why but
04:50 - we're going to go ahead and change that
04:51 - to 15.
04:53 - foreign
04:55 - we've accomplished that and now we have
04:58 - our tutorial video again let's pretend
05:00 - that we don't want to watch that we'll
05:01 - click OK and now if you look on your
05:03 - left hand side you'll see this animation
05:05 - built right in telling us to grab that
05:07 - ruler uh and that's going to tell us how
05:10 - many steps that we need to make so again
05:12 - it's very self-paced for the students
05:15 - hands off for the teachers and now we
05:17 - know this is going to be 20 steps so
05:20 - this is just an example of how our
05:23 - program works Code Monkey was created
05:25 - with the understanding most teachers
05:27 - don't have a coding background and they
05:29 - don't need to for this to work although
05:32 - we do have a ton of teacher resources as
05:34 - well I'd say it's kind of a 50 50 split
05:37 - so some teachers they want to utilize
05:39 - these resources and learn along with
05:41 - their students or maybe they took a
05:42 - class in college they want to brush up
05:44 - well we have that available so we have
05:47 - tons of lesson plans and we also have
05:50 - coding Concepts media and graphic and
05:53 - most importantly the solutions so we
05:55 - have the and users to every single
05:57 - question on our platform so I know you
06:00 - mentioned
06:02 - um
06:02 - The Code Monkey Junior earlier well we
06:05 - can go right here we could say hey
06:07 - there's a few students that are stuck on
06:10 - Challenge number 15 well as a teacher we
06:13 - can click right into it
06:15 - um and now we're able to see exactly how
06:20 - to solve
06:22 - so we'll go back here
06:26 - so as a teacher
06:28 - um the teacher dashboard is obviously
06:33 - very important and here we can choose
06:36 - our specific class we'll go with Mr
06:39 - Allen's class
06:42 - and now at a bird's eye view we can see
06:45 - all of our students we can see their
06:47 - progress we can look at proficiency
06:49 - overall
06:51 - um and then we also have our gradebook
06:55 - you can assign quizzes if you'd like
06:57 - that will
06:59 - expire at a certain time they have to
07:01 - complete it let's say by the end of
07:03 - April for Code Monkey Junior part one
07:05 - for instance and then we can see exactly
07:09 - um how they're scoring there we can do
07:11 - letters we can do numbers we can do
07:13 - percent uh and then your quizzes are
07:16 - right here if you do want to assign
07:18 - those
07:19 - um so as we mentioned coding Adventure
07:21 - we can choose an end date you can try it
07:24 - yourself if you'd like
07:27 - if we go back to progress you can also
07:30 - click on a specific student so let's see
07:32 - we want more information on Dan well
07:35 - with one click now we can see how much
07:37 - time they spent again their proficiency
07:39 - how many solutions how many courses
07:41 - they've started challenges games uh and
07:44 - the course progress here we can choose a
07:47 - specific area and do it that way and
07:49 - then we can export the data the data
07:52 - file
07:53 - and then we can also limit progress here
07:55 - so that's a question we get all the time
07:57 - is hey so do students just get on and
08:00 - they just play as far as they can go not
08:02 - necessarily we can limit that progress
08:04 - have students focus on a specific topic
08:06 - and then we can add that quiz if we
08:09 - would like
08:10 - so what questions do you all have so far
08:16 - if any if any it's okay if we don't
08:22 - nothing
08:24 - all right Molly is there anything that
08:27 - uh you've that you'd like to add here on
08:30 - the teacher dashboard
08:32 - uh no no
08:34 - okay
08:37 - um another important piece is we
08:40 - integrate with a variety of ssos so if
08:43 - you're using classlink Google classrooms
08:45 - even clever we do have the opportunity
08:49 - for you to to roster even a full
08:52 - integration with the site license
08:54 - um with clever just to make that a very
08:58 - seamless process for you in addition
09:00 - we're offering professional development
09:03 - and that's what one of our Code Monkey
09:06 - professional development Specialists why
09:09 - is that important well we know each
09:10 - School each district sometimes each
09:13 - classroom is going to be different as
09:15 - far as what you're trying to accomplish
09:17 - so we want to discuss hey how can we
09:19 - optimize
09:21 - code monkeys features and
09:22 - functionalities to meet your specific
09:24 - goals and objectives so you'll have a
09:26 - preliminary phone call and then we'll
09:28 - have a 60-minute webinar with the
09:29 - specialist with your teachers or
09:31 - administrators
09:33 - um to talk about all of those details in
09:36 - addition have a customer experience
09:38 - manager the duration of your
09:40 - subscription so when you need support
09:43 - you don't have to go and and potentially
09:45 - wait 48 hours for an email response you
09:47 - do have that that one-to-one
09:50 - um support so whether it's questions
09:53 - with rostering or just about some of our
09:57 - curriculum in general you do have that
10:00 - dedicated customer experience manager as
10:03 - well as Molly and I so kind of the full
10:06 - package
10:07 - um is there anything else that you guys
10:10 - would like to discuss here today
10:14 - I have a question if you don't mind
10:16 - about getting students logged in I
10:19 - noticed under the students tab you have
10:21 - the print student login cards
10:24 - um and when I do you see that from your
10:26 - experience especially with younger
10:28 - students do teachers just post that link
10:30 - to like a Google classroom or a seesaw
10:33 - or some sort of
10:35 - um
10:38 - system so that students can quickly
10:40 - access it and then use their login do
10:42 - they create QR codes what have you kind
10:43 - of found
10:44 - yeah Molly what do you think is the most
10:47 - popular yeah if you want um Tyler if you
10:49 - want to click on the students tab
10:52 - um on yep
10:56 - so Lauren where you were referring to
10:59 - you have the print student login card so
11:01 - with that it's going to print your class
11:04 - roster with your students uh username or
11:07 - login information as well as their
11:08 - password so if you wanted to go that
11:11 - route you'd print it out and then you'd
11:13 - cut out each card and give that to their
11:15 - Stu to your students so that they can
11:18 - keep that and refer to each time that
11:20 - they are logging in if you're doing the
11:23 - classroom login URL then that is
11:25 - something that you would put up on your
11:26 - whiteboard or post somewhere and then
11:29 - students to go to that URL directly and
11:32 - then log in with our own username or
11:35 - passwords that they either have saved on
11:37 - their computer or that they've memorized
11:39 - for younger students I'm using a simple
11:44 - username and very simple password is
11:47 - what we would recommend if you are not
11:49 - using single sign-on such as their
11:52 - Google email addresses or clever
11:56 - um and then as you can see here if you
11:58 - are using a username and password you
12:00 - also have the ability to reset passwords
12:02 - for students so if they
12:04 - don't remember their password or if
12:06 - maybe the password they've set up is
12:08 - just a little too tricky for them you
12:10 - can reset it to a simpler password
12:11 - that'll make it easier for them
12:16 - thank you
12:19 - um another feature here thank you Molly
12:21 - is our admin dashboard
12:24 - um so we typically will have just one
12:26 - admin but I believe Molly you can have a
12:29 - couple admins now that's a new feature
12:31 - is that correct correct yes
12:34 - um so here if you were one of the admins
12:37 - or V admin this would be the area where
12:40 - you can look at everything as well all
12:43 - of your schools
12:45 - um active students past six weeks and
12:48 - then we can click the teachers tab
12:51 - um and look at all the teachers and then
12:54 - here if you have multiple schools we can
12:56 - add a school
12:57 - um and then also add your classrooms or
13:01 - upload a classroom
13:03 - um and then you can add co-teachers too
13:06 - and then we have our assignments Tab and
13:10 - now we can see for each of these schools
13:12 - or classrooms well you can filter it by
13:15 - teacher classroom or school and we can
13:17 - see exactly what's being
13:19 - um assigned to each classroom teacher or
13:23 - school and then we can edit that
13:26 - um and assign or or unassign all so
13:29 - offers you the flexibility from that
13:33 - perspective
13:35 - um one piece I did want to mention on
13:37 - the courses which is really exciting
13:38 - this is something that's been added
13:41 - um I don't know maybe the past six
13:43 - months or so we wanted to be more
13:45 - all-encompassing when it comes to
13:46 - computer science in general to meet
13:48 - those State Standards so we're csta
13:50 - aligned
13:52 - um
13:53 - and we are not just coding so we are
13:56 - offering digital literacy this is
13:58 - targeted towards really third through
14:00 - sixth grade
14:02 - um and then we also have our dodo does
14:04 - math as you can see so this is
14:06 - specifically focusing on distances
14:08 - angles multiplications we also have a
14:10 - mini course so it's completely up to the
14:13 - teacher we see this used as
14:15 - um maybe
14:17 - a week every two months or a month out
14:20 - of the year we're going to focus
14:22 - specifically on math or digital literacy
14:25 - so it's broken down into
14:28 - um two pieces here so we have digital
14:30 - use which is roughly a semester long and
14:32 - digital citizen Citizenship which is
14:35 - another semester so students can use
14:37 - this year after year and not necessarily
14:40 - run out of material why is this
14:42 - important well digital use as you can
14:45 - imagine this is going to focus on
14:48 - um you know what's the difference
14:49 - between tablets and desktops and
14:53 - um
14:53 - uh keyboard and typing component even
14:56 - Hardware software browsers and then
15:01 - the digital citizenship is going to
15:04 - focus more on hey
15:06 - um how can I be a good person on the
15:08 - internet really so or as it's phrased
15:11 - how to thrive as a digital citizen so
15:15 - most importantly I feel is our cyber
15:17 - bullying component here and again this
15:20 - is third fourth fifth and sixth grade
15:22 - students just because there is a
15:24 - specific
15:27 - reading comprehension
15:29 - um limit there so just wanted to point
15:32 - that out that has been a very uh popular
15:35 - addition to our platform and this is
15:38 - available for doesn't matter if you have
15:41 - just a small classroom license or a
15:43 - district-wide implementation this is
15:45 - going to be available
15:47 - um for everyone
15:50 - so
15:54 - all right
15:56 - any other questions
16:03 - no
16:06 - okay
16:08 - well thank you very much for tuning in
16:11 - everyone again this is will be saved and
16:14 - I can email it over to you all if you'd
16:16 - like to look back at it
16:18 - um you also have my email and Molly's if
16:22 - you have any further questions we're
16:24 - happy to assist always happy to jump on
16:26 - another call
16:28 - um and if you do have an interest for
16:30 - next school year happy to provide quotes
16:32 - again anything you all need so thank you
16:35 - very much for your time and we hope to
16:38 - engage with you all again soon
16:44 - bye bye everyone

Cleaned transcript:

okay all right awesome so yeah today our main focus is going to be how to use Code Monkey for teachers why is it important for teachers to have the opportunity to be able to utilize Code Monkey um and we'll just go ahead and jump straight into it so let me go ahead and share my screen here all right alrighty yeah okay can everyone see my screen Molly you can see it excellent okay perfect awesome um and Lauren Amy uh cleansing have any of you had the chance to look at some of our curriculum um online maybe utilizing our free trial is this looking all new to everyone yes I'm on the free trial and I've been looking at Code Monkey Junior specifically for some preschoolers gotcha okay Amy anything on your end basically it's like uh new for you as well okay perfect so we'll just start here from the beginning um so right here for some of our younger students kindergarten first second grade we start them off with block based coding um this is really our bread and butter for Code Monkey we started 12 years ago we focused on Block Base and Tech space for elementary school students we're currently providing Code Monkey for k through eight we even have some high schools that use us as well because of we do offer python but what separates Code Monkey from other platforms such as you know code.org for instance is the way that we're introducing these topics so you can't just jump Straight Ahead uh into textbased coding or into the 20th lesson within Block Base you have to prove your conceptual understanding in each one of those lessons come fluidly so students aren't getting stuck right they're having fun they're engaged and I'll show you what this looks like here quickly so Code Monkey Junior as we can see here if it wants to load this is going to be Challenge number five all right I'm going to mute that and as you can see here if you were in kindergarten or first grade and you jump straight into Challenge number five you wouldn't know what to do right this looks a little bit Advanced uh and again this is Challenge number five so students wouldn't see this they would first start off something very basic challenge number one uh drag and drop block based introduction and then each one of these lessons we're going to introduce um a new piece to block coding and our goal is to get students into actually writing code um as quickly as possible and I'll show you what this looks like on a higher level here so we're going to jump into our text base here we go all right so this is called coding adventures part one and this is where Elementary School students are actually going to be writing code as you can see here this looks very Advanced similar concept this is Challenge number 41. um we do have these tutorial videos but we notice most students probably aren't going to watch the tutorial right so uh we're gonna start students at a very basic introduction especially when they're moving right from block into text and I'll show you what this looks like here so we have a little animation we'll skip that just for time again we do have our our first steps tutorial here step 15. it's pointing at uh run so we'll go ahead and click it all right we got that correct we're not sure why we just click run and now it's telling us hey you can change the amount of steps we'll click run it's not correct it says use step 15 we're still not sure why but we're going to go ahead and change that to 15. foreign we've accomplished that and now we have our tutorial video again let's pretend that we don't want to watch that we'll click OK and now if you look on your left hand side you'll see this animation built right in telling us to grab that ruler uh and that's going to tell us how many steps that we need to make so again it's very selfpaced for the students hands off for the teachers and now we know this is going to be 20 steps so this is just an example of how our program works Code Monkey was created with the understanding most teachers don't have a coding background and they don't need to for this to work although we do have a ton of teacher resources as well I'd say it's kind of a 50 50 split so some teachers they want to utilize these resources and learn along with their students or maybe they took a class in college they want to brush up well we have that available so we have tons of lesson plans and we also have coding Concepts media and graphic and most importantly the solutions so we have the and users to every single question on our platform so I know you mentioned um The Code Monkey Junior earlier well we can go right here we could say hey there's a few students that are stuck on Challenge number 15 well as a teacher we can click right into it um and now we're able to see exactly how to solve so we'll go back here so as a teacher um the teacher dashboard is obviously very important and here we can choose our specific class we'll go with Mr Allen's class and now at a bird's eye view we can see all of our students we can see their progress we can look at proficiency overall um and then we also have our gradebook you can assign quizzes if you'd like that will expire at a certain time they have to complete it let's say by the end of April for Code Monkey Junior part one for instance and then we can see exactly um how they're scoring there we can do letters we can do numbers we can do percent uh and then your quizzes are right here if you do want to assign those um so as we mentioned coding Adventure we can choose an end date you can try it yourself if you'd like if we go back to progress you can also click on a specific student so let's see we want more information on Dan well with one click now we can see how much time they spent again their proficiency how many solutions how many courses they've started challenges games uh and the course progress here we can choose a specific area and do it that way and then we can export the data the data file and then we can also limit progress here so that's a question we get all the time is hey so do students just get on and they just play as far as they can go not necessarily we can limit that progress have students focus on a specific topic and then we can add that quiz if we would like so what questions do you all have so far if any if any it's okay if we don't nothing all right Molly is there anything that uh you've that you'd like to add here on the teacher dashboard uh no no okay um another important piece is we integrate with a variety of ssos so if you're using classlink Google classrooms even clever we do have the opportunity for you to to roster even a full integration with the site license um with clever just to make that a very seamless process for you in addition we're offering professional development and that's what one of our Code Monkey professional development Specialists why is that important well we know each School each district sometimes each classroom is going to be different as far as what you're trying to accomplish so we want to discuss hey how can we optimize code monkeys features and functionalities to meet your specific goals and objectives so you'll have a preliminary phone call and then we'll have a 60minute webinar with the specialist with your teachers or administrators um to talk about all of those details in addition have a customer experience manager the duration of your subscription so when you need support you don't have to go and and potentially wait 48 hours for an email response you do have that that onetoone um support so whether it's questions with rostering or just about some of our curriculum in general you do have that dedicated customer experience manager as well as Molly and I so kind of the full package um is there anything else that you guys would like to discuss here today I have a question if you don't mind about getting students logged in I noticed under the students tab you have the print student login cards um and when I do you see that from your experience especially with younger students do teachers just post that link to like a Google classroom or a seesaw or some sort of um system so that students can quickly access it and then use their login do they create QR codes what have you kind of found yeah Molly what do you think is the most popular yeah if you want um Tyler if you want to click on the students tab um on yep so Lauren where you were referring to you have the print student login card so with that it's going to print your class roster with your students uh username or login information as well as their password so if you wanted to go that route you'd print it out and then you'd cut out each card and give that to their Stu to your students so that they can keep that and refer to each time that they are logging in if you're doing the classroom login URL then that is something that you would put up on your whiteboard or post somewhere and then students to go to that URL directly and then log in with our own username or passwords that they either have saved on their computer or that they've memorized for younger students I'm using a simple username and very simple password is what we would recommend if you are not using single signon such as their Google email addresses or clever um and then as you can see here if you are using a username and password you also have the ability to reset passwords for students so if they don't remember their password or if maybe the password they've set up is just a little too tricky for them you can reset it to a simpler password that'll make it easier for them thank you um another feature here thank you Molly is our admin dashboard um so we typically will have just one admin but I believe Molly you can have a couple admins now that's a new feature is that correct correct yes um so here if you were one of the admins or V admin this would be the area where you can look at everything as well all of your schools um active students past six weeks and then we can click the teachers tab um and look at all the teachers and then here if you have multiple schools we can add a school um and then also add your classrooms or upload a classroom um and then you can add coteachers too and then we have our assignments Tab and now we can see for each of these schools or classrooms well you can filter it by teacher classroom or school and we can see exactly what's being um assigned to each classroom teacher or school and then we can edit that um and assign or or unassign all so offers you the flexibility from that perspective um one piece I did want to mention on the courses which is really exciting this is something that's been added um I don't know maybe the past six months or so we wanted to be more allencompassing when it comes to computer science in general to meet those State Standards so we're csta aligned um and we are not just coding so we are offering digital literacy this is targeted towards really third through sixth grade um and then we also have our dodo does math as you can see so this is specifically focusing on distances angles multiplications we also have a mini course so it's completely up to the teacher we see this used as um maybe a week every two months or a month out of the year we're going to focus specifically on math or digital literacy so it's broken down into um two pieces here so we have digital use which is roughly a semester long and digital citizen Citizenship which is another semester so students can use this year after year and not necessarily run out of material why is this important well digital use as you can imagine this is going to focus on um you know what's the difference between tablets and desktops and um uh keyboard and typing component even Hardware software browsers and then the digital citizenship is going to focus more on hey um how can I be a good person on the internet really so or as it's phrased how to thrive as a digital citizen so most importantly I feel is our cyber bullying component here and again this is third fourth fifth and sixth grade students just because there is a specific reading comprehension um limit there so just wanted to point that out that has been a very uh popular addition to our platform and this is available for doesn't matter if you have just a small classroom license or a districtwide implementation this is going to be available um for everyone so all right any other questions no okay well thank you very much for tuning in everyone again this is will be saved and I can email it over to you all if you'd like to look back at it um you also have my email and Molly's if you have any further questions we're happy to assist always happy to jump on another call um and if you do have an interest for next school year happy to provide quotes again anything you all need so thank you very much for your time and we hope to engage with you all again soon bye bye everyone
