00:04 - I started learning coding myself in the
00:07 - 70s as a boy but I started teaching it
00:09 - when scratch from MIT was still in
00:11 - infancy and it wasn't bad I liked the
00:14 - block builder interface but I knew
00:16 - something was missing it wasn't really
00:18 - quite replicating what true cold looks
00:20 - like and I began a Google search just
00:22 - for fun to see what else I could have
00:23 - for one child was accelerated and I was
00:26 - here that I had the happy accident
00:27 - actually of discovering code monkey I
00:29 - started to play with it realized hey
00:31 - this looks like real script and in fact
00:34 - it is based on JavaScript just as if you
00:36 - were writing a sentence on a page you
00:38 - have to know in what order you're gonna
00:39 - put the work so it is with code monkey
00:41 - you have to actually subtract another
00:45 - word
00:46 - find your own eloquence find your own
00:47 - voice in terms of writing code instead
00:49 - of using pre formatted blocks I adore
00:51 - that and I can't help but argument yeah
00:52 - if a monkey is cute it really has a nice
00:54 - response it's very non-threatening I
00:57 - found it very approachable I like that
00:59 - code monkey also lays out the task at
01:02 - hand so that in a very gentle user
01:05 - friendly format you can start with the
01:08 - baby steps
01:09 - write out your code bit by bit so that
01:12 - you're building a foundation very
01:13 - strongly but make no mistake you're
01:16 - doing your own work anyone who writes
01:18 - coding knows that it's teaching
01:21 - discipline of thought and metacognition
01:22 - or thinking about thinking so you're not
01:25 - just learning a technical skill which is
01:26 - valuable but you're learning how to
01:28 - think you're learning how to order your
01:29 - thoughts
01:30 - so basically coding not only is teaching
01:32 - a skill that we need but it's enriching
01:34 - all academic disciplines not just the
01:36 - obvious STEM related ones there was one
01:39 - other thing to consider about code
01:40 - monkey and teaching coding to special
01:42 - needs students and that's never
01:45 - underestimate them I had one student who
01:47 - came from a deeply troubled background
01:49 - he's in high school now we helped ignite
01:51 - an interest in coding in him long before
01:54 - I even heard of code monkey as of now
01:56 - he's taught himself C++ programming he's
01:59 - brilliant at it and he's going to
02:01 - continue to move on why mention this
02:04 - coding feeds into the needs of a special
02:09 - need child the needs to order their
02:11 - thoughts the needs to see direct results
02:13 - of their work
02:14 - and it could lead to great things just
02:16 - as it did of that one boy who now knows
02:18 - more about object-oriented programming
02:19 - than I can teach you please know that
02:22 - our special needs kids have their own
02:25 - brilliance they're not to be
02:26 - underestimated and coding is giving them
02:28 - the discipline they need to excel in
02:30 - this area and another
02:32 - [Music]
