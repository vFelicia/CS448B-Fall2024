02:57 - onboarding which means that I make sure
02:59 - that they set up their subscription add
03:02 - students and start using Code Monkey
03:04 - successfully
03:06 - um as Code Monkey is a very teacher
03:08 - friendly platform most of the customers
03:11 - are able to do those stages
03:12 - independently but me and Angie were
03:16 - there to help the ones who need help and
03:18 - there's always a lot to do at the
03:21 - beginning of the year so there's always
03:23 - a lot of things that we can do to help
03:24 - and
03:27 - uh and I mostly uh use the great videos
03:32 - and help center that we have uh for
03:35 - example one of the videos is getting
03:37 - started with Code Monkey a video a video
03:39 - tutorial that helps teachers uh to hit
03:42 - the ground running when they set up
03:44 - their subscription and
03:48 - um Angie why don't you introduce
03:50 - yourself
03:52 - absolutely so my name is Angie lintner
03:54 - I'm also a customer success manager here
03:57 - at Code Monkey I have worked within
04:00 - customer success in the edtech industry
04:02 - for almost eight years now I really love
04:05 - what I do like Maya I also support
04:08 - customers in onboarding setup setting
04:12 - goals for their use of Code Monkey and
04:15 - helping them to monitor progress towards
04:18 - those goals using data and metrics most
04:21 - importantly I feel my focus is to help
04:24 - all of your teachers and students be
04:27 - successful uh whatever success looks
04:30 - like for them
04:32 - that's awesome
04:35 - um so let's uh go over uh some of the
04:39 - topics that we plan to cover today and
04:42 - so we are going to talk about what is
04:47 - Code Monkey uh and a little bit about
04:49 - code monkey's Pathway to learning and
04:52 - this is what Angie's gonna talk about a
04:54 - little bit and we're gonna review the
04:56 - admin dashboard as it currently is and
04:59 - the new features that we are launching
05:03 - next during next week and we will be
05:06 - talking about monitoring students uh
05:09 - progress usage and tracking that and of
05:14 - course in the end we'll have a q a
05:16 - session so
05:18 - I know part of the webinar today is
05:20 - going to be a little bit technical uh so
05:24 - first of all we have a moderator here
05:27 - who is able to answer your answers in
05:29 - the Q a box and during the Q a uh time
05:33 - we will answer
05:35 - whatever questions that weren't answered
05:37 - in the Q a box and any new question that
05:40 - has arisen during the webinar
05:45 - so feel free
05:52 - um so
05:53 - what is Code Monkey Code Monkey is a
05:56 - leading coding for kids program that
05:58 - provides engaging online courses for
06:00 - students to learn code it's made with
06:03 - schools and teachers in mind standards
06:06 - are aligned with csda and EC and k
06:10 - through eight and it's a complete case
06:12 - rate coding curriculum and start
06:15 - starting from
06:17 - um
06:18 - block based moving on to text-based
06:21 - coding and then finally even python real
06:24 - python
06:25 - uh so no prior coding is experience is
06:28 - needed in order to teach as I mentioned
06:31 - it's made with schools and teachers in
06:34 - mind we know that teachers don't
06:36 - necessarily or even usually don't have
06:38 - coding background uh which means that we
06:41 - have a very extensive help center and
06:45 - teacher resources that are made to help
06:48 - teachers just be able to focus in
06:51 - helping the students in the classroom
06:55 - wonderful and to springboard off that as
06:58 - far as what Maya is explaining with the
07:01 - resources uh I want to share a little
07:04 - bit about the Code Monkey Pathway to
07:05 - learning typically this is a tool that
07:08 - we offer to teachers and what it is
07:10 - designed to do is help guide teachers
07:13 - into where to start students properly at
07:16 - a good level for their student and grade
07:18 - band and we like to share this with
07:20 - administrators because we know that
07:22 - you're not always familiar with all of
07:24 - the various resources available and If
07:27 - you get questions we would love for you
07:29 - to have a general understanding of what
07:31 - is available to your teachers and
07:33 - students within the platform
07:35 - so starting on the left with block based
07:38 - coding we offer Code Monkey Junior and
07:40 - beaver achiever these courses are going
07:43 - to be suited for your K through 2
07:45 - classrooms
07:47 - moving on to your text-based coding dodo
07:51 - does math and coding Adventure includes
07:53 - that type of coding language and that
07:56 - would be ideal for your three through
07:57 - five students
07:59 - and then wrapping up on the higher end
08:01 - you have your sixth through ninth grades
08:03 - that will learn as Maya mentioned Python
08:07 - and that can be found in our game
08:08 - builder banana tales and coding chat
08:11 - bots so this is a nice visual that your
08:14 - teachers can use to identify where would
08:17 - be a good place to to get their students
08:19 - started
08:22 - that's excellent and I just want to add
08:25 - something that a teacher just recently
08:27 - told me that one of the things that they
08:29 - love about Code Monkey except for the
08:31 - students obviously loving it and
08:33 - enjoying the learning experience is that
08:36 - within the Code Monkey platform because
08:38 - we have such a vast coding curriculum uh
08:41 - students what the teacher said was
08:44 - students become from student to Creator
08:46 - we have Creator we have a
08:50 - Creator spaces in Code Monkey so
08:53 - students can actually use code to create
08:56 - a chat bot and whatnot so that's pretty
09:00 - awesome and I really like the become
09:03 - from student to creator
09:05 - um
09:06 - so Angie yes I'm gonna go ahead and move
09:11 - on over to the live demo portion of our
09:15 - presentation
09:17 - um Maya you're seeing the interview yes
09:19 - all right
09:21 - wonderful so for those of you who are in
09:25 - The Code Monkey platform
09:27 - um frequently you notice
09:30 - um you know things look relatively the
09:32 - same at the moment things will be
09:34 - changing shortly within the week and
09:36 - Maya will go into what those changes
09:38 - will look like but currently what you
09:40 - have on your administrative dashboard
09:41 - when you log in are going to be your
09:44 - widgets giving you general information
09:46 - about the subscription and who has
09:49 - access to it so you'll get a synopsis of
09:52 - how many teachers schools classrooms and
09:55 - students are accessing the platform or
09:58 - have access and then underneath that you
10:01 - have your subscription details and those
10:03 - include the name of your subscription
10:05 - how many seats were purchased and used
10:07 - as well as when the subscription becomes
10:10 - active and when it expires
10:13 - moving on to your teachers tab
10:17 - our admin dashboard is relatively new it
10:19 - was launched last year so some of you
10:21 - may not be familiar with this when
10:24 - you're managing multiple teachers we've
10:27 - added this to make it easier for you to
10:29 - give teachers access and this is one of
10:32 - the few things as an administrator you
10:34 - will need to do at the beginning of
10:35 - every subscription and that is to give
10:38 - your teachers access by adding them as a
10:41 - teacher on the subscription this is
10:44 - super simple from the teachers tab you
10:46 - will simply enter their email address
10:48 - and click on invite
10:51 - once you've done that you'll see that
10:52 - they'll be added to your table
10:54 - and you'll get a status as for example
10:57 - this particular teacher is pending
10:59 - they'll they'll be receiving an email
11:02 - that will allow them to access the
11:05 - platform and then they will become an
11:07 - active teacher
11:09 - teachers can be added by you as a
11:12 - primary teacher or they can be added by
11:14 - another teacher to a classroom to be a
11:16 - co-teacher and they would be labeled as
11:18 - such in the table
11:21 - moving on to your schools tab this is
11:25 - not a Mandatory Action however it as an
11:29 - administrator is highly likely to be
11:31 - helpful to you this is where you will
11:34 - create your schools and get information
11:38 - about those schools in terms of how many
11:40 - registered users are
11:43 - within that school how many classrooms
11:45 - and how many students again super easy
11:48 - you just navigate to the top right hand
11:51 - corner you'll type in the name of the
11:54 - school the way you'd like to see it
11:55 - appear on the table and then you'll
11:57 - click add School
12:00 - if you ever want to edit your school
12:03 - names you can simply click on the pencil
12:05 - icon that will open up the field so that
12:07 - you can make appropriate edits and then
12:10 - you would save your changes
12:13 - you also have the ability to remove a
12:15 - school from your classroom table and you
12:16 - would do that by clicking on the garbage
12:19 - can icon
12:22 - moving over to your classrooms table
12:26 - first and foremost I want to
12:27 - differentiate for you some of you may be
12:30 - the administrator of your school or
12:32 - District's account as a whole but you
12:35 - may also be using Code Monkey in the
12:37 - classroom with your students as a
12:39 - teacher
12:40 - so when you're an administrator your
12:43 - classrooms tab will include all
12:46 - classrooms that are assigned to this
12:49 - subscription or that roll up to the
12:52 - subscription
12:53 - whereas your my classrooms tab on the
12:56 - left hand side is only the classrooms
12:59 - that you are the primary teacher for so
13:02 - know that that is the difference between
13:03 - those two areas
13:05 - again as you have created classrooms you
13:09 - will um see that they are listed here on
13:11 - the classrooms table you get general
13:13 - information about the school the primary
13:16 - teacher number of students
13:19 - you have an option here to Archive
13:21 - classrooms that will remove them from
13:24 - your classroom table
13:26 - and again you have an option to edit and
13:29 - when you click into that you'll notice
13:30 - that you can change the classroom name
13:32 - you can change the school
13:35 - in order for this drop down to be active
13:37 - you do need to create the schools under
13:39 - the schools tab
13:41 - and then you can change the primary
13:43 - teacher or the co-teacher for that
13:46 - classroom and again the teacher in
13:48 - question must be registered on the
13:51 - teachers tab for them to show up in your
13:53 - drop down menu
13:55 - then you would click save and your
13:57 - changes will be saved to the platform
14:00 - in addition to the classroom table if
14:04 - you have a long list of classrooms we
14:07 - offer you a filter option so that you
14:10 - can filter by teacher classroom or
14:12 - school to shorten that list up and be
14:15 - able to view just the classrooms that
14:16 - you are needing to work with
14:20 - from the classrooms tab you were also
14:22 - able to upload classrooms on behalf of
14:24 - your teachers so teachers definitely
14:27 - have the ability to manually create
14:29 - their own classrooms however if you
14:32 - would like to lessen the burden for them
14:34 - you can do that here when you click on
14:36 - upload classrooms you will be given
14:38 - short and very explicit instructions on
14:42 - how to build the file it's super easy
14:45 - with four columns simply naming the
14:48 - classroom entering the primary teacher's
14:50 - email address
14:52 - chilling in the school and then if a
14:54 - co-teacher will be
14:56 - involved then adding their email address
14:58 - as well once this is saved in a CSV file
15:03 - format you can select that file and
15:05 - upload and that will Mass create all of
15:08 - the classrooms in one one thousand Loop
15:11 - now there is not a way currently to
15:13 - roster students within that same file
15:16 - but your teachers do have a bulk upload
15:19 - option when they go to add students so
15:21 - that is available to them
15:25 - finally we have the
15:28 - Kebab menu That's to the right of the
15:31 - upload classrooms button
15:33 - if you are in the platform or have been
15:36 - recently you'll notice we have a couple
15:38 - of new editions we have had our usage
15:41 - report available for some time we now
15:44 - offer an activity report which is a
15:46 - student activity report and we'll take a
15:49 - look at that in more depth in a moment
15:51 - you also have your export course
15:53 - progress report which will also take a
15:56 - look at and is also a new report
15:58 - available to you in addition to these
16:01 - options you can search by student or you
16:04 - can access the archived classroom
16:07 - section
16:08 - I'm going to return to the reports in
16:10 - just a moment
16:12 - um but let's review our assignments tab
16:14 - which is the last piece of your
16:16 - administrative dashboard
16:18 - here if you would like you are able to
16:21 - manage assignments for all classrooms on
16:23 - the subscription some schools and
16:26 - districts prefer that the teacher manage
16:28 - the assignments others preferred at the
16:31 - administrator manage those either way
16:34 - you can do that from one place
16:37 - you have an option here to assign all
16:40 - courses
16:41 - currently you can see all of the courses
16:44 - are assigned to all of my classrooms I
16:46 - can also unassign
16:48 - all of the courses from all classrooms
16:51 - and that's refresh
16:54 - and then you can see that then all
16:56 - classrooms have been have no courses
16:59 - assigned and this is where you'd want
17:02 - everything set if you don't want
17:04 - students working within the platform
17:06 - quite yet if you're introducing or
17:08 - providing background knowledge to them
17:10 - this is a way to keep them from working
17:12 - within the platform you also have the
17:15 - flexibility of differentiating what
17:18 - courses you assign to each classroom you
17:21 - can simply click on the individual
17:23 - courses that you would like each
17:25 - classroom to have access to and of
17:28 - course those can be different
17:30 - and you can also limit progress so if
17:35 - you would like students to only be able
17:37 - to work through a certain Challenge in a
17:39 - course you would assign that course
17:41 - click on the carrot
17:44 - select
17:45 - set progress limit
17:48 - and then simply enter the number of the
17:51 - challenge that their students can work
17:53 - through once they hit this number and
17:55 - they complete that challenge they will
17:58 - be locked out of the remainder of the
17:59 - course until you either increase this
18:02 - number or come back and return them to
18:05 - free play
18:10 - so with that I'm going to come back to
18:12 - our my classrooms tab
18:15 - and we will move into the reporting
18:17 - portion of the presentation and we'll
18:20 - take a look at the reports that are
18:22 - available to you and then Maya is going
18:25 - to show you the very exciting new
18:27 - features and reports that will be coming
18:29 - shortly
18:31 - so first and foremost you have your
18:33 - general usage report so when you access
18:37 - this report you will be asked to outline
18:39 - or identify a timeline that you want to
18:42 - see data for when you click into this
18:45 - field you simply click on the two dates
18:48 - the beginning date and the end date for
18:50 - the data that you would like to see
18:53 - and
18:54 - here is the report that you will get
18:57 - um once it's downloaded and there's a
19:01 - lot of information on this usage report
19:03 - starting with your students usage
19:06 - so you'll get an overview of classrooms
19:08 - the number of registered users the
19:10 - number of sessions the users have
19:12 - completed within the time frame that you
19:14 - outlined the number or average session
19:17 - duration in minutes and the number of
19:19 - challenges or exercises the students
19:23 - have solved in that time frame
19:25 - below that you get a graphical
19:27 - representation of your active users by
19:31 - month so you can see when your Peak
19:33 - usage is as well as when it starts
19:35 - tapering off
19:40 - moving down you'll then get teacher
19:42 - usage information again the number of
19:44 - registered teachers and the number of
19:46 - sessions that they have engaged in
19:50 - followed by a little bit more granular
19:52 - data at the classroom level here you're
19:55 - given the classroom name the number of
19:57 - students in that classroom and then
20:00 - you're given the number of active users
20:02 - in that classroom month over month
20:04 - and the final column provides you with a
20:07 - total number of challenges solved by the
20:10 - students in that classroom
20:12 - so this provides you a nice way of being
20:14 - able to identify what classrooms are
20:16 - more active and maybe which classrooms
20:19 - such as this one may need a little bit
20:22 - more encouragement or support in getting
20:25 - students engaged with Code Monkey
20:30 - returning to the Kebab menu
20:33 - we now also have an activity report
20:35 - available
20:37 - when you click into this you're really
20:39 - just going to be given one option this
20:42 - report will be for the entire
20:43 - subscription from the date it was
20:45 - activated through the date that you're
20:47 - running it and really what they're what
20:50 - we're asking you here is do you want all
20:53 - activity even if the classrooms are now
20:56 - archived so if you would like to see all
20:59 - activity from the day that your
21:01 - subscription started then you're going
21:03 - to want to include any archived
21:05 - classrooms to make sure that usage is
21:07 - captured if you just want to see usage
21:10 - for the classrooms that are active then
21:12 - you would leave that uncheck marked and
21:15 - then select export reports
21:19 - when you export the report this is what
21:21 - it will look like or it will look
21:22 - similar to this I've wiped a lot of the
21:26 - data from this in terms of personal
21:28 - information for the students but yours
21:31 - of course would be populated
21:33 - so the report will start by giving you
21:35 - the classroom name whether it's active
21:37 - or archived
21:39 - you'll also get the students first and
21:41 - last name their login type how many
21:44 - times they've logged in as well as their
21:47 - username
21:49 - we also provide you with the date and
21:51 - time they first logged into their
21:53 - account as well as a date and time for
21:55 - the last time that they logged into
21:57 - their account
21:59 - and then we provide you some metrics and
22:02 - really what we're looking at here is
22:04 - your student engagement
22:05 - total time on the site in minutes
22:08 - the number of times they've been on the
22:10 - site in the past month which of course
22:12 - depending on when you introduce coding
22:14 - will you'll have Peaks and valleys a
22:18 - number of sessions in the past month
22:20 - that they have engaged with and then the
22:22 - total number of solutions submitted by
22:26 - the student during the subscription and
22:29 - what's great about this report is that
22:30 - it is granular at the student level so
22:33 - you can really see what engagement
22:35 - you're getting not only at a classroom
22:38 - level but really digging down further
22:41 - into the student level
22:47 - returning to our Kebab menu we now have
22:50 - the export course progress report
22:54 - foreign here you'll be given a drop down
22:57 - menu this report is run by course and it
23:00 - will provide you progress on all
23:02 - students who have completed challenges
23:05 - within that course during the time frame
23:07 - that or for the subscription in this
23:10 - case I'm going to go ahead and select
23:12 - sequencing in Loops again you need to
23:15 - determine whether you want archived
23:16 - classrooms included in this report or
23:19 - not and then you would click on exports
23:23 - when your report is done you'll be able
23:26 - to download it and it will look
23:28 - something like this similar to what we
23:31 - looked at with the activity report but
23:33 - giving you different data points so
23:36 - again you'll have the same information
23:38 - classroom name whether that classroom is
23:41 - active or archived the student's name
23:44 - and username for logging in and then
23:46 - information on how many challenges the
23:49 - student has completed within this course
23:52 - the total number of stars that they've
23:55 - earned as they've worked through the
23:57 - course
23:58 - and here's where we get into really the
24:01 - meat of this report so I'm going to move
24:04 - over just a little
24:07 - your average score column is again going
24:10 - to of course give you an average for
24:13 - each challenge that the students have
24:16 - completed
24:17 - give you kind of an aggregate average
24:20 - for for the overall course and as you're
24:25 - looking at this it's important to
24:27 - remember that A3 under any challenge is
24:30 - a perfect score
24:32 - so as you look at average scores for
24:36 - your students the closer they are to a
24:39 - three
24:40 - the better they are grasping the
24:42 - concepts they are being exposed to
24:44 - because a perfect score is going to be
24:47 - three
24:49 - and then you can also see the progress
24:51 - as you
24:52 - scroll to the right challenge by
24:55 - challenge you can see what that student
24:57 - score as they worked through the course
25:00 - and you're easily able to see that
25:04 - students that move quickly from one
25:06 - challenge to the next and out and are
25:09 - scoring that perfect score they are
25:12 - making progress this is how you can
25:14 - determine the student is actually
25:16 - progressing and is understanding and
25:19 - comprehending the concepts that they are
25:22 - being taught
25:23 - you are also given an average for the
25:26 - classroom and at the end of the report
25:27 - an average for the entire subscription
25:31 - I um talk with a lot of customers
25:34 - districts schools administrators and I
25:38 - can say that one thing that I hear very
25:40 - commonly this school year is that Code
25:43 - Monkey is being used specifically for
25:45 - exposing students to computer science or
25:48 - coding Concepts
25:50 - so this is a report that you can use to
25:52 - show that as well because if your
25:55 - student here is your concept sequencing
25:59 - your first 15 challenges in this course
26:02 - are related to sequencing here's your
26:05 - loops and all of the reports will have
26:08 - the concepts listed at the top so as you
26:11 - put those Concepts in conjunction with
26:14 - how the students scored you can easily
26:17 - show with metrics that your students are
26:21 - being exposed to those Concepts and are
26:25 - grasping them successfully
26:30 - so with that that concludes the
26:33 - demonstration portion of our event today
26:36 - so I'm going to hand it back to Maya who
26:38 - is going to pick up and show us what is
26:41 - coming in the very near future for
26:44 - Code Monkey
26:47 - wow Angie you are so thorough and so
26:51 - organized You Gotta Give me some tips
26:53 - after the webinar is finished I Wanna Be
26:57 - You
26:58 - amazing thank you for covering
27:01 - all of this uh and everyone again I want
27:04 - to remind you that we know that this is
27:08 - kind of a technical webinar so first of
27:11 - all q a session will be uh we'll have
27:14 - some time for that in the end you also
27:17 - can always reach out to us uh for um
27:20 - through the support email and you will
27:22 - see you will get the address uh email
27:25 - address at the end and this webinar will
27:29 - also be live on our YouTube and our
27:31 - webinar section at the website within a
27:34 - week or so maybe less uh so you can
27:38 - re-watch that whenever you want
27:41 - um so thank you Angie and I'm
27:44 - I know that the webinar is supposed to
27:46 - end at 6 15 in 15 minutes we may uh go
27:52 - overboard a little bit uh just to have
27:54 - more time for Q a uh so
27:57 - let's Jump Right In
28:00 - um so this is a a mock-up image of what
28:06 - uh the the of the expanded admin
28:10 - dashboard what it's going to look like
28:11 - but before I jump into that I just
28:14 - wanted to say
28:15 - um that this admin dashboard is a result
28:18 - of
28:20 - a lot of feedback that we've been
28:22 - getting from
28:23 - administrators uh curriculum
28:26 - coordinators teachers and it's it's not
28:30 - the first time that we have built
28:32 - something in accordance uh of feedback
28:35 - that we received from teachers for
28:37 - example in the past uh we had a few
28:41 - teachers saying that they needed more
28:43 - assessment tools so we created the
28:46 - quizzes tab that you can find for in in
28:49 - every classroom's dashboard uh code Nike
28:53 - Junior the course for example initially
28:55 - had 30 challenges but we heard from
28:57 - teachers that the kiddos are loving it
29:00 - and they need more courses and more
29:02 - content so we upgraded it to 60
29:05 - challenges and then again to
29:08 - 120 challenges so all of that is a
29:11 - result from feedback that we're getting
29:13 - from you uh you literally have the power
29:17 - to affect the product that you're that
29:19 - you're receiving that you're using that
29:21 - you're using daily that you're
29:23 - purchasing and working with so
29:26 - why am I saying that uh just that if we
29:30 - see that this new feature is being used
29:33 - and we get feedback on your needs uh
29:36 - maybe it doesn't cover all your needs
29:38 - maybe you have more uh specific
29:41 - particular granular things that you need
29:44 - from your admin dashboard well
29:48 - if anything is still being
29:50 - unfulfilled or with betters or some
29:54 - small tweaks would better suit your
29:57 - modus operandi so we will make changes
30:01 - and you will have an in an imprint on
30:04 - how the product and what the product
30:05 - looks like so please whenever you have
30:08 - feedback
30:09 - don't be shy tell us
30:13 - um okay back to the admin dashboard so
30:17 - the new and extended admin dashboard is
30:19 - not live yet it will be so uh in within
30:22 - the next week and but we do have some
30:25 - mock-ups that we'll be sharing with you
30:27 - today and uh it will be
30:31 - [Music]
30:31 - um
30:32 - and and once it is live you will all be
30:36 - able to dive deeper and explore on your
30:39 - own but you will have the knowledge that
30:42 - you acquired today so it's not you won't
30:44 - be starting from scratch uh
30:48 - so and again
30:51 - it gets a little bit technical but will
30:54 - will answer a question in the end so the
30:57 - admin dashboard here
30:59 - um our hypothesis was that District that
31:03 - means during the year during the school
31:05 - year I want to Monitor and track usage
31:09 - and progress of uh
31:12 - of their classrooms so at key points
31:16 - during the year and we know that admins
31:18 - are looking uh to know what is being
31:22 - used and what isn't where do we need to
31:25 - invest more time and effort and where
31:27 - are the success stories so our goal here
31:30 - is to give the admins uh sort of an
31:33 - impression or status of both General
31:36 - activity meaning usage and progress in
31:40 - courses
31:42 - um for that purpose the admin dashboard
31:44 - will display data relating to and pulled
31:48 - from the managed subscription and the
31:52 - main subscription classrooms
31:54 - uh the data that it will be displayed
31:58 - here gets uh updated every 24 hours
32:01 - which means every day you'll get you'll
32:05 - see changes you'll see movement and and
32:09 - it's displayed from the start of the
32:11 - subscription till the current day and
32:15 - and the charts which I will show you up
32:18 - close uh later would can display by
32:21 - weekly or monthly and the data and as
32:26 - long as uh for the term perspective
32:31 - um so the data sorry did you want to say
32:34 - something
32:35 - no all right so the data taken from
32:39 - all classrooms uh is in the subscription
32:43 - for all customers in the subscription of
32:45 - course is excluding archives classrooms
32:48 - by default so if you remember Angie
32:51 - showed you the reports before you can
32:52 - select whether you want archived
32:55 - classrooms to be included in the report
32:57 - or not here it's automatically excluded
33:01 - and the course
33:05 - yeah so the courses list displayed
33:09 - should be uh it's all Code Monkey
33:12 - courses and
33:15 - you can see here that we
33:18 - uh okay that again this is a mock-up uh
33:22 - usually it wouldn't be zero schools
33:24 - because as Angie said uh the admins are
33:28 - the ones who really can benefit from
33:30 - adding schools and to the to the mix and
33:34 - to the
33:35 - helps divide the classrooms so the
33:40 - uh yeah so this is an overview of the
33:43 - subscription the number of schools the
33:46 - amount of classrooms how many students
33:48 - there are and how many teachers and you
33:53 - so you can see that from 822 students
33:58 - and 97 are engaged what does engaged
34:03 - mean engage means that they had over two
34:06 - sessions why we chose over two sessions
34:09 - because we assume usually the first
34:12 - session is the first sign up and then
34:14 - the second session is really activation
34:16 - and getting more uh Hands-On with
34:20 - playing and learning with the platform
34:22 - same goes for teachers uh in engaged
34:27 - teacher is a teacher that logged in more
34:30 - than once
34:31 - [Music]
34:32 - um
34:33 - on the student usage part of the
34:37 - overview you'll see that there's active
34:40 - students total on-site minutes and time
34:44 - spent on site break breakdown so all of
34:48 - those
34:49 - oh yeah so I had this yeah engaged you
34:53 - can see that wherever there's a tooltip
34:56 - there will be an explanation on what how
35:00 - we Define uh what is the bar how we
35:03 - Define this criteria so even if you
35:06 - forgot it's always right there at hand
35:10 - um so
35:12 - active students I think is pretty
35:15 - straightforward we just talked about it
35:17 - active students and students and that
35:20 - have signed in you can view it as weekly
35:25 - or monthly
35:26 - total on-site minutes will be the number
35:31 - of minutes spent by each student
35:35 - so this would be the average and time on
35:39 - site breakdown you can see here that
35:41 - it's between zero to nine minutes 10 to
35:44 - 29 30 to 59 and 60 minutes and above and
35:48 - you'll see the colors change throughout
35:52 - the year and
35:53 - [Music]
35:55 - for example we know that
35:59 - for a lot of subscriptions the median
36:02 - and
36:04 - time per session for a student would be
36:08 - around 12 minutes and because class is
36:12 - 45 minutes there is usually you know
36:15 - five minutes just getting students to
36:18 - concentrate and about 20 minutes of
36:21 - tutoring learning the
36:24 - theoretical part and then the Practical
36:27 - part of playing is usually about 15
36:30 - minutes out of the class so you would
36:33 - see at the beginning of the year most of
36:35 - this will be green and then
36:37 - depending on what the frequency of
36:40 - classes is is a daily weekly uh I don't
36:44 - know whatever you choose uh so there's
36:48 - no right way to teach with Code Monkey
36:50 - we know that sometimes it's more of a
36:52 - structural lesson as I described uh just
36:55 - now but sometimes it's just free play
36:58 - and then and they let the kids just
37:02 - Play and Learn uh independently and then
37:06 - you would probably see
37:09 - the numbers change accordingly so I'm
37:11 - only
37:13 - uh delving into this just to make sure
37:17 - that if you see zero to nine just don't
37:20 - be worried it just means probably one
37:23 - class
37:24 - was done and so time spent uh oh yeah
37:28 - and this will be time spent by active
37:31 - students so this will only take
37:35 - um
37:37 - take the data from students that have
37:39 - activated their accounts uh total
37:42 - on-site minutes will be all time spent
37:45 - by all students and active students
37:47 - would be active students that had at
37:50 - least one session during the week or
37:52 - month so just to differentiate
37:55 - active students at least one session
37:57 - engage students at least two
38:02 - again weekly monthly you can filter it
38:06 - in any way that you want
38:08 - um
38:10 - so uh the last part would be student
38:13 - progress and again even I think even the
38:17 - wording here may change a little bit
38:20 - before this is launched you're really
38:22 - getting a sneak peek preview of
38:25 - something that we haven't launched yet
38:27 - so uh here on the student progress we
38:30 - can see amount of solutions submitted
38:33 - and you can choose so here is the
38:37 - tooltip says weekly last 12 weeks and
38:41 - you can click the drop down menu and
38:44 - select which course you want
38:47 - um to view or view all courses and
38:52 - it presents successful Solutions
38:55 - submitted by students in the
38:57 - subscription and again uh linking to
39:00 - what Angie said about the scoring system
39:03 - it can be between one to three stars so
39:07 - any solution between one to three stars
39:10 - will be presented here if students
39:12 - attempted uh to tempted a challenge but
39:17 - weren't able to complete it then it
39:19 - won't appear here it's not a solution
39:21 - submitted if they didn't complete the
39:23 - challenge
39:23 - and so this and again
39:28 - uh following on what Angie mentioned
39:31 - this can be a great way to show progress
39:35 - uh if you ever need to if ever uh you
39:38 - need your teachers to present uh
39:41 - progress to you or you need to present
39:43 - progress to somebody else or just want
39:45 - to monitor it
39:46 - um
39:47 - a great way to show progress can be
39:50 - screenshotting this once a month and
39:54 - I know screenshotting is not ideal we do
39:57 - plan on adding an ability to print or
40:00 - download it at a later stage but for now
40:02 - with this initial version a screenshot
40:06 - can be a way to go or again
40:09 - from the classrooms tab on your admin
40:12 - dashboard you can generate a usage
40:15 - report or an activity report and get
40:18 - all of that information there and
40:23 - before we finish I just want to say uh
40:28 - so in four days hour of code week begins
40:31 - hour of code week is uh as you must know
40:36 - the biggest week for all uh coding
40:39 - curriculums and we get a um we get a lot
40:45 - of
40:46 - activity during that time we know
40:48 - teachers really love using our courses
40:50 - in the classroom during hour of code and
40:52 - we have
40:54 - um specific courses that are designated
40:56 - per hour of course with for our code and
40:59 - hour of code lesson plans so even there
41:03 - we are aware that teachers need
41:06 - resources to be able to teach so I just
41:09 - wanted to share with you uh this is
41:12 - those are the steps so you the teachers
41:15 - or the students or whoever can choose a
41:18 - course that best suits their classroom
41:20 - or themselves review the course teacher
41:23 - notes prior to class and then make sure
41:27 - and that everybody has access to
41:30 - computer or laptop internet and code
41:33 - away
41:35 - um
41:35 - we have two more really cool things to
41:40 - let you know uh so four uh uniquely
41:43 - especially four hours of code we now
41:47 - have
41:47 - uh students and kids have an ability to
41:51 - generate and download uh certificates
41:55 - for themselves so if before uh a teacher
41:59 - would be would be the only one with
42:02 - access to download a certificate once
42:04 - the student completed the course now
42:07 - students and kids can do so themselves
42:09 - we have a health article on that uh on
42:13 - our help center
42:15 - which I by the way really recommend
42:18 - check out our help center
42:21 - very useful and we keep it up to date
42:23 - but to summarize once a student
42:26 - completed the course the thumbnail of
42:28 - the course will earn the V sign and
42:31 - become clickable and when they click it
42:34 - they can download they they there's a
42:38 - pop-up window and by clicking the
42:40 - download certificate button the
42:43 - certificate will be downloaded
42:45 - uh only note is when a child or student
42:48 - downloads their own certificate it will
42:51 - not include their teacher's name on it
42:53 - so as opposed to the certificates
42:55 - generated from the teacher's gradebook
42:58 - uh and uh in six days from now we have
43:03 - another free live webinar with Jonathan
43:07 - Shore one of our two amazing co-founders
43:10 - that started code monkey and it will be
43:13 - a live webinar and they'll be talking
43:15 - about the history of Code Monkey how
43:18 - everything started uh
43:21 - and where we are today it will be on
43:24 - Wednesday December 7th at 11 A.M EST
43:28 - um
43:29 - stay tuned you'll be getting an invite
43:31 - to this to sign up to this webinar uh by
43:35 - email

monkey's uh csms from the customers and success team I work with our customers schools and teachers once they join Code Monkey I handle their onboarding which means that I make sure that they set up their subscription add students and start using Code Monkey successfully um as Code Monkey is a very teacher friendly platform most of the customers are able to do those stages independently but me and Angie were there to help the ones who need help and there's always a lot to do at the beginning of the year so there's always a lot of things that we can do to help and uh and I mostly uh use the great videos and help center that we have uh for example one of the videos is getting started with Code Monkey a video a video tutorial that helps teachers uh to hit the ground running when they set up their subscription and um Angie why don't you introduce yourself absolutely so my name is Angie lintner I'm also a customer success manager here at Code Monkey I have worked within customer success in the edtech industry for almost eight years now I really love what I do like Maya I also support customers in onboarding setup setting goals for their use of Code Monkey and helping them to monitor progress towards those goals using data and metrics most importantly I feel my focus is to help all of your teachers and students be successful uh whatever success looks like for them that's awesome um so let's uh go over uh some of the topics that we plan to cover today and so we are going to talk about what is Code Monkey uh and a little bit about code monkey's Pathway to learning and this is what Angie's gonna talk about a little bit and we're gonna review the admin dashboard as it currently is and the new features that we are launching next during next week and we will be talking about monitoring students uh progress usage and tracking that and of course in the end we'll have a q a session so I know part of the webinar today is going to be a little bit technical uh so first of all we have a moderator here who is able to answer your answers in the Q a box and during the Q a uh time we will answer whatever questions that weren't answered in the Q a box and any new question that has arisen during the webinar so feel free um so what is Code Monkey Code Monkey is a leading coding for kids program that provides engaging online courses for students to learn code it's made with schools and teachers in mind standards are aligned with csda and EC and k through eight and it's a complete case rate coding curriculum and start starting from um block based moving on to textbased coding and then finally even python real python uh so no prior coding is experience is needed in order to teach as I mentioned it's made with schools and teachers in mind we know that teachers don't necessarily or even usually don't have coding background uh which means that we have a very extensive help center and teacher resources that are made to help teachers just be able to focus in helping the students in the classroom wonderful and to springboard off that as far as what Maya is explaining with the resources uh I want to share a little bit about the Code Monkey Pathway to learning typically this is a tool that we offer to teachers and what it is designed to do is help guide teachers into where to start students properly at a good level for their student and grade band and we like to share this with administrators because we know that you're not always familiar with all of the various resources available and If you get questions we would love for you to have a general understanding of what is available to your teachers and students within the platform so starting on the left with block based coding we offer Code Monkey Junior and beaver achiever these courses are going to be suited for your K through 2 classrooms moving on to your textbased coding dodo does math and coding Adventure includes that type of coding language and that would be ideal for your three through five students and then wrapping up on the higher end you have your sixth through ninth grades that will learn as Maya mentioned Python and that can be found in our game builder banana tales and coding chat bots so this is a nice visual that your teachers can use to identify where would be a good place to to get their students started that's excellent and I just want to add something that a teacher just recently told me that one of the things that they love about Code Monkey except for the students obviously loving it and enjoying the learning experience is that within the Code Monkey platform because we have such a vast coding curriculum uh students what the teacher said was students become from student to Creator we have Creator we have a Creator spaces in Code Monkey so students can actually use code to create a chat bot and whatnot so that's pretty awesome and I really like the become from student to creator um so Angie yes I'm gonna go ahead and move on over to the live demo portion of our presentation um Maya you're seeing the interview yes all right wonderful so for those of you who are in The Code Monkey platform um frequently you notice um you know things look relatively the same at the moment things will be changing shortly within the week and Maya will go into what those changes will look like but currently what you have on your administrative dashboard when you log in are going to be your widgets giving you general information about the subscription and who has access to it so you'll get a synopsis of how many teachers schools classrooms and students are accessing the platform or have access and then underneath that you have your subscription details and those include the name of your subscription how many seats were purchased and used as well as when the subscription becomes active and when it expires moving on to your teachers tab our admin dashboard is relatively new it was launched last year so some of you may not be familiar with this when you're managing multiple teachers we've added this to make it easier for you to give teachers access and this is one of the few things as an administrator you will need to do at the beginning of every subscription and that is to give your teachers access by adding them as a teacher on the subscription this is super simple from the teachers tab you will simply enter their email address and click on invite once you've done that you'll see that they'll be added to your table and you'll get a status as for example this particular teacher is pending they'll they'll be receiving an email that will allow them to access the platform and then they will become an active teacher teachers can be added by you as a primary teacher or they can be added by another teacher to a classroom to be a coteacher and they would be labeled as such in the table moving on to your schools tab this is not a Mandatory Action however it as an administrator is highly likely to be helpful to you this is where you will create your schools and get information about those schools in terms of how many registered users are within that school how many classrooms and how many students again super easy you just navigate to the top right hand corner you'll type in the name of the school the way you'd like to see it appear on the table and then you'll click add School if you ever want to edit your school names you can simply click on the pencil icon that will open up the field so that you can make appropriate edits and then you would save your changes you also have the ability to remove a school from your classroom table and you would do that by clicking on the garbage can icon moving over to your classrooms table first and foremost I want to differentiate for you some of you may be the administrator of your school or District's account as a whole but you may also be using Code Monkey in the classroom with your students as a teacher so when you're an administrator your classrooms tab will include all classrooms that are assigned to this subscription or that roll up to the subscription whereas your my classrooms tab on the left hand side is only the classrooms that you are the primary teacher for so know that that is the difference between those two areas again as you have created classrooms you will um see that they are listed here on the classrooms table you get general information about the school the primary teacher number of students you have an option here to Archive classrooms that will remove them from your classroom table and again you have an option to edit and when you click into that you'll notice that you can change the classroom name you can change the school in order for this drop down to be active you do need to create the schools under the schools tab and then you can change the primary teacher or the coteacher for that classroom and again the teacher in question must be registered on the teachers tab for them to show up in your drop down menu then you would click save and your changes will be saved to the platform in addition to the classroom table if you have a long list of classrooms we offer you a filter option so that you can filter by teacher classroom or school to shorten that list up and be able to view just the classrooms that you are needing to work with from the classrooms tab you were also able to upload classrooms on behalf of your teachers so teachers definitely have the ability to manually create their own classrooms however if you would like to lessen the burden for them you can do that here when you click on upload classrooms you will be given short and very explicit instructions on how to build the file it's super easy with four columns simply naming the classroom entering the primary teacher's email address chilling in the school and then if a coteacher will be involved then adding their email address as well once this is saved in a CSV file format you can select that file and upload and that will Mass create all of the classrooms in one one thousand Loop now there is not a way currently to roster students within that same file but your teachers do have a bulk upload option when they go to add students so that is available to them finally we have the Kebab menu That's to the right of the upload classrooms button if you are in the platform or have been recently you'll notice we have a couple of new editions we have had our usage report available for some time we now offer an activity report which is a student activity report and we'll take a look at that in more depth in a moment you also have your export course progress report which will also take a look at and is also a new report available to you in addition to these options you can search by student or you can access the archived classroom section I'm going to return to the reports in just a moment um but let's review our assignments tab which is the last piece of your administrative dashboard here if you would like you are able to manage assignments for all classrooms on the subscription some schools and districts prefer that the teacher manage the assignments others preferred at the administrator manage those either way you can do that from one place you have an option here to assign all courses currently you can see all of the courses are assigned to all of my classrooms I can also unassign all of the courses from all classrooms and that's refresh and then you can see that then all classrooms have been have no courses assigned and this is where you'd want everything set if you don't want students working within the platform quite yet if you're introducing or providing background knowledge to them this is a way to keep them from working within the platform you also have the flexibility of differentiating what courses you assign to each classroom you can simply click on the individual courses that you would like each classroom to have access to and of course those can be different and you can also limit progress so if you would like students to only be able to work through a certain Challenge in a course you would assign that course click on the carrot select set progress limit and then simply enter the number of the challenge that their students can work through once they hit this number and they complete that challenge they will be locked out of the remainder of the course until you either increase this number or come back and return them to free play so with that I'm going to come back to our my classrooms tab and we will move into the reporting portion of the presentation and we'll take a look at the reports that are available to you and then Maya is going to show you the very exciting new features and reports that will be coming shortly so first and foremost you have your general usage report so when you access this report you will be asked to outline or identify a timeline that you want to see data for when you click into this field you simply click on the two dates the beginning date and the end date for the data that you would like to see and here is the report that you will get um once it's downloaded and there's a lot of information on this usage report starting with your students usage so you'll get an overview of classrooms the number of registered users the number of sessions the users have completed within the time frame that you outlined the number or average session duration in minutes and the number of challenges or exercises the students have solved in that time frame below that you get a graphical representation of your active users by month so you can see when your Peak usage is as well as when it starts tapering off moving down you'll then get teacher usage information again the number of registered teachers and the number of sessions that they have engaged in followed by a little bit more granular data at the classroom level here you're given the classroom name the number of students in that classroom and then you're given the number of active users in that classroom month over month and the final column provides you with a total number of challenges solved by the students in that classroom so this provides you a nice way of being able to identify what classrooms are more active and maybe which classrooms such as this one may need a little bit more encouragement or support in getting students engaged with Code Monkey returning to the Kebab menu we now also have an activity report available when you click into this you're really just going to be given one option this report will be for the entire subscription from the date it was activated through the date that you're running it and really what they're what we're asking you here is do you want all activity even if the classrooms are now archived so if you would like to see all activity from the day that your subscription started then you're going to want to include any archived classrooms to make sure that usage is captured if you just want to see usage for the classrooms that are active then you would leave that uncheck marked and then select export reports when you export the report this is what it will look like or it will look similar to this I've wiped a lot of the data from this in terms of personal information for the students but yours of course would be populated so the report will start by giving you the classroom name whether it's active or archived you'll also get the students first and last name their login type how many times they've logged in as well as their username we also provide you with the date and time they first logged into their account as well as a date and time for the last time that they logged into their account and then we provide you some metrics and really what we're looking at here is your student engagement total time on the site in minutes the number of times they've been on the site in the past month which of course depending on when you introduce coding will you'll have Peaks and valleys a number of sessions in the past month that they have engaged with and then the total number of solutions submitted by the student during the subscription and what's great about this report is that it is granular at the student level so you can really see what engagement you're getting not only at a classroom level but really digging down further into the student level returning to our Kebab menu we now have the export course progress report foreign here you'll be given a drop down menu this report is run by course and it will provide you progress on all students who have completed challenges within that course during the time frame that or for the subscription in this case I'm going to go ahead and select sequencing in Loops again you need to determine whether you want archived classrooms included in this report or not and then you would click on exports when your report is done you'll be able to download it and it will look something like this similar to what we looked at with the activity report but giving you different data points so again you'll have the same information classroom name whether that classroom is active or archived the student's name and username for logging in and then information on how many challenges the student has completed within this course the total number of stars that they've earned as they've worked through the course and here's where we get into really the meat of this report so I'm going to move over just a little your average score column is again going to of course give you an average for each challenge that the students have completed give you kind of an aggregate average for for the overall course and as you're looking at this it's important to remember that A3 under any challenge is a perfect score so as you look at average scores for your students the closer they are to a three the better they are grasping the concepts they are being exposed to because a perfect score is going to be three and then you can also see the progress as you scroll to the right challenge by challenge you can see what that student score as they worked through the course and you're easily able to see that students that move quickly from one challenge to the next and out and are scoring that perfect score they are making progress this is how you can determine the student is actually progressing and is understanding and comprehending the concepts that they are being taught you are also given an average for the classroom and at the end of the report an average for the entire subscription I um talk with a lot of customers districts schools administrators and I can say that one thing that I hear very commonly this school year is that Code Monkey is being used specifically for exposing students to computer science or coding Concepts so this is a report that you can use to show that as well because if your student here is your concept sequencing your first 15 challenges in this course are related to sequencing here's your loops and all of the reports will have the concepts listed at the top so as you put those Concepts in conjunction with how the students scored you can easily show with metrics that your students are being exposed to those Concepts and are grasping them successfully so with that that concludes the demonstration portion of our event today so I'm going to hand it back to Maya who is going to pick up and show us what is coming in the very near future for Code Monkey wow Angie you are so thorough and so organized You Gotta Give me some tips after the webinar is finished I Wanna Be You amazing thank you for covering all of this uh and everyone again I want to remind you that we know that this is kind of a technical webinar so first of all q a session will be uh we'll have some time for that in the end you also can always reach out to us uh for um through the support email and you will see you will get the address uh email address at the end and this webinar will also be live on our YouTube and our webinar section at the website within a week or so maybe less uh so you can rewatch that whenever you want um so thank you Angie and I'm I know that the webinar is supposed to end at 6 15 in 15 minutes we may uh go overboard a little bit uh just to have more time for Q a uh so let's Jump Right In um so this is a a mockup image of what uh the the of the expanded admin dashboard what it's going to look like but before I jump into that I just wanted to say um that this admin dashboard is a result of a lot of feedback that we've been getting from administrators uh curriculum coordinators teachers and it's it's not the first time that we have built something in accordance uh of feedback that we received from teachers for example in the past uh we had a few teachers saying that they needed more assessment tools so we created the quizzes tab that you can find for in in every classroom's dashboard uh code Nike Junior the course for example initially had 30 challenges but we heard from teachers that the kiddos are loving it and they need more courses and more content so we upgraded it to 60 challenges and then again to 120 challenges so all of that is a result from feedback that we're getting from you uh you literally have the power to affect the product that you're that you're receiving that you're using that you're using daily that you're purchasing and working with so why am I saying that uh just that if we see that this new feature is being used and we get feedback on your needs uh maybe it doesn't cover all your needs maybe you have more uh specific particular granular things that you need from your admin dashboard well if anything is still being unfulfilled or with betters or some small tweaks would better suit your modus operandi so we will make changes and you will have an in an imprint on how the product and what the product looks like so please whenever you have feedback don't be shy tell us um okay back to the admin dashboard so the new and extended admin dashboard is not live yet it will be so uh in within the next week and but we do have some mockups that we'll be sharing with you today and uh it will be um and and once it is live you will all be able to dive deeper and explore on your own but you will have the knowledge that you acquired today so it's not you won't be starting from scratch uh so and again it gets a little bit technical but will will answer a question in the end so the admin dashboard here um our hypothesis was that District that means during the year during the school year I want to Monitor and track usage and progress of uh of their classrooms so at key points during the year and we know that admins are looking uh to know what is being used and what isn't where do we need to invest more time and effort and where are the success stories so our goal here is to give the admins uh sort of an impression or status of both General activity meaning usage and progress in courses um for that purpose the admin dashboard will display data relating to and pulled from the managed subscription and the main subscription classrooms uh the data that it will be displayed here gets uh updated every 24 hours which means every day you'll get you'll see changes you'll see movement and and it's displayed from the start of the subscription till the current day and and the charts which I will show you up close uh later would can display by weekly or monthly and the data and as long as uh for the term perspective um so the data sorry did you want to say something no all right so the data taken from all classrooms uh is in the subscription for all customers in the subscription of course is excluding archives classrooms by default so if you remember Angie showed you the reports before you can select whether you want archived classrooms to be included in the report or not here it's automatically excluded and the course yeah so the courses list displayed should be uh it's all Code Monkey courses and you can see here that we uh okay that again this is a mockup uh usually it wouldn't be zero schools because as Angie said uh the admins are the ones who really can benefit from adding schools and to the to the mix and to the helps divide the classrooms so the uh yeah so this is an overview of the subscription the number of schools the amount of classrooms how many students there are and how many teachers and you so you can see that from 822 students and 97 are engaged what does engaged mean engage means that they had over two sessions why we chose over two sessions because we assume usually the first session is the first sign up and then the second session is really activation and getting more uh HandsOn with playing and learning with the platform same goes for teachers uh in engaged teacher is a teacher that logged in more than once um on the student usage part of the overview you'll see that there's active students total onsite minutes and time spent on site break breakdown so all of those oh yeah so I had this yeah engaged you can see that wherever there's a tooltip there will be an explanation on what how we Define uh what is the bar how we Define this criteria so even if you forgot it's always right there at hand um so active students I think is pretty straightforward we just talked about it active students and students and that have signed in you can view it as weekly or monthly total onsite minutes will be the number of minutes spent by each student so this would be the average and time on site breakdown you can see here that it's between zero to nine minutes 10 to 29 30 to 59 and 60 minutes and above and you'll see the colors change throughout the year and for example we know that for a lot of subscriptions the median and time per session for a student would be around 12 minutes and because class is 45 minutes there is usually you know five minutes just getting students to concentrate and about 20 minutes of tutoring learning the theoretical part and then the Practical part of playing is usually about 15 minutes out of the class so you would see at the beginning of the year most of this will be green and then depending on what the frequency of classes is is a daily weekly uh I don't know whatever you choose uh so there's no right way to teach with Code Monkey we know that sometimes it's more of a structural lesson as I described uh just now but sometimes it's just free play and then and they let the kids just Play and Learn uh independently and then you would probably see the numbers change accordingly so I'm only uh delving into this just to make sure that if you see zero to nine just don't be worried it just means probably one class was done and so time spent uh oh yeah and this will be time spent by active students so this will only take um take the data from students that have activated their accounts uh total onsite minutes will be all time spent by all students and active students would be active students that had at least one session during the week or month so just to differentiate active students at least one session engage students at least two again weekly monthly you can filter it in any way that you want um so uh the last part would be student progress and again even I think even the wording here may change a little bit before this is launched you're really getting a sneak peek preview of something that we haven't launched yet so uh here on the student progress we can see amount of solutions submitted and you can choose so here is the tooltip says weekly last 12 weeks and you can click the drop down menu and select which course you want um to view or view all courses and it presents successful Solutions submitted by students in the subscription and again uh linking to what Angie said about the scoring system it can be between one to three stars so any solution between one to three stars will be presented here if students attempted uh to tempted a challenge but weren't able to complete it then it won't appear here it's not a solution submitted if they didn't complete the challenge and so this and again uh following on what Angie mentioned this can be a great way to show progress uh if you ever need to if ever uh you need your teachers to present uh progress to you or you need to present progress to somebody else or just want to monitor it um a great way to show progress can be screenshotting this once a month and I know screenshotting is not ideal we do plan on adding an ability to print or download it at a later stage but for now with this initial version a screenshot can be a way to go or again from the classrooms tab on your admin dashboard you can generate a usage report or an activity report and get all of that information there and before we finish I just want to say uh so in four days hour of code week begins hour of code week is uh as you must know the biggest week for all uh coding curriculums and we get a um we get a lot of activity during that time we know teachers really love using our courses in the classroom during hour of code and we have um specific courses that are designated per hour of course with for our code and hour of code lesson plans so even there we are aware that teachers need resources to be able to teach so I just wanted to share with you uh this is those are the steps so you the teachers or the students or whoever can choose a course that best suits their classroom or themselves review the course teacher notes prior to class and then make sure and that everybody has access to computer or laptop internet and code away um we have two more really cool things to let you know uh so four uh uniquely especially four hours of code we now have uh students and kids have an ability to generate and download uh certificates for themselves so if before uh a teacher would be would be the only one with access to download a certificate once the student completed the course now students and kids can do so themselves we have a health article on that uh on our help center which I by the way really recommend check out our help center very useful and we keep it up to date but to summarize once a student completed the course the thumbnail of the course will earn the V sign and become clickable and when they click it they can download they they there's a popup window and by clicking the download certificate button the certificate will be downloaded uh only note is when a child or student downloads their own certificate it will not include their teacher's name on it so as opposed to the certificates generated from the teacher's gradebook uh and uh in six days from now we have another free live webinar with Jonathan Shore one of our two amazing cofounders that started code monkey and it will be a live webinar and they'll be talking about the history of Code Monkey how everything started uh and where we are today it will be on Wednesday December 7th at 11 A.M EST um stay tuned you'll be getting an invite to this to sign up to this webinar uh by email and Q a we are ready to hear from you let's see if we have any questions pending questions okay well I know um it can take a minute or two to think of a question so uh we'll wait for a minute let you guys absorb everything that you learned here today and if you have any q and A's please write them in the Q a box in the meantime Angie do you wanna cover that yeah yes absolutely uh so before we wrap up uh and while you're thinking of any questions you may have remaining but we always want to make sure that you know we are here we have a team of folks available to help you you are invited to always reach out to our support team at support codemonkey.com or you can navigate as Maya mentioned previously to help.codemonkey.com where you'll get access to all of our health articles that include gifts videos and stepbystep instructions for just about anything you might be wanting to do within the platform exactly um I see that we have uh no question yet um okay well we wanna thank everybody for taking the time uh to join us today sorry Angie Uh Oh no you're okay yeah we would we do we want to thank everyone for joining we definitely want to thank you all for supporting yours you know all that you do to support teachers and students throughout the year and we also want to just leave you with a reminder to write code catch bananas and save the world have a wonderful day a wonderful holiday season and we wish you all the best
