00:04 - hello welcome to variable valley let's
00:07 - learn about variables
00:10 - variables store values
00:12 - the values could be numbers strings or
00:16 - even objects
00:18 - here's a piece of code where we use a
00:20 - variable
00:21 - with the name n
00:24 - the assignment operator which is the
00:26 - equal sign and the value is 5.
00:29 - so 5 is stored in the variable n
00:33 - later in the code we could use that
00:35 - variable n with a command such as the
00:37 - step command step n
00:41 - since n is 5 we're stepping 5. so
00:44 - anywhere in your code where you use a
00:45 - number you can use a variable instead
00:48 - just make sure you assign
00:50 - the variable of value before you use it
00:54 - let's look at an example
00:57 - here's an example
01:00 - where we have three variables
01:03 - in the code
01:05 - n
01:06 - has the value of five
01:08 - and it looks like n is controlling how
01:10 - many times the loop goes around
01:14 - x
01:15 - it has the value of 5 and it looks like
01:18 - that's how much we're stepping each time
01:20 - d has the value of 72
01:24 - and that is the amount of degrees that
01:26 - we're turning each time
01:28 - and if we look at the challenge you
01:30 - could see the monkey is stepping
01:33 - and turning
01:35 - in order to go in a circular pattern
01:40 - okay so let's just go ahead and run this
01:48 - and what's really cool in code monkey is
01:50 - there's this table here
01:52 - that will tell you the starting value of
01:54 - all the variables and if they change
01:56 - that change will
01:58 - appear there as well
02:00 - oh it looks like we need to change the
02:03 - value of how far it steps x
02:08 - 10 so x should actually
02:11 - be 10
02:13 - and since we change that to 10 now when
02:16 - we step x it'll say what's the value of
02:19 - x
02:20 - 10. so you see how 10 x is 10 now
02:32 - okay let's look at one more example
02:37 - now in this example you could see
02:40 - that the monkey is stepping in a spiral
02:44 - sort of pattern
02:46 - and first
02:48 - the monkey is stepping eight
02:50 - turning
02:51 - and then stepping 12 turning stepping 16
02:55 - turning
02:57 - 20 turning and 24. how are these numbers
03:00 - changing each
03:02 - time yeah it's changing by 4 each time 8
03:07 - plus 4 is 12 12 plus 4 is 16
03:10 - and so on
03:12 - and you see how
03:13 - the code they're giving us
03:16 - they have d is equal to h so that's the
03:19 - initial
03:20 - distance here
03:22 - and then we have a loop
03:24 - where we're stepping
03:26 - a certain amount
03:28 - d
03:29 - and then turning left and we're doing
03:31 - that over and over again
03:34 - but we want this d to be four more each
03:37 - time so the way you code that is say d
03:42 - equals
03:43 - d
03:44 - plus
03:45 - four
03:46 - this is a really common way of coding
03:51 - a variable changing by a certain amount
03:54 - each time
03:55 - so the way the code works it will
03:57 - evaluate what's on the right hand side
04:00 - say what's the what's the current value
04:02 - of d
04:03 - eight
04:04 - add four to it and then put it into the
04:07 - new value of d
04:09 - and that happens over and over again
04:13 - um also let's just look at this code one
04:16 - two three four five times i think we
04:19 - actually need to loop
04:22 - five times instead of three
04:25 - so let's go ahead and run this and
04:27 - remember to look
04:28 - at the variable table
04:31 - to see how it changes see this variable
04:33 - table see how d is changing
04:36 - not cool
04:39 - i love having this
04:41 - this table
04:47 - all right very good
04:51 - now that we've reviewed variables it's
04:53 - your turn to try variables good luck

hello welcome to variable valley let's learn about variables variables store values the values could be numbers strings or even objects here's a piece of code where we use a variable with the name n the assignment operator which is the equal sign and the value is 5. so 5 is stored in the variable n later in the code we could use that variable n with a command such as the step command step n since n is 5 we're stepping 5. so anywhere in your code where you use a number you can use a variable instead just make sure you assign the variable of value before you use it let's look at an example here's an example where we have three variables in the code n has the value of five and it looks like n is controlling how many times the loop goes around x it has the value of 5 and it looks like that's how much we're stepping each time d has the value of 72 and that is the amount of degrees that we're turning each time and if we look at the challenge you could see the monkey is stepping and turning in order to go in a circular pattern okay so let's just go ahead and run this and what's really cool in code monkey is there's this table here that will tell you the starting value of all the variables and if they change that change will appear there as well oh it looks like we need to change the value of how far it steps x 10 so x should actually be 10 and since we change that to 10 now when we step x it'll say what's the value of x 10. so you see how 10 x is 10 now okay let's look at one more example now in this example you could see that the monkey is stepping in a spiral sort of pattern and first the monkey is stepping eight turning and then stepping 12 turning stepping 16 turning 20 turning and 24. how are these numbers changing each time yeah it's changing by 4 each time 8 plus 4 is 12 12 plus 4 is 16 and so on and you see how the code they're giving us they have d is equal to h so that's the initial distance here and then we have a loop where we're stepping a certain amount d and then turning left and we're doing that over and over again but we want this d to be four more each time so the way you code that is say d equals d plus four this is a really common way of coding a variable changing by a certain amount each time so the way the code works it will evaluate what's on the right hand side say what's the what's the current value of d eight add four to it and then put it into the new value of d and that happens over and over again um also let's just look at this code one two three four five times i think we actually need to loop five times instead of three so let's go ahead and run this and remember to look at the variable table to see how it changes see this variable table see how d is changing not cool i love having this this table all right very good now that we've reviewed variables it's your turn to try variables good luck
