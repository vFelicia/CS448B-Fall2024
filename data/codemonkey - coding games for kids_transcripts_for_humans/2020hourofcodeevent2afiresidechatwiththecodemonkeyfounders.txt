01:32 - development and sales manager and
01:33 - basically what that means is that i work
01:35 - with teachers to train them
01:37 - on how to become code monkey teachers
01:39 - and then i also
01:40 - help your teachers purchase to bring
01:42 - code monkey to you
01:44 - and now i'm going to let the rest of my
01:46 - panelists introduce themselves
01:52 - hi everyone my name is molly schubach i
01:55 - am a member of the sales team here at
01:57 - codemonkey and
01:59 - joining today to help answer questions
02:01 - through zoom so thanks everyone for
02:02 - joining us hi
02:08 - everybody i'm bret eskelsen i also work
02:11 - on the sales team here and help
02:12 - schools and teachers get started using
02:15 - codemonkey
02:16 - and we're really excited to have
02:17 - everyone here
02:22 - i concur with that all right and now
02:25 - most importantly who you've been waiting
02:27 - to meet today and you are going to now
02:29 - meet our founder ido shore
02:34 - hi everyone uh so my name is da shor i'm
02:38 - a co-founder of code monkey studios
02:41 - and the cto which is chief technology
02:44 - officer
02:45 - uh excited uh to be here awesome
02:50 - thank you so much udo and i know
02:51 - everyone is very excited to be able to
02:54 - hear your story so today's webinar is
02:57 - going to be
02:58 - learning about what is code monkey from
03:00 - the founder himself
03:01 - um his story and we're gonna do an uh
03:04 - interview
03:05 - styles uh q a session here and then we
03:08 - also took your questions and we're going
03:10 - to ask him your questions as well as
03:11 - what questions you've asked
03:13 - in the q a um some people are asking
03:15 - when does this
03:16 - end this will be about 40 minutes or so
03:18 - so just so you have that on your agenda
03:21 - so code monkey um began in 2014 with the
03:25 - doe
03:25 - his brother and one of their childhood
03:27 - best friends they
03:29 - are computer programmers by nature and
03:31 - they'll be able to share he'll be able
03:32 - to share his story with you today
03:34 - um and basically when they started to
03:36 - begin teaching
03:37 - coding to kids they realized that they
03:40 - much prefer to learn it in a more
03:42 - gamified way and so that's how code
03:44 - monkey was born and so today we have
03:45 - about 20 million users worldwide so
03:48 - we hope that if you haven't checking us
03:50 - out during this hour of code event that
03:52 - you at least give us a try
03:53 - i think you'll really enjoy collecting
03:55 - bananas as much as we do
03:58 - so now it is time for our interview so i
04:01 - hope you all are
04:02 - as excited as we are um so first
04:05 - question for you ido is how did you
04:09 - first get interested in programming and
04:12 - coding
04:12 - and developing yeah
04:15 - so uh it was probably like
04:19 - 20 years ago when i was about
04:22 - 10 12 about that age
04:26 - there was a program called uh flash
04:30 - uh you might still see it sometimes like
04:32 - your browser will tell you
04:33 - flash is disabled so it's an old
04:36 - technology that's uh
04:38 - no longer watching use but it was uh
04:43 - it was a cool technology for like making
04:44 - like small animations and games
04:47 - and uh i just wanted i was like playing
04:50 - games myself and i wanted to
04:52 - create uh some of my own so i just
04:55 - i had a book of how to like
04:58 - how to work with flash so yeah this is
05:01 - like an example of something i made
05:03 - probably when i was like
05:04 - 11 years old like a small animation
05:08 - screenshot of the animation actually
05:10 - does a few things and there's like
05:12 - a little bit of uh uh interactions
05:15 - so uh like i was making small games and
05:19 - just uh writing just writing a little
05:22 - bit of code and learning how to code
05:25 - just a little bit while doing it
05:28 - so yeah it was the very first
05:31 - experience i had coding
05:36 - great um and as you can see here
05:39 - it didn't start out as um
05:42 - as amazing as code monkey is today so we
05:45 - i think that's great to see an example
05:47 - of how you begin
05:48 - began your coding journey oops
05:52 - excuse me okay so our next question is
05:55 - what was your first
05:56 - job right after you finished college and
05:58 - you'll hear ido say
06:00 - university because ito lives in israel
06:02 - if you did not know
06:03 - um and so there they call it university
06:05 - and here we call it college
06:08 - that's right i'm uh from israel and uh
06:11 - english is my second language so
06:14 - forgive me if i uh
06:17 - take a little more time um yes after
06:20 - university
06:22 - i worked at
06:24 - [Music]
06:25 - as a programmer in this company that did
06:30 - basically algorithms for
06:35 - medical things like i was
06:38 - doing this program which took a bunch of
06:41 - images of eyes of patients
06:45 - and just trying to make the eye doctors
06:48 - work
06:49 - a little easier by
06:52 - matching eye images together and it was
06:57 - actually as more boring than it sounds
07:00 - uh wasn't very exciting
07:06 - actually i guess i should be thankful it
07:08 - wasn't very exciting
07:12 - because it did drive me to work on
07:15 - something that i do like which is code
07:16 - monkey and
07:18 - uh and start that so
07:21 - i i did enjoy uh the process in that
07:24 - first job that you enjoy
07:26 - uh having something working and
07:29 - helping you know something important but
07:32 - the day-to-day was a kind of a letdown
07:35 - so
07:36 - yeah totally understand that i think
07:39 - everybody can relate
07:40 - and those of you when you reach out of
07:42 - college you'll also understand sometimes
07:43 - you don't always love your job as much
07:45 - as you would like so
07:47 - heart we hope we spark some joy for you
07:49 - today
07:50 - um so can you tell us so we know that
07:53 - you didn't really love your first
07:55 - job but you enjoyed the experience that
07:58 - you gained from that first job
07:59 - but what made you decide that you wanted
08:01 - to get started with code monkey
08:05 - uh so the ideas in code monkey and
08:08 - like many of the ideas started from me
08:11 - and
08:12 - my brother jonathan talking he had
08:17 - experience teaching kids to code and he
08:19 - had experience
08:21 - using just seeing what works and what
08:25 - doesn't work
08:26 - um like we both grew up playing computer
08:30 - games but i was like
08:32 - always more involved in that uh
08:35 - i always liked just being creative with
08:39 - music
08:40 - and with uh art um
08:43 - so from these conversations and just
08:46 - um seeing how he used to teach coding
08:50 - uh we got the idea of just uh taking
08:53 - something that actually
08:55 - uh worked well which was the logo
08:57 - programming language another technology
08:58 - that is
08:59 - kind of old um taking that
09:03 - idea and taking it further uh making it
09:06 - a game like uh putting a monkey in there
09:10 - like a cute monkey
09:11 - and having a story around it just
09:14 - um yeah like like you said we thought
09:17 - about
09:18 - how we would like to learn coding and we
09:21 - just it
09:22 - made a lot of sense to do it that way
09:27 - very great um
09:30 - okay so can you tell us a little bit
09:33 - about um and we all love the fun monkey
09:37 - i do know that ego has a fun fact for us
09:39 - and i know that
09:40 - he did some of the music for code monkey
09:46 - uh yeah i'm not sure how much of that
09:49 - music
09:49 - is still uh in the game i think
09:53 - maybe the only thing that's left that we
09:54 - haven't replaced
09:56 - because when you work on a product you
09:57 - keep like iterating like
09:59 - we have this you know things like
10:03 - you make like a a very harsh sound when
10:06 - you fail a challenge then people will
10:08 - tell you
10:09 - that's a little bit too harsh then we
10:10 - replace it with like a smaller ding
10:13 - or something so we keep iterating even
10:15 - on the sound but i think you know
10:16 - the one thing that i did like
10:19 - compose and state is like just a little
10:22 - uh
10:25 - that's when you finish uh when you
10:27 - collect all the bananas
10:29 - so that stayed and uh yeah we grew a
10:32 - little from there and we could hire
10:34 - uh professional musicians to do the
10:37 - to do the music to take over that
10:40 - although italy is quite talented in
10:42 - music so not only does he program he
10:43 - also plays some music
10:45 - which is more than we can say for some
10:47 - of the rest of us
10:49 - um so can you tell everyone i know you
10:52 - kind of touched over this briefly in the
10:53 - beginning but can you tell everyone what
10:55 - your role is within code monkey
10:59 - uh yes so the title is a
11:02 - chief technology officer and
11:06 - it can mean a few different things in a
11:08 - few different companies in our company
11:11 - uh it means uh i managed uh
11:15 - development team so we have a
11:19 - development team is uh three developers
11:23 - who you know code a product and code
11:26 - like everything
11:26 - around like either the games themselves
11:29 - or everything around the games making
11:31 - sure users can
11:33 - log in and the website is up and that
11:37 - everything is working and
11:38 - working on new features
11:41 - so i manage the developers and manage uh
11:45 - our product manager and i over select so
11:48 - basically it means
11:49 - overseeing the product
11:54 - and so that means the product is code
11:56 - monkey so that's what you guys all see
11:58 - on your side so he makes all of the
12:00 - everything that you see and do on code
12:02 - monkey is has to do with etho and his
12:04 - team
12:05 - so um
12:09 - sorry yeah i might explain to the
12:11 - product is uh
12:13 - so there's a lot of faces to it if
12:14 - you're a student then maybe you log in
12:16 - and you see
12:17 - uh you can play a game but there are
12:19 - lots of other
12:20 - parts of it that you might don't see
12:22 - that maybe only your teacher can see
12:24 - a bunch of screens and maybe like uh
12:28 - there are all kind of things that are
12:30 - working behind the scene to make sure
12:32 - like everything is uh
12:33 - working smoothly so yeah lots of aspects
12:37 - to that
12:38 - yeah basically the brain of code monkey
12:40 - part of vito and his team
12:42 - um so what are some things that you do
12:45 - um day to day so when you go into the
12:47 - office
12:48 - or you start working at co you start
12:50 - your day what are some things that you
12:51 - do
12:52 - in your day today um
12:55 - so big part of my job is
12:57 - [Music]
12:59 - working with my developers so
13:04 - if uh
13:07 - the people listening the students
13:08 - listening now have tried a bit of coding
13:10 - on codemonkey
13:12 - so they know what it means basically you
13:15 - can think of all
13:15 - coding as solving small riddles in code
13:20 - monkey it's uh
13:21 - like the reader is just getting the
13:23 - monkey to the banana
13:24 - but the job of uh of a code monkey
13:27 - developer
13:30 - might consist of things like um
13:34 - fixing a bug or having a
13:38 - certain data moving back and forth
13:42 - and there's a lot to it sometimes it's
13:44 - uh usually developers can
13:48 - are independent and they can figure out
13:50 - themselves
13:51 - but in many cases there are many
13:54 - different ways to do one thing
13:57 - so it's also something that happens in
13:58 - code monkey sometimes you can use a loop
14:00 - sometimes you can't use
14:01 - something just you don't have to use a
14:02 - loop but you can solve the same thing in
14:04 - a few ways
14:05 - so there's there's a lot of discussions
14:07 - i have when i with my developers
14:10 - it's less of using a loop yes or no it's
14:13 - more like
14:14 - uh gets into like uh uh
14:18 - like heavier questions revolving uh
14:22 - design design has in how the code is
14:26 - structured it's like
14:27 - the code monkey have when you write a
14:30 - when you solve a
14:31 - code market challenge you get 10 lines
14:33 - of code
14:34 - um the code monkey app meaning
14:37 - everything that's running
14:38 - behind the scenes and making sure that
14:40 - everything is working
14:41 - consists of uh tens of thousands of
14:44 - lines of code
14:46 - so it's like uh there are lots of
14:48 - considerations a lot of things i talk
14:50 - with my
14:51 - uh developers and how to do in the right
14:54 - way
14:56 - so that's a big part of the job also
14:59 - um like figuring out
15:02 - what should be done like how to solve
15:05 - problems for users
15:07 - how to make the experience uh smoother
15:12 - or more more fun lots and lots of things
15:14 - are done
15:15 - behind the scenes and so we only see a
15:17 - little bit of code us on the front side
15:19 - of things um that these
15:21 - edo and his team are writing hundreds of
15:23 - lines of code so
15:24 - and they're having a lot of fun when
15:25 - they do it yep and always
15:27 - problem solving along the way because
15:29 - there's nothing worse than when you get
15:32 - through finishing your code and finding
15:33 - you have an error or it doesn't work
15:35 - so well as you immediately assumed it
15:37 - would
15:39 - yeah so what do you think you do is the
15:41 - most challenging part of
15:43 - starting your own company
15:48 - um i would say um
15:52 - when you're starting a new company
15:53 - working on just an idea that you had
15:56 - and it's hard to try to convince other
16:00 - people that your
16:01 - idea is valid and that
16:04 - um something you thought about would
16:08 - uh be interesting to people like
16:12 - in the early days we would get feedback
16:15 - like
16:17 - either from other developers or teachers
16:21 - everyone had like their own idea of like
16:24 - um
16:25 - how you're supposed to enter code
16:27 - because that's the way
16:28 - they learned to code or that's like the
16:31 - um
16:32 - that's the experience they had and like
16:36 - you know just um you need you do need to
16:39 - learn to listen to other people but you
16:40 - do need to have a
16:44 - certain pride and just be sure of what
16:47 - you're doing
16:48 - um yeah because otherwise you just end
16:51 - up doing something that's
16:53 - already been done so you gotta like uh
16:56 - you gotta uh you gotta be able to trust
16:58 - your gut
17:00 - so yeah and that's and that's a
17:02 - challenge
17:04 - sometimes people don't always like when
17:06 - you trust your gut
17:10 - even though it's the right way right um
17:14 - yeah you're like as a as a founder
17:17 - you're like uh
17:18 - you're taking a risk like uh you're
17:22 - in many cases uh you leave a job that
17:26 - you have
17:27 - to try something that might work and
17:29 - might
17:31 - leave you out of the job in a few months
17:33 - uh
17:35 - but yeah i've been uh i've been
17:37 - privileged to
17:38 - go with my idea and and uh try it out
17:42 - and uh yeah and it worked out
17:48 - what do you think what has been the most
17:50 - meaningful from your experience of
17:51 - starting your own company
17:55 - um
17:59 - well i guess um i really enjoy
18:03 - um i really enjoying
18:06 - students who like getting feedback
18:10 - from students getting feedback from kids
18:13 - um
18:14 - i enjoy seeing what kids do on the game
18:18 - builder
18:19 - there's so many uh creative
18:23 - uh ways students are using the game
18:26 - builder that i
18:27 - like didn't think were possible
18:30 - so it's really cool to see someone build
18:33 - on top of your ideas like
18:36 - understand what you were doing and
18:38 - understand how to use
18:40 - a tool you created and just using it
18:44 - and working on top of on that and
18:46 - learning in the process
18:48 - um it's great you know like uh
18:52 - it's great to know that uh could have
18:54 - affected uh
18:56 - some kids uh who got a kick out of
18:58 - coding
19:00 - thanks to the code market yeah and
19:02 - actually on that
19:03 - on that note um how many people
19:06 - weston asked this question about how
19:09 - many people
19:10 - a day do you think play code monkey
19:14 - um i'd have to look at the numbers think
19:16 - it's like uh
19:17 - tens of thousands now
19:21 - in that area depends if it's the school
19:24 - year or not and uh yeah
19:25 - hopefully we'll get uh like hundreds of
19:28 - thousands a day uh
19:30 - in uh hour of code
19:34 - great it's our favorite event of the
19:35 - year we know that um
19:38 - okay so the next thing that we're going
19:40 - to do is we're going to transition
19:42 - from questions to the from the audience
19:44 - so these are questions that our audience
19:46 - asked when they registered for today's
19:47 - event and so this first question comes
19:50 - from
19:50 - miss jonakowski sorry if i said your
19:52 - name incorrectly i'm from homer illinois
19:55 - what was your favorite
19:57 - what were your favorite subjects in
19:58 - school
20:03 - my favorite subject in school um
20:07 - i guess in high school i didn't learn
20:09 - coding in
20:11 - middle school because like
20:14 - this i was in school like about 20 15
20:17 - years ago
20:19 - and then i only started to learn coding
20:21 - in high school
20:23 - and uh yeah i was really into that
20:27 - um i had just a little experience as i
20:31 - said in flash but we were learning a
20:33 - language called ascot and i actually
20:36 - remember
20:37 - like we got in the computer room
20:40 - and uh and we had like an assignment
20:44 - like to make some kind of program that
20:47 - does something i don't remember what was
20:50 - the test but i just remember like
20:51 - finishing it early
20:53 - and then doing like uh like something
20:56 - fun
20:56 - with code um
20:59 - yeah so that was fun if you don't know
21:02 - what pascal language is definitely
21:04 - recommend you
21:05 - googling it check out what that language
21:06 - is it's one of the
21:08 - beginning languages right it's an
21:11 - old-fashioned one yeah
21:12 - it's uh i think if you like to read
21:17 - you can read some pascal and like if
21:19 - you've coded before you can kind of
21:21 - get what things what it's up to but it's
21:25 - uh
21:26 - yeah definitely looks great if you
21:28 - learned like
21:29 - copyscript the javascript
21:32 - great um this one comes from
21:36 - i believe miss lily from new york
21:39 - alabama what is the hardest part of
21:42 - coding
21:44 - um so there are many hard parts in uh
21:50 - cutting what is the hardest part
21:55 - well there's like a kind of it's
22:00 - yeah bugs are hard uh
22:03 - mostly if you ask coders there's a thing
22:05 - called
22:07 - usually they would say something like
22:08 - naming things
22:11 - so uh i guess if you
22:14 - uh maybe if you did again game builder
22:16 - you maybe sometimes have to name
22:18 - a thing meaning like um
22:22 - i don't know name a character but this
22:25 - character can be
22:27 - uh the villain but then it can also be
22:30 - the
22:30 - the hero or you know just naming
22:33 - concepts figuring out like
22:36 - what a part of the code does is uh and
22:40 - how to just give it a very
22:41 - descriptive name so a lot of
22:45 - much of much about coding is just
22:49 - um being able to write code that
22:52 - other humans can understand not other
22:56 - not only other not only the machine can
22:58 - understand but also other
23:00 - humans can read what you did and
23:02 - understand
23:04 - so so that part is hard
23:07 - so yeah i totally agree
23:10 - sometimes i look at i'm not a very good
23:13 - coder so i'm just a very beginner coder
23:15 - but sometimes when i look into the
23:16 - people's codes when they're doing a
23:18 - sprint which is a
23:20 - lot of a very long coding project and
23:22 - you look and you see
23:23 - there's it's very overwhelming you see
23:25 - how much code goes into there so i can
23:27 - totally understand why it's important to
23:28 - be
23:29 - descriptive not only for your team but
23:31 - for other people
23:33 - this one comes from miss simmons from
23:36 - pamal i don't even know how to say that
23:39 - uh city so sorry about that from
23:40 - pennsylvania that part i do know
23:42 - um what types of careers do you think
23:45 - are available
23:46 - in coding uh that's a good question
23:50 - so i guess i took one
23:53 - career path which was uh
23:56 - like at the beginning of code monkey i
23:58 - was uh doing most of the coding
24:01 - and then we grew and i like what i do
24:04 - now is mostly
24:06 - manage other developers but i do
24:09 - i do still write some code myself
24:12 - um so that's one career path just being
24:14 - a developer and then maybe manage other
24:16 - developers once you have enough
24:18 - experience
24:20 - there are other career paths so some
24:23 - developers become
24:24 - product managers which are basically the
24:27 - people who decide
24:29 - uh what to code like what should the
24:32 - product
24:33 - look like like what should the game look
24:35 - like what should the
24:37 - dashboard for the teacher look like so
24:39 - they usually need to understand a bit of
24:40 - coding because they work with
24:43 - uh coders um
24:46 - and then like a third one i can think of
24:48 - is um
24:51 - working with data so we have someone in
24:53 - the company
24:54 - uh we learned computer science and is
24:58 - now
25:00 - doing marketing but in this day
25:04 - and age uh like so much of the marketing
25:06 - is done online and it's with data
25:09 - and uh you need to learn you need to
25:11 - know how to code like how to work with
25:13 - that data
25:14 - then they can say like uh people in
25:17 - uruguay are interested in coding maybe
25:20 - you should
25:20 - put an advertisement for them you know
25:23 - or something like
25:25 - uh everyone like challenge
25:28 - 25 in coding adventure is too hard
25:31 - because
25:32 - 50 of uh people who started don't finish
25:36 - it so
25:37 - all these things like in many cases
25:39 - require a little bit of coding to to get
25:42 - the insight
25:43 - out of the data so you're saying you
25:45 - have to
25:46 - understand some data which i know lots
25:48 - of you learn in your day-to-day
25:50 - schooling and it plays some
25:51 - plays quite a bit of an importance in
25:53 - the coding side of things right
25:58 - um yeah like data and coding are really
26:01 - like
26:02 - um you can't have one well i guess you
26:04 - can have data without
26:05 - coding but you kind of coding without
26:07 - data everything is about
26:09 - um yeah numbers and text and uh
26:12 - you know things like that i agree and i
26:16 - know that in our company and we talked
26:17 - about this in our other webinar that
26:19 - there are other sides
26:21 - in a company that does coding as well
26:23 - like myself i work with professionals
26:25 - i work with teachers and training them
26:27 - and there's other people who
26:29 - work on the advertisements for code
26:30 - monkey and what you see on the webpage
26:32 - and all the graphics so there's lots of
26:34 - big
26:35 - lots of teams but knowing a little bit
26:36 - of code helps get your foot in the door
26:38 - with all of these coding
26:40 - platforms and we know that digital is
26:42 - where i mean you're interacting with us
26:44 - virtually right now
26:45 - too um so we have mrs
26:48 - miss lomb liam barker excuse me
26:52 - i see somebody said there was their
26:53 - teacher um in skillman new jersey and
26:56 - her question was
26:57 - um what types of careers are available
27:01 - um oh whoops i messed that up
27:04 - they would like to know if you have any
27:05 - advice for third and fourth graders to
27:08 - be
27:08 - successful
27:12 - um so i guess it's it would be
27:17 - [Music]
27:18 - um
27:20 - well i would say i would split my advice
27:22 - to two i was
27:24 - uh um
27:27 - you have to work hard like you have to
27:29 - uh
27:32 - you have to study and you have to uh get
27:34 - in the details and
27:36 - you shouldn't be afraid um to fail
27:39 - because
27:40 - when you do coding and when you learn
27:43 - uh things that are hard like math uh
27:47 - it's gonna be hard so uh um
27:51 - so be ready to like uh to study art for
27:55 - that but
27:56 - also um i guess the other
27:59 - part of that is um
28:02 - is find your passion so like i guess i
28:05 - was uh
28:06 - lucky that yeah my passion
28:11 - led me in a good career path but it's
28:15 - that you can
28:16 - you gotta work on something that
28:19 - you're passionate about i agree and i
28:22 - think also what you mentioned earlier
28:24 - about trusting your gut i think is also
28:26 - something
28:26 - important because sometimes we think
28:27 - we're interested in something and
28:29 - sometimes you give it a try and it might
28:30 - not just be
28:31 - the right thing so i think also you said
28:33 - something about being
28:34 - able to handle failure is a big piece of
28:37 - all of that as well
28:39 - um so this next one comes from miss
28:41 - watts in cartersville georgia how can
28:44 - block coding benefit students rather
28:46 - than just doing text-based coding like
28:48 - python or javascript
28:52 - so um block coding is um
28:58 - is helpful is uh it's a very
29:01 - um it's a good entry point
29:05 - for young kids uh to get into the world
29:08 - of logic
29:09 - and uh uh
29:12 - codemonkey started out as a completely
29:15 - text-based
29:17 - um platform we only did games that
29:22 - made you type uh use the keyboard like a
29:25 - real programmer
29:27 - and um it is a very
29:30 - important um aspect
29:33 - of coding uh like no like real world
29:37 - quarters i use like this drag and drop
29:41 - interface and uh the reason is they
29:44 - are limited there are
29:47 - they become a crotch at some point um
29:52 - so it's like it's a barrier that
29:54 - eventually if uh
29:55 - people really want to understand and
29:58 - know how to code you gotta uh
30:01 - get across the drag and drop interfaces
30:04 - into
30:05 - uh text-based coding programming
30:08 - languages
30:10 - but text base is harder than
30:13 - dragon drop and blockly
30:16 - [Music]
30:17 - platform so yeah so it's a good entry
30:20 - point
30:21 - um but i recommend uh
30:25 - looking at the text basis like uh the
30:27 - next thing
30:28 - and uh that's the next step i would
30:30 - agree yeah i do think the block base
30:33 - tends to be easier but it also helps you
30:36 - learn
30:37 - exactly what you're saying it's a really
30:38 - great next step for learning how to code
30:40 - because now you've learned all the
30:41 - computational thinking and now you know
30:43 - how things
30:44 - kind of work together so it kind of lays
30:46 - the foundation i think for
30:48 - the next we have this question
30:51 - here what is the difference in our chat
30:54 - what's the difference between javascript
30:56 - and python
30:58 - so javascript and python are two
31:01 - programming language
31:02 - so you could ask
31:05 - i could say what what a programming
31:09 - language is
31:11 - so a programming language is kind of
31:12 - like uh
31:14 - like two programming languages refer
31:16 - like to human languages the first so
31:20 - french and english are two different
31:21 - languages they can both express
31:24 - you can both use you can use either
31:26 - french or english
31:27 - to say something like uh i'm hungry i
31:30 - want to eat a burger
31:33 - but these are you would say differently
31:35 - in french
31:36 - um so two programming languages are yeah
31:39 - they're equal in the way they can do the
31:41 - same thing
31:42 - usually in most cases but they
31:46 - look different and behave differently
31:50 - [Music]
31:52 - so python and javascript are different
31:54 - programming language
31:55 - they both can solve like almost
31:58 - entirely the same problems but they do
32:01 - it differently
32:03 - but it's and it's a big but javascript
32:06 - is the only languages
32:07 - language that can run in a browser so if
32:10 - you're thinking
32:11 - of doing a project if you're thinking of
32:15 - starting your own website
32:16 - and putting out this like a small uh
32:20 - game on the website you will have a much
32:23 - harder time doing that on python
32:25 - you should learn javascript but
32:29 - if you have other concerns then look
32:30 - into python
32:32 - that's a good tip why do you think this
32:35 - is from miss
32:36 - c in austin texas actually where i am
32:39 - why is it important do you think for
32:42 - students to learn how to code
32:45 - um so learning how to go first of all
32:48 - it's um as we like talked about people
32:52 - have asked
32:54 - yeah it's a good skill to have as we
32:56 - said like if you're thinking about
32:58 - uh like career-wise but uh
33:02 - even if you don't like i'm thinking of
33:04 - that i think it's
33:06 - it's good to know um
33:09 - some coding because like we're using
33:12 - a program now and we're just like
33:15 - so much of our life is digital
33:18 - and i think it's uh important to just be
33:23 - aware of how these things work and like
33:26 - um just understanding things like
33:29 - uh what's a bug like bugs can be
33:33 - like um they can be like very
33:37 - serious things like in a digital world
33:40 - right they can stop a
33:42 - classroom like a lesson from happening
33:45 - they can stop
33:46 - uh cars from working
33:50 - like bugs are like uh very important so
33:53 - i think it's important people know like
33:54 - how code works and
33:56 - like what does it mean like to have a
33:58 - bug it's important for people like
34:00 - to understand um
34:04 - how the internet works and how their
34:06 - information
34:08 - is uh how their information
34:11 - is used and can be used and what it
34:13 - means
34:14 - for uh their security
34:17 - i think it's important to like just
34:20 - because so much of our world is
34:22 - digital um it should not be
34:26 - people shouldn't uh look at it as like
34:28 - complete
34:29 - magic that is unexplainable because it
34:32 - is explainable like
34:34 - it's all been written by people who went
34:36 - to school and learned how to code and
34:38 - they just
34:38 - wrote it and there are and they're just
34:41 - that they're just
34:42 - people sometimes make mistake and it's
34:45 - important that everyone like kind of
34:47 - understand what is going on in the
34:49 - digital world
34:50 - i agree and cyber security has been the
34:52 - hot button
34:53 - issue for quite some time especially
34:55 - from this coveted pandemic so it's good
34:57 - to hear that you also
34:59 - share that insight of the importance of
35:01 - it
35:02 - i'm going to take one question here from
35:04 - our q a
35:05 - this is a fun one do you think if you
35:06 - hadn't gotten into code monkey that you
35:08 - would have pursued a career in music
35:13 - i thought about it uh before i went to
35:16 - school
35:16 - so uh uh i was actually
35:20 - so i'm from israel and i was in the army
35:22 - as most uh
35:24 - uh israelis who turned 18 go to the army
35:29 - so when i got out at 21 uh
35:32 - i was thinking about a career in music
35:35 - um but i guess it was
35:38 - kind of like what i talked about before
35:41 - about passions so i was enjoying music
35:43 - but i wasn't really
35:44 - passionate enough to make it my living
35:47 - especially in music it's very hard to
35:49 - make a living out of it so now music is
35:53 - just a hobby for me
35:55 - and i'm glad that
35:58 - i'm glad i'm doing what i'm doing right
35:59 - now and uh
36:01 - sounds like you're still very passionate
36:03 - about coding so it's good to
36:05 - it's good to be able to share that
36:08 - um yeah so it's uh it's actually ever in
36:11 - everything you
36:13 - you do for a living uh i think you can
36:16 - find like aspects of it that
36:18 - do excite you so yeah i wasn't always
36:21 - like
36:22 - it wasn't always uh fun working on code
36:25 - marketing there have been hard times and
36:27 - there have been times that i
36:28 - had to do something maybe a little
36:31 - boring or
36:33 - like that but yeah i think it's um
36:38 - i think it's important that you do
36:40 - something
36:41 - like you focus on the area in your work
36:43 - that
36:44 - uh you are passionate about
36:48 - i think that's i think that's important
36:49 - to to keep in mind that you might not
36:52 - always love it 100
36:53 - all the time but it still gives you that
36:56 - you still know what you're
36:57 - i think it's important to know what your
36:58 - true north is and it sounds like you do
37:00 - know what that is
37:02 - um this question comes from mr oman in
37:05 - uh converse texas oh another texas
37:08 - what qualities or skills do you think is
37:10 - important
37:11 - to obtain in this field and i think you
37:14 - mentioned failure obviously um
37:18 - maybe even the ability to communicate
37:19 - with other people um
37:22 - and maybe even take some feedback do you
37:24 - have anything else that
37:26 - you think are some important features
37:27 - that kids or
37:29 - skills qualities they should have
37:32 - yeah i mean you said it perfectly i
37:34 - think communication
37:36 - is is uh underrated there's like this
37:40 - um i guess this uh
37:43 - false ideal of a programmer that is
37:46 - completely false
37:48 - but like sometimes you would see movies
37:50 - like a programmer just sitting alone at
37:51 - this desk
37:53 - just typing for uh the whole night and
37:56 - just coming up and
37:58 - oh yes i made it i like hacked the
38:00 - mainframe or i
38:01 - uh wrote facebook in a day or something
38:04 - like that
38:05 - but that is so uh out of touch
38:08 - with reality the reality of coding is
38:11 - just
38:12 - being able to communicate with your
38:14 - peers and being respectful
38:16 - of other people's opinion about your
38:19 - work
38:19 - and being able to communicate
38:23 - to your peers about their work and give
38:26 - feedback and get feedback
38:29 - those are the riches of of good
38:32 - programmers not like
38:33 - being able to like uh crunch
38:37 - like just be alone with the computer all
38:39 - day and write
38:40 - code all night that's that's not that's
38:43 - not a good lifestyle
38:46 - it's true you have to have a little bit
38:47 - of
38:49 - variance from that um so in the effort
38:51 - of time we're going to take one more
38:53 - question from our audience that we had
38:55 - here
38:56 - and i think this is probably my most
38:58 - favorite and best
39:00 - question why did you name code monkey
39:02 - code monkey
39:05 - um so as i
39:08 - talked about before about the
39:09 - conversations we had me and jonathan had
39:13 - um
39:15 - i guess i was i kind of like monkeys
39:17 - they're cute
39:20 - my partner see she also really likes
39:23 - monkeys she used to volunteer with
39:24 - monkeys
39:26 - in south america once and uh i guess i
39:29 - was just thinking about monkeys monkeys
39:31 - uh
39:33 - were just in my head and then we thought
39:34 - about uh
39:36 - doing like a game that is like having a
39:39 - character move across the screen
39:41 - and then there there was this term code
39:43 - monkey which is like
39:45 - kind of means a bad thing like uh like a
39:48 - coder that's like
39:50 - not really uh excited about what it
39:53 - what they do um but i thought it would
39:56 - be
39:57 - cute to give like a twist of like no
39:59 - it's just it's a
40:00 - cute little monkey and he's collecting
40:02 - bananas and
40:03 - that's it's a game and i like it's all
40:06 - like um
40:08 - like all the puzzle pieces came together
40:10 - and like it made a lot of sense
40:12 - a lot of sense to just have the
40:13 - character a monkey have the name
40:16 - uh code monkey and just go with that
40:21 - we're happy that we did make code monkey
40:24 - into more of a fun term than what it was
40:27 - originally used
40:28 - for so we just
40:31 - want to round out today by telling
40:35 - all of you and sharing all of your
40:37 - experiences with us today and making
40:39 - sure you had your questions there were
40:41 - so many great questions that all of you
40:42 - asked beforehand
40:44 - thank you so much to ido as well for
40:46 - sharing your story with all of our
40:47 - audience and especially because we know
40:49 - it is pretty late there in israel so
40:52 - we're glad that he was able to join us
40:53 - and spend some time and share your
40:55 - stories and we hope that this
40:56 - sparks some joy for you whether you
40:58 - decide you want to become a computer
40:59 - programmer
41:00 - or you just want to explore owning your
41:02 - own business someday hopefully you had
41:04 - some really great takeaways
41:06 - we want to thank you guys so much again
41:08 - for joining us during the hour of code
41:10 - week
41:10 - the best week in our opinion of the
41:13 - whole year
41:14 - um so we hope you check out us on our
41:17 - hour of code through code.org or on our
41:19 - own webpage and
41:20 - you check out our new space adventure
41:22 - course it's one of our favorite what's
41:24 - better than being in space
41:26 - you know you can can code in space and
41:28 - maybe eventually elon musk will take you
41:30 - to space so you never know where that
41:31 - will take you
41:32 - um so thank you again everybody and
41:35 - thank you so much to our team brett
41:36 - molly and ido
41:38 - of course the shining star of today's
41:40 - webinar um
41:41 - and as always write code catch bananas
41:43 - and save the world we'll see you guys

everyone we want to thank you so much for joining us for today's webinar the code monkey team wants to thank you all for joining us for our webinar and bringing your questions for us we have some really great questions beforehand we want to thank those of us that are joining us on facebook and youtube for today's event our goal of today's webinar is to really get you excited about coding and to give you a first look into what it looks like to own a coding company and we know that this year has been anything but normal and we hope that if anything this this coronavirus pandemic endemic has shown you that our world is going even more digital if you would like to ask any questions during today's event please write it in the chat box or if you're joining us on zoom you can also place it in the q a box so you can also follow us on our twitter instagram facebook our youtube or you can also check out our code monkey blog it's always up to date with some new fun trends and unplugged activities and different topics that we cover so we hope that you give us a chance to check that out as well and now i'm going to go ahead and we're going to meet the team that's going to be hosting alongside myself um so my name first i'm the mc for today's event my name is lena saleh and i'm the professional development and sales manager and basically what that means is that i work with teachers to train them on how to become code monkey teachers and then i also help your teachers purchase to bring code monkey to you and now i'm going to let the rest of my panelists introduce themselves hi everyone my name is molly schubach i am a member of the sales team here at codemonkey and joining today to help answer questions through zoom so thanks everyone for joining us hi everybody i'm bret eskelsen i also work on the sales team here and help schools and teachers get started using codemonkey and we're really excited to have everyone here i concur with that all right and now most importantly who you've been waiting to meet today and you are going to now meet our founder ido shore hi everyone uh so my name is da shor i'm a cofounder of code monkey studios and the cto which is chief technology officer uh excited uh to be here awesome thank you so much udo and i know everyone is very excited to be able to hear your story so today's webinar is going to be learning about what is code monkey from the founder himself um his story and we're gonna do an uh interview styles uh q a session here and then we also took your questions and we're going to ask him your questions as well as what questions you've asked in the q a um some people are asking when does this end this will be about 40 minutes or so so just so you have that on your agenda so code monkey um began in 2014 with the doe his brother and one of their childhood best friends they are computer programmers by nature and they'll be able to share he'll be able to share his story with you today um and basically when they started to begin teaching coding to kids they realized that they much prefer to learn it in a more gamified way and so that's how code monkey was born and so today we have about 20 million users worldwide so we hope that if you haven't checking us out during this hour of code event that you at least give us a try i think you'll really enjoy collecting bananas as much as we do so now it is time for our interview so i hope you all are as excited as we are um so first question for you ido is how did you first get interested in programming and coding and developing yeah so uh it was probably like 20 years ago when i was about 10 12 about that age there was a program called uh flash uh you might still see it sometimes like your browser will tell you flash is disabled so it's an old technology that's uh no longer watching use but it was uh it was a cool technology for like making like small animations and games and uh i just wanted i was like playing games myself and i wanted to create uh some of my own so i just i had a book of how to like how to work with flash so yeah this is like an example of something i made probably when i was like 11 years old like a small animation screenshot of the animation actually does a few things and there's like a little bit of uh uh interactions so uh like i was making small games and just uh writing just writing a little bit of code and learning how to code just a little bit while doing it so yeah it was the very first experience i had coding great um and as you can see here it didn't start out as um as amazing as code monkey is today so we i think that's great to see an example of how you begin began your coding journey oops excuse me okay so our next question is what was your first job right after you finished college and you'll hear ido say university because ito lives in israel if you did not know um and so there they call it university and here we call it college that's right i'm uh from israel and uh english is my second language so forgive me if i uh take a little more time um yes after university i worked at as a programmer in this company that did basically algorithms for medical things like i was doing this program which took a bunch of images of eyes of patients and just trying to make the eye doctors work a little easier by matching eye images together and it was actually as more boring than it sounds uh wasn't very exciting actually i guess i should be thankful it wasn't very exciting because it did drive me to work on something that i do like which is code monkey and uh and start that so i i did enjoy uh the process in that first job that you enjoy uh having something working and helping you know something important but the daytoday was a kind of a letdown so yeah totally understand that i think everybody can relate and those of you when you reach out of college you'll also understand sometimes you don't always love your job as much as you would like so heart we hope we spark some joy for you today um so can you tell us so we know that you didn't really love your first job but you enjoyed the experience that you gained from that first job but what made you decide that you wanted to get started with code monkey uh so the ideas in code monkey and like many of the ideas started from me and my brother jonathan talking he had experience teaching kids to code and he had experience using just seeing what works and what doesn't work um like we both grew up playing computer games but i was like always more involved in that uh i always liked just being creative with music and with uh art um so from these conversations and just um seeing how he used to teach coding uh we got the idea of just uh taking something that actually uh worked well which was the logo programming language another technology that is kind of old um taking that idea and taking it further uh making it a game like uh putting a monkey in there like a cute monkey and having a story around it just um yeah like like you said we thought about how we would like to learn coding and we just it made a lot of sense to do it that way very great um okay so can you tell us a little bit about um and we all love the fun monkey i do know that ego has a fun fact for us and i know that he did some of the music for code monkey uh yeah i'm not sure how much of that music is still uh in the game i think maybe the only thing that's left that we haven't replaced because when you work on a product you keep like iterating like we have this you know things like you make like a a very harsh sound when you fail a challenge then people will tell you that's a little bit too harsh then we replace it with like a smaller ding or something so we keep iterating even on the sound but i think you know the one thing that i did like compose and state is like just a little uh that's when you finish uh when you collect all the bananas so that stayed and uh yeah we grew a little from there and we could hire uh professional musicians to do the to do the music to take over that although italy is quite talented in music so not only does he program he also plays some music which is more than we can say for some of the rest of us um so can you tell everyone i know you kind of touched over this briefly in the beginning but can you tell everyone what your role is within code monkey uh yes so the title is a chief technology officer and it can mean a few different things in a few different companies in our company uh it means uh i managed uh development team so we have a development team is uh three developers who you know code a product and code like everything around like either the games themselves or everything around the games making sure users can log in and the website is up and that everything is working and working on new features so i manage the developers and manage uh our product manager and i over select so basically it means overseeing the product and so that means the product is code monkey so that's what you guys all see on your side so he makes all of the everything that you see and do on code monkey is has to do with etho and his team so um sorry yeah i might explain to the product is uh so there's a lot of faces to it if you're a student then maybe you log in and you see uh you can play a game but there are lots of other parts of it that you might don't see that maybe only your teacher can see a bunch of screens and maybe like uh there are all kind of things that are working behind the scene to make sure like everything is uh working smoothly so yeah lots of aspects to that yeah basically the brain of code monkey part of vito and his team um so what are some things that you do um day to day so when you go into the office or you start working at co you start your day what are some things that you do in your day today um so big part of my job is working with my developers so if uh the people listening the students listening now have tried a bit of coding on codemonkey so they know what it means basically you can think of all coding as solving small riddles in code monkey it's uh like the reader is just getting the monkey to the banana but the job of uh of a code monkey developer might consist of things like um fixing a bug or having a certain data moving back and forth and there's a lot to it sometimes it's uh usually developers can are independent and they can figure out themselves but in many cases there are many different ways to do one thing so it's also something that happens in code monkey sometimes you can use a loop sometimes you can't use something just you don't have to use a loop but you can solve the same thing in a few ways so there's there's a lot of discussions i have when i with my developers it's less of using a loop yes or no it's more like uh gets into like uh uh like heavier questions revolving uh design design has in how the code is structured it's like the code monkey have when you write a when you solve a code market challenge you get 10 lines of code um the code monkey app meaning everything that's running behind the scenes and making sure that everything is working consists of uh tens of thousands of lines of code so it's like uh there are lots of considerations a lot of things i talk with my uh developers and how to do in the right way so that's a big part of the job also um like figuring out what should be done like how to solve problems for users how to make the experience uh smoother or more more fun lots and lots of things are done behind the scenes and so we only see a little bit of code us on the front side of things um that these edo and his team are writing hundreds of lines of code so and they're having a lot of fun when they do it yep and always problem solving along the way because there's nothing worse than when you get through finishing your code and finding you have an error or it doesn't work so well as you immediately assumed it would yeah so what do you think you do is the most challenging part of starting your own company um i would say um when you're starting a new company working on just an idea that you had and it's hard to try to convince other people that your idea is valid and that um something you thought about would uh be interesting to people like in the early days we would get feedback like either from other developers or teachers everyone had like their own idea of like um how you're supposed to enter code because that's the way they learned to code or that's like the um that's the experience they had and like you know just um you need you do need to learn to listen to other people but you do need to have a certain pride and just be sure of what you're doing um yeah because otherwise you just end up doing something that's already been done so you gotta like uh you gotta uh you gotta be able to trust your gut so yeah and that's and that's a challenge sometimes people don't always like when you trust your gut even though it's the right way right um yeah you're like as a as a founder you're like uh you're taking a risk like uh you're in many cases uh you leave a job that you have to try something that might work and might leave you out of the job in a few months uh but yeah i've been uh i've been privileged to go with my idea and and uh try it out and uh yeah and it worked out what do you think what has been the most meaningful from your experience of starting your own company um well i guess um i really enjoy um i really enjoying students who like getting feedback from students getting feedback from kids um i enjoy seeing what kids do on the game builder there's so many uh creative uh ways students are using the game builder that i like didn't think were possible so it's really cool to see someone build on top of your ideas like understand what you were doing and understand how to use a tool you created and just using it and working on top of on that and learning in the process um it's great you know like uh it's great to know that uh could have affected uh some kids uh who got a kick out of coding thanks to the code market yeah and actually on that on that note um how many people weston asked this question about how many people a day do you think play code monkey um i'd have to look at the numbers think it's like uh tens of thousands now in that area depends if it's the school year or not and uh yeah hopefully we'll get uh like hundreds of thousands a day uh in uh hour of code great it's our favorite event of the year we know that um okay so the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to transition from questions to the from the audience so these are questions that our audience asked when they registered for today's event and so this first question comes from miss jonakowski sorry if i said your name incorrectly i'm from homer illinois what was your favorite what were your favorite subjects in school my favorite subject in school um i guess in high school i didn't learn coding in middle school because like this i was in school like about 20 15 years ago and then i only started to learn coding in high school and uh yeah i was really into that um i had just a little experience as i said in flash but we were learning a language called ascot and i actually remember like we got in the computer room and uh and we had like an assignment like to make some kind of program that does something i don't remember what was the test but i just remember like finishing it early and then doing like uh like something fun with code um yeah so that was fun if you don't know what pascal language is definitely recommend you googling it check out what that language is it's one of the beginning languages right it's an oldfashioned one yeah it's uh i think if you like to read you can read some pascal and like if you've coded before you can kind of get what things what it's up to but it's uh yeah definitely looks great if you learned like copyscript the javascript great um this one comes from i believe miss lily from new york alabama what is the hardest part of coding um so there are many hard parts in uh cutting what is the hardest part well there's like a kind of it's yeah bugs are hard uh mostly if you ask coders there's a thing called usually they would say something like naming things so uh i guess if you uh maybe if you did again game builder you maybe sometimes have to name a thing meaning like um i don't know name a character but this character can be uh the villain but then it can also be the the hero or you know just naming concepts figuring out like what a part of the code does is uh and how to just give it a very descriptive name so a lot of much of much about coding is just um being able to write code that other humans can understand not other not only other not only the machine can understand but also other humans can read what you did and understand so so that part is hard so yeah i totally agree sometimes i look at i'm not a very good coder so i'm just a very beginner coder but sometimes when i look into the people's codes when they're doing a sprint which is a lot of a very long coding project and you look and you see there's it's very overwhelming you see how much code goes into there so i can totally understand why it's important to be descriptive not only for your team but for other people this one comes from miss simmons from pamal i don't even know how to say that uh city so sorry about that from pennsylvania that part i do know um what types of careers do you think are available in coding uh that's a good question so i guess i took one career path which was uh like at the beginning of code monkey i was uh doing most of the coding and then we grew and i like what i do now is mostly manage other developers but i do i do still write some code myself um so that's one career path just being a developer and then maybe manage other developers once you have enough experience there are other career paths so some developers become product managers which are basically the people who decide uh what to code like what should the product look like like what should the game look like what should the dashboard for the teacher look like so they usually need to understand a bit of coding because they work with uh coders um and then like a third one i can think of is um working with data so we have someone in the company uh we learned computer science and is now doing marketing but in this day and age uh like so much of the marketing is done online and it's with data and uh you need to learn you need to know how to code like how to work with that data then they can say like uh people in uruguay are interested in coding maybe you should put an advertisement for them you know or something like uh everyone like challenge 25 in coding adventure is too hard because 50 of uh people who started don't finish it so all these things like in many cases require a little bit of coding to to get the insight out of the data so you're saying you have to understand some data which i know lots of you learn in your daytoday schooling and it plays some plays quite a bit of an importance in the coding side of things right um yeah like data and coding are really like um you can't have one well i guess you can have data without coding but you kind of coding without data everything is about um yeah numbers and text and uh you know things like that i agree and i know that in our company and we talked about this in our other webinar that there are other sides in a company that does coding as well like myself i work with professionals i work with teachers and training them and there's other people who work on the advertisements for code monkey and what you see on the webpage and all the graphics so there's lots of big lots of teams but knowing a little bit of code helps get your foot in the door with all of these coding platforms and we know that digital is where i mean you're interacting with us virtually right now too um so we have mrs miss lomb liam barker excuse me i see somebody said there was their teacher um in skillman new jersey and her question was um what types of careers are available um oh whoops i messed that up they would like to know if you have any advice for third and fourth graders to be successful um so i guess it's it would be um well i would say i would split my advice to two i was uh um you have to work hard like you have to uh you have to study and you have to uh get in the details and you shouldn't be afraid um to fail because when you do coding and when you learn uh things that are hard like math uh it's gonna be hard so uh um so be ready to like uh to study art for that but also um i guess the other part of that is um is find your passion so like i guess i was uh lucky that yeah my passion led me in a good career path but it's that you can you gotta work on something that you're passionate about i agree and i think also what you mentioned earlier about trusting your gut i think is also something important because sometimes we think we're interested in something and sometimes you give it a try and it might not just be the right thing so i think also you said something about being able to handle failure is a big piece of all of that as well um so this next one comes from miss watts in cartersville georgia how can block coding benefit students rather than just doing textbased coding like python or javascript so um block coding is um is helpful is uh it's a very um it's a good entry point for young kids uh to get into the world of logic and uh uh codemonkey started out as a completely textbased um platform we only did games that made you type uh use the keyboard like a real programmer and um it is a very important um aspect of coding uh like no like real world quarters i use like this drag and drop interface and uh the reason is they are limited there are they become a crotch at some point um so it's like it's a barrier that eventually if uh people really want to understand and know how to code you gotta uh get across the drag and drop interfaces into uh textbased coding programming languages but text base is harder than dragon drop and blockly platform so yeah so it's a good entry point um but i recommend uh looking at the text basis like uh the next thing and uh that's the next step i would agree yeah i do think the block base tends to be easier but it also helps you learn exactly what you're saying it's a really great next step for learning how to code because now you've learned all the computational thinking and now you know how things kind of work together so it kind of lays the foundation i think for the next we have this question here what is the difference in our chat what's the difference between javascript and python so javascript and python are two programming language so you could ask i could say what what a programming language is so a programming language is kind of like uh like two programming languages refer like to human languages the first so french and english are two different languages they can both express you can both use you can use either french or english to say something like uh i'm hungry i want to eat a burger but these are you would say differently in french um so two programming languages are yeah they're equal in the way they can do the same thing usually in most cases but they look different and behave differently so python and javascript are different programming language they both can solve like almost entirely the same problems but they do it differently but it's and it's a big but javascript is the only languages language that can run in a browser so if you're thinking of doing a project if you're thinking of starting your own website and putting out this like a small uh game on the website you will have a much harder time doing that on python you should learn javascript but if you have other concerns then look into python that's a good tip why do you think this is from miss c in austin texas actually where i am why is it important do you think for students to learn how to code um so learning how to go first of all it's um as we like talked about people have asked yeah it's a good skill to have as we said like if you're thinking about uh like careerwise but uh even if you don't like i'm thinking of that i think it's it's good to know um some coding because like we're using a program now and we're just like so much of our life is digital and i think it's uh important to just be aware of how these things work and like um just understanding things like uh what's a bug like bugs can be like um they can be like very serious things like in a digital world right they can stop a classroom like a lesson from happening they can stop uh cars from working like bugs are like uh very important so i think it's important people know like how code works and like what does it mean like to have a bug it's important for people like to understand um how the internet works and how their information is uh how their information is used and can be used and what it means for uh their security i think it's important to like just because so much of our world is digital um it should not be people shouldn't uh look at it as like complete magic that is unexplainable because it is explainable like it's all been written by people who went to school and learned how to code and they just wrote it and there are and they're just that they're just people sometimes make mistake and it's important that everyone like kind of understand what is going on in the digital world i agree and cyber security has been the hot button issue for quite some time especially from this coveted pandemic so it's good to hear that you also share that insight of the importance of it i'm going to take one question here from our q a this is a fun one do you think if you hadn't gotten into code monkey that you would have pursued a career in music i thought about it uh before i went to school so uh uh i was actually so i'm from israel and i was in the army as most uh uh israelis who turned 18 go to the army so when i got out at 21 uh i was thinking about a career in music um but i guess it was kind of like what i talked about before about passions so i was enjoying music but i wasn't really passionate enough to make it my living especially in music it's very hard to make a living out of it so now music is just a hobby for me and i'm glad that i'm glad i'm doing what i'm doing right now and uh sounds like you're still very passionate about coding so it's good to it's good to be able to share that um yeah so it's uh it's actually ever in everything you you do for a living uh i think you can find like aspects of it that do excite you so yeah i wasn't always like it wasn't always uh fun working on code marketing there have been hard times and there have been times that i had to do something maybe a little boring or like that but yeah i think it's um i think it's important that you do something like you focus on the area in your work that uh you are passionate about i think that's i think that's important to to keep in mind that you might not always love it 100 all the time but it still gives you that you still know what you're i think it's important to know what your true north is and it sounds like you do know what that is um this question comes from mr oman in uh converse texas oh another texas what qualities or skills do you think is important to obtain in this field and i think you mentioned failure obviously um maybe even the ability to communicate with other people um and maybe even take some feedback do you have anything else that you think are some important features that kids or skills qualities they should have yeah i mean you said it perfectly i think communication is is uh underrated there's like this um i guess this uh false ideal of a programmer that is completely false but like sometimes you would see movies like a programmer just sitting alone at this desk just typing for uh the whole night and just coming up and oh yes i made it i like hacked the mainframe or i uh wrote facebook in a day or something like that but that is so uh out of touch with reality the reality of coding is just being able to communicate with your peers and being respectful of other people's opinion about your work and being able to communicate to your peers about their work and give feedback and get feedback those are the riches of of good programmers not like being able to like uh crunch like just be alone with the computer all day and write code all night that's that's not that's not a good lifestyle it's true you have to have a little bit of variance from that um so in the effort of time we're going to take one more question from our audience that we had here and i think this is probably my most favorite and best question why did you name code monkey code monkey um so as i talked about before about the conversations we had me and jonathan had um i guess i was i kind of like monkeys they're cute my partner see she also really likes monkeys she used to volunteer with monkeys in south america once and uh i guess i was just thinking about monkeys monkeys uh were just in my head and then we thought about uh doing like a game that is like having a character move across the screen and then there there was this term code monkey which is like kind of means a bad thing like uh like a coder that's like not really uh excited about what it what they do um but i thought it would be cute to give like a twist of like no it's just it's a cute little monkey and he's collecting bananas and that's it's a game and i like it's all like um like all the puzzle pieces came together and like it made a lot of sense a lot of sense to just have the character a monkey have the name uh code monkey and just go with that we're happy that we did make code monkey into more of a fun term than what it was originally used for so we just want to round out today by telling all of you and sharing all of your experiences with us today and making sure you had your questions there were so many great questions that all of you asked beforehand thank you so much to ido as well for sharing your story with all of our audience and especially because we know it is pretty late there in israel so we're glad that he was able to join us and spend some time and share your stories and we hope that this sparks some joy for you whether you decide you want to become a computer programmer or you just want to explore owning your own business someday hopefully you had some really great takeaways we want to thank you guys so much again for joining us during the hour of code week the best week in our opinion of the whole year um so we hope you check out us on our hour of code through code.org or on our own webpage and you check out our new space adventure course it's one of our favorite what's better than being in space you know you can can code in space and maybe eventually elon musk will take you to space so you never know where that will take you um so thank you again everybody and thank you so much to our team brett molly and ido of course the shining star of today's webinar um and as always write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time bye everybody
