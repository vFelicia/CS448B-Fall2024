With timestamps:

00:16 - hello everybody and thank you so much
00:18 - for joining it yes we will give a
00:20 - everyone a chance to populate inside of
00:23 - the room and then we will get started so
00:27 - we are looking forward to coding with
00:30 - you all today
01:44 - all right we will give everyone just
01:47 - another minute to go ahead and head into
01:51 - our zoom room here but if you can hear

04:29 - started
04:32 - and I will share those results with you
04:34 - here in just a few minutes
04:38 - okay welcome to a coming welcome to our
04:43 - online webinar session this is a session
04:45 - design for students so we're going to be
04:47 - working with you your students on how to
04:50 - work with our challenge builder and
04:51 - learning some coding concepts along the
04:53 - way
04:53 - so thank you again for joining us you so
04:58 - a couple of things just some reminders I
05:00 - may open this up later for some of you
05:03 - to go ahead and participate with us if
05:05 - you do hear that yourself is if you do
05:07 - see that you are unliked and you're
05:10 - unmuted just please make sure that
05:12 - you're you mute yourself once you're
05:14 - finished talking because everyone can
05:15 - hear you wherever they are and it hears
05:17 - like an echo even though you may not
05:18 - hear it on your end make sure that you
05:21 - have headphones in that's always just a
05:23 - really nice reminder for people around
05:24 - you and then when you are working in
05:27 - that chat box which we will open up here
05:29 - very shortly if you could just make sure
05:32 - that you're using responsible language
05:33 - and questions also if along the way
05:36 - you're kind of getting stuck on
05:37 - something maybe you need a little bit
05:38 - extra help you can just make sure that
05:40 - you know because if you you are specific
05:43 - about the question that you're asking
05:44 - because if I just say hey I need help
05:46 - that could mean anything it can mean
05:47 - anything from I dropped something on the
05:49 - ground I need you to help me or I have
05:51 - something on my screen I'm stuck on so
05:52 - just please make sure you're very
05:54 - specific about your questions that helps
05:56 - us help you and then right here along
05:59 - the bottom we see a couple of things
06:00 - here we see our chat the raise hand and
06:02 - the QA the Q&A box is open for you at
06:05 - any time to ask any questions and the
06:07 - chat box will be kind of locked down and
06:09 - will be opened up so you'll know when we
06:12 - open it so
06:15 - I always like to start off by just
06:18 - introducing Who I am my name is lina
06:19 - saleh i'm the professional development
06:21 - manager here at code monkey i see
06:23 - several familiar names and all on our
06:26 - list here so thank you so much for
06:28 - taking the time to join us as well as
06:29 - there are quite a bit of educators as
06:31 - there are students so thank you I have
06:34 - worked in the education for over a
06:35 - decade well more than that now
06:38 - and so I just really enjoy and miss
06:40 - working with kiddos I'm gonna introduce
06:43 - our other panel members and hand it off
06:47 - thanks Lena my name is Mark Dozier I am
06:51 - a customer success and support associate
06:53 - at code monkey that picture you're
06:55 - looking at is the pre shutdown image of
06:58 - me before it became a caveman but and I
07:02 - am definitely happy to be here with you
07:03 - guys and I look forward to taking some
07:05 - of your questions in the chat box or in
07:07 - the Q&A Thank You Lena awesome yeah
07:11 - thank you
07:11 - and we also you'll see a picture here of
07:14 - Jay he is our curriculum developer so
07:16 - that means he develops all the lesson
07:17 - plans for our teachers and makes it
07:19 - really easy and self-guided for teachers
07:21 - student advocate our courses we also
07:23 - have one more member joining us from our
07:25 - team and that's Brett ethical sin so he
07:27 - is in ahead of all of our sales here at
07:29 - code monkey so he'll also be helping
07:31 - answer your questions as well I already
07:34 - see a question hi I'm new what do i do I
07:35 - just join you're just gonna hang out
07:37 - right now before we get started so you
07:41 - can this is for teachers and students as
07:43 - well obviously if you're over the age of
07:46 - 13 you should only be viewing these
07:49 - social channels here but we you can
07:51 - follow us on Twitter Instagram or
07:53 - Facebook I could Mike es-tu I do
07:54 - encourage you throughout this remote
07:57 - learning and copepod time that you
07:59 - tagged us using the webinar i'm the
08:01 - using the hashtag code monkey webinar
08:03 - and will retweet as much as we can
08:07 - all right so I always like to start off
08:10 - telling the story about code monkey I
08:12 - know many of you have probably heard the
08:13 - story before code monkey was developed
08:15 - with a team of three two brothers and
08:18 - their best friend they started teaching
08:20 - code monkey to students in the very
08:21 - traditional manner like learning like
08:23 - you would in college and they found that
08:25 - when they were working with younger
08:26 - students they just just like you
08:28 - probably didn't really like to learn
08:29 - coding that way so that's how code
08:31 - monkey was born and they developed they
08:34 - found that students really enjoyed
08:36 - coding with a monkey and learning how to
08:39 - code those coding concepts in a much
08:41 - more fun and engaging way so I hope you
08:44 - enjoy it as well all right so the
08:46 - today's objectives that we are going to
08:48 - be doing today is we're gonna work with
08:49 - some we're gonna do a quick unplugged
08:51 - activity so get those keyboards ready
08:53 - I'm gonna open up the chat here in just
08:54 - a couple of minutes and then we're gonna
08:57 - do a little bit of coding vocabulary
08:59 - will keep it pretty short here we'll do
09:00 - a couple of coding challenges just to
09:03 - get you guys familiar and then the rest
09:04 - of our time will be spent building a
09:06 - code monkey challenge as we get started
09:10 - if you get stuck and you're not able to
09:12 - see like if you're viewing on a tablet
09:14 - which can happen that way you can't
09:17 - watch zoom and be on a tablet at the
09:19 - same time so just kind of keep that in
09:21 - mind it's probably better to watch and
09:22 - then go back and do what you learned
09:24 - throughout the lesson today all right so
09:27 - just how patience with yourself and have
09:28 - an understanding that everything might
09:30 - not always go 100% but that's the joy of
09:33 - programming as there's always a time
09:36 - where you can fail forward so you can
09:38 - try again okay all right so our first
09:41 - activity and I'm going to open up this
09:43 - chat box for you here in just a minute
09:46 - and that's how do we make and eat a bowl
09:49 - of cereal so in the chat box I would
09:52 - like for you to place your steps in the
09:54 - chat box so walk me through how you
09:56 - would make and eat a bowl of cereal and
09:59 - then I will choose someone's I will
10:03 - choose some buddies to share with me so
10:05 - give me just one second screen okay so
10:11 - now I'm gonna let you guys take just a
10:13 - few minutes here and you guys go ahead
10:15 - and type in the chat box the chat box is
10:17 - now open for you to share this quick
10:20 - activity so we're gonna have to keep it
10:21 - pretty time crunchy here today so I'm
10:24 - gonna give you guys one minute to go
10:26 - ahead and give me the steps the best
10:28 - that you can
10:29 - typing in the chat box for how we would
10:32 - eat and how we would make an eatable of
10:35 - cereal
10:41 - see in some really great direction so
10:43 - I'm gonna set this timer here in just a
10:47 - minute
11:10 - you
11:17 - seeing some really really really great
11:19 - examples here of how you would make and
11:22 - eat a bowl of cereal
11:27 - you
11:31 - I also see some interesting answers here
11:42 - some of you are quite clever
11:53 - you
12:02 - all right awesome job you guys so I see
12:08 - some really great examples here I see
12:10 - somebody who said toss it up in the air
12:11 - and catch it I don't think that's how we
12:13 - would eat the cereal my guess is it
12:17 - would end up on the floor and your
12:18 - parents would probably be very upset
12:19 - with you um I do see this one get a fine
12:23 - your favorite cereal
12:24 - get a bowl spoon and milk pour the
12:27 - cereal in a bowl and then add the milk
12:30 - and then get your suit and start eating
12:33 - and make sure to clean up after yourself
12:35 - so that's a really great example see
12:37 - another one who says look for a really
12:38 - big bowl ooh I like this one here eat
12:41 - and then repeat the steps until empty
12:43 - drink them they'll wash the bowl and the
12:45 - spoon so all really really great
12:48 - examples you guys are amazing unplugged
12:50 - coders are ready so let's go ahead and
12:53 - let's see what an example of what that
12:55 - might exactly look like here so one
12:59 - example of this is that obviously in
13:02 - this one it says put cereal in a bowl
13:04 - but obviously we need to choose your
13:05 - cereal first before kind of getting
13:07 - started then when you get that you
13:09 - choose a bowl that you like I always
13:11 - have a very favorite cereal bowl that I
13:14 - like to use I don't know about you and
13:16 - my favorite cereal used to be Lucky
13:18 - Charms in which I would always eat the
13:19 - all the Lucky Charms first before I ate
13:22 - the rest of the cereal okay so you spoon
13:24 - you then you also get a spoon which is
13:27 - also not here in our directions but some
13:28 - of you are very specific and that is
13:30 - exactly the more specific the better
13:31 - when we're coding okay first step by
13:34 - step directions then I'm just going to
13:36 - repeat step three some the spoon the
13:38 - cereal and milk into my mouth and I'm
13:40 - going to repeat that until all the
13:41 - cereal and milk is eaten and then I'm
13:44 - going to rinse the bowl and the spoon
13:46 - okay obviously after everything is
13:48 - finished we're not just gonna we're
13:49 - gonna walk it back to the sink rinse it
13:51 - out and your parents will be very
13:52 - thankful that you washed out your bowl
13:54 - and put it in the dishwasher or washed
13:55 - it for your family make it a little bit
13:57 - easier always clean up after yourselves
13:59 - it's a good trait for yourselves later
14:01 - okay so that is an example of an
14:04 - algorithm number one and number two it's
14:07 - also an example of a loop in this case
14:10 - this is if you've ever done block coding
14:12 - which it looks like a lot of
14:13 - are very familiar with block coding that
14:16 - forever loop that you've used before
14:17 - when you keep doing something okay
14:21 - if forever loop is a little bit
14:22 - different but in this case it's a for
14:24 - loop so every single time I'm gonna keep
14:26 - repeating this step until there's no
14:28 - more cereal not going to keep going
14:30 - through the motions if there's no cereal
14:32 - but if I only have three pieces of
14:34 - cereal three little let's say little
14:37 - Cheerios in my milk
14:38 - it'll be easier for me to program that
14:41 - than it is for me to program it with a
14:43 - lot of cereal so that's why we would use
14:45 - a simple loop and we're going to work on
14:46 - using a simple loop today so a simple
14:50 - loop okay is called a times loop or an
14:53 - iteration it means the number of times
14:55 - that you're going to do it an iteration
14:57 - is a repetition of those steps so more
15:00 - so like when we're eating cereal
15:01 - continuously
15:13 - okay I see some people are saying that
15:15 - they're not able to hear me so if you
15:20 - can just raise your hand quickly so we
15:22 - can hear so that I know that you can
15:25 - hear me
15:28 - okay so it seems like quite a bit of you
15:30 - are sometimes it can be connected with
15:31 - zoom I don't know that it's really crazy
15:34 - busy right now with their threshold but
15:35 - if at any time you can't hear me please
15:37 - just make sure that you are indicating
15:42 - that in the chat box it just kind of
15:44 - lets me know because I can hear me but
15:45 - you probably can't hear me so that's
15:47 - always really good to know so thank you
15:48 - so much okay so I'm going to change the
15:51 - chat that you can only chat with us as
15:55 - panelists so just you know that's there
15:57 - okay all right so we have our simple
16:00 - loop and a times loop here so in this
16:02 - case when we talked about a serial
16:04 - that's called an iteration so something
16:07 - who loves this game raise your hand I
16:09 - love this game okay it really helps me
16:11 - sometimes when I've had a bad day to
16:12 - just be knocking those guys down okay
16:15 - but I also find it very fun so that is
16:21 - an iteration now if I only had three of
16:23 - them pop up I would be able to count the
16:25 - amount of steps and give it a times if I
16:27 - would be able to say there's three of
16:29 - them and I would hit one and then what's
16:31 - my next step I would hit the next and
16:32 - the next so there's a difference between
16:34 - a simple loop and an iteration or a for
16:37 - loop where something is happening all
16:39 - the time and I'm able to do it until the
16:40 - condition is met so in this case until
16:42 - all the rats are gone or I can just if I
16:46 - drop three pencils I'm able to easily
16:48 - plan how to pick those up so I can count
16:50 - three times okay so all really great
16:54 - questions I see happening here in the
16:56 - chat box as well we also talked about an
16:58 - algorithm okay so an algorithm is a list
17:01 - of steps that you can follow to finish
17:03 - tasks so just like a plan of action how
17:06 - you're doing it exact like when you're
17:07 - making chocolate chip cookies with your
17:09 - mom or baking or anything like that
17:11 - that's a really good example of a list
17:12 - of steps that you follow I know that I'm
17:15 - really bad at following recipes step by
17:17 - step and so I'll sometimes forget to
17:19 - whip the butter with the sugar
17:21 - beforehand and my cookies don't end up
17:23 - turning out very good so it's always
17:25 - really great to follow your step by step
17:27 - directions to complete a task and that's
17:29 - how the computer works it goes step by
17:31 - step in a very very very very fast right
17:33 - working through as it kind of goes
17:35 - through so that's very important okay so
17:39 - we
17:40 - worked through an unemployed activity
17:42 - together and now our next step is we're
17:45 - actually gonna go to coach monkey now
17:46 - lots of you if you're working on an iPad
17:49 - or some kind of tablet please don't try
17:51 - to do both it just isn't gonna work that
17:54 - well so I know it's probably not as fun
17:55 - but I would like for you to just kind of
17:57 - watch what we're doing and then you can
17:59 - go and try it afterwards okay so and I
18:02 - know that many of you have accounts if
18:04 - you're a teacher you can stay using your
18:05 - account but if you're a student please
18:07 - use the account that we're going to give
18:08 - you because it's going to behave a
18:10 - little bit differently all right so what
18:12 - we're gonna do is we're gonna go to our
18:14 - code monkey website and so a member of
18:18 - my team is gonna pop down in the chat
18:19 - box there how do you get to code monkey
18:21 - and when you do you should see a web
18:24 - page like this so I'm in a browser you
18:26 - may use Safari or Google Chrome or
18:28 - Firefox or whatever it is that you have
18:30 - on there basically how you get to the
18:31 - Internet that's our browser so you're
18:34 - gonna open a new tab or open up your
18:37 - window and see that you can still have
18:39 - it's called toggling so when you have a
18:41 - couple of different screens or a couple
18:44 - of different windows we're looking
18:46 - between the two of those we're going to
18:47 - toggle between the two of those
18:50 - and when you're here if you can in that
18:54 - raise your hand just so I know that
18:56 - you're with me so I'm not moving too
18:58 - fast cause I know sometimes I can see
19:00 - very fast who you guys are on top of it
19:04 - today I really appreciate you guys
19:05 - following along with me it's very
19:06 - helpful okay so now that we're all here
19:09 - we're all gonna get logged in like I
19:11 - said if you're a teacher you guys can go
19:12 - ahead and log in and the rest of you you
19:17 - are going to use this username and the
19:21 - password so what you're going to do is
19:23 - at code monkey comm you're going to
19:25 - click up here on the right hand side and
19:27 - you're going to click login when you do
19:30 - this sign-in slash login box opens press
19:35 - ok login page and right here it says
19:38 - email a username
19:39 - you're gonna type this this here your
19:42 - username is monkey code 1 and your
19:45 - password is 1 2 3 4 5 6 obviously if
19:51 - you're doing this on your own you would
19:52 - not want to have such a simple password
19:54 - because we always have to be leery of
19:56 - hackers but in this case we're going to
19:59 - use this just today for this normally if
20:01 - you're working with my students we would
20:02 - have a much more difficult password than
20:07 - we have here never want to have
20:08 - something that somebody can crack super
20:10 - easy ok you guys are amazing when you
20:13 - are logged in raise your hand so I can
20:15 - we can go over the next steps together
20:22 - you guys are right on it with me okay
20:26 - Hannah remember when we talked about
20:27 - this about how if you have a question or
20:31 - you're stuck with something just make
20:33 - sure you can let us know it that well
20:34 - exactly you're stuck on it's hard for us
20:37 - to know what help means it can mean a
20:40 - lot of things so you have to be very
20:41 - specific with your questions just like
20:43 - if you were asking the teacher very
20:45 - specific questions awesome guys are
20:49 - rocking and rolling okay now I am going
20:52 - to get logged in
20:55 - so now I'm gonna do my username remember
20:59 - my username is monkey code 1 so I'm
21:02 - gonna type it here in the box oops
21:04 - making sure I spell stuff correctly or I
21:06 - won't be able to get in one key code 1
21:08 - and my password is 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 ok if
21:16 - you don't have an account Hanna that's a
21:18 - really good question I can't get into
21:19 - the account because I have an account so
21:22 - you would need to log out of your
21:23 - account and use this username and
21:26 - password or try to go on your own
21:27 - account if it doesn't work then you'll
21:30 - know what ok so now what we're gonna do
21:33 - is we're going to review that simple
21:35 - loop because what we're going to do is
21:36 - we're going to build a simple loop in
21:38 - the challenge builder so we're gonna do
21:40 - two challenges together and then we're
21:42 - gonna spend our time the rest of the
21:43 - time building our challenge ok so if you
21:49 - can scroll down to coding adventure
21:53 - and when you click on coding adventure
21:55 - you click start coding
21:58 - you
22:01 - [Music]
22:06 - so you can just quickly turn all those
22:09 - songs off for me it just makes it a
22:10 - little bit easier okay I'm gonna talk
22:12 - about what you see here and then we're
22:14 - gonna scroll to our challenges so what
22:16 - we see here is our main screen or our
22:20 - code monkey course on the left hand side
22:22 - this is a stage F and on the right hand
22:25 - side is where we would script and write
22:27 - our code so our text editor okay
22:29 - Gordo is our teacher assisting it pops
22:31 - up for directions and when we want
22:33 - anything to work on the screen we're
22:35 - going to click the run however we're not
22:36 - going to do this challenge so what we're
22:38 - gonna do is if you can't see the story
22:41 - map there is a shortcut that I'll show
22:45 - you but this is where you're gonna go so
22:47 - you're gonna click on the story map
22:48 - which is right next to your little
22:50 - avatar here we're gonna click on the
22:52 - story map and each and every single
22:56 - world is a different coding concepts so
22:58 - we're going to scroll through till we
23:02 - get to the third map and the third map
23:04 - at the top says Lew plant okay and on
23:10 - loop land I want us to click on
23:12 - challenge number 22
23:17 - if you don't see the storymap and maybe
23:21 - you're a little bit stuck okay I'm just
23:23 - gonna click off of Gordo for a second
23:25 - what I want you to do is I want you to
23:27 - come up here to the address bar and in
23:32 - the address bar you can change it from
23:34 - we are on challenge zero you can change
23:36 - it to challenge 22 and it's going to
23:39 - take you right here to where you need to
23:41 - be hands up if you are with me so I have
23:46 - an idea
23:48 - oh you guys are fast love my afternoon
23:53 - coders so it was easier to code after a
23:56 - nice lunch right okay can I see that you
24:04 - are there I'm hoping that you're with us
24:07 - on this okay you're not even just send a
24:09 - message to our panelists right okay so
24:11 - here I have Gordo again he's giving me
24:13 - those directions says the number you
24:15 - write before this function here which is
24:19 - the x function or x loop like we've
24:21 - talked about earlier is the number of
24:23 - times the code will repeat so I already
24:26 - have text here so anytime there's text
24:30 - on the screen we always want to debug it
24:32 - which means we want to find out if
24:33 - there's an error in the code so what I'm
24:36 - going to do is I'm going to click run
24:38 - like we did before
24:42 - and we're going to see something it
24:44 - tells us to count the bananas now
24:46 - there's a trick here sometimes people
24:49 - will hover over this last banana and say
24:51 - that there is a number eight so there's
24:54 - only eight bananas
24:55 - however on computers they actually start
24:59 - counting from zero so there's actually
25:01 - not only eight here there are actually
25:05 - nine bananas and we can count this so we
25:08 - have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 so there's 9
25:14 - bananas if we want to measure the
25:16 - distance we can take a ruler and we can
25:19 - pull the ruler out and hit go from the
25:21 - top we click one time on the monkeys
25:23 - head and we drag the ruler and we also
25:26 - see that the ruler not only does that
25:28 - but it also does angled measurements
25:31 - okay so you can see the measurements of
25:33 - the angles happening here so we saw that
25:36 - he was moving correctly he just wasn't
25:38 - moving before this number of times he
25:41 - wasn't moving the correct number of
25:42 - times so we have to change our time slip
25:44 - okay so this is going to say how many
25:48 - times do I want to run this line of code
25:51 - I could write this step 6
25:53 - turn 36 and I could do that 9 times
25:55 - however I don't want to do it 9 times I
25:58 - want to get the shortest way possible
26:03 - Hannah if you already have an account
26:05 - you can just join us on challenge 22 and
26:07 - that will kind of help you as well
26:09 - okay
26:12 - all righty so we saw that we got a three
26:16 - star solution now I research Aleutian
26:19 - amines the shortest code that I could
26:21 - have bring if I had wrote step six
26:24 - 1036 every single time nine times I
26:27 - would have gotten at one star because it
26:28 - wasn't the shortest solution okay so I
26:31 - know you guys are with me on this I'm
26:33 - gonna do one more with you and that's
26:36 - gonna be challenged number 25 and then
26:38 - we're gonna build and create our own
26:39 - challenge so this one is important
26:42 - because we're going to rebuild something
26:44 - very similar to this okay so we're going
26:47 - to take a look here so we're gonna debug
26:51 - our challenge like we've done before and
26:55 - what we see here is that we don't really
26:58 - have a sequence we sort of have here we
27:01 - have two bananas and two bananas then
27:03 - two bananas and two bananas and we take
27:06 - the measurement of the bananas we want
27:07 - to check them we'll see that every
27:09 - single time the distance between each
27:11 - banana is five okay so that's important
27:13 - so we saw the monkey turn left when he
27:17 - got to the banana buddy just kept
27:18 - turning left three times and that's not
27:21 - exactly what we want to have happen okay
27:25 - so we have to see so we have one set 2
27:28 - sets 3 sets and four sets okay so we're
27:33 - gonna change the number to four let's
27:35 - see if that makes a difference
27:37 - oh no he still didn't complete the
27:41 - sequence so when the monkey turns left
27:44 - we saw him facing that one direction now
27:47 - we want him to turn right okay and then
27:53 - remember we measured already the
27:54 - distance between each one so we can do
27:57 - step 5 okay and when we do let's see one
28:04 - now we have completed an algorithm okay
28:08 - and also a time slip so really great
28:13 - alright so
28:15 - now we have learned what a simple loop
28:18 - is now we're gonna go to our challenge
28:20 - builder so it's important that you
28:22 - follow along where we are okay and at
28:25 - the end of this my team will send out a
28:27 - challenge builder guide that will kind
28:29 - of help you guys I don't want to
28:30 - overwhelm you though right now with too
28:31 - much so right here in the code monkey in
28:33 - the left hand side we're going to click
28:35 - on the monkeys head or on the words code
28:38 - monkey that will take us back to our
28:41 - home page now what we're gonna do is
28:45 - we're gonna scroll to the bottom and if
28:47 - you don't if yours isn't at the bottom
28:49 - you're just gonna look for this picture
28:51 - that says challenge builder okay and
28:56 - what it is is it has a person with a
28:59 - banana and it's hand and you see a
29:01 - turtle in a rack so if you see that
29:03 - you're in the right place it will be
29:06 - under the creativity section okay so
29:09 - it's important so we're gonna click here
29:11 - on our challenge builder and I would
29:17 - like for you to click start coding and
29:20 - just to make sure that everyone is here
29:23 - I would like for you to raise your hand
29:25 - so that I know that everybody is with me
29:27 - and if you're not and you're not able to
29:28 - get in just please be patient and just
29:30 - kind of watch and learn from us and then
29:33 - you can try on your own later we'll make
29:34 - this recording available for you and
29:36 - your families alright
29:40 - and there are some people speaking
29:42 - Spanish unfortunately I don't speak
29:44 - Spanish so I'm not able to respond back
29:46 - to you and I don't have time to Google
29:48 - Translate right now or else I would love
29:50 - to do that okay alrighty so you guys are
29:55 - amazing and you guys are doing some
29:57 - really great work so remember you can
30:00 - always use that Q&A box as well if you
30:02 - have any questions so I'm glad everyone
30:05 - is with us okay and we'll kind of go
30:09 - through there alright so here we go so
30:14 - we noticed something automatically
30:16 - different gordo doesn't have any
30:18 - directions he hasn't said anything and
30:21 - the way that we would want to do that is
30:23 - we don't want to give the directions yet
30:24 - because we don't even know what we're
30:25 - doing okay so what we're going to
30:29 - celina we may ask you some questions
30:33 - here in a little bit
30:33 - so here's Gordo just like normal okay
30:36 - and we're gonna click on the okay and
30:38 - I'm just gonna talk about some
30:40 - functionalities here of the page so it's
30:43 - blink like it's not like the other ones
30:46 - that we've seen because we're gonna be
30:47 - building and creating our own challenge
30:49 - okay
30:50 - the roller is still here it still
30:52 - behaves the same the monkey is here the
30:55 - bananas here okay there's different
30:57 - backgrounds and this is why you're
30:59 - logged in like us today okay
31:01 - we're only going to use backgrounds that
31:03 - we've know so we only saw grass today so
31:05 - we're only going to use the grass okay
31:07 - then look we we click the plus sign
31:09 - there are different objects that we can
31:11 - add to the screen today we don't need to
31:13 - use any of those because we're just
31:14 - using the bananas and as these on your
31:17 - side of the student as you work through
31:19 - the challenges these little guys will
31:20 - unlock once you've been introduced to it
31:23 - okay and then the objects are open but
31:27 - you don't know anything about the
31:28 - objects yet so we won't use anything
31:30 - that we don't know
31:31 - so we don't have to do anything the next
31:35 - thing I want us to do is when you hover
31:37 - over these buttons here you'll see a
31:38 - little minus sign so we're gonna get rid
31:40 - of the minus I'm gonna get rid of the
31:43 - blocks and all we're gonna leave is the
31:46 - step okay button so raise your hand if
31:51 - you're with me and the only button that
31:53 - you see on your screen is the step
31:56 - great great great
32:04 - okay there's a rocking and rolling all
32:07 - right so now that we see that we're
32:08 - gonna click on this plus sign here and
32:10 - we're gonna use the buttons that we we
32:12 - know we've used before so we're gonna
32:16 - get the turn because we use turn we're
32:19 - gonna click it and it will go on to the
32:20 - bottom and then we're gonna find the
32:22 - time slip you'll see it's like a little
32:23 - almost like a recycle sign sort of okay
32:27 - and we're gonna click on that and we're
32:29 - gonna have it add it to the bottom and
32:31 - now we see step turn and the times look
32:34 - hey all very important
32:37 - all right great now this is my favorite
32:41 - part of the platform and hopefully maybe
32:43 - yours as well okay so what I'm gonna do
32:45 - now is I'm going to show you this
32:48 - configuration is the behind the scenes
32:50 - things that you don't normally see on
32:52 - the program itself okay so every step is
32:55 - about 20 pixels so these this XY runs in
33:00 - pixels like computers ok so there's an
33:03 - XY coordinate right the monkey normally
33:07 - on an XY coordinate you would see a zero
33:10 - be somewhere in the middle okay but on
33:13 - computers and in the computer program
33:14 - it's actually up here at zero zero okay
33:19 - zero zero is in the upper left hand side
33:20 - of our screen so we're gonna put our
33:23 - monkey down here so truck so put your
33:26 - monkey down here in the right hand
33:28 - corner okay and we could see where the
33:31 - monkey is we can see if we move him
33:33 - around we can see his rotation I'm just
33:35 - gonna have him facing forward right now
33:37 - on the screen on our bird's-eye view
33:40 - okay now we see our banana right now we
33:43 - only have one banana on the screen and
33:45 - we can see that we're moving it I want
33:47 - you to add three bananas well let's do
33:52 - four
33:55 - you
33:58 - all right now a trick here something to
34:03 - notice is that you want your the for
34:06 - banana so you want two of them to be on
34:08 - the same same Y court same y-coordinate
34:13 - okay and then you want them to be on the
34:16 - same and then we'll change the
34:18 - x-coordinate okay so here we have these
34:21 - two bananas so I can click on this
34:22 - banana I can move it and we can see that
34:23 - it's Y is at 3:43 so that means that I
34:27 - want this other one to also be at 3:43
34:34 - you can also use the ruler
34:37 - okay to move it so just kind of keep
34:40 - that in mind as you're going through
34:44 - you
34:46 - okay that's fine Jackson if you can't
34:48 - find the turn no big deal if you see the
34:50 - left and the right that's perfectly fine
34:51 - nothing wrong with that we're gonna
34:52 - program it anyway so it won't be that
34:55 - big video just to help you if you get
34:57 - tricked up with spelling okay it's a
34:59 - great question all right so now we have
35:01 - those two and we know that there we know
35:04 - that they're on the right plane let's do
35:05 - the same thing let's check our other
35:07 - ones and let's make sure they're in the
35:09 - same place so I'm just gonna move mine
35:10 - action away a little bit extra banana
35:13 - there okay so now I'm gonna move this
35:15 - and I'm gonna put this one at y2 11 okay
35:20 - yours doesn't have to be exactly but
35:24 - it's tricky okay all right
35:27 - so that kinds of kind of gives us a
35:30 - little bit of idea if they're on the
35:31 - right plane or the right coordinate
35:34 - where we want them to go so think about
35:36 - it like the right line are they on the
35:37 - right line and are they even with each
35:39 - other okay I'm gonna get my ruler and
35:41 - I'm going to measure the distance first
35:43 - so we see that this one is nine and that
35:46 - this is six and the distance from this
35:49 - banana this one should be the same as
35:51 - the first one but it's not so we're
35:55 - gonna have to adjust it to make sure
35:59 - that that's the case we have this as
36:01 - being nine okay and then we can have
36:05 - this one as being six nothing wrong with
36:07 - that but we want this one to also be
36:10 - nine so that means that I need to move
36:12 - this one a little bit
36:16 - then it was before and I pick up the
36:19 - ruler and I'm so close so close okay and
36:24 - I measure
36:27 - and now you can see that it's night okay
36:29 - so we have six and nine okay so you can
36:36 - also see that I don't have it on the
36:38 - right right spot so I'm just gonna move
36:43 - it so it's even okay so now they're even
36:45 - with each other give me a hand in the
36:47 - air if you're with me you have four
36:49 - bananas and your bananas two of them arm
36:53 - the same y-coordinate and the other two
36:55 - are on the same y-coordinate as well and
36:59 - that just makes it a little bit even
37:02 - awesome you guys are doing great and I
37:05 - know my team is helping to answer those
37:07 - questions that you have any okay
37:09 - now we have that okay we have our back
37:11 - our back is done so we don't have to do
37:13 - anything here so you guys ready to the
37:15 - next step
37:16 - right now we have to go and code it so
37:21 - we have this year and our first step is
37:24 - we want our monkey to be able to step 6
37:30 - like here so we can repeat this so we
37:32 - need to measure our monkey and move him
37:36 - 6 so that means I'm going to need to
37:38 - move him a little bit up here
37:43 - and so close
37:49 - you can see how sometimes when you're
37:51 - coding and coding adventure how
37:52 - sometimes it can seem like oh I use six
37:54 - one time and I use seven that time
37:56 - because it's really easy okay to be a
38:01 - little bit off by what just something
38:04 - normal okay so now we have that so you
38:06 - guys did awesome we have it kind of so
38:09 - now we're gonna coat it so how many
38:10 - times do we want to repeat this action
38:12 - so we know he's gonna go up and when he
38:15 - goes to the first banana he's gonna turn
38:16 - left when he gets here another banana
38:19 - he's going to turn right okay
38:25 - you
38:32 - okay so i seee the person was asking
38:35 - about spinach i'm gonna if you want to
38:37 - resend your message there is a person in
38:39 - this chat that can kind of help us a
38:41 - guide just like I said I'm not a Spanish
38:43 - speaker I wish I were but not not that
38:46 - cool alright so now we're gonna kotas
38:48 - and I'm gonna get my times loop and I'm
38:50 - gonna click on it once because I don't
38:51 - remember what the function was do I want
38:53 - to do it three times or do I want to do
38:55 - it two times we can try it with three
38:57 - times or I know that I have a collection
38:59 - of two steps so I'm gonna do - okay and
39:03 - then what's the first thing that we did
39:05 - we have to make sure that it's inside
39:06 - the loop so this is nested loop that's
39:09 - why we don't have it this way because I
39:10 - think Peter won't realize that so the
39:13 - first step that we did is we said step
39:14 - six
39:15 - okay and then when we get to this banana
39:18 - what do we want to do we wanted to turn
39:20 - left okay and then step can't remember
39:25 - so I need to measure the distance it was
39:28 - nine okay so we're going to step nine
39:33 - 9 and then we're going to turn right and
39:39 - now we're going to test it so it may not
39:41 - work on the first time but that's the
39:43 - joy about coding right we're always
39:44 - failing and we're always doing better
39:46 - than we did the previous time oh so
39:50 - close okay step we got this first one
39:55 - okay so we step six he turns left and
39:58 - then he stepped nine and then six and
40:03 - then nine so now I'm going to look at my
40:05 - configuration and just see if there's
40:07 - something that maybe is a little bit off
40:10 - here
40:12 - you
40:16 - okay and then I'm going to rerun the
40:19 - code just because I wasn't paying that
40:21 - close of attention okay so I probably
40:27 - have an error Beach between the
40:29 - measurement of this banana and that
40:31 - banana just fine so I could change it to
40:35 - seven just in case and let's see if that
40:38 - makes a difference
40:42 - okay so sometimes so you can see it can
40:44 - be a difference of just one number in
40:46 - one direction or the other
40:47 - Gordo doesn't have anything here so we
40:50 - need to say something like whoa I don't
40:53 - know something well here like whoa oops
40:56 - and make sure your spelling and we're
40:58 - using correct capitalization and
41:00 - punctuation
41:00 - okay so woah you coded a simple loop
41:09 - great work because what's going to
41:11 - happen is that other people can actually
41:13 - see this and I click close now I'm not
41:16 - finished okay I need to also name my
41:19 - challenge so when we're naming our
41:20 - challenge we never use last names ever
41:22 - okay we can use a first name but it's
41:25 - always better to have a nickname but
41:27 - when you do a nickname it must be
41:28 - inappropriate okay so I'm just gonna do
41:31 - this here I'm gonna do - monkey demo
41:34 - because I'm just settling for you and
41:37 - when I'm finished I'm gonna click the
41:39 - checkmark so I know that it's saved and
41:41 - I am finished with this challenge so
41:44 - I'll go over here to the right hand side
41:45 - I'm going to click save so that I know
41:46 - it's saved okay and then I'll click
41:50 - continue editing
41:52 - and then I'll walk you through that just
41:56 - one more time so if you can just stay
41:58 - with me here and then what you'll do is
42:00 - you can share it to your classroom or
42:03 - you can share it to our discover feature
42:05 - and that means that everyone from all
42:07 - across the world so some of you that are
42:08 - speaking Spanish you guys can share
42:10 - yours and Spanish or the language of
42:12 - your choice and you're able to share
42:14 - that worldwide with each other and
42:15 - you're able to remix each other's
42:17 - challenges and kind of work from there
42:19 - okay you can also do a link and when you
42:22 - do this link that means that you can
42:23 - share it anywhere okay like if you want
42:26 - to share with your family and say hey
42:27 - look at this really cool challenge that
42:29 - I just did today all right or you can
42:31 - even put it in a webpage or anything
42:34 - so let's do that again so we will name
42:37 - our challenge remember no personal names
42:39 - no nothing there just like a nickname
42:41 - you can use a first name just and we
42:43 - never use last names for privacy issues
42:45 - okay we click Save
42:48 - always saving our work and then I click
42:52 - continue winning and I can share it into
42:54 - my classroom if I would like and that
42:55 - would mean that other people can play it
42:56 - or I can just keep it private right now
42:58 - because I haven't really done much on my
42:59 - side of that or I can publish it
43:02 - worldwide now my team is going to send a
43:07 - challenge builder guide to you and
43:10 - that's just going to be something that's
43:11 - going to help you navigate building that
43:13 - so remember I use the configuration so
43:16 - the x and y-coordinates I looked at the
43:18 - different rotations that I had here you
43:20 - see the monkey was at a certain rotation
43:21 - there it wasn't rotated at zero okay and
43:25 - I made sure I had the same Y coordinates
43:27 - and it's easy to look between them to
43:30 - see the x coordinates as well it's a
43:32 - difference of 20 between each one each
43:34 - pixel okay so we build and we created
43:38 - the last thing that we didn't do though
43:39 - is we didn't give Gordo a message so
43:42 - here I would say you will need to use a
43:51 - simple number correct capitalization of
43:58 - tuition to solve this challenge I'm just
44:07 - gonna say don't give up try again okay
44:12 - so we always want to give some
44:14 - encouraging more words than making sure
44:15 - that that's where you're using digital
44:16 - digital citizenship you're always acting
44:19 - they're always using the right words and
44:22 - appropriate words when communicating
44:25 - worldwide with other people or they can
44:27 - see it alright so we are finished
44:32 - working through a challenge we talked
44:34 - about a simple loop okay if you get
44:37 - stuck you always want to ask a teacher a
44:41 - review basically any other challenges
44:43 - that you've worked through
44:45 - there's also super hints that the
44:47 - teachers will turn on so you can use
44:49 - super hints when you're stuck on the
44:50 - coding adventure courses themselves okay
44:53 - and now I'm gonna leave some time for
44:55 - questions because it's pretty quiet so
44:58 - if you have any questions it's open to
45:00 - all panelists and participants right now
45:02 - we can also pop it in the Q&A box while
45:05 - we're doing why you guys are thinking of
45:07 - questions I'm gonna share your results
45:08 - from earlier so hopefully you guys can
45:10 - see this how familiar are you with are
45:14 - you as with code monkey that's supposed
45:18 - to be how familiar are you coding as
45:19 - with code monkey you're a decent coder
45:21 - Facebook could hire you some of most of
45:23 - you are beginners are still learning
45:25 - which is exactly what you what you
45:27 - should be have you use code monkey
45:28 - before a lot of you have used it do you
45:31 - love to code and create
45:32 - yes so that's exactly what we would want
45:34 - for you to do and then the majority
45:36 - there's a couple people that are in
45:38 - third grade and there's one person in
45:40 - fifth grade sixth grade seventh grade
45:41 - and beyond and then we also have
45:43 - educator or might not even be one of
45:46 - those so I don't see any questions
45:50 - coming in so that's great or it could or
45:55 - could not be great so the challenge
45:57 - builder guide is there just make sure
45:59 - that you click on that if you have any
46:01 - questions or you're wanting to use a
46:03 - challenge builder I'm gonna leave this
46:04 - open for this afternoon so you can go
46:07 - ahead and keep working on your
46:08 - challenges and all of that kind of stuff
46:10 - is it okay to teach code monkey
46:12 - - we have our beaver achiever courses
46:14 - that are really great for starting with
46:16 - both first and second grade I would
46:18 - recommend starting there first before
46:19 - doing the text based coding just because
46:23 - the text-based coding can get a little
46:25 - bit tricky beyond challenge 30 they can
46:28 - definitely do the first 30 challenges
46:29 - but beyond challenge 30 they start in
46:31 - variables I'm challenge 31 so sometimes
46:35 - that can be a tough concept for anyone
46:37 - to understand but most importantly for
46:39 - those younger guys but that's a great
46:41 - question okay I'm gonna keep moving here
46:46 - we will be doing some more webinars and
46:47 - things next week both for teachers and
46:50 - for students but if you missed anything
46:51 - they'll be up here there's a great game
46:53 - builder webinar that we did last week
46:55 - and some different things that we did
46:57 - with beaver achiever and things like
47:01 - that okay
47:04 - and remember that you can always contact
47:07 - us at info at code monkey comm or you
47:11 - can reach out to us on any of our social
47:13 - channels Facebook Instagram Twitter any
47:17 - of that kind of thing so remember to
47:18 - follow us and like us the guide is not
47:22 - hyperlinked I think you'll have to copy
47:25 - and paste it Brett would you be able to
47:27 - share that with them that link that I
47:29 - shared with you that is a hyperlink
47:32 - document and then remember while you
47:37 - were working with us today that we wrote
47:40 - some code we caught some bananas and we
47:44 - saved the world I'll send a follow-up
47:46 - email to our users with the challenge
47:48 - builder guide or you can just reach out
47:49 - to me at info at code monkey comm so I
47:52 - see some people are saying they're not
47:53 - able to get it so we'll send the
47:55 - follow-up email or we'll post it on our
47:57 - web page as well for you guys to use so
48:00 - thank you so much for spending your
48:01 - afternoon with us you guys were amazing
48:03 - coders and you did some amazing work
48:05 - today
48:05 - and remember to always have patience
48:07 - with yourself and that coding is never a
48:09 - hundred percent on the first try
48:11 - so thank you for writing code with us
48:13 - catching bananas and saving the world
48:15 - you guys have a wonderful day bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and thank you so much for joining it yes we will give a everyone a chance to populate inside of the room and then we will get started so we are looking forward to coding with you all today all right we will give everyone just another minute to go ahead and head into our zoom room here but if you can hear me if you can go ahead and raise your hand that will let me know that you are with me awesome as a rock star just another minute and we will get started I am going to launch a poll right now for you to take so you can just take a minute why you guys are waiting to take this poll raise your hand if you are able to see the pole just so I know that you're able to see it I don't see anyone taking it ok great you just take a couple of seconds here to go ahead and fill out this poll and then we're gonna get started awesome because our rock stars you you okay those of you are joining us so if you can go ahead and fill out this poll really quickly there's still about three of you that have not voted and panelists you're also welcome to vote as well you okay see some more people are still joining us.we if you just joined us if you see the pool you're welcome to go ahead and hop on that pole otherwise I'm going to end that we're going to get started and I will share those results with you here in just a few minutes okay welcome to a coming welcome to our online webinar session this is a session design for students so we're going to be working with you your students on how to work with our challenge builder and learning some coding concepts along the way so thank you again for joining us you so a couple of things just some reminders I may open this up later for some of you to go ahead and participate with us if you do hear that yourself is if you do see that you are unliked and you're unmuted just please make sure that you're you mute yourself once you're finished talking because everyone can hear you wherever they are and it hears like an echo even though you may not hear it on your end make sure that you have headphones in that's always just a really nice reminder for people around you and then when you are working in that chat box which we will open up here very shortly if you could just make sure that you're using responsible language and questions also if along the way you're kind of getting stuck on something maybe you need a little bit extra help you can just make sure that you know because if you you are specific about the question that you're asking because if I just say hey I need help that could mean anything it can mean anything from I dropped something on the ground I need you to help me or I have something on my screen I'm stuck on so just please make sure you're very specific about your questions that helps us help you and then right here along the bottom we see a couple of things here we see our chat the raise hand and the QA the Q&A box is open for you at any time to ask any questions and the chat box will be kind of locked down and will be opened up so you'll know when we open it so I always like to start off by just introducing Who I am my name is lina saleh i'm the professional development manager here at code monkey i see several familiar names and all on our list here so thank you so much for taking the time to join us as well as there are quite a bit of educators as there are students so thank you I have worked in the education for over a decade well more than that now and so I just really enjoy and miss working with kiddos I'm gonna introduce our other panel members and hand it off thanks Lena my name is Mark Dozier I am a customer success and support associate at code monkey that picture you're looking at is the pre shutdown image of me before it became a caveman but and I am definitely happy to be here with you guys and I look forward to taking some of your questions in the chat box or in the Q&A Thank You Lena awesome yeah thank you and we also you'll see a picture here of Jay he is our curriculum developer so that means he develops all the lesson plans for our teachers and makes it really easy and selfguided for teachers student advocate our courses we also have one more member joining us from our team and that's Brett ethical sin so he is in ahead of all of our sales here at code monkey so he'll also be helping answer your questions as well I already see a question hi I'm new what do i do I just join you're just gonna hang out right now before we get started so you can this is for teachers and students as well obviously if you're over the age of 13 you should only be viewing these social channels here but we you can follow us on Twitter Instagram or Facebook I could Mike estu I do encourage you throughout this remote learning and copepod time that you tagged us using the webinar i'm the using the hashtag code monkey webinar and will retweet as much as we can all right so I always like to start off telling the story about code monkey I know many of you have probably heard the story before code monkey was developed with a team of three two brothers and their best friend they started teaching code monkey to students in the very traditional manner like learning like you would in college and they found that when they were working with younger students they just just like you probably didn't really like to learn coding that way so that's how code monkey was born and they developed they found that students really enjoyed coding with a monkey and learning how to code those coding concepts in a much more fun and engaging way so I hope you enjoy it as well all right so the today's objectives that we are going to be doing today is we're gonna work with some we're gonna do a quick unplugged activity so get those keyboards ready I'm gonna open up the chat here in just a couple of minutes and then we're gonna do a little bit of coding vocabulary will keep it pretty short here we'll do a couple of coding challenges just to get you guys familiar and then the rest of our time will be spent building a code monkey challenge as we get started if you get stuck and you're not able to see like if you're viewing on a tablet which can happen that way you can't watch zoom and be on a tablet at the same time so just kind of keep that in mind it's probably better to watch and then go back and do what you learned throughout the lesson today all right so just how patience with yourself and have an understanding that everything might not always go 100% but that's the joy of programming as there's always a time where you can fail forward so you can try again okay all right so our first activity and I'm going to open up this chat box for you here in just a minute and that's how do we make and eat a bowl of cereal so in the chat box I would like for you to place your steps in the chat box so walk me through how you would make and eat a bowl of cereal and then I will choose someone's I will choose some buddies to share with me so give me just one second screen okay so now I'm gonna let you guys take just a few minutes here and you guys go ahead and type in the chat box the chat box is now open for you to share this quick activity so we're gonna have to keep it pretty time crunchy here today so I'm gonna give you guys one minute to go ahead and give me the steps the best that you can typing in the chat box for how we would eat and how we would make an eatable of cereal see in some really great direction so I'm gonna set this timer here in just a minute you seeing some really really really great examples here of how you would make and eat a bowl of cereal you I also see some interesting answers here some of you are quite clever you all right awesome job you guys so I see some really great examples here I see somebody who said toss it up in the air and catch it I don't think that's how we would eat the cereal my guess is it would end up on the floor and your parents would probably be very upset with you um I do see this one get a fine your favorite cereal get a bowl spoon and milk pour the cereal in a bowl and then add the milk and then get your suit and start eating and make sure to clean up after yourself so that's a really great example see another one who says look for a really big bowl ooh I like this one here eat and then repeat the steps until empty drink them they'll wash the bowl and the spoon so all really really great examples you guys are amazing unplugged coders are ready so let's go ahead and let's see what an example of what that might exactly look like here so one example of this is that obviously in this one it says put cereal in a bowl but obviously we need to choose your cereal first before kind of getting started then when you get that you choose a bowl that you like I always have a very favorite cereal bowl that I like to use I don't know about you and my favorite cereal used to be Lucky Charms in which I would always eat the all the Lucky Charms first before I ate the rest of the cereal okay so you spoon you then you also get a spoon which is also not here in our directions but some of you are very specific and that is exactly the more specific the better when we're coding okay first step by step directions then I'm just going to repeat step three some the spoon the cereal and milk into my mouth and I'm going to repeat that until all the cereal and milk is eaten and then I'm going to rinse the bowl and the spoon okay obviously after everything is finished we're not just gonna we're gonna walk it back to the sink rinse it out and your parents will be very thankful that you washed out your bowl and put it in the dishwasher or washed it for your family make it a little bit easier always clean up after yourselves it's a good trait for yourselves later okay so that is an example of an algorithm number one and number two it's also an example of a loop in this case this is if you've ever done block coding which it looks like a lot of are very familiar with block coding that forever loop that you've used before when you keep doing something okay if forever loop is a little bit different but in this case it's a for loop so every single time I'm gonna keep repeating this step until there's no more cereal not going to keep going through the motions if there's no cereal but if I only have three pieces of cereal three little let's say little Cheerios in my milk it'll be easier for me to program that than it is for me to program it with a lot of cereal so that's why we would use a simple loop and we're going to work on using a simple loop today so a simple loop okay is called a times loop or an iteration it means the number of times that you're going to do it an iteration is a repetition of those steps so more so like when we're eating cereal continuously okay I see some people are saying that they're not able to hear me so if you can just raise your hand quickly so we can hear so that I know that you can hear me okay so it seems like quite a bit of you are sometimes it can be connected with zoom I don't know that it's really crazy busy right now with their threshold but if at any time you can't hear me please just make sure that you are indicating that in the chat box it just kind of lets me know because I can hear me but you probably can't hear me so that's always really good to know so thank you so much okay so I'm going to change the chat that you can only chat with us as panelists so just you know that's there okay all right so we have our simple loop and a times loop here so in this case when we talked about a serial that's called an iteration so something who loves this game raise your hand I love this game okay it really helps me sometimes when I've had a bad day to just be knocking those guys down okay but I also find it very fun so that is an iteration now if I only had three of them pop up I would be able to count the amount of steps and give it a times if I would be able to say there's three of them and I would hit one and then what's my next step I would hit the next and the next so there's a difference between a simple loop and an iteration or a for loop where something is happening all the time and I'm able to do it until the condition is met so in this case until all the rats are gone or I can just if I drop three pencils I'm able to easily plan how to pick those up so I can count three times okay so all really great questions I see happening here in the chat box as well we also talked about an algorithm okay so an algorithm is a list of steps that you can follow to finish tasks so just like a plan of action how you're doing it exact like when you're making chocolate chip cookies with your mom or baking or anything like that that's a really good example of a list of steps that you follow I know that I'm really bad at following recipes step by step and so I'll sometimes forget to whip the butter with the sugar beforehand and my cookies don't end up turning out very good so it's always really great to follow your step by step directions to complete a task and that's how the computer works it goes step by step in a very very very very fast right working through as it kind of goes through so that's very important okay so we worked through an unemployed activity together and now our next step is we're actually gonna go to coach monkey now lots of you if you're working on an iPad or some kind of tablet please don't try to do both it just isn't gonna work that well so I know it's probably not as fun but I would like for you to just kind of watch what we're doing and then you can go and try it afterwards okay so and I know that many of you have accounts if you're a teacher you can stay using your account but if you're a student please use the account that we're going to give you because it's going to behave a little bit differently all right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to our code monkey website and so a member of my team is gonna pop down in the chat box there how do you get to code monkey and when you do you should see a web page like this so I'm in a browser you may use Safari or Google Chrome or Firefox or whatever it is that you have on there basically how you get to the Internet that's our browser so you're gonna open a new tab or open up your window and see that you can still have it's called toggling so when you have a couple of different screens or a couple of different windows we're looking between the two of those we're going to toggle between the two of those and when you're here if you can in that raise your hand just so I know that you're with me so I'm not moving too fast cause I know sometimes I can see very fast who you guys are on top of it today I really appreciate you guys following along with me it's very helpful okay so now that we're all here we're all gonna get logged in like I said if you're a teacher you guys can go ahead and log in and the rest of you you are going to use this username and the password so what you're going to do is at code monkey comm you're going to click up here on the right hand side and you're going to click login when you do this signin slash login box opens press ok login page and right here it says email a username you're gonna type this this here your username is monkey code 1 and your password is 1 2 3 4 5 6 obviously if you're doing this on your own you would not want to have such a simple password because we always have to be leery of hackers but in this case we're going to use this just today for this normally if you're working with my students we would have a much more difficult password than we have here never want to have something that somebody can crack super easy ok you guys are amazing when you are logged in raise your hand so I can we can go over the next steps together you guys are right on it with me okay Hannah remember when we talked about this about how if you have a question or you're stuck with something just make sure you can let us know it that well exactly you're stuck on it's hard for us to know what help means it can mean a lot of things so you have to be very specific with your questions just like if you were asking the teacher very specific questions awesome guys are rocking and rolling okay now I am going to get logged in so now I'm gonna do my username remember my username is monkey code 1 so I'm gonna type it here in the box oops making sure I spell stuff correctly or I won't be able to get in one key code 1 and my password is 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 ok if you don't have an account Hanna that's a really good question I can't get into the account because I have an account so you would need to log out of your account and use this username and password or try to go on your own account if it doesn't work then you'll know what ok so now what we're gonna do is we're going to review that simple loop because what we're going to do is we're going to build a simple loop in the challenge builder so we're gonna do two challenges together and then we're gonna spend our time the rest of the time building our challenge ok so if you can scroll down to coding adventure and when you click on coding adventure you click start coding you so you can just quickly turn all those songs off for me it just makes it a little bit easier okay I'm gonna talk about what you see here and then we're gonna scroll to our challenges so what we see here is our main screen or our code monkey course on the left hand side this is a stage F and on the right hand side is where we would script and write our code so our text editor okay Gordo is our teacher assisting it pops up for directions and when we want anything to work on the screen we're going to click the run however we're not going to do this challenge so what we're gonna do is if you can't see the story map there is a shortcut that I'll show you but this is where you're gonna go so you're gonna click on the story map which is right next to your little avatar here we're gonna click on the story map and each and every single world is a different coding concepts so we're going to scroll through till we get to the third map and the third map at the top says Lew plant okay and on loop land I want us to click on challenge number 22 if you don't see the storymap and maybe you're a little bit stuck okay I'm just gonna click off of Gordo for a second what I want you to do is I want you to come up here to the address bar and in the address bar you can change it from we are on challenge zero you can change it to challenge 22 and it's going to take you right here to where you need to be hands up if you are with me so I have an idea oh you guys are fast love my afternoon coders so it was easier to code after a nice lunch right okay can I see that you are there I'm hoping that you're with us on this okay you're not even just send a message to our panelists right okay so here I have Gordo again he's giving me those directions says the number you write before this function here which is the x function or x loop like we've talked about earlier is the number of times the code will repeat so I already have text here so anytime there's text on the screen we always want to debug it which means we want to find out if there's an error in the code so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click run like we did before and we're going to see something it tells us to count the bananas now there's a trick here sometimes people will hover over this last banana and say that there is a number eight so there's only eight bananas however on computers they actually start counting from zero so there's actually not only eight here there are actually nine bananas and we can count this so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 so there's 9 bananas if we want to measure the distance we can take a ruler and we can pull the ruler out and hit go from the top we click one time on the monkeys head and we drag the ruler and we also see that the ruler not only does that but it also does angled measurements okay so you can see the measurements of the angles happening here so we saw that he was moving correctly he just wasn't moving before this number of times he wasn't moving the correct number of times so we have to change our time slip okay so this is going to say how many times do I want to run this line of code I could write this step 6 turn 36 and I could do that 9 times however I don't want to do it 9 times I want to get the shortest way possible Hannah if you already have an account you can just join us on challenge 22 and that will kind of help you as well okay all righty so we saw that we got a three star solution now I research Aleutian amines the shortest code that I could have bring if I had wrote step six 1036 every single time nine times I would have gotten at one star because it wasn't the shortest solution okay so I know you guys are with me on this I'm gonna do one more with you and that's gonna be challenged number 25 and then we're gonna build and create our own challenge so this one is important because we're going to rebuild something very similar to this okay so we're going to take a look here so we're gonna debug our challenge like we've done before and what we see here is that we don't really have a sequence we sort of have here we have two bananas and two bananas then two bananas and two bananas and we take the measurement of the bananas we want to check them we'll see that every single time the distance between each banana is five okay so that's important so we saw the monkey turn left when he got to the banana buddy just kept turning left three times and that's not exactly what we want to have happen okay so we have to see so we have one set 2 sets 3 sets and four sets okay so we're gonna change the number to four let's see if that makes a difference oh no he still didn't complete the sequence so when the monkey turns left we saw him facing that one direction now we want him to turn right okay and then remember we measured already the distance between each one so we can do step 5 okay and when we do let's see one now we have completed an algorithm okay and also a time slip so really great alright so now we have learned what a simple loop is now we're gonna go to our challenge builder so it's important that you follow along where we are okay and at the end of this my team will send out a challenge builder guide that will kind of help you guys I don't want to overwhelm you though right now with too much so right here in the code monkey in the left hand side we're going to click on the monkeys head or on the words code monkey that will take us back to our home page now what we're gonna do is we're gonna scroll to the bottom and if you don't if yours isn't at the bottom you're just gonna look for this picture that says challenge builder okay and what it is is it has a person with a banana and it's hand and you see a turtle in a rack so if you see that you're in the right place it will be under the creativity section okay so it's important so we're gonna click here on our challenge builder and I would like for you to click start coding and just to make sure that everyone is here I would like for you to raise your hand so that I know that everybody is with me and if you're not and you're not able to get in just please be patient and just kind of watch and learn from us and then you can try on your own later we'll make this recording available for you and your families alright and there are some people speaking Spanish unfortunately I don't speak Spanish so I'm not able to respond back to you and I don't have time to Google Translate right now or else I would love to do that okay alrighty so you guys are amazing and you guys are doing some really great work so remember you can always use that Q&A box as well if you have any questions so I'm glad everyone is with us okay and we'll kind of go through there alright so here we go so we noticed something automatically different gordo doesn't have any directions he hasn't said anything and the way that we would want to do that is we don't want to give the directions yet because we don't even know what we're doing okay so what we're going to celina we may ask you some questions here in a little bit so here's Gordo just like normal okay and we're gonna click on the okay and I'm just gonna talk about some functionalities here of the page so it's blink like it's not like the other ones that we've seen because we're gonna be building and creating our own challenge okay the roller is still here it still behaves the same the monkey is here the bananas here okay there's different backgrounds and this is why you're logged in like us today okay we're only going to use backgrounds that we've know so we only saw grass today so we're only going to use the grass okay then look we we click the plus sign there are different objects that we can add to the screen today we don't need to use any of those because we're just using the bananas and as these on your side of the student as you work through the challenges these little guys will unlock once you've been introduced to it okay and then the objects are open but you don't know anything about the objects yet so we won't use anything that we don't know so we don't have to do anything the next thing I want us to do is when you hover over these buttons here you'll see a little minus sign so we're gonna get rid of the minus I'm gonna get rid of the blocks and all we're gonna leave is the step okay button so raise your hand if you're with me and the only button that you see on your screen is the step great great great okay there's a rocking and rolling all right so now that we see that we're gonna click on this plus sign here and we're gonna use the buttons that we we know we've used before so we're gonna get the turn because we use turn we're gonna click it and it will go on to the bottom and then we're gonna find the time slip you'll see it's like a little almost like a recycle sign sort of okay and we're gonna click on that and we're gonna have it add it to the bottom and now we see step turn and the times look hey all very important all right great now this is my favorite part of the platform and hopefully maybe yours as well okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to show you this configuration is the behind the scenes things that you don't normally see on the program itself okay so every step is about 20 pixels so these this XY runs in pixels like computers ok so there's an XY coordinate right the monkey normally on an XY coordinate you would see a zero be somewhere in the middle okay but on computers and in the computer program it's actually up here at zero zero okay zero zero is in the upper left hand side of our screen so we're gonna put our monkey down here so truck so put your monkey down here in the right hand corner okay and we could see where the monkey is we can see if we move him around we can see his rotation I'm just gonna have him facing forward right now on the screen on our bird'seye view okay now we see our banana right now we only have one banana on the screen and we can see that we're moving it I want you to add three bananas well let's do four you all right now a trick here something to notice is that you want your the for banana so you want two of them to be on the same same Y court same ycoordinate okay and then you want them to be on the same and then we'll change the xcoordinate okay so here we have these two bananas so I can click on this banana I can move it and we can see that it's Y is at 343 so that means that I want this other one to also be at 343 you can also use the ruler okay to move it so just kind of keep that in mind as you're going through you okay that's fine Jackson if you can't find the turn no big deal if you see the left and the right that's perfectly fine nothing wrong with that we're gonna program it anyway so it won't be that big video just to help you if you get tricked up with spelling okay it's a great question all right so now we have those two and we know that there we know that they're on the right plane let's do the same thing let's check our other ones and let's make sure they're in the same place so I'm just gonna move mine action away a little bit extra banana there okay so now I'm gonna move this and I'm gonna put this one at y2 11 okay yours doesn't have to be exactly but it's tricky okay all right so that kinds of kind of gives us a little bit of idea if they're on the right plane or the right coordinate where we want them to go so think about it like the right line are they on the right line and are they even with each other okay I'm gonna get my ruler and I'm going to measure the distance first so we see that this one is nine and that this is six and the distance from this banana this one should be the same as the first one but it's not so we're gonna have to adjust it to make sure that that's the case we have this as being nine okay and then we can have this one as being six nothing wrong with that but we want this one to also be nine so that means that I need to move this one a little bit then it was before and I pick up the ruler and I'm so close so close okay and I measure and now you can see that it's night okay so we have six and nine okay so you can also see that I don't have it on the right right spot so I'm just gonna move it so it's even okay so now they're even with each other give me a hand in the air if you're with me you have four bananas and your bananas two of them arm the same ycoordinate and the other two are on the same ycoordinate as well and that just makes it a little bit even awesome you guys are doing great and I know my team is helping to answer those questions that you have any okay now we have that okay we have our back our back is done so we don't have to do anything here so you guys ready to the next step right now we have to go and code it so we have this year and our first step is we want our monkey to be able to step 6 like here so we can repeat this so we need to measure our monkey and move him 6 so that means I'm going to need to move him a little bit up here and so close you can see how sometimes when you're coding and coding adventure how sometimes it can seem like oh I use six one time and I use seven that time because it's really easy okay to be a little bit off by what just something normal okay so now we have that so you guys did awesome we have it kind of so now we're gonna coat it so how many times do we want to repeat this action so we know he's gonna go up and when he goes to the first banana he's gonna turn left when he gets here another banana he's going to turn right okay you okay so i seee the person was asking about spinach i'm gonna if you want to resend your message there is a person in this chat that can kind of help us a guide just like I said I'm not a Spanish speaker I wish I were but not not that cool alright so now we're gonna kotas and I'm gonna get my times loop and I'm gonna click on it once because I don't remember what the function was do I want to do it three times or do I want to do it two times we can try it with three times or I know that I have a collection of two steps so I'm gonna do okay and then what's the first thing that we did we have to make sure that it's inside the loop so this is nested loop that's why we don't have it this way because I think Peter won't realize that so the first step that we did is we said step six okay and then when we get to this banana what do we want to do we wanted to turn left okay and then step can't remember so I need to measure the distance it was nine okay so we're going to step nine 9 and then we're going to turn right and now we're going to test it so it may not work on the first time but that's the joy about coding right we're always failing and we're always doing better than we did the previous time oh so close okay step we got this first one okay so we step six he turns left and then he stepped nine and then six and then nine so now I'm going to look at my configuration and just see if there's something that maybe is a little bit off here you okay and then I'm going to rerun the code just because I wasn't paying that close of attention okay so I probably have an error Beach between the measurement of this banana and that banana just fine so I could change it to seven just in case and let's see if that makes a difference okay so sometimes so you can see it can be a difference of just one number in one direction or the other Gordo doesn't have anything here so we need to say something like whoa I don't know something well here like whoa oops and make sure your spelling and we're using correct capitalization and punctuation okay so woah you coded a simple loop great work because what's going to happen is that other people can actually see this and I click close now I'm not finished okay I need to also name my challenge so when we're naming our challenge we never use last names ever okay we can use a first name but it's always better to have a nickname but when you do a nickname it must be inappropriate okay so I'm just gonna do this here I'm gonna do monkey demo because I'm just settling for you and when I'm finished I'm gonna click the checkmark so I know that it's saved and I am finished with this challenge so I'll go over here to the right hand side I'm going to click save so that I know it's saved okay and then I'll click continue editing and then I'll walk you through that just one more time so if you can just stay with me here and then what you'll do is you can share it to your classroom or you can share it to our discover feature and that means that everyone from all across the world so some of you that are speaking Spanish you guys can share yours and Spanish or the language of your choice and you're able to share that worldwide with each other and you're able to remix each other's challenges and kind of work from there okay you can also do a link and when you do this link that means that you can share it anywhere okay like if you want to share with your family and say hey look at this really cool challenge that I just did today all right or you can even put it in a webpage or anything so let's do that again so we will name our challenge remember no personal names no nothing there just like a nickname you can use a first name just and we never use last names for privacy issues okay we click Save always saving our work and then I click continue winning and I can share it into my classroom if I would like and that would mean that other people can play it or I can just keep it private right now because I haven't really done much on my side of that or I can publish it worldwide now my team is going to send a challenge builder guide to you and that's just going to be something that's going to help you navigate building that so remember I use the configuration so the x and ycoordinates I looked at the different rotations that I had here you see the monkey was at a certain rotation there it wasn't rotated at zero okay and I made sure I had the same Y coordinates and it's easy to look between them to see the x coordinates as well it's a difference of 20 between each one each pixel okay so we build and we created the last thing that we didn't do though is we didn't give Gordo a message so here I would say you will need to use a simple number correct capitalization of tuition to solve this challenge I'm just gonna say don't give up try again okay so we always want to give some encouraging more words than making sure that that's where you're using digital digital citizenship you're always acting they're always using the right words and appropriate words when communicating worldwide with other people or they can see it alright so we are finished working through a challenge we talked about a simple loop okay if you get stuck you always want to ask a teacher a review basically any other challenges that you've worked through there's also super hints that the teachers will turn on so you can use super hints when you're stuck on the coding adventure courses themselves okay and now I'm gonna leave some time for questions because it's pretty quiet so if you have any questions it's open to all panelists and participants right now we can also pop it in the Q&A box while we're doing why you guys are thinking of questions I'm gonna share your results from earlier so hopefully you guys can see this how familiar are you with are you as with code monkey that's supposed to be how familiar are you coding as with code monkey you're a decent coder Facebook could hire you some of most of you are beginners are still learning which is exactly what you what you should be have you use code monkey before a lot of you have used it do you love to code and create yes so that's exactly what we would want for you to do and then the majority there's a couple people that are in third grade and there's one person in fifth grade sixth grade seventh grade and beyond and then we also have educator or might not even be one of those so I don't see any questions coming in so that's great or it could or could not be great so the challenge builder guide is there just make sure that you click on that if you have any questions or you're wanting to use a challenge builder I'm gonna leave this open for this afternoon so you can go ahead and keep working on your challenges and all of that kind of stuff is it okay to teach code monkey we have our beaver achiever courses that are really great for starting with both first and second grade I would recommend starting there first before doing the text based coding just because the textbased coding can get a little bit tricky beyond challenge 30 they can definitely do the first 30 challenges but beyond challenge 30 they start in variables I'm challenge 31 so sometimes that can be a tough concept for anyone to understand but most importantly for those younger guys but that's a great question okay I'm gonna keep moving here we will be doing some more webinars and things next week both for teachers and for students but if you missed anything they'll be up here there's a great game builder webinar that we did last week and some different things that we did with beaver achiever and things like that okay and remember that you can always contact us at info at code monkey comm or you can reach out to us on any of our social channels Facebook Instagram Twitter any of that kind of thing so remember to follow us and like us the guide is not hyperlinked I think you'll have to copy and paste it Brett would you be able to share that with them that link that I shared with you that is a hyperlink document and then remember while you were working with us today that we wrote some code we caught some bananas and we saved the world I'll send a followup email to our users with the challenge builder guide or you can just reach out to me at info at code monkey comm so I see some people are saying they're not able to get it so we'll send the followup email or we'll post it on our web page as well for you guys to use so thank you so much for spending your afternoon with us you guys were amazing coders and you did some amazing work today and remember to always have patience with yourself and that coding is never a hundred percent on the first try so thank you for writing code with us catching bananas and saving the world you guys have a wonderful day bye bye
