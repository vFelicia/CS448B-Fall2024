01:22 - not had the pleasure of meeting yet
01:24 - my name is mark dozier i am part of the
01:27 - customer success team at code monkey
01:30 - i joined the group at the start of the
01:31 - school year prior to that i spent
01:33 - the last 16 years as an educator i
01:36 - started as a fifth grade teacher here in
01:39 - texas a fifth grade science teacher
01:41 - before moving on to chicago where i
01:42 - worked as a technology director
01:45 - as well as a computer science teacher
01:47 - there
01:49 - i did mention that i had friends with me
01:50 - today so i
01:52 - do want to introduce or allow two of my
01:54 - amazing colleagues
01:56 - to introduce themselves
02:06 - hi everyone uh my name is lena saleh i
02:09 - am the professional development and
02:11 - sales manager here at code monkey you
02:13 - can reach me at lena.s at codemonkey.com
02:15 - or you can live tweet
02:17 - at me today at lena or sorry at lena
02:20 - codemonkey
02:21 - just a little bit of background about me
02:23 - i'm a former educator as well
02:25 - i spent over 10 years in the classroom
02:27 - and now i'm just very passionate about
02:29 - delivering computer science to students
02:33 - all right thank you lena
02:38 - hey i'm jay bloodworth i am the
02:41 - curriculum developer here at codemonkey
02:43 - um like mark i'm pretty new to the
02:45 - company i've been here for
02:47 - about six months now um but have had a
02:49 - good time before that
02:51 - i worked for 20 years as a middle school
02:53 - teacher here in south carolina
02:55 - mostly math but also a computer science
02:57 - course
02:58 - that i designed myself so that's kind of
03:00 - the role i'm in now
03:02 - writing the computer science curriculum
03:03 - for good monkey
03:06 - all right thanks lena and jay and i
03:08 - think i speak for all of us when i say
03:09 - that it's
03:11 - it's my hope that when speaking with you
03:13 - all today that we're going to be able to
03:14 - provide everybody with the confidence
03:16 - that you're going to need to effectively
03:18 - teach our game creation courses
03:20 - and then by accomplishing that the goal
03:23 - is you're going to allow your students
03:24 - to really take off and show
03:26 - how creative they can be so with that
03:29 - let's get ready to write code catch
03:31 - bananas and sing the world
03:34 - all right so taking a look at our
03:36 - objectives you can see the areas that we
03:38 - are going to cover today
03:40 - we will explain what is included in the
03:43 - game builder package
03:44 - i'm also going to define what we mean by
03:46 - game creation
03:47 - i will explain why we use it after
03:49 - coding adventure
03:52 - then we'll get into the first parts of
03:54 - platformer which is one of those game
03:55 - creation courses
03:57 - we'll also explain uh what game builder
04:00 - is and when you should use it
04:02 - then we'll show you guys some examples
04:05 - from students
04:07 - that could be found in our discover tab
04:09 - and then as always of course
04:11 - we will leave time at the end for your
04:13 - questions
04:14 - in our q a session
04:18 - so which courses are we referring to
04:21 - when we say
04:22 - game creation game builder what which
04:25 - which courses are part of that game
04:26 - builder package
04:29 - so here you see that game creation is
04:31 - composed of
04:32 - three tutorial based courses uh
04:35 - platformer which we'll cover today
04:37 - frogger and then sprite animations
04:40 - and then over to the far right you see
04:42 - game builder which is a standalone
04:43 - platform
04:44 - it's a sort of a sandbox style uh where
04:47 - the kids can just create from the ground
04:48 - up
04:50 - now with platformer your students are
04:52 - going to learn the fundamentals of game
04:53 - creation
04:54 - by building a game that's very similar
04:56 - to super mario bros
04:58 - they're going to be introduced to game
05:00 - mechanics
05:01 - such as keyboard events and timers
05:06 - in the frog course students will learn
05:08 - how to program a touchscreen game
05:10 - as they build a game that's very similar
05:12 - to that arcade classic frogger
05:14 - uh the course will also teach them how
05:16 - to program a game that utilizes the
05:18 - swiping motion that you're going to find
05:20 - in a mobile or tablet setting
05:22 - and then with the sprite animation
05:23 - course uh your students are going to
05:25 - learn how to create
05:26 - and basically bring to life uh sprites
05:28 - that can be used
05:30 - in the games that they create and then
05:32 - all this culminates with our game
05:34 - builder
05:35 - platform and that'll be the place where
05:36 - your students are going to take those
05:38 - game creation basics
05:40 - and then hopefully wow you with their
05:42 - own uh games that they've made
05:48 - all right so what is game creation so
05:51 - perhaps you've noticed
05:52 - in my course description that i use the
05:54 - word create a lot i use it very
05:56 - liberally
05:57 - and having taught you know elementary
05:59 - and middle school computer science
06:01 - i think we all can agree that it's
06:03 - really important to have that component
06:06 - and also from a buy-in view so it's not
06:08 - just
06:09 - teacher says do this i do this but now
06:11 - we're getting into i learned this let me
06:13 - show you that
06:14 - so to do this in game creation what we
06:18 - need to do
06:19 - is we need to give them a peek under the
06:20 - hood okay so
06:22 - we want to introduce them to the
06:23 - building blocks and these game mechanics
06:26 - then bring them to a point where they're
06:28 - ready to pair that knowledge
06:29 - with their creativity uh in the game
06:32 - builder platform
06:36 - so why do we use it after we complete
06:40 - coding adventure
06:41 - so this is done because coding adventure
06:44 - is going to establish a really strong
06:47 - foundation for them it's going to be a
06:49 - base level that will allow them greater
06:51 - success
06:52 - in game creation also there's going to
06:55 - be concepts that are introduced at the
06:56 - end of coding adventure
06:58 - that are expanded upon at the very
06:59 - beginning of game creation
07:05 - all right so as i mentioned earlier we
07:07 - will get into game creation
07:10 - by starting with the first lesson of
07:11 - platformer now
07:13 - technically speaking you can start with
07:15 - any of the game any of those three game
07:17 - creation courses
07:18 - but i chose platformer today primarily
07:20 - for as i said earlier the similarities
07:23 - to the super mario brothers games uh and
07:26 - your students are
07:27 - actually going to instantly recognize
07:29 - the connections between the two
07:30 - so it's a good jumping off point
07:36 - now in case some of you are unfamiliar
07:38 - with where the lesson plans
07:40 - can be found i'm going to point out that
07:42 - you can find them under the teacher
07:44 - resources
07:49 - so here this is your teacher home page
07:51 - under the teacher resources i have
07:52 - lesson plans
07:55 - and if i scroll down i find the game
07:56 - builder package
07:58 - and you see here platformer is the first
08:00 - one there
08:05 - also with these lessons you'll see
08:08 - they're very similar to coding adventure
08:10 - and that in the way that they're
08:11 - structured uh so the lessons are
08:13 - basically broken up into three parts
08:17 - so you'll start with your introduction
08:20 - and it usually includes
08:21 - objectives and components so the
08:23 - components to think of those as the
08:25 - concepts that are going to be learned
08:27 - part two let's scroll down a little bit
08:31 - more
08:35 - so part two will put the play time this
08:37 - is where the students will actually
08:39 - explore the lesson
08:40 - and then of course we end with part
08:42 - three with our debrief
08:45 - so in platformer i want to point out
08:46 - that you will have seven lessons
08:49 - and each of them is designed for about
08:51 - uh 45 minutes
08:58 - all right so to jump jump start this
09:00 - platform of course we're going to use a
09:01 - very cool and engaging
09:03 - unplugged activity and unplugged
09:05 - activities hopefully you know by now
09:07 - are these critical pieces in each of our
09:09 - code monkey lessons
09:11 - and at their core they allow you as a
09:13 - teacher to break down
09:14 - what can sometimes be a difficult
09:16 - concept into something that's uh
09:18 - you know relatable and easy to
09:20 - understand so this particular
09:22 - unplugged activity that we're going to
09:23 - show you guys today is going to serve as
09:25 - an introduction to a major concept
09:28 - that you're going to find throughout
09:29 - game design and that concept
09:31 - is this concept of event driven
09:34 - programming
09:38 - so i know it may look a little
09:39 - complicated but honestly
09:42 - what i can tell you is it's not on the
09:44 - left what you're looking at
09:46 - is the way that students are sort of
09:47 - used to thinking about coding
09:49 - at least up to this point uh so you know
09:52 - you have lines of code
09:53 - and they're going to be executed in
09:54 - order now on the right which we're
09:56 - seeing is this
09:58 - new concept of event driven programming
10:01 - and the idea here is that a computer
10:03 - program
10:05 - as we know is a set of instructions
10:06 - telling the computer how to process
10:08 - input
10:09 - and deliver a certain output an
10:11 - important part of that program is
10:12 - telling the computer
10:13 - when to perform a certain task
10:16 - so events are a way to trigger
10:19 - certain instructions so let's dive into
10:24 - the unplug activity
10:28 - so as you can see here the materials and
10:31 - preparation needed
10:32 - are going to be pretty minimal you'll
10:34 - need two sets of colored index cards
10:37 - uh the first color and in our example
10:39 - here we're using the color red
10:41 - will be our designated event cards
10:44 - and on each event card you're going to
10:46 - write down one of three events
10:48 - such as cross arms
10:52 - clap hands or pat your head
10:55 - the other color is going to be for your
10:57 - handler pile
10:59 - now each of these cards is going to need
11:01 - a conditional statement such as
11:03 - when someone crosses their arms i'm
11:05 - going to take a knee
11:06 - or when someone claps their hands i will
11:09 - say
11:10 - jumanji now to help you guys understand
11:14 - how this is going to work um i actually
11:16 - do have a video that was filmed at our
11:18 - code monkey
11:20 - studios so let's get to that
11:40 - okay
11:42 - [Music]
11:48 - all right so i don't know if those guys
11:49 - are going to be winning any oscars
11:50 - anytime
11:51 - soon but they did a great job um so what
11:54 - what they've done here is you have to
11:55 - start by distributing those cards face
11:57 - down
11:57 - and then you form two lines uh one
11:59 - line's for events
12:01 - the other line is for handlers next you
12:04 - want to go down on the line one at a
12:05 - time
12:06 - having each student perform the
12:09 - action that is on their card or the
12:10 - command that's on their card
12:12 - then your handlers are going to react
12:15 - based on the behavior
12:17 - that they saw on the events line and
12:19 - then maybe after one time down the line
12:21 - you can switch roles uh events will
12:23 - trade with handlers
12:25 - there's also an opportunity here to have
12:27 - the students maybe rewrite the code just
12:29 - to see
12:30 - how you know maybe the first time when a
12:32 - person folded their arms
12:34 - i jumped up but now someone rewrote the
12:37 - code
12:37 - and now i'm going to turn off the lights
12:40 - or something like that
12:45 - now if you see any holdouts if you still
12:48 - have holdouts
12:49 - as far as buy-ins with the students even
12:51 - after that activity
12:53 - and i promise you if you show them this
12:55 - um
12:56 - this activity which is actually taken
12:57 - directly from the lesson plan it's a
12:59 - short video
13:00 - uh and we kind of use it to show
13:02 - students the possibilities we're going
13:04 - to show them
13:05 - what it is we hope to get from this
13:07 - platformer course
13:08 - so i'll go ahead and play a little bit
13:10 - for you guys
13:11 - and this will be something that you show
13:12 - the kids and again this is directly from
13:15 - the lesson plan so it's easily
13:17 - accessible for you as a teacher
13:24 - alright so watch out for the tigers and
13:27 - chocolates
13:30 - [Music]
13:32 - i see a tiger
13:36 - i'm also old school and i need more of a
13:39 - playstation controller
13:42 - [Music]
13:46 - all right so there uh what we saw
13:50 - was a lot of those elements are going to
13:52 - come into play we saw a timer
13:53 - there was objects there were good guys
13:56 - bad guys
13:57 - um in the times where we've shown this
14:00 - we've taken our visits to schools
14:02 - this is really what gets the students
14:04 - going so
14:06 - the job for you is to get them calmed
14:07 - down and get ready for the beginning of
14:09 - the
14:09 - lesson uh and with that i'm going to
14:11 - turn it back over to jay
14:13 - who's going to guide us through lesson
14:16 - one
14:16 - of this platformer course
14:20 - all right yep let me get out set up so
14:22 - you can see my screen and we'll get
14:23 - going with this
14:26 - all right it should be there for you now
14:29 - um
14:29 - so this is lesson one which is going to
14:31 - encompass uh the first five exercises
14:34 - of the platformer course and i want to
14:37 - go through these
14:38 - fairly quickly introduce you to what the
14:41 - screen looks like and all the elements
14:42 - that we're using here
14:44 - um but also explain a little bit of the
14:46 - computer science and coding times that
14:49 - um find what they're doing what your
14:51 - students will be doing
14:52 - so let's look at the screen um we've got
14:55 - basically three columns here
14:57 - the column left is where the
14:59 - instructions are
15:00 - and then at the bottom it has a little
15:01 - checklist where the steps are broken
15:04 - down
15:05 - some of these exercises have multiple
15:07 - parts and
15:08 - the students can check them off as they
15:11 - do them
15:12 - uh on the in the middle is where the
15:14 - students will actually write their code
15:16 - we're going to focus in this discussion
15:18 - on just the code area up here
15:20 - there are these buttons down here that
15:21 - can be used to as shortcuts for typing
15:24 - but we're going gonna do it old school
15:25 - today and just type in the
15:27 - uh doors by hand then on the right we
15:31 - have
15:31 - the game screen at the top um that's
15:34 - where we'll actually play the game when
15:35 - we press the run
15:36 - button but also where we can design the
15:39 - game by moving around the elements
15:40 - and adding things and
15:43 - things like that at the bottom there are
15:46 - some tabs for controlling different
15:48 - aspects of the game
15:49 - adding new sprites adding widgets sounds
15:52 - and modifying the game um for this
15:56 - for these five lessons exercises we're
15:58 - only going to see
15:59 - uh the sprite tab but later on the
16:02 - course
16:03 - we'll have opportunities to work on the
16:04 - other tabs as well
16:07 - so let's go and get started with um the
16:10 - first
16:11 - exercise um as was mentioned
16:14 - um these elements that make up the game
16:16 - are called sprites
16:18 - uh sprites are basically just a little
16:19 - pictures little characters and objects
16:21 - in the screen
16:22 - that interact um so
16:26 - the background here is not considered a
16:28 - sprite because it doesn't really
16:29 - interact with anything
16:30 - later on we're going to encounter tiles
16:32 - they're not sprites
16:33 - but sprites are the parts of the game
16:35 - that do things
16:37 - so in the simple version of the game
16:38 - we're starting with the sprites are the
16:40 - monkey and banana
16:42 - later on as you saw will add chocolate
16:44 - and a tiger and some other little
16:46 - power-ups and things
16:47 - right now just the monkey in the banana
16:51 - the thing to understand about coding
16:53 - games is that when you
16:55 - write code it is always associated with
16:58 - a particular sprite
17:00 - so right now in this exercise and the
17:03 - next ones we're going to be writing code
17:05 - that is attached to the monkey sprite
17:07 - you can see that the editor up here has
17:09 - the monkey
17:10 - showing that that's what we're editing
17:13 - so let's look at what this code
17:14 - uh does or needs to do um so
17:18 - mark talk to you about event handlers
17:20 - event handlers are used for responding
17:21 - to events
17:22 - events are things like pressing a
17:25 - keyboard key clicking a mouse things
17:27 - that happen
17:28 - in in and outside of the games world
17:32 - so here we're creating an event handler
17:35 - for the monkey sprite
17:37 - called own key on key is built into
17:41 - the game builder platform is a special
17:44 - property of a sprite and if the sprite
17:47 - has that property
17:49 - then that code will be executed
17:52 - when a keyboard key is pressed now let's
17:55 - talk about this axle for a second
17:57 - this at symbol is special notation
18:00 - in the coffee script language we're
18:02 - using that says
18:04 - this property its own key is part of the
18:07 - monkey sprite
18:08 - this is the monkey's own key function
18:12 - later on in the course you may have to
18:13 - refer to other sprites
18:15 - inside of the monkey's code and there's
18:17 - different notation for that but for
18:18 - referring to the monkey's own code
18:21 - it's the at symbol so the on key
18:23 - property of the monkey
18:24 - is set equal to and this notation here
18:27 - with the parentheses in the arrow that
18:29 - creates a function
18:32 - and this function takes an argument an
18:35 - input called key which is going to
18:36 - represent the actual keyboard key that
18:39 - is
18:40 - we're not pressed actually going to use
18:42 - that argument in this first exercise
18:44 - we'll use it in the next two
18:47 - so when the keyboard keeps pressed we
18:48 - want to do something what we want to do
18:50 - well if we read the instructions
18:52 - we want to use this function that caught
18:55 - called step one that's going to make the
18:57 - monkey
18:59 - take one step forward again
19:02 - the accidental means this belongs to the
19:05 - monkey who is the monkey that's doing
19:06 - the stepping not the banana or anything
19:08 - else
19:10 - and one step may not seem like much but
19:13 - this code's gonna execute over and over
19:15 - again as long as you hold down the key
19:18 - and so that will move the monkey quickly
19:20 - enough
19:21 - so i've done what they said to do i can
19:24 - check it
19:25 - it's happy i'm gonna press run just to
19:27 - see what happens
19:30 - so here's the one key now if i press any
19:32 - key on my keyboard at all the monkey
19:33 - steps forward as long as i hold the key
19:36 - down
19:38 - and oh happy day he found the banana
19:41 - so we have solved extras of one
19:45 - moving on to exercise two
19:49 - so one of the things we'll see is the
19:51 - exercises build on each other
19:53 - so everything we talked about before is
19:55 - still here
19:56 - with a little bit more because just
19:59 - having the monkey only be able to move
20:00 - forward that's not much of a game we
20:02 - want to have some ability to control
20:04 - what the monkey is doing so now we're
20:07 - actually going to use this input
20:09 - remember i said key is a code that
20:12 - represents
20:13 - the keyboard key that was pressed
20:16 - and so in this line of code they've
20:18 - already given us we're using an
20:20 - if statement to test to see if that key
20:22 - if that keyboard key that was pressed
20:24 - is equal to keyboard.left is a symbol
20:28 - that stands for the left
20:30 - arrow key on the keyboard the double
20:32 - equals is important
20:34 - the double equals is what you should
20:35 - check to see if two things are equal
20:37 - okay if you use just a single equals the
20:39 - program would not work
20:42 - so if the key is the left keyboard key
20:45 - then we're gonna step negative one hmm
20:49 - well this is not too hard to understand
20:51 - since stepping one moves the monkey to
20:53 - the right
20:54 - stepping negative one moves the monkey
20:56 - to the left we want the monkey
20:58 - to be able to move in both directions so
21:00 - let's add the possibility for him to
21:02 - move to the right again so that's going
21:03 - to be f
21:04 - key double equals
21:08 - keyboard right
21:12 - obviously and then we'll use the same
21:15 - thing we used before
21:16 - step one because that moves the monkey
21:19 - to the right
21:21 - and let's check that it's happy with us
21:24 - we'll press run
21:26 - we can see the monkey can move both to
21:27 - the right and to the left
21:31 - and there he managed to make make his
21:33 - way to banana once again
21:35 - all right
21:39 - lesson exercise number three well mark
21:42 - told you that
21:42 - um this is a super mario type game and
21:46 - uh mario's one of mario's biggest tricks
21:49 - is he can jump
21:50 - so we want our monkey to be able to jump
21:52 - so we can get to his been
21:53 - hanging in the air for us so we got our
21:56 - old code from before
21:57 - move to the left or if the keyboard key
22:00 - is the one to the left
22:01 - move backwards if it's the right arrow
22:03 - key move
22:05 - forwards to the right and if it's the up
22:07 - key
22:08 - this isn't right we don't want the up
22:10 - key to move the monkey
22:12 - to the right which is what step one does
22:14 - we want the up key to make the monkey
22:16 - jump so let's change this
22:21 - to this new function jump
22:27 - now notice that this time there's these
22:30 - parentheses
22:31 - empty set of parentheses open print fees
22:33 - and immediately close parentheses right
22:34 - after jump
22:36 - that's because the jump function doesn't
22:38 - take any inputs so the step function
22:40 - takes an input how many steps to take
22:43 - the jump function doesn't and in coffee
22:45 - script if a function doesn't take any
22:47 - inputs
22:48 - you have to use these open and close
22:50 - parentheses right after it
22:52 - but that's all we need to do to modify
22:54 - the code here so we'll check it
22:56 - and we'll run it and then the monkey
22:59 - comes over here
23:00 - and he jumps up and he got the banana
23:07 - all right um these next two exercises
23:11 - are not really based on coding um in
23:14 - addition to the sprites in the game
23:15 - world we can make it more interesting by
23:17 - adding
23:18 - tiles to the game world um to create
23:21 - stair steps and challenges and things
23:23 - for the monkey to move around
23:24 - on to do that nothing in the code window
23:27 - instead we're going to come over here to
23:28 - the
23:29 - game window and use the paintbrush icon
23:33 - and we can choose any of these tiles we
23:34 - like i'll keep using the same one
23:38 - and then just paint some extra tiles on
23:42 - the screen
23:44 - to make it easier for the monkey to get
23:45 - up there to the banana so
23:47 - i've already done that i should be ready
23:49 - to go let's run the game
23:52 - and the monkey should be able to climb
23:54 - up there these new steps
23:57 - and get the banana one more time
24:00 - all right and then one more quick
24:02 - challenge before we finish
24:04 - up with this um in addition to the paint
24:06 - brush there is an eraser
24:10 - tool here so we see there's an obstacle
24:12 - we have all these tiles we can put in
24:14 - the monkey's way
24:15 - so to make this challenge solvable we
24:17 - need to erase these
24:19 - now obviously in designing an actual
24:22 - game you wouldn't
24:24 - add tiles just so you could erase them
24:26 - later but you make mistakes near
24:28 - dividing or putting
24:29 - towels on the screen for the eraser tool
24:31 - is used for
24:32 - removing those so now the monkey has a
24:35 - path
24:36 - we press run
24:41 - and he's got the banana
24:45 - so uh we have gone through those pretty
24:47 - quickly um
24:49 - if you're doing this in the classroom
24:50 - it's probably gonna take your students a
24:51 - little bit longer
24:52 - but if they will read the instructions
24:54 - you see that's pretty much
24:56 - step by step and they should be able to
24:59 - get through
25:00 - uh these exercises almost as quickly as
25:04 - i let you do them but
25:05 - let them take the time to kind of learn
25:07 - and digest the computer science
25:09 - as they're playing so with that i'm
25:11 - going to turn it back
25:12 - over to mark and let him continue the
25:15 - presentation
25:21 - all right thanks again jay um
25:24 - so with the time that we have remaining
25:25 - i want to get to the part uh the meats
25:27 - and potatoes of game creation this is
25:29 - the part that
25:30 - i know many of you are already consider
25:32 - yourself the most popular teacher in
25:34 - your school
25:34 - based on the nature of what you teach uh
25:37 - but if you're not already you for sure
25:39 - will be the most popular teacher
25:41 - once you begin the game builder part
25:45 - of our course so
25:48 - game builder needs to be assigned to
25:49 - your students for them to access it
25:52 - so if you have a question on how to do
25:53 - that just make sure you leave us a
25:54 - comment uh
25:56 - in the chat and then someone will answer
25:58 - that for you
26:02 - all right so let's imagine for a minute
26:04 - you've completed the entire platformer
26:06 - course
26:07 - so what have you actually done what
26:08 - you've done is you started by using the
26:11 - lesson plan video
26:12 - to kind of hype them up and show them
26:14 - what it is that they can make you're
26:15 - showing them the possibilities
26:17 - then through those exercises the ones
26:20 - that jay just walked us through
26:22 - they've learned how to make those games
26:25 - and by
26:25 - this point when they reach game builder
26:28 - they're going to be able to showcase
26:29 - what they've learned
26:30 - and then again combine it with
26:32 - creativity
26:33 - so as our teacher i find that this is a
26:36 - perfect way
26:38 - to assess their progress another reason
26:40 - that you're going to find that this is
26:41 - the
26:42 - ideal next step after coding adventure
26:45 - is
26:46 - for those of you that like to see
26:48 - collaboration and creativity
26:50 - in your classroom then get ready because
26:53 - it's going to go through the roof once
26:54 - you introduce
26:55 - game builder and then honestly if you
26:58 - forget
26:59 - all those other bullet points there just
27:01 - know that
27:02 - your students are going to love game
27:03 - builder because it's just plain and
27:05 - simple
27:06 - a lot of fun
27:10 - so this is a good question when should
27:12 - you assign it
27:13 - and to get the most out of game builder
27:15 - i strongly suggest that you complete at
27:17 - least
27:18 - one of the game creation courses if not
27:19 - more you definitely want to set your
27:21 - students up
27:22 - for success and we believe that this is
27:25 - the best way
27:26 - to ensure that
27:33 - all right so you may be wondering uh
27:35 - where you can find game builder
27:37 - so for those of you that have not
27:38 - accessed it already uh from your teacher
27:40 - homepage you would scroll below your
27:42 - classrooms
27:46 - and then you'll find the platform
27:50 - under in the creativity section and here
27:52 - it is game builder
27:54 - create your own games so you'll start by
27:57 - clicking on
27:59 - create games and then you'll see the
28:01 - green start coding button here
28:07 - so here i see a couple of options or a
28:09 - few options actually for a game template
28:12 - but what i'm going to do is i'm going to
28:13 - choose the default platform
28:16 - because i chose i'm going to choose
28:17 - default because the other five actually
28:19 - have pre-written
28:20 - code in them so it's a small amount but
28:22 - it is there
28:24 - and if i really want to dive in i really
28:26 - want to drive home the assessment aspect
28:28 - of this platform that we have
28:29 - i think it's best to have these students
28:31 - start with a blank slate
28:34 - so let's go ahead and start
28:40 - okay so the first thing i want to do
28:41 - when i get to the game builder is always
28:43 - just take a look at the layout here it's
28:45 - pretty minimal right
28:46 - uh the left side of the screen is going
28:48 - to be divided with our code editor
28:50 - uh taking up the most real estate and
28:52 - then we have some buttons and tabs
28:53 - sitting just below that
28:55 - still on the left side now you can find
28:57 - the stage on the upper right
28:59 - and our design and object tabs in the
29:01 - lower array
29:03 - now staying on the right side of the
29:05 - screen i want to point out something
29:06 - that's a relatively
29:08 - new feature that's going to be so
29:11 - helpful to everybody that's listening
29:13 - today
29:13 - i know the term game changer can be
29:16 - overused
29:17 - but this is like a literal game changer
29:19 - right so here
29:21 - next to my avatar what i have are
29:24 - reference cards
29:25 - now these reference cards will allow
29:27 - students to refer back to the concepts
29:29 - that they've learned in the course
29:31 - and they'll also be able to see example
29:32 - code so i'll actually show you how that
29:34 - looks
29:34 - here
29:38 - so again you know we're saying here's a
29:40 - blank slate but we don't want to leave
29:42 - them out to dry
29:43 - so here are some of your training rules
29:45 - if you will
29:47 - you can also search for uh content
29:51 - in our search bar here with the
29:52 - reference cards
29:55 - and then the last thing i want to point
29:57 - out here on the screen
29:59 - is our save and share buttons you
30:01 - definitely want to make sure that your
30:02 - students are aware
30:04 - of the save button to maintain their
30:05 - progress so those are next to the green
30:07 - run button at the top of the screen
30:10 - um okay so let's see how this process
30:13 - works
30:13 - so right here i'm being asked to add a
30:16 - sprite or widget
30:18 - uh to start the game coding so i'll do
30:20 - just that and i'll keep it simple for
30:23 - the purposes of this webinar we'll just
30:25 - do monkey
30:27 - and we will add a banana as well so
30:30 - two sprites
30:37 - and again um jay went over some really
30:40 - good information
30:41 - but maybe i didn't keep a technology
30:43 - notebook or maybe i didn't write this
30:45 - down
30:46 - what i can do is refer to the reference
30:47 - cards to sort of kickstart
30:49 - uh what it is that i want to do so i
30:52 - remember he said something about an
30:53 - on key and then when i search for it i
30:56 - get the definition
30:58 - as well as an example
31:01 - so i'm actually going to give myself a
31:04 - shortcut
31:05 - copy the example paste it
31:10 - and then again this is a very
31:11 - rudimentary game uh but just to give you
31:13 - an idea how this would look
31:16 - so there it is i kind of i'm i'm on my
31:18 - way here a little bit right
31:21 - okay so i talked about saving and
31:24 - sharing
31:25 - and i do want to walk you guys through
31:26 - the process of sharing a game that
31:29 - you've created
31:32 - i'll click on the share button here
31:42 - so when a student decides to share or
31:43 - create a game they're going to encounter
31:45 - this pop-up window
31:46 - that has a couple of options so you see
31:48 - i can just make it private
31:50 - you know my game is very early on in the
31:52 - early stages i don't need to share with
31:53 - anybody
31:54 - i could also share it with my classroom
31:56 - and that would be my code monkey
31:58 - classroom so only those 20 to 25
32:00 - students will be able to see that
32:02 - i can also get a link and that link
32:05 - could be copied and pasted into her
32:06 - browser
32:07 - i could possibly email it to my parents
32:10 - i think some schools have embedded it in
32:12 - their school home page
32:14 - but that's an option as well but also
32:18 - at the bottom here i see the option to
32:21 - publish it
32:23 - so with this i'll go ahead and click on
32:27 - that
32:28 - so i want you guys to keep in mind that
32:29 - any game that's shared
32:31 - will be vetted by us uh to make sure
32:34 - that they meet our community standards
32:38 - so you can sort of see here um sort of
32:41 - the guidelines that the students are
32:42 - going to be held to
32:44 - uh before their game is actually posted
32:46 - online
32:53 - all right so to view the games that have
32:55 - been shared um
32:56 - throughout the cold monkey global
32:57 - community we're going to use the the
33:00 - discover tab uh which is located on the
33:02 - home page
33:04 - so you see it there next to my
33:08 - challenges
33:10 - i'm going to take you there as well
33:17 - backing up a little bit before steven
33:18 - publishes the game you want to make sure
33:20 - they give it a name
33:21 - so we'll call this uh webinar
33:25 - and then the instructions in the
33:27 - description is pretty optional
33:28 - it's optional right now but again
33:30 - getting back to what we talked about
33:32 - assessing
33:33 - uh you can tie in literacy you can tie
33:35 - in the fact that hey
33:37 - it's just comprehension right if i can
33:38 - explain how to do something if i can
33:40 - clearly give directions
33:42 - uh then i i've showed that i have a
33:44 - mastery over this content
33:46 - so in my case i'm just gonna say feed
33:50 - the monkey employ
33:53 - the bad guys and then i click publish
34:01 - okay so we were getting into the
34:03 - discover tab again it's right next to my
34:06 - challenges
34:09 - so here when you get to the discover tab
34:12 - uh you'll see all the games that have
34:13 - made it through that vetting process
34:15 - that i just described
34:16 - and in addition to playing the games as
34:18 - they are
34:20 - so let's just kind of show you a little
34:22 - bit of those
34:24 - so in addition to playing the games as
34:26 - they are you also have the option to
34:27 - remix games
34:29 - which will sort of allow you to add your
34:30 - own slant to the games
34:35 - i also want to point out uh there's sort
34:37 - of a social element to this as well
34:39 - you can see how many times this game has
34:41 - been played
34:43 - you can see how many times people have
34:44 - liked it and we
34:46 - think about the population that we're
34:47 - teaching and those students in those age
34:50 - levels
34:51 - that's kind of you know where they are
34:53 - in their environment these days
34:54 - so that's another great piece that i
34:56 - like to point out
35:03 - all right so as we wrap up today i want
35:05 - to take a look back at the ground that
35:07 - we've covered
35:08 - um we've discussed our game builder
35:10 - package which courses
35:11 - make up that package we explain when to
35:14 - assign it
35:16 - jay walked us through that first lesson
35:17 - of platformer
35:19 - after that we took a look at creating
35:21 - our own games using game builder
35:24 - and then finally we looked at the
35:25 - discover tab to see
35:27 - where to find games that have been
35:28 - published by code monkey users
35:30 - from across the globe
35:34 - all right so i think that that is a
35:36 - great place to stop
35:38 - and open the floor to everyone that's
35:40 - here so with that let's go ahead and
35:42 - begin our q a
35:48 - so we had one question will this webinar
35:51 - be offered again
35:52 - at this time we do not have a scheduled
35:54 - date but we will be sending out the
35:56 - webinar
35:57 - after today's live viewing of it so to
36:00 - make sure that you also have that on
36:01 - hand for any note taking or anything
36:03 - that you need to take as far as that
36:04 - goes
36:09 - thank you leno if you have any other
36:12 - questions
36:18 - all right so if we don't have any other
36:20 - questions i want to thank everybody for
36:21 - their time
36:23 - uh and again like i said uh pdc
36:26 - pd information certificates will be
36:28 - emailed out to you guys as well as a
36:30 - recording
36:39 - thank you everybody
36:46 - and remember to write code catch bananas
36:48 - and save the world we'll see you guys
36:50 - next time
36:51 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

i'd like to welcome everybody i definitely say thank you to all of you that have joined us today uh it's always great to get together and discuss ways that we can help our students as they continue to learn coding now before we dive uh too deep into the webinar i'll mention that if you haven't already done so please follow us across all of our social media channels you can find us on instagram and twitter at codemonkeystu you can also get valuable updates on code monkey's facebook page as well as our code monkey blog which you can find on our website at codemonkey.com and if you wish to live tweet at us today during today's webinar you can do so using the hashtag codemonkeywebinar and we will do our best to answer any of your live tweets i have a team with me today so i'm not alone which is good news uh we're all here to answer any questions that you may have i do want to ask that if you have a question please drop it in our chat box or in our q a so that way everyone can see it and then lastly i'll let everybody know that we will be sending out information regarding your pd certificate directly following the webinar so please look out for that in your email all right so for those of you who have not had the pleasure of meeting yet my name is mark dozier i am part of the customer success team at code monkey i joined the group at the start of the school year prior to that i spent the last 16 years as an educator i started as a fifth grade teacher here in texas a fifth grade science teacher before moving on to chicago where i worked as a technology director as well as a computer science teacher there i did mention that i had friends with me today so i do want to introduce or allow two of my amazing colleagues to introduce themselves hi everyone uh my name is lena saleh i am the professional development and sales manager here at code monkey you can reach me at lena.s at codemonkey.com or you can live tweet at me today at lena or sorry at lena codemonkey just a little bit of background about me i'm a former educator as well i spent over 10 years in the classroom and now i'm just very passionate about delivering computer science to students all right thank you lena hey i'm jay bloodworth i am the curriculum developer here at codemonkey um like mark i'm pretty new to the company i've been here for about six months now um but have had a good time before that i worked for 20 years as a middle school teacher here in south carolina mostly math but also a computer science course that i designed myself so that's kind of the role i'm in now writing the computer science curriculum for good monkey all right thanks lena and jay and i think i speak for all of us when i say that it's it's my hope that when speaking with you all today that we're going to be able to provide everybody with the confidence that you're going to need to effectively teach our game creation courses and then by accomplishing that the goal is you're going to allow your students to really take off and show how creative they can be so with that let's get ready to write code catch bananas and sing the world all right so taking a look at our objectives you can see the areas that we are going to cover today we will explain what is included in the game builder package i'm also going to define what we mean by game creation i will explain why we use it after coding adventure then we'll get into the first parts of platformer which is one of those game creation courses we'll also explain uh what game builder is and when you should use it then we'll show you guys some examples from students that could be found in our discover tab and then as always of course we will leave time at the end for your questions in our q a session so which courses are we referring to when we say game creation game builder what which which courses are part of that game builder package so here you see that game creation is composed of three tutorial based courses uh platformer which we'll cover today frogger and then sprite animations and then over to the far right you see game builder which is a standalone platform it's a sort of a sandbox style uh where the kids can just create from the ground up now with platformer your students are going to learn the fundamentals of game creation by building a game that's very similar to super mario bros they're going to be introduced to game mechanics such as keyboard events and timers in the frog course students will learn how to program a touchscreen game as they build a game that's very similar to that arcade classic frogger uh the course will also teach them how to program a game that utilizes the swiping motion that you're going to find in a mobile or tablet setting and then with the sprite animation course uh your students are going to learn how to create and basically bring to life uh sprites that can be used in the games that they create and then all this culminates with our game builder platform and that'll be the place where your students are going to take those game creation basics and then hopefully wow you with their own uh games that they've made all right so what is game creation so perhaps you've noticed in my course description that i use the word create a lot i use it very liberally and having taught you know elementary and middle school computer science i think we all can agree that it's really important to have that component and also from a buyin view so it's not just teacher says do this i do this but now we're getting into i learned this let me show you that so to do this in game creation what we need to do is we need to give them a peek under the hood okay so we want to introduce them to the building blocks and these game mechanics then bring them to a point where they're ready to pair that knowledge with their creativity uh in the game builder platform so why do we use it after we complete coding adventure so this is done because coding adventure is going to establish a really strong foundation for them it's going to be a base level that will allow them greater success in game creation also there's going to be concepts that are introduced at the end of coding adventure that are expanded upon at the very beginning of game creation all right so as i mentioned earlier we will get into game creation by starting with the first lesson of platformer now technically speaking you can start with any of the game any of those three game creation courses but i chose platformer today primarily for as i said earlier the similarities to the super mario brothers games uh and your students are actually going to instantly recognize the connections between the two so it's a good jumping off point now in case some of you are unfamiliar with where the lesson plans can be found i'm going to point out that you can find them under the teacher resources so here this is your teacher home page under the teacher resources i have lesson plans and if i scroll down i find the game builder package and you see here platformer is the first one there also with these lessons you'll see they're very similar to coding adventure and that in the way that they're structured uh so the lessons are basically broken up into three parts so you'll start with your introduction and it usually includes objectives and components so the components to think of those as the concepts that are going to be learned part two let's scroll down a little bit more so part two will put the play time this is where the students will actually explore the lesson and then of course we end with part three with our debrief so in platformer i want to point out that you will have seven lessons and each of them is designed for about uh 45 minutes all right so to jump jump start this platform of course we're going to use a very cool and engaging unplugged activity and unplugged activities hopefully you know by now are these critical pieces in each of our code monkey lessons and at their core they allow you as a teacher to break down what can sometimes be a difficult concept into something that's uh you know relatable and easy to understand so this particular unplugged activity that we're going to show you guys today is going to serve as an introduction to a major concept that you're going to find throughout game design and that concept is this concept of event driven programming so i know it may look a little complicated but honestly what i can tell you is it's not on the left what you're looking at is the way that students are sort of used to thinking about coding at least up to this point uh so you know you have lines of code and they're going to be executed in order now on the right which we're seeing is this new concept of event driven programming and the idea here is that a computer program as we know is a set of instructions telling the computer how to process input and deliver a certain output an important part of that program is telling the computer when to perform a certain task so events are a way to trigger certain instructions so let's dive into the unplug activity so as you can see here the materials and preparation needed are going to be pretty minimal you'll need two sets of colored index cards uh the first color and in our example here we're using the color red will be our designated event cards and on each event card you're going to write down one of three events such as cross arms clap hands or pat your head the other color is going to be for your handler pile now each of these cards is going to need a conditional statement such as when someone crosses their arms i'm going to take a knee or when someone claps their hands i will say jumanji now to help you guys understand how this is going to work um i actually do have a video that was filmed at our code monkey studios so let's get to that okay all right so i don't know if those guys are going to be winning any oscars anytime soon but they did a great job um so what what they've done here is you have to start by distributing those cards face down and then you form two lines uh one line's for events the other line is for handlers next you want to go down on the line one at a time having each student perform the action that is on their card or the command that's on their card then your handlers are going to react based on the behavior that they saw on the events line and then maybe after one time down the line you can switch roles uh events will trade with handlers there's also an opportunity here to have the students maybe rewrite the code just to see how you know maybe the first time when a person folded their arms i jumped up but now someone rewrote the code and now i'm going to turn off the lights or something like that now if you see any holdouts if you still have holdouts as far as buyins with the students even after that activity and i promise you if you show them this um this activity which is actually taken directly from the lesson plan it's a short video uh and we kind of use it to show students the possibilities we're going to show them what it is we hope to get from this platformer course so i'll go ahead and play a little bit for you guys and this will be something that you show the kids and again this is directly from the lesson plan so it's easily accessible for you as a teacher alright so watch out for the tigers and chocolates i see a tiger i'm also old school and i need more of a playstation controller all right so there uh what we saw was a lot of those elements are going to come into play we saw a timer there was objects there were good guys bad guys um in the times where we've shown this we've taken our visits to schools this is really what gets the students going so the job for you is to get them calmed down and get ready for the beginning of the lesson uh and with that i'm going to turn it back over to jay who's going to guide us through lesson one of this platformer course all right yep let me get out set up so you can see my screen and we'll get going with this all right it should be there for you now um so this is lesson one which is going to encompass uh the first five exercises of the platformer course and i want to go through these fairly quickly introduce you to what the screen looks like and all the elements that we're using here um but also explain a little bit of the computer science and coding times that um find what they're doing what your students will be doing so let's look at the screen um we've got basically three columns here the column left is where the instructions are and then at the bottom it has a little checklist where the steps are broken down some of these exercises have multiple parts and the students can check them off as they do them uh on the in the middle is where the students will actually write their code we're going to focus in this discussion on just the code area up here there are these buttons down here that can be used to as shortcuts for typing but we're going gonna do it old school today and just type in the uh doors by hand then on the right we have the game screen at the top um that's where we'll actually play the game when we press the run button but also where we can design the game by moving around the elements and adding things and things like that at the bottom there are some tabs for controlling different aspects of the game adding new sprites adding widgets sounds and modifying the game um for this for these five lessons exercises we're only going to see uh the sprite tab but later on the course we'll have opportunities to work on the other tabs as well so let's go and get started with um the first exercise um as was mentioned um these elements that make up the game are called sprites uh sprites are basically just a little pictures little characters and objects in the screen that interact um so the background here is not considered a sprite because it doesn't really interact with anything later on we're going to encounter tiles they're not sprites but sprites are the parts of the game that do things so in the simple version of the game we're starting with the sprites are the monkey and banana later on as you saw will add chocolate and a tiger and some other little powerups and things right now just the monkey in the banana the thing to understand about coding games is that when you write code it is always associated with a particular sprite so right now in this exercise and the next ones we're going to be writing code that is attached to the monkey sprite you can see that the editor up here has the monkey showing that that's what we're editing so let's look at what this code uh does or needs to do um so mark talk to you about event handlers event handlers are used for responding to events events are things like pressing a keyboard key clicking a mouse things that happen in in and outside of the games world so here we're creating an event handler for the monkey sprite called own key on key is built into the game builder platform is a special property of a sprite and if the sprite has that property then that code will be executed when a keyboard key is pressed now let's talk about this axle for a second this at symbol is special notation in the coffee script language we're using that says this property its own key is part of the monkey sprite this is the monkey's own key function later on in the course you may have to refer to other sprites inside of the monkey's code and there's different notation for that but for referring to the monkey's own code it's the at symbol so the on key property of the monkey is set equal to and this notation here with the parentheses in the arrow that creates a function and this function takes an argument an input called key which is going to represent the actual keyboard key that is we're not pressed actually going to use that argument in this first exercise we'll use it in the next two so when the keyboard keeps pressed we want to do something what we want to do well if we read the instructions we want to use this function that caught called step one that's going to make the monkey take one step forward again the accidental means this belongs to the monkey who is the monkey that's doing the stepping not the banana or anything else and one step may not seem like much but this code's gonna execute over and over again as long as you hold down the key and so that will move the monkey quickly enough so i've done what they said to do i can check it it's happy i'm gonna press run just to see what happens so here's the one key now if i press any key on my keyboard at all the monkey steps forward as long as i hold the key down and oh happy day he found the banana so we have solved extras of one moving on to exercise two so one of the things we'll see is the exercises build on each other so everything we talked about before is still here with a little bit more because just having the monkey only be able to move forward that's not much of a game we want to have some ability to control what the monkey is doing so now we're actually going to use this input remember i said key is a code that represents the keyboard key that was pressed and so in this line of code they've already given us we're using an if statement to test to see if that key if that keyboard key that was pressed is equal to keyboard.left is a symbol that stands for the left arrow key on the keyboard the double equals is important the double equals is what you should check to see if two things are equal okay if you use just a single equals the program would not work so if the key is the left keyboard key then we're gonna step negative one hmm well this is not too hard to understand since stepping one moves the monkey to the right stepping negative one moves the monkey to the left we want the monkey to be able to move in both directions so let's add the possibility for him to move to the right again so that's going to be f key double equals keyboard right obviously and then we'll use the same thing we used before step one because that moves the monkey to the right and let's check that it's happy with us we'll press run we can see the monkey can move both to the right and to the left and there he managed to make make his way to banana once again all right lesson exercise number three well mark told you that um this is a super mario type game and uh mario's one of mario's biggest tricks is he can jump so we want our monkey to be able to jump so we can get to his been hanging in the air for us so we got our old code from before move to the left or if the keyboard key is the one to the left move backwards if it's the right arrow key move forwards to the right and if it's the up key this isn't right we don't want the up key to move the monkey to the right which is what step one does we want the up key to make the monkey jump so let's change this to this new function jump now notice that this time there's these parentheses empty set of parentheses open print fees and immediately close parentheses right after jump that's because the jump function doesn't take any inputs so the step function takes an input how many steps to take the jump function doesn't and in coffee script if a function doesn't take any inputs you have to use these open and close parentheses right after it but that's all we need to do to modify the code here so we'll check it and we'll run it and then the monkey comes over here and he jumps up and he got the banana all right um these next two exercises are not really based on coding um in addition to the sprites in the game world we can make it more interesting by adding tiles to the game world um to create stair steps and challenges and things for the monkey to move around on to do that nothing in the code window instead we're going to come over here to the game window and use the paintbrush icon and we can choose any of these tiles we like i'll keep using the same one and then just paint some extra tiles on the screen to make it easier for the monkey to get up there to the banana so i've already done that i should be ready to go let's run the game and the monkey should be able to climb up there these new steps and get the banana one more time all right and then one more quick challenge before we finish up with this um in addition to the paint brush there is an eraser tool here so we see there's an obstacle we have all these tiles we can put in the monkey's way so to make this challenge solvable we need to erase these now obviously in designing an actual game you wouldn't add tiles just so you could erase them later but you make mistakes near dividing or putting towels on the screen for the eraser tool is used for removing those so now the monkey has a path we press run and he's got the banana so uh we have gone through those pretty quickly um if you're doing this in the classroom it's probably gonna take your students a little bit longer but if they will read the instructions you see that's pretty much step by step and they should be able to get through uh these exercises almost as quickly as i let you do them but let them take the time to kind of learn and digest the computer science as they're playing so with that i'm going to turn it back over to mark and let him continue the presentation all right thanks again jay um so with the time that we have remaining i want to get to the part uh the meats and potatoes of game creation this is the part that i know many of you are already consider yourself the most popular teacher in your school based on the nature of what you teach uh but if you're not already you for sure will be the most popular teacher once you begin the game builder part of our course so game builder needs to be assigned to your students for them to access it so if you have a question on how to do that just make sure you leave us a comment uh in the chat and then someone will answer that for you all right so let's imagine for a minute you've completed the entire platformer course so what have you actually done what you've done is you started by using the lesson plan video to kind of hype them up and show them what it is that they can make you're showing them the possibilities then through those exercises the ones that jay just walked us through they've learned how to make those games and by this point when they reach game builder they're going to be able to showcase what they've learned and then again combine it with creativity so as our teacher i find that this is a perfect way to assess their progress another reason that you're going to find that this is the ideal next step after coding adventure is for those of you that like to see collaboration and creativity in your classroom then get ready because it's going to go through the roof once you introduce game builder and then honestly if you forget all those other bullet points there just know that your students are going to love game builder because it's just plain and simple a lot of fun so this is a good question when should you assign it and to get the most out of game builder i strongly suggest that you complete at least one of the game creation courses if not more you definitely want to set your students up for success and we believe that this is the best way to ensure that all right so you may be wondering uh where you can find game builder so for those of you that have not accessed it already uh from your teacher homepage you would scroll below your classrooms and then you'll find the platform under in the creativity section and here it is game builder create your own games so you'll start by clicking on create games and then you'll see the green start coding button here so here i see a couple of options or a few options actually for a game template but what i'm going to do is i'm going to choose the default platform because i chose i'm going to choose default because the other five actually have prewritten code in them so it's a small amount but it is there and if i really want to dive in i really want to drive home the assessment aspect of this platform that we have i think it's best to have these students start with a blank slate so let's go ahead and start okay so the first thing i want to do when i get to the game builder is always just take a look at the layout here it's pretty minimal right uh the left side of the screen is going to be divided with our code editor uh taking up the most real estate and then we have some buttons and tabs sitting just below that still on the left side now you can find the stage on the upper right and our design and object tabs in the lower array now staying on the right side of the screen i want to point out something that's a relatively new feature that's going to be so helpful to everybody that's listening today i know the term game changer can be overused but this is like a literal game changer right so here next to my avatar what i have are reference cards now these reference cards will allow students to refer back to the concepts that they've learned in the course and they'll also be able to see example code so i'll actually show you how that looks here so again you know we're saying here's a blank slate but we don't want to leave them out to dry so here are some of your training rules if you will you can also search for uh content in our search bar here with the reference cards and then the last thing i want to point out here on the screen is our save and share buttons you definitely want to make sure that your students are aware of the save button to maintain their progress so those are next to the green run button at the top of the screen um okay so let's see how this process works so right here i'm being asked to add a sprite or widget uh to start the game coding so i'll do just that and i'll keep it simple for the purposes of this webinar we'll just do monkey and we will add a banana as well so two sprites and again um jay went over some really good information but maybe i didn't keep a technology notebook or maybe i didn't write this down what i can do is refer to the reference cards to sort of kickstart uh what it is that i want to do so i remember he said something about an on key and then when i search for it i get the definition as well as an example so i'm actually going to give myself a shortcut copy the example paste it and then again this is a very rudimentary game uh but just to give you an idea how this would look so there it is i kind of i'm i'm on my way here a little bit right okay so i talked about saving and sharing and i do want to walk you guys through the process of sharing a game that you've created i'll click on the share button here so when a student decides to share or create a game they're going to encounter this popup window that has a couple of options so you see i can just make it private you know my game is very early on in the early stages i don't need to share with anybody i could also share it with my classroom and that would be my code monkey classroom so only those 20 to 25 students will be able to see that i can also get a link and that link could be copied and pasted into her browser i could possibly email it to my parents i think some schools have embedded it in their school home page but that's an option as well but also at the bottom here i see the option to publish it so with this i'll go ahead and click on that so i want you guys to keep in mind that any game that's shared will be vetted by us uh to make sure that they meet our community standards so you can sort of see here um sort of the guidelines that the students are going to be held to uh before their game is actually posted online all right so to view the games that have been shared um throughout the cold monkey global community we're going to use the the discover tab uh which is located on the home page so you see it there next to my challenges i'm going to take you there as well backing up a little bit before steven publishes the game you want to make sure they give it a name so we'll call this uh webinar and then the instructions in the description is pretty optional it's optional right now but again getting back to what we talked about assessing uh you can tie in literacy you can tie in the fact that hey it's just comprehension right if i can explain how to do something if i can clearly give directions uh then i i've showed that i have a mastery over this content so in my case i'm just gonna say feed the monkey employ the bad guys and then i click publish okay so we were getting into the discover tab again it's right next to my challenges so here when you get to the discover tab uh you'll see all the games that have made it through that vetting process that i just described and in addition to playing the games as they are so let's just kind of show you a little bit of those so in addition to playing the games as they are you also have the option to remix games which will sort of allow you to add your own slant to the games i also want to point out uh there's sort of a social element to this as well you can see how many times this game has been played you can see how many times people have liked it and we think about the population that we're teaching and those students in those age levels that's kind of you know where they are in their environment these days so that's another great piece that i like to point out all right so as we wrap up today i want to take a look back at the ground that we've covered um we've discussed our game builder package which courses make up that package we explain when to assign it jay walked us through that first lesson of platformer after that we took a look at creating our own games using game builder and then finally we looked at the discover tab to see where to find games that have been published by code monkey users from across the globe all right so i think that that is a great place to stop and open the floor to everyone that's here so with that let's go ahead and begin our q a so we had one question will this webinar be offered again at this time we do not have a scheduled date but we will be sending out the webinar after today's live viewing of it so to make sure that you also have that on hand for any note taking or anything that you need to take as far as that goes thank you leno if you have any other questions all right so if we don't have any other questions i want to thank everybody for their time uh and again like i said uh pdc pd information certificates will be emailed out to you guys as well as a recording thank you everybody and remember to write code catch bananas and save the world we'll see you guys next time thank you
