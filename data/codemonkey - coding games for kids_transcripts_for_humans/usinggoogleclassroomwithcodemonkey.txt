00:01 - hi thanks for joining this is a
00:03 - short demo on how to use google
00:06 - classrooms with
00:07 - code monkey so um this
00:10 - integration is available for teachers
00:12 - who use google classrooms
00:14 - um and they would need to log into
00:16 - codemonkey using their google
00:18 - account using the google single sign-on
00:21 - option
00:22 - and with this integration after logging
00:26 - using google as a teacher you are able
00:29 - to
00:30 - import your google classrooms onto
00:32 - codemonkey with the students
00:35 - in them of course and you will continue
00:38 - to manage your student roster on google
00:41 - classrooms
00:42 - you'll have option to access all the
00:44 - classroom features
00:46 - but managing your student list will
00:50 - continue to be through google classroom
00:54 - with this integration you're also able
00:56 - to post coding adventure assignments to
00:58 - your
00:59 - google classrooms there's currently no
01:02 - full integration with google classroom
01:04 - assignments
01:06 - or any stream functionality
01:09 - [Music]
01:10 - so i'll show you that um later on uh
01:13 - your students after you've
01:15 - imported your classroom they'll be able
01:17 - to log in to codemonkey
01:19 - um using their um google accounts
01:22 - um and once you've imported your
01:25 - classrooms your study
01:26 - students already belong to their
01:28 - classroom so they don't need to do any
01:30 - action
01:31 - to to join it themselves
01:35 - so let's start so i'm going to sign up
01:39 - to code monkey using my google account
01:42 - so just
01:42 - make sure you use the google account
01:45 - with which you are using google
01:47 - classrooms
01:49 - i'm going to click on google single sign
01:51 - on so i'm going to choose the google
01:53 - button here
01:58 - and i'm going to choose the account
02:01 - that i use
02:05 - that i'm going to use for this purpose
02:07 - that's where i have my
02:10 - google classrooms
02:13 - great so a few things i need to
02:17 - fill in here before i proceed
02:24 - and now i have signed up to code monkey
02:26 - i've created my
02:27 - teacher account let's choose my avatar
02:35 - as a new teacher i get a 30 days trial
02:39 - with an option to add up to 30 students
02:43 - with access to some of our content i
02:46 - already have an example classroom which
02:48 - i can check out but
02:50 - what i really like to do is import my
02:52 - students so they can start
02:55 - accessing code monkey so i'm going to
02:57 - click on create new classroom and i can
02:59 - either create a classroom
03:01 - or i can choose to import my classrooms
03:04 - from google so i'm going to choose that
03:06 - option
03:06 - and first thing i need to do is to give
03:10 - code monkey permissions to access
03:12 - my google classrooms by clicking on
03:14 - connect
03:15 - with google classroom and you would only
03:18 - need to do this
03:19 - once and if you won't
03:22 - give this permission then you will not
03:26 - be able to
03:27 - import your classrooms and it shows you
03:30 - what this authorizations allow to
03:33 - view your google classrooms view your
03:36 - roster and i'm going to click on allow
03:40 - and i can now continue to import my
03:43 - classroom so clicking again on import
03:46 - from google and now i have the option to
03:49 - choose my classroom so
03:50 - this drop down menu would only give me
03:53 - classrooms that i manage
03:55 - on google classroom so if you want to
03:59 - import your colleagues classroom you
04:01 - first need to make sure that they add
04:03 - you as a teacher
04:04 - um onto these classrooms
04:08 - okay so i'm going to choose a classroom
04:12 - and next up i'm going to choose the
04:13 - subscription i want to connect this
04:15 - classroom to
04:16 - this would determine what type
04:19 - of access my students get so
04:22 - for now i'm going to connect them to my
04:24 - teacher trial because that's the only
04:27 - access i have as a new teacher and
04:30 - that's really the default here
04:32 - and i'm going to click on create my
04:34 - classroom
04:35 - great so my classroom has been imported
04:38 - i can see
04:39 - the classroom right here in my
04:41 - classrooms list
04:42 - uh if you want to import additional
04:44 - classrooms you would need to
04:46 - do that i just repeat the action again
04:50 - and choose the classroom you would like
04:52 - to import
04:54 - great so i'm going to click on the
04:56 - classroom
04:59 - and go to the students tab just to see
05:02 - the students that were imported along
05:05 - with the classroom and
05:06 - just one student that's the student who
05:09 - i have
05:09 - in my google classroom as you can see i
05:12 - can't really do
05:13 - any actions because like i said you
05:15 - would manage your roster
05:17 - through google classroom you can see
05:19 - this sync
05:20 - classroom button on top so anytime you
05:24 - make any changes to your roster
05:26 - on google classrooms just click the sync
05:28 - button and it will sync
05:30 - the roster also on code monkey
05:35 - if you're looking to add additional
05:37 - teachers to your classrooms on code
05:39 - monkey
05:40 - just scroll down here under co-teachers
05:43 - you're
05:43 - able to import additional teachers
05:47 - as co-teachers on your classroom
05:48 - basically
05:50 - they would have um access to the
05:53 - classroom dashboard
05:55 - and access to the courses as well
05:58 - you would click here to choose the
06:00 - teacher you would like to add
