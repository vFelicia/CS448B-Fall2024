hi guys i hope you guys are doing good during this um tough time of quarantine so i guess you guys are bored by now so i decided to make an another youtube video on um a tutorial for a game on scratch it's a very simple game it's basically the maze game um this game is going to have two stages an easy stage followed by a hard stage i hope you guys enjoy if you have any questions about scratch watch our tutorial video that we've uploaded on youtube or you can dm us on instagram or facebook so let's get right into it so um in this entire game i'm gonna be using five stars two bombs one doctor that's gonna move around and complete the maze and the final uh place to reach is going to be this virus so here's what the doctor looks like all that it has to do is move around and navigate to the final place the current virus by itself is the final destination that the doctor has to reach um these bombs um these are two bombs and um they will appear every 25 seconds and they're just very fun um aspect of the game these stars um they add a thousand points to the entire game just for fun um i also have a mace as one of the sprites so that that the doctor can go through it and um also these are the two three backgrounds that i'm using this is for the first the easy part of the maze um this is for the second part of the mace and this is the final background which has the word congratulations on it um i will be using all of these a lot throughout the game and in my code so um here's just a small introduction about them as you guys can see i've already set up my entire game um i have a maze i have my stars which would give us extra points in the game um i also have bombs which would appear in 25 seconds and i have my uh final uh place to go which is the virus this is basically a doctor going through a virus and um yeah that's the game so i'm going to start coding the game now um my very first step is going to be coding the doctor's movement so i'm going to start by getting one flag is clicked then i would want it to go to the beginning position which is 212 and negative 160 and then i'm going to make a forever loop because we want the movement to keep going and then if um touching if we want down up arrow first so if up arrow is click then we want our y to change by three sorry to change y by three and then we move to the next costume the next costume basically doesn't do much it just stays exactly the same but if you want to like change your customer change the person from like a doctor to maybe say a nurse or something you can do that also now i'm going to change the i'm going to say if touching color black because that's the color of my face if your maze is another color please feel free to put the color that your maze is and i'm going to change y by negative 3 so that it works i'm going to do the same for um all the other keys what i can do is i don't need to redo the whole thing over and over again i can just copy and um copy the entire code and paste it so it just like eases my job i don't have to keep doing it over and over again so i have my forever loop followed by this code and then this i'm going to change my up arrow to down arrow this time change y but i'm going to say negative 3 and i'm going to make this positive three again i'm gonna paste in the other one and i'm gonna put it over here i'm gonna say if now right arrow keys click and then i'm going to this time because it's right and left we want it to be x instead of y so i'm going to say change x by positive 3 and likewise over here i'm going to make it change x by negative three i'm going to delete this and then i'm gonna pull this out copy and paste put this back in put this down make this if left arrow is pressed change the x to negative 3 and change the y to positive 3 so that would move that would uh manage the movement of our doctor to go left right up or down now i'm going to do the movement of um oil controlling our time and score because um that's a fun thing you do not need to necessarily do it but i just wanted to have something fun that's why i did it also for score and time i have basically made my own variables because they didn't have variables of show score and time but if you want you you don't need to necessarily do this but i just did it because i think you can learn something new i'm gonna make the entire game for 60 seconds so um you can it's like a challenge factor to the game i would also want to know the person's name just in case you'd like to see who the who is playing you can adjust your scoring time uh bars then i'm gonna make a forever loop i'm gonna put it over here uh if you have any questions please let us know on instagram we will be more than happy to help you um then i'm gonna also went forever look so uh i would want my time to keep decreasing by one second and then um after it decreases by one second i would want it to wait for a second and then decrease again um then i would add an if statement so and then uh which means that if my time is equal to zero so if my time is up um i'm gonna drag and drop the time over here then i'm gonna say hide my variable time because i don't want it to be seen over there i mean you can skip this step if you want but i like to keep it this way and then i'm going to say stop all because as soon as the time gets over i want my entire game to stop because then there's oh so you cannot continue so the main point of the game is to finish everything before your time is up um next i am going to be doing is uh how do i move to my second stage of the maze so i'm gonna say if my doctor touches the coronavirus on the top i would want it to switch background backdrop because i have two backdrops um to back i want to switch to backdrop two and then uh i would want the first half of the game to stop so i'm going to say stop all uh now for the movement of the doctor to go to the starting position i'm going to say when flag is clicked then i'm going to i would want the background to switch to background too um oh now i wanted to switch to background one so when you start if there's the background once visible and then i would want my sprite which is my doctor to go back to its original position and then um i will be starting a forever loop um an if statement and then i would say if touching corona virus uh yep then i would want it to go back go to the up a different position so in order to see what the exact position is i'm going to check it out i'm going to see what the position is it seems to be like it's to 12 and negative 163 oh yeah 12 and negative 163 i'm going to say so this is going to be go to 12 and negative 163 and um and i want my background to switch to background too you could you you do not need to switch it but i switched it just for fun so here's our code for um the doctor don't worry if you guys haven't caught up yet i mean i can um i will link the entire game down in the description below so you guys can access it whenever you want then i'm gonna have and i'm gonna write the code for my coronavirus so at the beginning i would want it to be at the position that it is right now um and then i'm gonna say then um i'm gonna say when my backdrop switches which is the second half of the game i would want to move it to a different position so the different position is going to be negative 16 and 1 3 8 and it's not always the same values guys so you have to adjust it and see you can see it over here x and y um but i've already checked it so i know what the values are um i'm going to say if touching doctor so when karana viruses his doctor i would wanted to switch to backdrop 3 which is my final background to have a message like congratulations and then once the message is displayed i want my entire game to stop so i'm gonna put stop now comes the code for the bomb uh both the bombs are gonna have the same code so the code is very simple you can literally copy paste it so first you do click uh flag and then i want my time to my bomb to be hidden first um so that it appears every 25 seconds then i'm going to start a forever loop which should have which will say first i have to wait for 25 seconds because i want my bomb to appear every 25 seconds and then i'm going to say show uh it's very simple and the second half of the code is gonna be when backdrop switches to backdrop two and then i'm just gonna copy and paste the entire code because it's literally that so as you can see my code is already done for the bomb it was simple and sweet i've done it for my other bomb already now i'm gonna do the code for the stars because when when the star is clicked you basically get uh 1000 points extra so i want my star to be seen at all the time so i'm going to say when flag is clicked then i'm going to press show then start a forever loop say forever and then i'm going to say i'll have an if statement and then it's going to be if touching doctor i want to change my uh change my score by 1000 and i would also want to add five seconds to uh my time just to give like a plus factor to the game then um i want it to be hidden after the starts click because then there's no point clicking the start over and over again and then i'm gonna say stop but instead of stop all i'm gonna make it only stop this sprite so now um as you can see the one half of the code is done it's uh the second half is is basically the same all i have to do is make the step back drop two and copy and paste and and whoops sorry guys okay oh my god yeah ah there you go my bad um show and i'm gonna just do it this way so our code for the star is also done i've done the same thing for my second third fourth and fifth star so we don't waste too much time you it's basically the same there's no change at all um now the last code is going to be the code for the maze the code for them is extremely extremely simple so i'm just going to say one flag is quick then i'm going to say switch costume to my second one which is which i've named as b in this case i don't know why but i just named it b and i would want it to go okay i wanted to stay wherever it is or i would want it to go no i would want it to go to whatever position is given over here one second guys i need to what is it sixteen and zero on my back sixteen zero and sixteen oh it's sixteen zero four both okay so i'm gonna let it stay at 16 and zero um and then i'm going to say one backdrop switches up another forever loop followed by switch costume to be and my last code is going to be go to 16 0 so i mean 16 negative 6 so as you guys can see our game is already ready now hey thanks for watching and once again my name is riya makaria and leave a like below if you would like to code this amazing game and hit the
