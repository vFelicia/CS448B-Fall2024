hi my name is sarah and today i'm going to be showing you how to create a mouse trail with a sprite and also how you can make patterns on the screen with the trail that you make okay the first step is to create a sprite that will follow around your mouse so i chose a ball for my sprite i'm gonna go over here to costumes and change it to blue because i like blue and then you can make it any color you want you can pick any sprite and i'm going to say when the green flag is clicked i'm going to go to the mouse pointer then i'm going to add in a forever loop to make sure that the code continues to run and i'm going to say that it's always the sprite is always going to point towards the mouse pointer and it's going to move whatever distance it is from the mouse pointer so it's always moving to the mouse pointer and i'm also going to add in a control that's going to make it wait a little bit um that's enough time it's a very short time but basically this make sure your mouse isn't on top of the sprite when you're moving it around and that sprite is a little bit behind it so there we go okay the second step now is to create a clone to create clones of the sprite to make a trail behind it so we need to add in this block where it will create a clone of myself i'm going to add it to this forever block and just put it at the top and then we're going to add this new block when i start as a clone and then i'm going to add this repeat block and i'm going to say repeat 50 times and then i'm going to go over here to looks and this is what's going to create the trail and i'm going to say oops i'm going to change the ghost effect by 10. and this makes it a little bit transparent yeah there we go so now you've created a trail and another thing that i want to do is i want to change the color so i'm going to also add a change color effect and you can make it by 10 it will look like this or you can make it by make it 25 let's try again the colors are different it's more like a rainbow so you can play around with those the third and final step of this is to add a pen extension so that you can create a pattern with your trailing sprite so we're gonna go down here in the bottom left corner and you just click on this pen extension sorry and then we're going to go to control this is really fun and interesting so we're going to first go to control and you have this function here if then so um we don't want it to be drawing on the screen like whenever we move our mouse around so i'm gonna say only if the mouse is pressed down then it will draw something and over here there's this block stamp and this means whenever you press your mouse whatever like image is on the screen it will be sort of stamped onto the background so it's like you're drawing something and then if else i'm going to say pen up so it's not drawing anything anymore and so you can see when i click it it leaves that trail so i'm clicking my mouse here and here and that's what it looks like and then another important thing is that we erase the screen um once it starts again so that when we restart it it will have a new clean blank slate um thank you so much for watching and i hope you enjoyed and i hope you have a lot of fun bye
