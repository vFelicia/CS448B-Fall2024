hello everyone welcome back to our youtube channel hope you guys are coping well during quarantine um as you guys know we've done quite a few series and stimulated concepts on this youtube channel um i just wanted to give you a brief summary before we introduce our new series that we're going to start so let's begin okay so this is just a quick summary of coding and programming um you've seen the craze for learning code but what exactly is coding coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software apps and websites your browser your os the apps on your phone facebook this website google slides they're all made with code if you don't know the first thing about coding you've come to the right place we've put together a bunch of videos and um series to help you understand coding and the different languages that are available for you to code for different uses um so why do we code outside of the implication of coding which looks good on your resume for your university um coding actually does boost skills which are actually useful for most jobs uh problem solving and logical logics are like the two main or the most important reasons why people code um doing such codes activates your left side of the brain which is basically your problemsolving brain which would help you later think faster in um stimulated subjects at least um what what is coding used for simply foot coding is used for communication with computers uh people use coding to give computers and other machine instructions on what actions to perform further we use it to program the websites apps and other technologies that we use or interact with on a daily basis um some coding jobs uh there are a bunch of coding jobs that you can do um so in the software development which is basically a massive field with plenty of career opportunities um there's coding like software engineering cloud engineering and database developer for artificial intelligence coding there is um machine learning engineering deep learning engineering data scientists and mobile development and our final category is web development which includes front and back developer and ux developer um to know more about these i think it's the best if you google it because we don't want to go too much into it um now usually when we think about coding we associate it mostly to stem related subjects but i think it is important for us to understand how coding is used in medical fields today medical coding professionals help ensure that codes are applied correctly during medical billing process which includes abstracting the information from a documentation assigning the appropriate codes and creating a claim to be paid by insurance carriers accurate coding is critical an incorrect code becomes a permanent part of a patient's record it can affect a patient's healthcare and delay physician reimbursement because the patient's claim may be rejected due to an incorrect code um so coding is also used for making all the technologies um like ct scans and um ultrasound and stuff like that because like machines work based on the code that we give them so in order for that to work coding is very important and putting in the right code is more important so uh you could take coding and then go to a medical field and maybe do bioengineering which would help you make equipment that could be used for surgeries um that'd be it thank you so much for watching our video please follow us on all our social media platforms and subscribe to our channel for more videos bye
