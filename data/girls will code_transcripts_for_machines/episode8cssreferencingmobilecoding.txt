hey everyone today i'm going to be teaching you how to use basic css on your html file through the mobile coding app decoder so first off i made my html document and the gwc then within the body i added the h1 hello world so if i press play you can see my blank document with hello world on top on the top left so in this video we're going to be talking about three types of ways you can add css we have inline internal and external so the first way is inline usually use inline if you want to apply styles to a single html element so for instance if i wanted to make hello world blue within here i can add the word style equals then quotation marks within the quotation marks i can then add whatever style attributes i want to apply such as font colors background and many other things so we're going to keep it simple and just make hello world blue so what i can then do is put color semicolon then so that i'm finished i can press the play button and as you can see hello world is now color blue so the next way you can apply css onto your html document is through using internal css so you would do this by making a section called style within the inter within the head section then in this section you can reference whatever element you have on your document and then declare whatever style attributes you want to apply to it so for instance if i want to change the color of hello world again what i can do is put h1 put the brackets and within these brackets i can put whatever style attributes i want to apply so if i want to make the color yellow for instance i can put in yellow semicolon then you have to close the style section so here if i want to see what i have i can press the play button and as you can see hello world is now yellow the last way you can apply css onto your html file is they're using external css so what external allows you to do is it allows you to define the style for many html pages all within one css file so in this docu in this html file if i want to apply css using an external file i can go onto.css on the decoder page i can then reference the element i want to change the style of so once again it's h1 then within these brackets i put next to h1 i can then put whatever style i want so once again i'm going to change the color to red so now i can go back to my html document and when i press play the words hello world will be now will now be in red so those are the three different ways you can add css onto your html file and i hope this video helps
