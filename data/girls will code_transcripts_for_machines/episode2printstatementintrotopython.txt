hi everyone this is the second video of the intro to python series and in this video we are going to be talking about variables and data types when printing things out in python we are providing text that we want to be printed out text in python is considered a specific type of data called a string it's called a string because it's a series of characters so in the previous video when we printed the following statement we were actually printing out a string a string is denoted by quotation marks so everything between these quotation marks is part of the string and as mentioned in the previous video you can use double quotes or single quotes but make sure you use both you use the same on each end so here we have some data of type string and that data is my name if i wanted to store this data so i can use it later on i need to store it in a variable a variable as its name suggests also allows you to deal with data that changes over time so in this example i am going to be defining a variable called name and i'm going to assign it a string of my name so i'm going to do name which is the name of our variable i'm going to put the equal sign which means assign this value to this variable so now i have my name stored in the memory of my computer and to access it i use the name of my variable so in this case the name of our variable is name so whenever you create a variable the name you set for it should describe what data is stored inside the variable in a concise manner so in this case as i'm storing my name i call the variable name so here is the general syntax of creating a variable you put the variable name you then put an equals to sign and then you put the data that you want to store inside the variable so in this previous example over here our variable name was name there's our equal sign and the data that we want to store inside it is a string containing my name so now if i wanted to print out the data that is stored inside this variable name i put a print statement and inside the print statement i would put the name of the variable and the name of the variable over here as we've defined is name so now what that's going to do is when i run this code after saving it as you can see it prints out locks and that's because on line 12 where we say print name what the computer does is it looks at the value stored inside this variable which is laksh the string and it's going to print out the string so that's exactly the same as doing this but the beauty of variables is that it allows you to deal with data that changes over time so now let's say that i change my name to reassign a different value to the previous variable that we've created what i'm going to do first is type the variable name so the name of our variable is name so name and then we're going to put an equals to sign just like we do when we assign an initial value and now what i'm going to do is type in my new name so let's just say aryan and now what i do is if i print out name print out the value stored inside the variable name what that's going to do now is as you can see first sorry let me save the code first so as you can see previously it printed out lux when we printed out this statement because at line 12 the value stored inside our variable was still locked but by the time we reach line 16 because in line 14 we've reassigned the value to of our variable it's now going to print out the new value so now we've looked at strings but there are also other data types we're now going to look at the two main other data types integers and booleans now an integer is exactly what its name suggests it's an integer it's a number if you want to store something like your h or the date or any other number you use the data type integer just like we did with strings we first write the variable name so since i want to store my age i'm going to name the variable h but you know you can name these variables whatever you like but it's always good practice to give a variable a name that describes what data is stored inside of it so since i want to store my age i'm going to call my variable age but once again you could just use any value for this you know but i'm going to go with age and just like we did with strings what we first do is create an equal to and what that does is whatever value we put after it's going to assign that value to the variable so since my age is 16 i'm going to type 16. so you know as you noticed earlier in strings we use quotation marks but with integers you do not use anything you just type the variable name put the equal sign and then type the number you want to store the last data type we will discuss is booleans these are very simple they just have two possible values true or false so if i wanted to store whether it is raining outside or not since there are only two possibilities raining or not raining we will use booleans just like the previous two we first write the variable name so i'm going to call this variable is raining and then i'm going to set it equal to either true or false and as of now since it's not raining outside i am going to name it false and once again you do not use quotation marks otherwise that would create a string one important thing to note is that we write the true or false with capital t and capital f if you write true or false with lowercase t or f like i'm doing right now that is going to be incorrect so we want to make sure that we put capital f for false and capital t for true once again just to recap what we want to do is whenever we create a variable we first want to give it a name so we give a variable name a variable name and then we put our equals to and then we put the data that we want to store inside the variable it could be a string it could be an integer like such or it could be true or even false so one thing i'm going to be asking you to think about right now is whether there's any difference between the following two lines besides the variable names and i'm going to discuss the answer to this in the beginning of the next video so another thing i'm going to ask you to do is try and attempt these two questions i'm going to be discussing the answer at the end of this video so before you look at the answer please try and do it by yourself so now i'm going to be discussing the answers the first one is printing your name and age using variables so first let's create our variables you know the first thing we want to do when we create variables is give our variable a name so i'm going to call this variable my name and set it equal to a string of whatever so you guys type in your name and i type in locks and then the next is our age so i'm going to create a variable called my age and set it equal to an integer because your age is a number so 16 in my case and now i'm going to print both these variables so the first is our print statement and then we put our opening and closing parentheses and then we put the name of our variable over here so my name to print out the first value and to print out the second value we put in my age the next question is creating a variable called older than 12 and setting it to true if you are and false if you're not so like we did in the previous question we first defined the variable's name so in this case the question tells us what name we want to give our variable so let's type in the name that the question asks us older than 12 and now we set it equal to if we are older than 12 or not in my case i'm going to set that equal to true and there you go these are the answers to the exercise i hope you guys enjoyed this video stay tuned for the next one and leave any questions you have in the comments below thank you for watching
