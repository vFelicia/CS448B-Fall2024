hi guys welcome back to our youtube channel um this video is basically a brief introduction slash recap of different languages and um the differences between these languages um it's just to give you a brief understanding before we move ahead with all our different coding series so let's get started okay um so just an introduction to languages and their differences um so there are about 700 programming languages including esoteric coding language um that's not a very important term right now oops so we won't define it um other sources that only list notable languages still count up to impressive 245 languages so those are languages that are used on a daily basis of all around the world computer programming languages um are used to communicate um instructions to a computer they are based on certain syntactic and semantic rules which define the meaning of each of the program language constructs uh here this is basically a list of the top 20 of the many languages that are available um the list is not the top 20 in order but it's just the top 20 in general um now coming to the most used language across the world i think the most used language across the world would be python evidently 31.2 um so the benefits of um python is python is widely regarded as a programming language that's easy to learn due to its simple syntax a large library of standards and toolkits and integration with other popular programming languages such as c and c plus plus in fact it is the first language the students learn in a lying program design program um it is a very popular programming language especially among startups and therefore python skills are high demand um so python is commonly used in um in um in a wide variety of applications including artificial intelligence financial services and data science uh social media sites such as instagram and pinterest are also built on python which is um it just shows how much python is used across the world um we've also done a series on basic python coding on our channel so please go watch it to understand and learn more about python um now up till now what we've covered on this on our youtube channel so if you look at our youtube page this is a screenshot of our youtube page uh you'll see that um we have covered python um scratch and we as coding languages and we also have a series of um women in stem which basically takes you through all the successful women um in stem field and how they grew and what they have accomplished so far um now um so now that um you know what languages are i'm just gonna introduce and tell you what our next series is going to be about so our next series is basically um using a mobile coding app to code and um the mobile coding app that we're going to be using is decoder very simple amazing love it easily uh you can use it very easily um it's a very basic and a very um nice and simplistic um app for mobile coding and you can't use it for big things but for a basic level for just understanding and learning purposes this is possibly one of the best apps that you could use um very easy to download you can download it on all ios or android devices um and it's completely free so the two main languages that we will be covering in our upcoming mobile coding series is html and css and to get a more understanding of what these two languages are and they're used on a daily basis please have a look at our next youtube video um that's it for now thank you so much for watching again please follow us on all our social media sites and subscribe to our youtube channel for more amazing content thank you bye
