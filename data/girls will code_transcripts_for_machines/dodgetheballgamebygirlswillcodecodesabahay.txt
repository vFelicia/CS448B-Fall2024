today we're gonna learn how to make a simple dodge the obstacle game in scratch which will look something like this there will be balls that fall from the top of the screen and our player has to move left and right to avoid getting hit by any of these balls so let's get started the first step is to create our player i'm gonna paint my own sprite because i want to use a simple rectangle as our player at the start of the game we want our player to be at the bottom of the screen so the first thing i'm going to do is when green flag is clicked i'm going to add a go to block which goes to x equals 0 and y equals negative 155 and that's going to be the bottom of the screen the next step is to allow the players to move left and right we're going to do that with the left and right arrow keys so let's put that in so here we have those two if statements if the right key is pressed and if the left key is pressed we've put these statements inside of forever loop because we want the game to continuously check if either key is pressed so if the right key is pressed we want to move in the right words direction we're going to use the move steps block to do so the move steps block moves us in the direction that we're facing and since as you can see over here we're facing in the rightward direction to move to the right we're gonna have to move a positive number of steps so we'll move positive 10 steps and to move to the left we're going to have to move a negative number of steps so we're going to move negative 10 steps the next step is to create the balls that are going to fall from the top of the screen so what i'm going to do is go to choose a sprite and look for ball there it is and you know i'm going to make it slightly smaller so 75 that seems good in the game we want multiple balls to be falling so we're not going to do that by creating multiple sprites but what we're going to do instead is create multiple clones of this sprite the first thing i'm going to do is grab one green fly clicked and i'm going to put a forever loop and the first thing i'm going to put in is a wait statement and after that i'm going to put in create clone of myself so the value that we put inside this weight statement is what determines the rate at which the clone spawn so as of now it's one second so that means every second we're going to create a clone of this ball but what we want instead is that as the game progresses we want that the speed at which clones are created we want that speed to get faster so what we're going to do instead is create a variable called spawn speed and what we're going to do is we're going to put that inside the weight lock and now what we can do is that as the gain progresses we can reduce the value of spawn speed and that's going to increase the rate at which the clones spawn and we're also going to put a height block here because we don't want the original ball to stay on the screen we just want to use it for creating clones next what we're going to do is drag the when i start as a clone block and whatever code we put underneath this is going to be executed for each and every clone that we create so when a clone starts the first thing we want to do is show it because otherwise it would stay hidden because we applied a height of the original one so what we want is that every clone starts off at the top of the screen but we also wanted to start off at different x coordinates so what we're going to do first is go to motion and draft the go to block and we're going to set the y to 180 so that's the top of the screen but the x is going to be a range from negative 225 to positive 325 so that's the left end of the screen to the right of the screen so now as you can see we're going to have balls that spawn at the top of the screen but at different x coordinates the next step is to make the balls fall down we're going to do that with the move block but before that what we have to do is change the ball's direction from 90 to 180 so that it points downwards so now when we add our moves block the ball is going to fall straight down like we did with spawn speed we want the balls to fall down faster as the game progresses we're going to do that by creating another variable so we're going to call this variable ball speed so instead of having 10 steps inside this move block what we're going to do is have our variable which is called fall speed inside this move block so now what we can do is as the game progresses we can increase fall speed and therefore that's going to increase the speed at which the balls fall down now another thing that we want to add is their starting values so the starting value of fall speed and the starting value of spawn speed so i'm just going to start it off start spawn speed off at 0.75 and fall speed up at 6 but you guys can play around with the values and see what works the next step is to detect if any of the balls hit the player and we're going to do that with an if statement so if touching sprite one and we're going to put this inside when i start a clone inside this forever loop and so therefore it's going to check this for each and every clone so if any of the clones touch sprite one we're gonna end the game so stop all next let's create our score variable which will increase each time the player dodges the ball the player dodges the ball what that really means is that the ball goes below the player and we can detect that by comparing the y coordinates of the player and the ball if the y coordinate of the ball is less than the y coordinate of the player which is negative 1 155 we know that the player has dodged the ball so let's put that statement in code here is that if statement we're going to put it inside the forever loop of the clone block because we want it to be checked for each and every ball so if the y position of the ball of any ball is less than negative 155 we're going to increase the score by one so change score by one and then we're also going to delete the clone because we don't want the ball to just stay in the stay at the bottom edge we're going to delete it so let's delete this clone but we're also going to add a weight block over here because otherwise it's going to change the score by more than one we wanted to change it only by one so we'll add a weight block only for 0.0 0.05 seconds and that'll work and another thing that we want to do is at the beginning of the game we want to set the score to zero now let's write code that changes the two variables we created earlier fall speed and spawn speed over time so that the game gets harder so what i'm going to do first is when the green flag is clicked i'm going to create a forever loop in which i have a weight block and that weight block is going to be for 10 seconds and then what i'm going to do is change our variables by a certain amount i'm going to change spawn speed by by 0.05 so every 10 seconds the spawn speed will decrease by sorry so negative 0.05 so the spawn speed is going to decrease by 0.05 0.05 seconds and we're going to change our fall speed by by one that's going to make it faster every 10 seconds we need to create a limit to the values these variables can reach otherwise the game would get unplayable for example let's say if we continuously decrease spawn speed every 10 seconds there's gonna be a point perhaps two minutes or three minutes into the game where the spawn speed would reach such a slow such a low value that there's going to be balls spawning right after each other instantaneously that's going to make the game unplayable what we're going to do is create a limit to the values these variables can reach so i've created my limits here the spawn speed will not get less than 0.3 and the fall speed will not get greater than 12 and that's because for this first if statement the value of spawn speed will only decrease if it's greater than 0.3 if it's not greater than 0.3 the value will not decrease and therefore the value of spawn speed will remain at 0.3 and the same happens for fall speed in the second hd now we're pretty much done i'm just going to change a few things first i'm going to make this a large readout and the second thing i'm going to do is add some background music so i'm going to go to our player sprite and i'm going to go to sounds and i've already chosen one which is classical piano but you guys can browse to the gallery and see other sounds that you like what i'm going to do is when the green plant display i'm going to put a forever loop and i'm going to play play the sound until it's done and it's going to play and this is going to play the sound in a loop and there you have it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching if you have any questions please
