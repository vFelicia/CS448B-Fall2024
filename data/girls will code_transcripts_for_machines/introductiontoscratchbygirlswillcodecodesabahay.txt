hi guys I hope you guys are staying safe due to covert and you guys are having fun I know this is a very boring time and you need some fun activities to do so today I'm going to show you a very fun and interesting type of coding website just called scratch it's a very fun creative and easy language easy website and you can make whatever you want there are tutorials also for you to try different types of games so I'm just gonna give you a basic idea on every type of coding scratch and the different characters that you can add so please enjoy first as you can see there's already a sprite which is a character that they've given us in order for you to add more types of character you can go to the paint option and the pain option lets you make your own character for example i want to make a square so then it lets me lets me make a square and then i can color it whatever color I want in case you don't want to make a character on your own scratch provides some put some characters already so if you go to the chooser sprite there are a bunch of characters that you can see like cake cheese puffs you can choose whatever you want there are various categories for you to choose from so you can choose from that in case you want to add a background to it and then you can go to the choose a background option is the same as the character option you can either choose a background that they already have like harps and like stripes or you can create a background on your own or if you want to upload a background of your choice you can just go to upload you can download of image from Google and upload it for your background so these are the fun like the initial part of the entire code you can also add some sounds if you want for example they have various kinds of sounds if you want to add for example if you have a cat you can add a meow in case you want to try a new game here's something called tutorials which is over here and that if you click that then there are various options for you to explore from for example a pong game or maybe like animating a sprite or maybe and making your own name and you can click on those options and then they will give you a bunch of they will tell you what to do so you can do accordingly you can also edit your spray edit your game you can save it you can save by using the save option and so then you can also rename your sprite for example I will name it cat and then you can hide your sprite by clicking this button but then you can show it again then you can change the size also by making it 810 or making it say 1000 that's a huge one but I'm gonna keep it 100 because it's convenient you can change the initial starting point so for example if I put X is U and Y is zero it's just in the middle but if I put X as say 30 it starts from the right so it goes accordingly you can do it however you want now the different parts of this website are the coding it's very simple because you do not have to type a code on your own all that if you do is drag it and drop it on the screen and then you can just like join a bunch of codes this way and make a whole game and stuff so I'm going to now explain the different types of codes that you can use so the move 10 move 10 steps code is basically if you wonder if you want your character to move 10 steps right or 10 steps left so I say move 100 steps so it will move 100 steps to the right or the left then you have the turn so you can make your sprite turn in like certain directions say you can make it turn 90 degree so it'll turn out to the right if you make it turn 1 180 degrees it'll go upside down it won't show you over here because we don't have a starting code yet but I'm just explaining the different parts also you can make it go to random positions for example if you have a unicorn and you wanted to like pop up from like a random location you can do that you can also make your sprite go to a certain position in your entire screen because it zeros you is the center but if I make it same 30 and 45 then it will go 30 to the right and 45 up and it didn't then the your sprite automatically goes to the top right corner you can also change your xaxis which is your horizontal up position and even change your yaxis which is your vertical position there's an option called if on edge bounce that means that if your sprite is moving and it touches the edge you can you can make it bounce off all by itself rather than having a whole new code so that's a very cool thing that you can add you can also change you can also make your sprite rotate in a certain direction say clockwise or anticlockwise so if it's like a if it's like a boon or a Sun you can make it rotate so it looks more realistic um that's the basic like how to move a sprite from one place to have to move the character from one place to another now I will go to the part where you can make your characters say certain things say for example I press the say hello for two seconds so your sprite your character says hello for two seconds if I make it five seconds so then it'll say hello for five seconds if you want it to say hello for the whole time you can just press say hello and then it will say hello for however long New York game lasts you can also change this by saying let's say say cat for five seconds so then it'll say cat for five seconds and that's if you want it to say something if you wanted to think about something or some something like that saying you want it to think about kick so then you can press okay and then if you click it then it thinks for cake for two seconds and then it disappears you can also switch your costume which is you can switch how the sprite looks by moving it from costume one to costume two or you can change the background say for example you have a beach and then your sprite is walking and then you want it to go to like a desert a desert so then you can change switch background to sit the next background and then it will switch your background to whatever your next background is set as you can also change the size of your sprite because it's 100 right now and if you want it to become smaller you can change it to say 50 or if you want you to become bigger you can change us to 150 and you can also change the color or like the brightness of your sprites if example right now you can see it like it's properly you can see it fully but if you want it to become less if you wanted to become dull you can just change the color by say 25 or 50 and then it keeps getting lighter see if examples and change colors then it was initially yellow but then it changed to green you can also show and hide your sprite so if you say show and then it'll it'll appear for a certain time but then it will go off in whenever you want it you can just get the hide option and hide it you can go forward 1 layer 1 they're in the sense 1 like a particular distance and or like a background of stuff so you can make it go forward however much you want you can make it go backward also so that's the basic like what you want to try to look like or to think or say now I'll go to the sounds part which is a very fun fight because you can make your sprite or your character say different things and or sing different things so right now because it's a cat I am it's such meow but say if it's like a dog you can start change to like a bark or something you can also record your own sound if you want your character to represent something else you can record that that sound and added also that's also something very fun then you can stop your sounds by just getting to stop all sounds option then you can change the pitch which is the intensity or the like the shakiness of your character you can get it down or you can make gate make it go up you can change the volume of your character by increasing it or decreasing and depending on what you want so that's a fun thing about the sound that you can add to your character then comes to the events part which is one of the most important part of your entire code because it actually um is like a starting point for your entire code so this is when the green color flag is clicked which is this flag this is the most important thing in your entire code because only if this option is available can you start your entire game so only if I press this will the sprite change color or stuff like that so every code should have this at the beginning of it for it to work successfully and there are other options also that you can do when things those spaces fixify only only if I click the space bar with my entire code start working or when when you give the option of one backgrounds which is two so like when you only when you switch your background to something else will look cold start working or when you switch the volume to something else your cold starts working so these are different options to make your code to start working these are the most important codes and your entire code like an entire code for the game then you have the control options so for like how long you want an activity to last say for example wait one second so if you have your sprite moving and then you want it to stop for one second then you can do that you can make it stop first five second you can make it stop at ten seconds for however long you wanted to if you want the sprite to do the same activity a certain number of times you can just make it to repeat say for example I make it to repeat 15 times so then it'll repeat the same activity 15 times but if you want the activity to last forever and you don't not want to but like a certain number to it you can just say forever and the activity will keep going on until you press stop on your game so this is basically a forever option for you to keep picking the same thing happen over and over again now these are some difficult like some different things that you can do there they're gonna be a little bit complex for you so please pay attention to this this is something called as the ifthen so um in case I want the sprite to move let's say move up so then my option of your should be if up arrow is quick then move ten steps then the the ifthen option helps the sprite to do an activity all by itself so then if I say if okay if I do it this way so if the cat touches the color black okay let's set it to black then your sprite should say bounce back or then move ten steps or whatever you want so this is very important because you are telling what the sprite should do so keep that in mind and if you wanted to do two or more activities at once or like say this is so if it touches if it touches the black color then you can make it move ten steps to the right if it does not touch the black color you can move it ten steps to the left so this is basically an if or else option so you tell it to do something but then if it doesn't if it doesn't fulfill the requirements then it does something else so that's a pretty cool thing that you can do so you don't have to type two different things you can just do one ifelse and make it one easy thing for you to do um you can also repeat an activity for however long you want say we can repeat the activity you can repeat like the rotation of your sprite until it touches back color or you can do stuff like that or you can wait for the sprite to do something until it touches black color you can ask the sprite can move ten steps to the left until it touches black other and then ask it to bounce back say that it can bounce back so that's something that you would want to think about doing so these are some important but fun and useful things but um scratch now you can make your entire game stop at a point which so this is called the star ball option where you can make everything stop or you can make only the sprite stop or you can make for example if you have three or more sprites and you can uh you can make all the others right stop and just make one sprite go at a time or so basically this is like a control option for you to like control the movement and control what the sprite doesn't stop it whenever you want then you have the sensing options so the sensing options are basically it's another cool and fun thing you would want to add so if you see there's touching mouse printer touching color if color changes today's it distance us okay so um if touching mouse pointer or let's just put it if touching edge then you can do it this way so if your sprite this is the edge then it moves five steps to the back or if it touches the edge it moves five steps up you can you can you can set it and that arm sense if just the way I told you before if it touches a particular color say like green yellow black blue or whatever is your background or something then you can make it go back or bounce back accordingly or move in whatever place you want if the color of the object changes from say purple to like yellow then it moves up down or whatever again and you can also ask for yours for the name of the person that's playing so for example this option would ask the person's name at the beginning of the game and only if the person answers can they move ahead so when you do this option and you have to enable the answer option just like by putting a click so if you ask ask what's your name they say for example your name is Ana so then it will put your name over here and then you can start playing your game so then you know who is playing the game at what time and stuff like that then you can also um you can also put this option where if you want the sprite to move up then you can press the up arrow so if the upper squid move sprite up if the down arrow is quick move sprite down if the left camera right or anything like that is click you can do it in that way there are also letters that you can click for it to move if I click space and maybe it can jump or you can bounce and stuff like that so um that's also very important thing because you are you want the sprite to move in the way you want so you have to ensure that you will you choose a right option and you know what you're choosing you can also set a timer for your game for example I want the game to be for one minute so then you have to enable the timer option over here as you can see because the green button is pressed so the timer is going on if I because the green button is pressed and will keep going on for however long you your game lasts or however long you want it to last you can also add like a year to your game because of 2020 so then we can say your 2020 and you can add a username so for example if your name is um let's see okay my name is realloc arya so then my user name would be Rhea and ur score acharya because that's what I have used to log in to scratch so you can add that also then sums the operators which is also another important part that you would want to take into account you can divide like you know how you add subtract multiply or divide numbers you can do that even over here so for example you can add two or more things at the same time so for example I can add um let's go up and see what we can add okay so what I can do is I can add like same timer and loudness in the same place so then while it's counting for the timer will also take the sound or the sound intensity of the entire project also into account so you can do stuff like that you can add numbers together or you can subtract or divide or multiply numbers for the object for the sprite to move you can also enable the option of pick a random number from 1 to 10 so you can ask the user to pick a random number from 1 to 10 and then depending on what number they pick they can move the spread in that way or something like that then you have the option of above 50 greater than 50 less than 50 or equal to 50 so that's safe though if the timer is 50/50 is equal to 50 then you can say and/or if you say if the timer is 60 is equal or you want the thing to say 60 is greater than 50 because it's not because it's true you can also make the timer stop so that's some fun things you can do you can also join two or more sprites if you want or to wear more letters to letters together by using this join option so you can join say Apple and bananas if you have an apple and a banana over here as the sprite you can join them together or you can you can ask for what letter um for example the first letter in Apple is a so you can say some stuff like that also to add like a like a fun pipe to your entire project or your game lastly you can this is a very important optional so it's called the variable option so if you want to like create your own variable variable in the sense your own say tasks or like an operation or like a control you can do that also say for example I want the strike to move um slant like I want this pipe to move 30 degrees to the right or rotate so then I can create a variable called rotate and then I can give it certain tasks to do and it's the same as the thing that we learned over here in control as for how long you want it to last or for like what time like repeat so then I can do that also by sing set the variable to last person 10 seconds or you can change the variable to last for 10 seconds and stuff like that so that's also an easy option for you to access if you don't find what you want to find I'll be here for you to add other stuff like if you want to add something of fun also to it that's not there above you can do that that you can add like a music or like a pen or video sensing or texttospeech this this enables you to have like a oneonone interaction with your user so you can do stuff like that also it's fun it's easy it's nice it's cool one last thing that I would want to talk about is the shape of your the shape of the code so these are the five different shapes that you can see in your entire code so this as you can see has just one little triangle thingy at the bottom which means that this has to be your starting requirement for an entire code so you cannot add any other function above this but then when I save one triangle as quick as you can see view there's a hollowed triangle also so you I can attach these together and it will do the task for me if I want I can also do it this way where I can say go to and then you can see that this one is white like Y is equal to white in color and then circular and this is also circular I can attach this in this together so in it does two functions in one I can also do it in a way success because this has a triangle on top a hollow triangle I can attach these two together bring this in the middle of them and then repeat until and then you see there is a triangle like a hexagon option here this is also a hexagon so I can attach this over here so then this code basically tells me so when I when this green triangles clipped so basically when I start my entire code I want the code to run till I click the space bar so till the user clicks the space bar and the code should be that the object should go to 26 degrees x and y as whatever is the X so y equals 26 so this is the entire code and this will last for however long you press the space bar so you can do different stuff like that I know it sounds very complex when I explain it but it's trust me it's not that complex all you need is some practice and some time on your own to spend over this and you will be perfectly fine I know so many people who have just like learned and then they've got enough become a pro at it after trying to work more game so try have fun with it do games and after you make your games please send it on Instagram our account as girls will code so please send it we will promote you guys we will put you guys on our story and share you guys um and it
