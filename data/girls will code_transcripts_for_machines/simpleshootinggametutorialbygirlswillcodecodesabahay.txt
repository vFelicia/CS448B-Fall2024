so today we're going to learn how to make a simple shooting game on scratch which is going to look something like this so i have my player which i can maneuver with my right and left arrow keys and every time i hit the up arrow key i shoot bullets out at my target and every time i managed to hit my target um i get one point and yep so let's learn how to make it okay so i'm on scratch now and i created a new file and i called it simple shooting game and i just changed the background to black as i preferred it but you guys can choose whatever you want and so now i'm going to create a new sprite you can choose a sprite or you can make your own so i decided to paint my own in this case i am choosing the color to be blue and it's going to be a square so this is going to be my player and i'm just going to drag it down so it's like in my preferred location now let's get on to the code so what we want is like whenever we click the right or left arrow key it should move so that's what we're going to program in the player so whenever the green flag is clicked i want to first go to the same position so i'm going to go to same x and go same way because if ever my sprite was moved by accident it will always go back to that position and i'm going to make a new variable and i'm going to call it player speed this is going to determine the speed of the player and how fast it moves as i click for the sprite only so other sprites can't use it and so now i'm setting the player speed to eight and it can be modified later on if it's too fast we can make it go low or if it's too slow we can increase it and i'm just gonna uncheck so it doesn't stay on the board so now this i'm going to put in a forever loop and i'm going to say if the right arrow key was pressed then i want it to move to the right so i'm going to choose if the key right arrow is pressed i want it to move speed steps to so that'll be to the right so let's just test it out okay that's perfect so now i want to do the opposite i want to do if the left arrow keys pressed i want it to move the opposite direction so in this case i'm going to have to multiply the variable which is player speed by negative one so it's going to go in the opposite direction so i'm going to go to operators and i'm going to multiply it by negative 1. and i'm going to drag it on to the moves steps perfect so now if i try it again my player is moving it's also a good idea to name your sprite so i'm naming it player so it's um we'll know what it is later on now i'm going to create a new sprite and this is going to be my target so i want it to be white and it's going to be a rectangle for me you guys can choose whatever shapes you want and like whatever colors you want that's completely up to you and i'm gonna and i'm gonna rename it target so i know what it is later on now let's go on to the code so i wanted to constantly move right and left on the loop so we are first gonna just position it to like the place i want it so i know where it is and then i'm going to go back and say when the green flag is clicked i want it to move but first i wanted to go to that position because in case of if it was moved later on it's easy to go back i'm going to make another variable for this right only and i'm going to name it target speed and i'm going to set that also to eight but if if it could also be changed so it doesn't have to always be eight and now i'm going to say forever if the x locations were ever out of target so if they were ever in the end and went out of the board i want to multiply it by negative one so x position is less than negative 230 which is the end of the board or if the x position is greater than 230 and so i'm just going to go to the operators and choose the or let's see then i wanted to multiply it by negative one like we did with the player so i'll move in the opposite direction so every time it's in the other side it's going to multiply itself by negative one but besides that it's always going to move so i'm going to go out back i'm going to say move outside the if statement i'm going to say move the target speed step so it's always going to move and if ever it was outside of the boundaries the variable is going to be manipulated it's going to be multiplied by negative 1. so that's good the target is looking good so that's the quote for the target i'm also going to create the another costume for the target and i'm going to make it red because i later on i want that if the bullet were to ever hit the target i want it to become red so i'm gonna just make a new costume as now and when it started just to make sure it's always in the right costume i'm gonna say switch back to costume one which is the white and we're gonna program the red part later now we're gonna create a new sprite and that's gonna be our bullet so every time i hit the up arrow key it's going to turn it bullets are going to shoot out on my player so i want it to be a yellow circle that looks right about the right size and i'm going to rename it bullet i'm gonna go back to events i'm gonna say when the green flag is clicked i want it to hide because i don't want it to show yet so when i click it it's gone already it's hiding i'm gonna go ctrl and i'm gonna say forever if my up arrow or whenever my up arrow is clicked i am going to create a clone of the bullet and when i create a clone that means that i can create have multiple bullets because as of now there's just one bullet if i didn't create a clone and i'm always going to wait until i am not pressing the up arrow because sometimes i can press the up arrow for long a long time and then multiple bullets will shoot out so then i'm going to go back and then i'm going to make a new thing and i'm going to say whenever i start as a clone this is what i'm going to do i'm going to go to not a random position but i'm going to go to the player so i'm going to start off where my player is and i'm going to show myself and i'm going to repeat this until i i am touching my target or i have gone out of the board so i'm gonna say i'm gonna repeat this until i have touched my target or my x position is sorry my white position is greater than the um the length of the board y position is greater than the board which is about 165. and every time it is not touching the target or the y position is greater than 165. i'm going to have it move i'm going to change that's y location by 10 so it's going to move up the board and then i i want to broadcast that whenever it's touching the target i want it to say something so i'm going to say whenever it's touching the target then i'm going to broadcast or like show a message saying that target hit so other slides other sprites will know when my target is hit and after it's done with all of that it's going to delete this clone so then i can have multiple bullets so let's test it out if i hit the up character perfect multiple okay perfect so now i want it to actually turn red when i hit it so i'm going to go back to the target and i'm going to say when i receive the target has been hit i'm going to switch back my costume to costume 2 which was the red brick i'm going to say wait for 0.2 seconds and i'm going to go back to the white costume which is costing one so it's going to turn red for a brief second so i'm just going to try it out okay there we go so just turned red for that brief moment so i know that it's turned red now let's do something fun let's add a score so let's make a variable name it's score for and i'm going to put it for all sprites and so every time i hit it i want the score to increase by one so at the start the score is always going to be zero and whenever i receive my target hit that means i've touched the target i'm going to change my score by one so it's going to increase by one and once it does that it's gonna just for fun play a sound which is the pop sound i'm gonna have that so i'm gonna try yay so my score increased by one and i heard that pop sound so yeah that's the simple shooting game and now feel free to modify it add levels and other things and even change the colors and all the sprites if you have any questions feel free to reach out and yeah that's pretty much it that's how you make a simple shooting game yay
