hi hi everyone today i'll be teaching you how to use css properties on the mobile coding app decoder so we will be talking about three six different properties which are color font size font family border padding and margin so first off we have color i have my typical hello world document html document here and when i press play it's your black hello world so first of all we'll be changing its color so go into the h1 bracket type in style to do um inline css put in an equal sign quotation marks color colon and blue so when i press the play button hello world should now be in blue our next property is font family so you can do this by going into the quotation marks putting in a semicolon to signify that you're adding another property type in font family and i will make the font of my text health ethical you go then you click the plus button i'm sorry the play button it's now in the font you chose so next off we have the property of font size so once again semicolon font dash size colon then let's go with the font size 12 px see um now our hello world text is on is in the size 12 okay next we have the property of border so this will just put a border around your text then you can do this once again going into the quotation marks putting a semicolon typing in border colon then let's go with dotted so that will create a dotted border around the word hello world so when i press play there's now a dotted border next off we have padding so once again semicolon padding then let's do padding on the left so padding dashlet colon do 40px and then press play you can see that hello world has shifted 40px to the right so um it's no longer touching the left side of the border lastly we have margin so once again semicolon margin then let's put a margin on top so margin dash top colon it's to 100 px when you press the button the whole hello world text has moved down 100 px so that's it for the properties i'll be talking about in this video but for more css properties please check out the link below and thank you for watching bye
