hi everyone in this mobile coding series video i'll be teaching you how to use css to create shape on the mobile coding app decoder so first of all we're going to be learning how to make a square or rectangle on the html file so i have my html file as always then the first thing you want to do is create a class within a div so div class equals rectangle or you can name it whatever you want but i'll name mine rectangle for the sake of simplicity then close the div and make a closing div so backslash div then closing so there are three properties essential in making a square or a rectangle and those are height width and background color so to do this go to css and to reference your class that you made type in dot and your class name since i named my class rectangle i'll be typing in rectangle then putting in my brackets within these brackets you can then put in your css so as i said the three properties are height sorry height so let's make the height 100 px then semicolon then next we have width um if you want to make it a square you could also do 100 px but since mine's a rectangle or maybe 200 px and lastly we have background colors like that dash color and i'll make my background color yellow so when i go back to my html and i press play i now have a rectangle that is 100 px in height 200 px in width and has a background color of yellow so the next thing we're going to do in this video is learn how to make a circle now that we know how to make a square it's a very similar process except we have one extra attribute which i will get to sorry property which i will get to later so once again we can make a div sorry div class equals quotation marks circle then once again closing then closing dip so to make a circle the css properties will we will need are once again height and width but including besides height and width and color we'll also need the property of border radius so let's try it out so dot circle or whatever you named your class then brackets then within the brackets we have height let's make it the same thing as last time so 100 px also 100 px sorry 100 px and um background color let's make it blue and most importantly border radius so this determines how curved your square will be and if it's curved to the max then that makes a circle so let's make it 50px so when i go back to my html and i press play i have my circle it's right below the rectangle and it's blue and it has a height of 100px and a width of 100px so that is it for today's video hope you enjoyed and thank you for watching make sure to check the other decoder videos on mobile coding if you haven't yet to learn more bye
