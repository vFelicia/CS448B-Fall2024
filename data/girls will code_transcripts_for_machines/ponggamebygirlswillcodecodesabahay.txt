hi today we're gonna learn how to make a simple multiplayer phone game which is gonna look something like this we have two players and they're both trying to hit the ball back and forth so let's get started the first thing i want to do is choose this price and search for paddle which is going to be what our player controls so i'm going to name it player one and i want it to be vertical instead of horizontal so i'm gonna change the direction to zero now since it's a multiplayer game we're going to need another one for player two so i'm gonna duplicate this we want the players to be on the left and right end of the screen so let's move player 1 to the left end of the screen and player 2 to the right end of the screen so we'll go to player one and we're gonna go to go to and we're gonna set it to x negative 225 and y equals zero that's gonna move it to the left end of the screen we're going to do the same with player 2 but instead we're going to move it to x225 positive 225 and that's going to move it to the right end of the screen now that we have positioned both the players let's move them up and down we're going to move player 1 up and down using the w and s keys so let's put that in so if the w key is pressed we want the player to move 10 steps in the direction that he's facing so since he's facing up he's going to move 10 steps off and since we wanted to move down when the s key is pressed we're going to move negative 10 so now it's going to move downwards we're going to do the same thing with player 2 but instead of using w and s to move up and down we use the up and down arrow keys so now both players can move up and down now it's time to create the ball i'm going to choose a sprite and look for ball i'm going to make the size a bit smaller so there that seems nice and so when the game begins we want the ball to go in the center of the screen so it's going to go to x0 y0 and when it begins we want it to move towards player 1 first and then player 1 is going to hit it and then it's going to move to player 2. so since it's going to start moving towards player 1 first we're going to point in direction of player 1 and player 1 is on the left so we're going to point in direction negative 19. so now we want the balls to always keep moving so we're gonna put a forever loop and in that we're gonna have a move block and we can change the the value so i'm gonna start off at seven but we can see if that's too slow or too fast and then we can change it around but now what we want is if the ball touches player 1 which means player 1 hits the ball we wanted to start moving towards player 2 and likewise so essentially what we want is if the ball touches either player we want the ball to switch its direction so let's put that statement in the code so here is that statement so if the ball touches either player you want it to switch direction so we're going to do is go to motion and drag the point in direction block we want the ball to be pointing in the opposite direction so we're going to do that by multiplying our current direction by negative one and then putting that inside the point in direction so as you can see the ball when it touches either player it switches directions which is good however you can see it just keeps moving horizontally what we want to do is allow the ball to travel diagonally so that each player has to keep moving up and down to actually get to the ball so we're going to do that by bringing in a turn block so each time a player hits the ball the ball is going to go horizontally but it's going to go at an angle and that angle is going to range from negative 20 to positive 20. and you guys can change these values around another thing you want to do is add the if on edge bounce block so what happens is if the ball touches the top edge of the bottom edge it's going to bounce instead of just staying there so let's see that happen now we can see the ball does travel diagonally and if it does touch an edge it's going to bounce we also need to add score so we know who's winning but before we do that we need to create a mechanism to detect if a player has won the point for player 1 to win a point which is the player on the left for him to win a point player 2 has to miss the ball and for player 2 to miss a ball what that really means is that the ball goes behind player 2 on its right side so what we can do is create an if statement that checks if the xcoordinate of the ball is greater than the xcoordinate of player 2 that means that player 2 has missed the ball so let's put that in code so here we have that statement if the x position of the ball is greater than 225 which is the x position of player 2 we know that player 1 has won the point now let's do the same for player 2. for player 2 to win the point player 1 has to miss the ball and what that really means is that the ball is behind player 1 and we can check that by seeing the x corner of the ball if the x coordinate of the ball is less than the x coordinate of player 1 that means player 1 has missed the ball so let's also put that in code so here we have that so if the x position of the ball is less than negative 225 which is the exposition of player 1 and player 2 has won the point so now let's create our two score variables player 1 score and player 2 score i'll move the player 2 scored above player 2 and i'll make it a large beat out okay so for this first if statement if the exposition is greater than 225 we know that player one has won the point so let's change player one score by one and likewise we can do the same over here and change player two as a score by one if the x coordinate of the ball is less than negative 225 now what we want to do is every time the game starts we want the scores to start off at zero so let's do that as well so another thing that we want to add is anytime a player wins a point you want to reset the game and bring the ball back to the middle so we're going to begin by whenever a player wins a point we're gonna hide the ball then we're gonna bring the ball back to the center so when x equals zero and y equals zero that's the center and then what we're gonna also do is point the ball in direction towards player 1 so in the direction of negative 90 degrees then we're going to show the ball and we're also going to add a weight block because we don't want the next round to begin right away we'll give the players a second to get back to the middle so this we're gonna put this code in both these if statements and another thing that we want to do is bring these move seven steps inside this forever loop because we don't want the ball to be moving when the game is being reset and now this should work so let's have a look perfect so let's see the ball goes back to the middle and now it's going to start so another thing you want to do is when either player reaches five a score of five you're going to end the game but of course you could also make it 10 15 or whatever you like so let's put that in code so here we have that if statement if player one's a score equals five or player two the score equals five we're going to end the game so we're gonna go to control and then grab the stop all block and now this is gonna end the game so we'll put this if statement inside this forever loop and now anytime each of the players reaches a score of 5 the game is going to end and that's it for this tutorial thank you all for watching if you have any questions please feel free to leave them in the comments below
