hi guys today i'll be teaching you how to make this spiral and as you can see as the spiral increases the colors are changing and the triangles are increasing hey guys today i'll be teaching you how to make a spiral project on scratch so what you want to do first is choose a sprite you can choose one of the scratch default sprites or you can also choose to make your own for this project i will be using the ball spray so here's my sprite and what i want to do now is decrease the size as much as possible this will allow us to better see our drawing for this project you will need the pen extension to access extensions press this button and click pen this will then give you a series of blocks you can then use to make your project so what you want to do first like every other project is get the when flag is clipped event which will then allow whatever block is split below it to play when this button is hit then you want to get the pen down block and move it here when click event this will allow a line to be drawn wherever your sprite goes so for instance if we move the sprite pen locks to the right a line will be drawn following for this project you need to start with a basic shape so i will start with a triangle i will do this by moving the sprite a particular number of steps then turning it 120 degrees and repeating this three times this will then allow me to make my triangle so here's my triangle and what you also want to do is go back to the pen blocks and have the erase all blocked put this at the beginning of your one click function so that you can start with a blank canvas every single time you click in the other triangle what we can now do is create a series of triangles going around in a circle to form our spiral what you want to do is go to the motion blocks and select the pen you can add this to the bottom so that every single time a new triangle is formed it turns 15 degrees to form several triangles you can go to control and have this set of code repeat forever this will make an infinite number of triangles going around in a circle and turning 15 degrees every time so as you can see we now have our spiral forming and we'll continue to add triangles until we press the stop so now that you have your basic spiral what you can now do to make it more interesting is customize it you can go to the pen blocks as i have here and you can set the pen color to whatever color you want i will set the pen color to green so as you can see our spiral is now green another thing i can do is have the color change as the spiral is being formed you can get this block called change pen color and have it at the end of your forever at the end of your forever loop and then have the color gradually change as the triangles are being formed so as you can see originally green triangles are now turning into blue and going through all the other colors of the rainbow another thing we can do to customize our spiral is have the triangles increase as the spiral is being formed this will then create a shell shape so we can do this by going to our variables and creating a variable to replace the number 50 and move 50 steps we can name this variable length since it will be determining the length of the triangle and we can put this in place of 50. now instead of moving 50 steps it will move length steps so we can originally set length to 50 then as the triangles are being created we can change the length by one every single time so that the triangles increase as the spiral goes so as you can see the triangles are now overlapping the other triangles since they're increasing in size thank you for watching and i hope you guys enjoyed the video you
