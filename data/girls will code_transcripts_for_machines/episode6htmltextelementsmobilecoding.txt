hi everyone in today's video we will be talking about html text elements and how to create text using html please note that all of the text elements that we will be discussing are placed in the body container within your html document so first off we have our h1 tag this is an html text tag used to define headings it ranges from h1 to h6 where an h1 is the most important usually meaning it's the largest and it carries the topic of your html document next we have our p tag this is an html text tag used to define paragraphs and text and note that all spaces and lines within a single p tag will be ignored see the example on the left to see how this plays out next we have our unordered list as denoted by ul each item in the list starts with the li tag and each item will be marked by bullets as you can see in the output next we have our ordered list which is denoted by ol this differs from the unordered list in that each item each item in the list is numbered as you can see in the output
