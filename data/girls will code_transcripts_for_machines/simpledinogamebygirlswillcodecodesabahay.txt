today i'll be teaching you how to make a simplified version of the chrome dyno game by google what you'd want to do first is choose a sprite you can choose one of scratch's default sprites which is what i'm going to do today or if you want to use the original image you can search it up upload an image onto your device and click upload sprite so i'll be choosing a sprite and i'll be choosing the dino sprite so here's our sprite and what we want to do now is decrease the size so it fits better in the board then have it so that every time the up every time the program runs we want it to start at exactly the same position so when this when the flag is clicked it will always go to this x and y position and we can pass this by moving it then when i click when i click the flag as you can see it will always move back here what you want to do next is go to costumes delete all the unnecessary costumes and create a duplicate of the first one we want to adjust it so that it looks like it's in a running position then to check you can go back and forth between the two costumes and the dinosaur will look like a cracker what you want to do next is create the obstacles so in the original game these are the campuses and once again you can upload the image through upload sprite instead i will be choosing a sprite and replacement of that and i'll be using the tree spray so here's my spray then i will decrease the size so that it fits function for the dinosaur so what you're gonna do is every single time you click the up arrow key the dinosaur will go up and down we can do this by going to control first hitting the forever loop so that the code replaces over and over again and getting the impedance so you can go to centic sensing get this block then have it set on so if up arrow key is pressed then the code inside this block will run what we want to put inside this block is the up and down motion go to the motion blocks and change y by 10 and change y by negative 10. what this does is it has a dinosaur change y position going upwards and going back downwards by 10 blocks then what we want to do is go back to control and get the review what the repeat does is it slows down the motion for both the going up and going down so that it's more so that it's a more smooth jump so here we can press play and you can test this by clicking your up arrow key now that we've programmed the dinosaur to move up and down every single time the up arrow key is pressed what we need to do now is program the tree for move to move from the left to the right so based on the jump of the dinosaur we can say that the tree should be a bit smaller so that the dinosaur can more easily jump through it then what we need to do now is put it back get when black is clipped and get the fur removing it we wanted to forever create a clone of itself then wait one minute sorry one second then every time it creates a clone of itself we want it to start at that exact position so you can get there go to this position so every time it starts it goes there then what we wanted what we wanted to do now is move to the left until it hits a particular x position so you can get the repeat until function then have it three p's until x the x position is less than we wanted to keep moving left so to make it move move left you can get the change x y and we can set it at negative the greater the number the faster the move then you can then go to control so that when it reaches the end this repeat will stop and it will move on to the next piece of code and when it's done repeating we want the clone to disappear all together so we can get the delete this one now we can test it and as you can see the trees are moving from the right to the left however as you can see there's a tree here there's a permanent tree here that creates clones of itself and we don't necessarily want that what we want to do is go to costumes and create a new costume but we want this costume to be black so every single tree starts blank until it starts moving to do that we can go the looks and have the costume to always start at the black costume but when it starts as a clone we wanted to switch to the tree what we want to do now is create a game over sequence so we can do this by going to control so if our sprite is touching the tree we can have all we can have the program stop so when you press the button if i miss a tree the program will stop what you want to do now is create a backdrop to signal the game over so you can go here go to backdrops quickly get this backdrop and create your gamer backdrop keep it simple i'll just type the words here so what you want to do now is go back to your dinosaur code and every single time the game starts he wanted to switch the backdrop one so that it starts with the normal background then when it ends we wanted to switch to backdrop too when it starts as you can see when we miss it will now say game over what i forgot to do at the beginning of the program is use our costumes that we made earlier so what we want to do is every time the program starts we want to switch the costume costume which is a1 but then throughout the code if the dinosaur isn't jumping we want the costume to switch back and forth between a1 and a2 if we do that we can get another if statement so if then we want the costumes costumes so we can switch costumes about shoot day and switch costume to costume a2 but have it weights in the middle so that the change is more visible now when we run our code you can see the dinosaurs like smoothing we're basically done with our game and now the only thing we have to do is create the score variable so you can go to make a variable type in score and at the beginning of your program you always want to set score to zero then every time it jumps over a tree you want a trench four by one when i play the plate as you can see i was able to jump over only one tree and now
