hi my name is sarah and today i'm going to be teaching you how to code a cat and mouse game so basically the way this works is the mouse is trying to get to a strawberry in order to score points and um the cat will be chasing around the mouse each time and if the cat catches the mouse then the game will end but until then the mouse is trying to eat as many strawberries as they can we are going to start off programming this game by adding some code for this mouse so i'm going to start over here in events and say when the green flag is clicked i want the mouse to go to the center so i want to always start the game with the mouse being in the same place if i click the green flag down you'll see the mouse goes to the center and the next step is to add in the functions of the different keys so first i'm going to use a forever loop to make sure that the code we add within that paragraph will execute as long as the game is being played and then i'm going to add three if statements for each of the keys that either rotate the mouse or move it forward so over here in sensing you can use these options if the left arrow key is pressed then something will happen if the right arrow key is pressed and something will happen and up here if the up arrow keys processing will happen and then if we go here to motions you'll see that you have the option to say if the left arrow key is pressed it will turn 15 degrees to the left if the right key is pressed it'll turn 15 degrees to the right and then here we have the option to say when the up arrow key is pressed the mouse will move 10 steps forward so if we give that a trial run now left key right key and the up key the next step in programming this game is to add some code for our strawberry to appear and disappear in random places so i'm going to start off with some event block which says when the green flag is clicked and then i'm going to add another forever loop just like we did for the mouse but instead of what we did with the mouse where we told the mouse to go center of the screen we are going to use this other foot block that says the strawberry will go to a random position you'll see what happens right now is the strawberry sort of zigzagging everywhere so in order to fix this issue we are going to use this control block wait seven milliseconds let's say two seconds and now you'll see that the strawberry stays in place for two seconds before moving to a new random location okay the third part of programming this game is to add some code for the cat so the cat moves around always following the mouse so we're going to start same way we did with the other sprites when the green flag is clicked and instead of going to random position or to the center of the screen we want the cat to start the game some spaces away from the mouse so i'm going to say the cat starts at the coordinates 200 200. so it's quite far away from the center of the screen and then because i want the player to have some time to maneuver the mouse before the cat starts chasing it i'm going to tell the cat to wait one second before it starts moving next i'm going to add in a forever loop and there's this really useful block up here it's a point towards code box so what i want this to say is i want the cat to always be pointing towards the mouse and i also want the cat to always be moving towards mass so it's always pointing in the direction of the mouse it's always moving it will always be moving for its mask and let's say it's going to be three steps at a time so it's a bit slower than the mouse as well the next important part of this game is to create a score function where each time a mouse eats a strawberry the score goes up by one so we are going to go over here to variables and i'm going to make a variable i'm going to call it score okay and the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to say set score to zero when the green flag is clicked so each time the game restarts the score also resets back to zero and then i'm going to create a broadcast message that will tell other sprites when a point has been scored so i'm going to say if the mouse is touching the strawberry meaning it's eating it sorry a strawberry then it will broadcast a message and i will need to create a new message here i'm going to call it point score okay so if the mouse catches strawberry it will save points for it then we're going to go over here to the strawberry and we are going to say when i receive the broadcast masters point scored first i am going to hide so that the mass can't keep scoring points so i'm going to hide and then i am going to change my score by one so it will go up by one point the next important part is to create a game over sequence in order to do that we are going to do something quite similar to what we did with the score functions and i'm going to create a if then statement so this time if the cat is touching the mouse then this game over sequence will be initiated so we are going to accomplish this by creating another broadcast message but instead of point score this one is going to say game over another important part of this game over sequence is the background so we want background to tell the player that it says game over so over here on the right you can change backdrops and if we go up here in the upper left you can see all the different backdrops we have available i'm going to add um two more which will be the ones that i'm using so i can delete this one up here so i one just called light which is the original name of the costume of the background and then here is another one and i'm going to call this one game over and i'm actually going to also add in some text that says game over on the backdrop itself and okay i want to move it to the center and then here we go back to the code so remember there is a game over broadcast that i sent out when the cat catches the mouse so i'm going to say when the backdrop receives this game over message only then will it switch the game over back up and i also want to remember that when the green flag is clicked the background will switch itself back to the original one where it does not say game over one of the finishing touches to this game is to make sure that when the game over sequence is initiated all the code for the other sprites actually stops running so that the player won't be able to continue playing the game after they've lost so we are going to add in an event function where it says when i receive game over broadcast when the master sees the game over broadcast first it's going to hide so that it won't cover the game over message and then it's going to do something really important it's going to stop all scripts in all of these different spreads so it's going to stop all the code from running after it receives the game over broadcast and that way here won't be able to continue playing the game and something important to remember is when you use this hide block you want to make sure that when the game starts again the sprite will show itself so when the game starts it will show itself and when the game ends it will hide itself we are going to add that over here with the strawberry so when i receive game over i'm going to hide and when the green flag is clicked i'm going to show myself it's important that we add it inside this forever function here because um here when each time a point is for the strawberry is actually going to hide itself again so we need the strawberry to show itself again each time it moves to a new location and also when the game starts for the first time we are going to add something similar for the cat when i receive game over i'm going to hide but when the game starts it's going to show itself so now we can try playing our game so we score points here and you can see the cat is following the mouse around and when the cat catches the mouth um the game ends so thank you so much i hope you enjoyed and have a great time coding you
