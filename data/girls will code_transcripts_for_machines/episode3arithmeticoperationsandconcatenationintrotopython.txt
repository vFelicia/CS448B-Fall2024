hi everyone this is the third video of the intro to python series and in this video we're going to be talking about arithmetic and other computational tools in python as we know one thing computers are very capable of doing is performing arithmetic addition subtraction multiplication division and other operations are easy to do in most programming languages and the same applies for python in the previous video we discussed three data types strings integers and booleans now as we know arithmetic operations like addition multiplication etc are performed on numbers so obviously if you want to perform these mathematical operations in python we would have to involve the integer data type in some way as this data type stores numbers okay so here i am adding two numbers and just like in math you use the plus symbol now if i create a variable to store the result let's call it sum because it's a sum of two numbers the data type would be an integer so now let's do some subtraction um let's just call it result is going to be 7 minus 6. so now the value that is going to be stored inside this variable result is going to be an integer with a value 1 because 7 minus 6 is 1 and for multiplication you use the asterisk symbol and for division you use let me just call this result two for division you use the slash symbol so let's just do four divided by two this is four divided by two five multiplied by three seven minus six four plus five and for exponentiation you would do this symbol so this means 5 raised to the power 2 and this would give me a value of 25 stored inside this variable result four usually you'd combine multiplication exponentiation and other operations together so one important thing to keep in mind is that python follows the same usual order of operations that is used in mathematics so for instance if i was to write the following code the computer would perform this multiplication before it does the addition so it would do 3 times 50 3 times 5 which is equal to 15 then 15 plus 4 19 but now if i wanted the addition to take place before the multiplication what i can do for that is put parentheses around the addition so now what it's going to do is perform the addition first that's going to give me 7 times five which is obviously going to be 35. another important data type is float while the integer is a whole number with no decimal point a number with a decimal point is called a float while the integer data type well stores integers which is numbers positive or negative without decimal points like 2 3 negative 5 etc the float data type stores numbers that have a decimal value so let's say if i want to write a number 5.3 now obviously since there is a decimal point this data is stored as a float and not an integer okay so just a small recap there are two main data types to represent numbers which are integers and floats integers are for numbers without decimal places positive or negative and floats are for numbers with decimal places and we can perform the aforementioned mathematical operations using both these data types as they both represent numbers another operation i would like to talk about which is very helpful when you look into algorithms in the future is the modulo operator now the modulo operator is essentially a companion to the division operator we know that the division operator is is this slash sign let me just do 10 divided by 3. now what the modulo operator does is that it returns the remainder of a division operation if i were to divide 10 by 3 that would give me a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 1. so the modulo operator is a way of accessing the remainder so this would give me an output of 1 and this would give me an output of 3 and if i were to divide 4 by 2 so if i were to do if i were to do 4 divided by 4 divided by 2 obviously that would give me a an output of 2 but i would get a remainder of i would get a remainder of zero because two goes into four perfectly okay so now i'm going to bridge off a bit but bear with me now what would happen if i added two strings so let me create two strings my first name and the second name and my my second name so these are the two strings my first name and my second name obviously strings are words so you can't numerically add them like you would add numbers but when you use the plus symbol between two strings you join them together into one bigger string which is called concassanation so now let's say if i were to store this in a variable called names let's just call it that and now the output of this would be a string like this it would just combine these two strings into a bigger string now if i perform a mathematical operation and i want to display the result on my screen i would use the print statement so let's do that i would print and let's say a mathematical operation there we have it four plus three now alternatively what i can also do is create a variable called result 6 because i've already called result 5 over here so we need a new variable name result 6 and alternatively what can also be done is storing the value in a variable and then printing the value of that variable you could do that as well so what i've done is just deleted that result six variable and gone back to the previous way that we'd represented that now what if i wanted to give the user some detail and tell them hey this is what you this is the result of the operation that you asked for so that would mean that i want to print a phrase first and then give the result right after that so let's say i want to print something let's say hey here is the computation you asked for now as you can notice this would be an integer and this would be a string now since they're two different data types we do not have a way of combining them but what i can do now is perform the computation so we've done that over here four plus three now what we do is convert the result into a string and then as we know we can add two strings together so i've performed the computation and to convert an integer to a string what we do is type the words str and then parentheses around what we want to convert into a string so four plus three now that's equal to seven and now it's going to create a string called seven it's gonna clear it's gonna create a string like this seven it's no longer gonna be an integer seven it's gonna be a string seven so now i have a string with the number seven stored inside of it and i have another string so i can combine these two strings like i did over here with the plus symbol now let's print this out and uh let's see what it does so as you can see it gives me the phrase that i wanted to print out as well as the result of the computation right beside it now if i did not put this string over here this str method if i did not put that in and i try to print out as you can see it is going to give me an error because you cannot concatenate a string to an integer but you may ask me why we can convert the integer into a string well keep in mind that strings are made up of all the alphanumeric symbols on your keyboard which obviously include numbers now this leads me back to the question i posed to you all in the previous video what is the difference between the following two statements besides obviously the variable names now i'm hoping you guys already have some sort of an understanding of what the difference between these two is based on the concatenation that we've done previously but even if you don't let me just provide you an explanation so variable y is a string that contains the alphanumeric character 5. well variable x is an integer and so it's a number with which you can perform mathematical operations we discussed earlier now why can't we perform the operations with variable y well because y is a string and we know that we cannot perform mathematical operations on characters or letters so even though it's the character 5 the alphanumeric character 5 we still can't perform computations on it and think of it as an integer because it's stored as a string that's all the content we'll cover in this video let me just give you all a few exercises that you can work on okay so here are some exercises to recap what we did please try to do these as best as you can and i will talk about the answers at the end of this video the first exercise is try and experiment with all the mathematical operations that we learned now obviously remember that you need to use the print statement to actually see the result in the terminal over here the second exercise is i want you to create a variable called age and then store your age in it then print it out with the short sentence preceding it so your terminal over here should look something like my ages dot dot dot and now that would obviously be your age now note that in this for this exercise you would need to do something similar to what i did in this line because your age is an integer and you want to print out a phrase preceding it which is obviously a string and we know that we cannot combine strings and integers without the use of this str block over here okay here are the answers to the exercise so obviously i will not discuss the answer to the first one because it's just experimenting with the different operations for the second one let's get started so it says create a variable called age okay so let's create a variable called age and let's assign it the value of my age i'm 16 so i'm going to assign it the number 16. now i want to print it out with a short statement short sentence preceding it now the sentence that i want to be printed is is let's say hello my age is and now i want and now i want the value of this variable to be printed right after this string now if i want to add obviously a string to an integer well that's not possible if i did not convert that integer into a string so let's do that to convert as we learned before we need to use the sdr block sdr function actually but we'll get to functions later on and we need to put parentheses and now let's print this out and see how it works hello my age is 16. so that's it for this video thank you all for watching and if you have any questions please feel free to leave them in the comments below
