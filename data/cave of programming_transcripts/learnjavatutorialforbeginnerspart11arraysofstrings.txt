00:00 - [Music]
00:19 - hello this is John from cave on
00:21 - programming calm welcome to tutorial
00:25 - number 11 and this tutorial is going to
00:27 - be on arrays of strings in Java I'm also
00:31 - going to show you a another way of
00:34 - iterating through arrays in Java and
00:36 - this tutorial is going to be kind of
00:38 - divided into two halves and then the
00:40 - first off I'm just going to give you the
00:42 - lowdown on arrays of strings and then
00:44 - the second half will dig a bit deeper
00:46 - into values and references arrays of
00:53 - strings in Java work pretty much the
00:56 - same as a race of integers I can type
00:59 - string array words for example equals
01:03 - new string array that's elf let's say
01:06 - three elements in this array I can set
01:11 - the elements by saying word zero equals
01:14 - hello words one equals two and the third
01:21 - element will have index two because I
01:23 - started numbering at zero you and I can
01:29 - access those values same way I could say
01:33 - for example words two which will be you
01:37 - so if I run that I get you down here and
01:44 - the same trick with integers that I
01:48 - showed you with integers and the last
01:50 - tutorial works with strings that is here
01:53 - I'm setting I'm allocating enough memory
01:57 - for three references to strings actually
02:00 - and here I'm actually allocating the
02:03 - memory for each of the three actual
02:05 - strings themselves but I can do all of
02:07 - this stuff stuff in one step by saying
02:11 - string array fruits let's say equals and
02:16 - then I just open curly brackets and I
02:18 - can literally type some strings here as
02:20 - many as I want apple banana / kiwi
02:27 - whatever
02:29 - and and this is basically equivalent to
02:33 - this excelled here I've got of course
02:35 - four and here is three and I want to
02:42 - show you also a new way of iterating
02:44 - through arrays because in the last
02:45 - tutorial we looked at using for loops
02:47 - with a loop index and there's another
02:51 - way of using for loops without a loop
02:53 - index I can create declare a variable
02:56 - here that I want to set to each of the
02:59 - array members in turn I'll call this
03:01 - fruit let's say so it's a type string
03:04 - because I'm going to iterate through an
03:06 - array of strings and then here I put a
03:09 - colon and here I type the name of the
03:11 - array that I want to iterate through and
03:15 - now Java will set this variable fruit to
03:19 - each of the values of this array in turn
03:22 - so if I do is this out I can say fruit
03:27 - and I get all the values in my array so
03:34 - that's basically all you need to know at
03:37 - a basic level about using strings of
03:39 - arrays now I want to tell you a little
03:44 - bit more about values and references in
03:48 - the context of arrays particularly and
03:51 - as I always say the really important
03:53 - thing is just to practice using this
03:56 - stuff and don't stress about their
03:59 - technical details too much but if you
04:02 - kind of listen to what I'm about to tell
04:05 - you and try to bear it in mind it'll
04:07 - help you to understand what's what's
04:09 - going on here so if I declare an int in
04:14 - Java int value equals one two three for
04:18 - example as we've seen already this is
04:22 - kind of enough memory to actually hold
04:25 - an integer and it can only hold an
04:29 - integer it's it's kind of the right size
04:32 - bit of memory for an integer and if I
04:36 - want to set it some kind of default
04:37 - default value I could set it equal to
04:39 - zero
04:40 - let's say but int that works because in
04:44 - is a primitive type and you know it's a
04:47 - primitive type because it's got a lower
04:49 - case letter and start here if I type
04:53 - string let's call it I don't know
04:57 - text this is string is a non primitive
05:02 - type it's a class and the giveaway is
05:05 - the capital letter at the top of top
05:08 - early start of string here and this
05:13 - isn't actually allocating enough memory
05:15 - for a string because how would you know
05:17 - how long your strings going to be and of
05:19 - course you don't
05:21 - this is allocating enough memory for a
05:25 - reference to a string and a reference is
05:28 - just basically an address of some memory
05:30 - so you could think of this as being a
05:32 - bit like a scrap of paper that you
05:34 - scribble down the address of your house
05:36 - on where your house in this slightly
05:40 - convoluted metaphor is the string so
05:44 - this is just the address of your string
05:46 - and the default value for references is
05:51 - is null so null is just kind of like it
05:59 - just kind of means pointless reference
06:01 - nothing it's not pointing anywhere and I
06:04 - can do assist out on that actually I
06:06 - could say this out text and then I get
06:10 - null and this this isn't the string of
06:13 - characters n ull this is an actual
06:16 - special type that means kind of nothing
06:20 - so if I create an array in Java off
06:23 - strings like this if I say string tetes
06:27 - with an S there and of course I need the
06:31 - array brackets here then again this is a
06:38 - reference that can point that an array
06:40 - actually of references to strings so
06:45 - let's say I do new string array
06:49 - I have like two references in myarray
06:52 - then by default Java will initialize
06:56 - each of those to null so I do sysout Tex
07:02 - 0 I'm going to get none again here so
07:10 - this whole thing here is only allocating
07:14 - enough memory for two references to
07:16 - strings it's not allocating the memory
07:18 - for the strings when I say text for
07:23 - example 0 equals 1 here I'm allocating
07:30 - memory for a string and I'm pointing
07:33 - this reference here at this string at
07:37 - this memory which really contains a
07:39 - string and so this is this is a useful
07:44 - thing to begin to get your head around
07:46 - at this stage but as I say don't stress
07:48 - about it because it's something you can
07:53 - absorb gradually as you go along and in
07:58 - the next tutorial we're going to look at
08:01 - multi-dimensional arrays which you can
08:05 - think of for example as as tables and I
08:09 - hope you'll join me then this will be
08:12 - tutorial number 12 and until then happy
08:16 - coding
08:19 - [Music]
08:34 - you
