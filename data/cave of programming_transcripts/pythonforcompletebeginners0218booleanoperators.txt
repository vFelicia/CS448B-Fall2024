00:00 - in this video we're going to look at
00:02 - Boolean operators in Python specifically
00:05 - we're going to look at the keywords and
00:07 - not and or and these are keywords that
00:10 - can be used with things that evaluate to
00:14 - a Boolean value so true or false and the
00:17 - simplest things that evaluate to true or
00:21 - false are just Boolean variables so
00:23 - let's look at those with these I'm going
00:25 - to create two here let's have is
00:29 - reigning
00:31 - and we'll set that equal to
00:33 - true and we'll have is windy equals
00:40 - false now supposing you want to stay
00:44 - inside if it's raining and it's also
00:48 - windy you can combine those two Boolean
00:51 - values with and so let's write stay
00:55 - inside equals is raining and is windy
01:02 - and we'll print that out so
01:05 - print stay
01:09 - inside and we can cast that to a string
01:12 - from Boolean so stay
01:15 - inside and take a look at it what do you
01:18 - think this is going to be let's have a
01:21 - look so I'm going to run
01:24 - this and it says stay inside fults so
01:28 - and we'll return a boot value which will
01:31 - only be true if this is true and also
01:34 - this is true otherwise it's false so if
01:37 - we change is windy to
01:39 - True stay inside
01:42 - becomes true if either one of these is
01:46 - false or if they're both fals for that
01:51 - matter then the and operator will return
01:55 - false it's pretty intuitive I think now
01:58 - supposing you want to take a coat if
02:02 - it's raining or if it's windy so if
02:05 - either one of those are true you want to
02:07 - take a coat now we can combine these
02:10 - using the or
02:12 - operator so let's say take coat equals
02:16 - is raining or is
02:21 - windy typical weather for
02:24 - Britain and let's print this out so I'll
02:27 - actually just copy this
02:30 - and we'll change this
02:33 - to
02:35 - take a
02:37 - coat and I'll put take coat in there let
02:41 - just copy
02:45 - that let's take a
02:48 - look so take a coat is false because
02:51 - they're both false but if either one of
02:53 - these is
02:54 - true take a coat will now be
02:58 - true the and it's also
03:01 - true if they're both
03:05 - true so the
03:07 - or Boolean operator evaluates to true if
03:11 - either one of the conditions that it
03:13 - applies to are true now let's take a
03:17 - look at
03:18 - not so what not does is it just flips a
03:22 - Boolean value to its opposite so it
03:24 - flips true to false and it flips false
03:27 - to True we'll take a look
03:31 - let's write here not windy not
03:36 - windy and then
03:38 - here so the expression that I'm going to
03:41 - pass to
03:42 - strau will be not is windy so it goes in
03:46 - front of the thing that you want it to
03:48 - apply to and we run this and it says
03:53 - false because it's flipped this True
03:55 - Value to false if this is
03:58 - false
04:02 - then it will flip it to true so not
04:04 - windy is
04:05 - true because windy is windy is
04:11 - false and you can combine these in all
04:14 - kinds of complicated ways it's best not
04:17 - to go too over the top with it so let's
04:20 - say that we want to take an umbrella
04:24 - only if it's raining and it's not
04:28 - windy we could combine them like this
04:31 - take
04:35 - umbrella equals is
04:38 - raining and not is
04:44 - windy and then if we print this out take
04:51 - umbrella and plra take umbrella let's
04:57 - take a
04:58 - look
05:00 - so it says
05:02 - true why because it is raining and it's
05:06 - not windy so if it is
05:08 - windy we don't take an
05:10 - umbrella because it might blow away
05:14 - definitely get damaged with a cheap one
05:16 - anyway and so that's
05:19 - false if it's
05:21 - windy let's say it's not
05:25 - windy and it's also not
05:28 - raining
05:31 - then we don't want an umbrella we only
05:33 - want an umbrella if it's raining and
05:36 - it's not
05:38 - windy and there we go true so I think
05:43 - all of this is fairly intuitive you can
05:45 - create really long Expressions you know
05:48 - like is this and not that or not this
05:53 - and this and so on and you want to try
05:56 - to avoid doing that you can always break
05:59 - down Boolean Expressions into a simplest
06:02 - series of expressions using Boolean
06:05 - variables if you do have to create a
06:08 - long expression and it's a bit hard to
06:10 - read you can put brackets in like we can
06:13 - with arithmetical
06:15 - Expressions so here for example we could
06:20 - put brackets around there but it's such
06:22 - a simple
06:24 - expression for this one I wouldn't
06:26 - bother but you can
06:27 - do then it says
06:30 - through in the next video I'll give you
06:33 - an exercise with Boolean
06:36 - variables hello you've been watching a
06:38 - free sample from my Python and machine
06:41 - learning for complete beginners course
06:43 - I'm uploading enough videos from the
06:45 - start of the course to get you started
06:48 - with python and machine learning the
06:49 - full course is absolutely massive if
06:51 - you're interested in it please click the
06:54 - link in the description the complete
06:56 - course covers not only basic python but
06:59 - o some fairly Advanced python even some
07:02 - desktop programming stuff and then goes
07:04 - on to machine learning and artificial
07:07 - intelligence until next time happy
07:10 - coding
