00:00 - hello my name's John Purcell welcome to
00:03 - my course on Python and machine learning
00:05 - for complete beginners in this video I'm
00:08 - going to explain to you what's actually
00:10 - in this course now it has to be said at
00:12 - the outset this is quite a long course
00:14 - you're going to want to work on it a
00:17 - little bit every day I think rather than
00:19 - try to get through huge amounts at a
00:21 - time
00:22 - but my idea in this course was to give
00:25 - complete beginners with computer
00:27 - programming
00:28 - skills that are up to date that are
00:31 - somewhere near The Cutting Edge of
00:32 - computing
00:34 - and that you could use to get a job if
00:36 - you want a job in programming
00:38 - in fact I think you could probably get a
00:40 - job after doing two-thirds of this
00:42 - course even although of course there are
00:44 - no guarantees and it depends where you
00:46 - live and how persistent you are and so
00:48 - on and I hope this course will also be
00:50 - very interesting for people who just
00:53 - want to learn about programming and
00:55 - artificial intelligence
00:57 - for their own purposes whether you see
01:00 - this as a hobby or you want to start
01:02 - your own company or whatever you want to
01:03 - do with it there are suggested exercises
01:06 - all the way through the course you don't
01:09 - have to do the exercises but you do have
01:11 - to practice somehow you can't learn
01:14 - computer programming just by watching
01:16 - videos it's like learning the guitar on
01:18 - a piano or something you have to
01:20 - actually practice but over the years
01:22 - people have often asked me to add more
01:24 - exercises to my courses and so you can
01:27 - find lots of exercises in this course
01:29 - which you can do if you want to
01:32 - so let's go quickly through the contents
01:35 - of the course so that you know what to
01:36 - expect
01:37 - this section the introductory section
01:40 - just tells you about how to create
01:42 - really basic python programs how to set
01:45 - up everything that you'll need to
01:47 - program in Python how to use the course
01:50 - and where to find the source code and so
01:52 - on
01:53 - we'll then take a look at loops and
01:55 - conditions and functions containers
01:58 - string formatting and a lot of the
02:01 - things that you're going to see
02:02 - especially in the early sections of the
02:04 - course they're the same things that
02:05 - you'd see if you studied any programming
02:08 - language we're going to look at the
02:09 - python versions of them but you can find
02:11 - them in almost any programming language
02:13 - just the same ideas just Express
02:16 - differently we'll look at regular
02:18 - Expressions which is something python is
02:20 - known for these are syntactical elements
02:23 - that are used to handle text basically
02:27 - to get bits out of text to rearrange
02:30 - text and so on we'll look at handling
02:32 - errors in Python and then we'll go on to
02:35 - looking at object oriented programming
02:37 - in Python you can do three types of
02:39 - programming basically procedural object
02:42 - oriented and functional programming and
02:45 - it's common to mix all three and that's
02:47 - what we'll be doing in this course with
02:50 - the skills you've gained up to that
02:51 - point we'll then build something called
02:53 - Conway's Game of Life which is a
02:56 - well-known cellular automata simulation
02:59 - program that has long been of interest
03:02 - to coders generally and then we'll look
03:05 - at some more advanced topics within
03:08 - Python programming
03:10 - like how to create modules how to
03:12 - implement your own operators so you can
03:15 - for example add your objects together
03:17 - we'll look at functional programming and
03:20 - files and then we're going to go on to
03:22 - looking at things that are more
03:23 - associated with machine learning in
03:26 - particular so we'll look at numpy that
03:29 - stands for numerical Python and that's a
03:32 - library or module that is used for
03:35 - handling large collections of numbers
03:37 - essentially in Python we'll look at
03:40 - graphs and plotting so that you can
03:42 - visualize data
03:44 - we'll look at pandas which is basically
03:46 - like the python equivalent of a
03:48 - spreadsheet program so if you ever use
03:51 - spreadsheets once you've seen that
03:53 - section you'll be able to use pandas
03:54 - instead and do a lot more than you ever
03:57 - could probably with a spreadsheet and
03:59 - we'll look at regression which is one of
04:01 - the simplest techniques for predicting
04:03 - data series it's basically about curve
04:06 - fitting
04:07 - we'll look at clustering where we find
04:09 - clusters that are present in data and
04:12 - then we'll look at naive Bayes a
04:14 - technique for making predictions about
04:16 - data in the naive Bayes section and in
04:19 - the section following that on decision
04:21 - trees you can find some kind of
04:24 - mathematical explanation but I've
04:25 - pitched it at a level where I'm assuming
04:28 - you don't actually know any mathematics
04:31 - and you don't actually need the
04:32 - mathematics to continue with the course
04:35 - in any case but I've thrown in some
04:37 - background information in there that
04:40 - explains how the mathematics of these
04:42 - things work a bit and we'll look at
04:44 - principal component analysis which is a
04:46 - powerful technique for visualizing data
04:49 - and reducing data to a manageable
04:51 - quantity of different data series and
04:55 - finally we'll look at probably the most
04:58 - powerful of
05:00 - techniques in machine learning and
05:02 - artificial intelligence which is
05:04 - artificial neural networks and we'll see
05:06 - how we can use the neural network in
05:08 - Python with hardly any code at all to
05:11 - easily recognize handwritten digits if
05:14 - you already know some python you might
05:16 - want to skip some of the earlier
05:18 - sections if you don't know any computer
05:20 - programming at all welcome to the world
05:22 - of computer programming and I hope by
05:25 - the time you'll finish this course
05:26 - you'll have really excellent skills
05:29 - which you can use to accomplish all
05:31 - kinds of things using computer programs
05:34 - or even get a job if you want one this
05:36 - is a free video from my course Python
05:40 - and machine learning for complete
05:42 - beginners I'm releasing the first couple
05:44 - of chapters of this course completely
05:47 - for free on YouTube to get you started
05:49 - with python I plan to upload new videos
05:52 - here to YouTube every Monday and every
05:55 - Thursday for at least a couple of months
05:58 - if you're interested in the complete
06:00 - course which teaches you python from
06:03 - scratch and eventually progresses to
06:06 - things like creating graphical user
06:08 - interfaces and using neural networks
06:10 - principal component analysis cluster
06:14 - analysis all that stuff and much more
06:16 - besides then you can find a link in the
06:19 - description or just go to this URL on
06:22 - the screen right here if you finish the
06:24 - whole course you'll be able to write all
06:26 - kinds of general purpose programs in
06:28 - Python and use Python to do machine
06:31 - learning and artificial intelligence as
06:34 - well thank you for watching until next
06:36 - time happy coding
