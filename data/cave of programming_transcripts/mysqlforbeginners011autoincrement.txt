00:00 - hello this is John from kof programming
00:03 - do.com in this tutorial we're going to
00:05 - take a look at Auto incrementing primary
00:08 - keys so I'm going to drop my users table
00:11 - again get rid of it and uh I've got to
00:14 - actually write drop table users in there
00:17 - and now I'm going to recreate the table
00:19 - similar to what we had before so what we
00:21 - had before was something like this
00:23 - create table
00:25 - users and the columns are ID int which
00:29 - is the primary key we've got name text
00:34 - and
00:35 - email text but actually for the purposes
00:39 - of this tutorial let's just let's just
00:41 - have a name in there because it'll save
00:43 - a little bit of
00:44 - time um so um the the the only sort of
00:48 - problem with this uh which is a sort of
00:51 - problem is
00:53 - that the ID field here um we have to
00:56 - invent a unique value for it now
00:58 - sometimes that's what you want
01:00 - sometimes you're running some software
01:02 - or something and you naturally get an ID
01:05 - uh when a user creates a a new account
01:08 - let's say on your system and you want to
01:10 - insert that ID into the database and uh
01:13 - there are ways of of course of doing
01:15 - queries and checking that the new idea
01:17 - is unique this sort of thing but
01:20 - sometimes it's nice if you can just get
01:22 - my SQL to invent an ID for you and you
01:26 - can do that by making the primary key
01:28 - autoincrement
01:29 - so let's let's drop this users table
01:32 - again I'm going to go back to the stuff
01:35 - that I just
01:36 - typed and I'm going to after primary key
01:40 - so before the comma I'm going to type
01:42 - Auto uncore increment so this is a very
01:47 - MySQL specific keyword and what it does
01:50 - is it means that you can do inserts
01:53 - without specifying an ID and the ID that
01:55 - will be assigned to each row will just
01:57 - be incremented or increased from
01:59 - whatever the last value that was used
02:01 - was and it's going to start at one so
02:04 - let's create that table now and we'll
02:06 - say insert into users and now I won't
02:09 - specify an ID so I'll just specify the
02:12 - one column we've got now which is at the
02:14 - moment it's just the name column and
02:16 - we'll say values and by the way I did a
02:19 - bit of checking and apparently um
02:22 - although I've always mixed double and
02:23 - single quotes except where I was using a
02:26 - database that really wouldn't accept one
02:28 - one or the other apparent single quotes
02:31 - are considered a kind of default
02:33 - standard thing to use in SQL but my sqls
02:36 - seems to be just fine with double quotes
02:38 - anyway let's insert something into there
02:40 - let's insert
02:41 - Bob that's the quotes around your um
02:44 - text values your string
02:46 - values so we'll insert that and we'll do
02:49 - a select star from users
02:53 - select star from
02:56 - users and we can see that we've inserted
02:58 - Bob and even though we we didn't specify
03:00 - an ID this time and even though it's a
03:02 - primary key so it has to have a value we
03:05 - can see that because it's autoincrement
03:06 - it's automatically assign Bob the value
03:09 - of one and of course if you insert
03:12 - another value let's insert another one
03:15 - then it's going to go to two as you
03:17 - might
03:18 - expect so let's take a look here and now
03:22 - it's two uh now my SQL won't allow zero
03:26 - in an autoincrement column so let's take
03:29 - a look at that uh supposing we do
03:31 - specify the ID and we specify it let's
03:34 - say as three or Any number greater than
03:37 - two that's going to work and we can do
03:41 - the select now and we see that the ID
03:44 - value of three which we have specified
03:46 - for this Auto inrent column now it my
03:49 - SQL will accept that just fine it's
03:51 - going to accept any valid value here
03:53 - which is going to be anything other than
03:55 - zero or some value that we've already
03:57 - got in this column or some value that's
04:00 - too big to fit in there which would be a
04:02 - really big number but if we um if we try
04:05 - to insert zero we get different results
04:09 - now um this depends on your settings I'm
04:12 - pretty sure that in the past I've tried
04:14 - to do this and it just hasn't run the
04:16 - query so I'm sure that's configurable
04:19 - but if we just run this now and we do a
04:21 - select on it with the settings that I've
04:23 - got here which is pretty much the yeah
04:26 - it's just the outof thee boox settings
04:29 - that it came with
04:30 - what happens is if you specify zero for
04:32 - an autoincrement column as we just did
04:36 - just right here then um it just kind of
04:39 - ignores the zero and it proceeds as
04:42 - though you hadn't specified any value
04:44 - for it so it will give us give it the
04:46 - next available ID in the
04:49 - sequence okay so that's it for this
04:50 - tutorial have a go yourself create a
04:52 - table with a primary key if you want to
04:55 - that is try inserting into it and also
04:58 - see what happens if if you try to insert
05:00 - zero on your your system maybe it won't
05:03 - run the query or maybe it will just
05:05 - ignore it and insert an auto incremented
05:07 - value in any case so until next time
05:10 - happy coding
