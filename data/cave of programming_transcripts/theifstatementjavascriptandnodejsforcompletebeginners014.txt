00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:03 - programming comm and this is another
00:05 - video in my series on JavaScript and no
00:08 - js' for complete beginners so in this
00:11 - video we're going to take a look at the
00:13 - if statement if you've done any
00:15 - programming before this will be probably
00:18 - too simple for you and if you are a
00:21 - complete beginner this is for you so if
00:24 - if you have done some programming before
00:26 - you probably want to skip ahead in this
00:28 - course a little bit maybe to the bit
00:30 - where we start discussing objects and
00:33 - classes or I'll see how the course goes
00:35 - so I haven't created those videos yet at
00:38 - this point in time but by the time you
00:40 - watch this I may have okay so I've got a
00:42 - crater the file here called conditioned
00:44 - stock j/s and I'm going to just write
00:48 - you strict here semicolon you may have
00:53 - noticed if you've been following this
00:54 - course that often in JavaScript it will
00:57 - work just fine without the semicolons
00:59 - but I feel it's good practice to put
01:03 - them in occasionally they are absolutely
01:06 - needed and other times JavaScript will
01:09 - just kind of automatically kind of put
01:12 - them in behind the scenes so it will
01:14 - just infer that you meant a semicolon
01:16 - semicolons are used to end statements
01:19 - basically it's the the kind of program
01:21 - it programming equivalent and a full
01:23 - stop or a period as you say in the USA
01:27 - but because JavaScript was used for such
01:30 - a long time in browsers it's kind of got
01:33 - this free and easy thing whereby it will
01:35 - try to correct your mistakes to a
01:37 - certain extent okay so let's get a
01:41 - command-line argument and we'll say that
01:43 - that's going to be a temperature so
01:47 - let's right let temperature so I'm
01:51 - declaring a variable and I'm going to
01:53 - assign it the value of process to arg v2
01:57 - which if you've been following this
01:58 - course you might remember it's how we
02:00 - get the first thing that someone types
02:03 - after the name of the program when they
02:05 - run it so in other words it's the first
02:07 - command-line argument and then now well
02:12 - let's actually use echo that bad
02:13 - just to see it so let's print it so if I
02:20 - run no two conditions Jas it says
02:24 - undefined but what I can do is after the
02:29 - name of the script I can write for
02:30 - example 21 and then it's going to echo
02:34 - that back to me now
02:35 - console dot log is is printing why I
02:38 - just typed so supposing we've got some
02:42 - sort of heating system and we want to
02:44 - take some kind of action if the
02:47 - temperature is let's say below 20 so we
02:52 - imagine that while I'm typing here is a
02:55 - temperature in Celsius and if it's 20 if
02:58 - it's below 20 it's too cold and I want
03:01 - to turn the heating on I can do that
03:03 - with an if statement and if statement
03:05 - looks like this so I'm going to write
03:09 - the keyword if then I'm going to have to
03:11 - round brackets and I'm going to have two
03:13 - curly brackets and notice I've put the
03:17 - opening curly bracket on the same line
03:19 - as the if and around brackets and then
03:23 - the closing curly bracket goes on a line
03:27 - further down and it's kind of aligned
03:29 - with the if they sort of line up I'm
03:33 - following the most common coding
03:35 - convention in JavaScript here there are
03:37 - others like some people put this bracket
03:39 - down here but that's that's less common
03:42 - I believe at the moment now in
03:45 - JavaScript so I'm going to follow the
03:47 - most common formatting for this and it
03:49 - is important to follow a convention for
03:52 - your code formatting is very important
03:54 - now in these round brackets I can put a
03:57 - condition so for example temperature
04:00 - less than 20 and I can put code in these
04:07 - curly brackets which will only be
04:09 - executed if this condition is true so
04:13 - let's just output some text there with
04:15 - console dot log and I'm going to print
04:20 - activating Heating
04:24 - so if I run this now if I put 21 there
04:29 - on the command line it's not going to do
04:32 - anything if I put 20 it's still not
04:34 - going to do anything because I've said
04:38 - do this only if temperature is less than
04:42 - 20 so 20 is not less than 20 it's equal
04:46 - to 20 let's run it with for example
04:48 - nineteen point five and now it says
04:51 - activating heating so this is an if
04:54 - statement it's hopefully it's fairly
04:56 - clear what it does it will it will run
05:00 - the code in curly brackets only if this
05:04 - condition in around brackets after the
05:07 - if keyword only if that's true we could
05:09 - put another one in there let's just copy
05:11 - that and put another one in and we can
05:16 - say if temperature is greater than 21
05:19 - let's say deactivating heating so now if
05:28 - I run this with let's say something less
05:31 - than 20 it's going to say activating
05:34 - eating 420 it does nothing 21 it does
05:40 - nothing but if I type in some value
05:42 - above 21 like 21 point two it says
05:47 - deactivating eating so now it's too hot
05:50 - and switching eating off so this is
05:53 - these are just a very couple of very
05:54 - simple if statements and if you haven't
05:59 - seen these before it's really important
06:00 - to practice them in the next video we'll
06:03 - look at more complicated versions of
06:05 - these if statements and we'll leave it
06:09 - there for for this video do try it out
06:11 - if you're a beginner especially and
06:13 - until next time happy coding
