00:00 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:01 - at the continue keyword which is closely
00:04 - related to the break keyword let's
00:07 - change break to
00:09 - continue once again this is a keyword in
00:13 - Python and it's a keyword in most
00:15 - programing languages I can think of one
00:18 - there's a programming language called
00:20 - Pearl where it's not called continue in
00:22 - Pearl it's called next if I remember
00:25 - correctly but it does the same thing
00:28 - even in that case
00:30 - so what does it actually
00:32 - do well break will cause the looping the
00:36 - iteration just to stop and execute
00:39 - whatever's after that in the program so
00:41 - break will actually stop your Loop
00:44 - continue doesn't stop the
00:46 - iteration it just skips whatever's next
00:50 - in this particular iteration I'll show
00:53 - you what I
00:54 - mean so let's run
00:58 - this
01:03 - so if I hit return here of course it
01:05 - carries on as normal we print starting
01:08 - Loop number whatever it is we ask the
01:11 - user if they want to stop the loop we
01:13 - print ending Loop number whatever it is
01:16 - and then we go to the next iteration of
01:18 - the loop supposing I press y here and
01:23 - enter do you see the
01:26 - difference we again we've gone to the
01:28 - next iteration of the loop but what's
01:30 - happened is we've skipped this so we're
01:33 - going to skip whatever remains after
01:35 - this continue keyword in the rest of
01:38 - that particular iteration of the loop so
01:41 - we've got starting Loop number zero and
01:44 - ending Loop number zero but then we've
01:46 - got starting Loop Number One there is no
01:49 - ending Loop number one here we've gone
01:52 - straight to starting Loop Number Two so
01:54 - do try this out for
01:56 - yourself I would just suggest trying it
01:58 - out and making sure that you understand
02:02 - what effect this has on your program it
02:04 - is a keyword that you're going to find
02:06 - useful later on hello you've been
02:08 - watching a free sample from my Python
02:11 - and machine learning for complete
02:13 - beginners course I'm uploading enough
02:15 - videos from the start of the course to
02:17 - get you started with python and machine
02:19 - learning the full course is absolutely
02:21 - massive if you're interested in it
02:24 - please click the link in the description
02:26 - the complete course covers not only
02:28 - basic python but also some fairly
02:31 - Advanced python even some desktop
02:33 - programming stuff and then goes on to
02:35 - machine learning and artificial
02:38 - intelligence until next time happy
02:40 - coding
