00:00 - [Music]
00:17 - hello this is John from cave of
00:20 - programming calm welcome back to C++ for
00:23 - complete beginners and in this tutorial
00:26 - we're going to talk about what you need
00:27 - to install on your computer to get
00:30 - started with C++ development
00:33 - unfortunately I can't give you exact
00:36 - instructions because exactly what you
00:40 - have to install depends on your platform
00:42 - your operating system your type of
00:44 - computer and it depends on your personal
00:48 - preferences for that matter and what you
00:52 - prefer to use to develop C++ but I'm
00:56 - gonna give you some pointers so I'm
00:59 - going to explain what I recommend you to
01:02 - install and where to find it and and
01:05 - here by the way you can see a little C++
01:08 - program in Eclipse which is gonna look
01:12 - completely puzzling to you at the moment
01:14 - probably but we're gonna look at that in
01:16 - the next tutorial so as I explained in
01:22 - the last video we need an IDE and a
01:25 - compiler so the first thing to do is to
01:29 - install your compiler now if you're on
01:31 - Windows you can use Visual C++ Express
01:36 - which I believe is free of Visual C++
01:39 - the paid version to follow this tutorial
01:42 - but there are gonna be some differences
01:44 - between what I show you and what you
01:46 - need to type in or do in Visual Studio
01:49 - but you probably can't follow that
01:51 - tutorial with this also on windows if
01:55 - you want a really simple solution to get
01:57 - started with you can use code blocks and
02:00 - I believe that can automatically
02:03 - download a compiler for you so visual
02:07 - C++ comes with its own compiler and I
02:10 - believe I think that code blocks can
02:12 - also download a compiler for you these
02:15 - are actually integrated development
02:16 - environments so those are two
02:18 - possibilities and there are others but
02:20 - what I recommend you to do
02:23 - is that firstly installed a compiler and
02:28 - now if you're on let's say Mac or
02:33 - another Linux type operating system like
02:35 - Linux or UNIX then you need to search
02:38 - for the canoes C++ compiler and search
02:44 - for this for your system so I'm using a
02:49 - Mac sort search for Anu C++ compiler for
02:52 - Mac and install that on your system and
02:59 - you may already have it so I'm not sure
03:02 - what the best link is here but you'll
03:04 - find it if you look around Mac OS X
03:07 - install GCC compiler ya the canoe
03:10 - compiler for C++ is also known as GCC
03:14 - and it's also known as G plus plus so
03:19 - you need to install C++ or GCC on your
03:25 - machine and if you're using like a Linux
03:29 - type operating system then you'll look
03:31 - for G plus plus or GCC or you know
03:34 - whatever
03:34 - if you're using Windows search form in
03:38 - GW mingw and that's minimalist the new
03:43 - for Windows so that's a GCC compiler for
03:48 - Windows so if you're using Windows I'd
03:50 - recommend that you install mingw so
03:55 - hopefully you can do that you're gonna
03:56 - have to search a little bit in Google to
03:58 - find exact instructions for your
04:00 - operating system but this is the first
04:02 - challenge to install GCC or mingw if
04:08 - you're on Windows and then you've got a
04:11 - compiler on your system the second thing
04:14 - that you need to do is you need to
04:16 - install an IDE
04:20 - and again visual C++ is an IDE which
04:25 - comes with a compiler code blocks is an
04:27 - IDE which comes with a compiler but I'd
04:29 - recommend the use clips so if you search
04:33 - for Eclipse c-plus plus let's say then
04:38 - you can find the Eclipse CDT and that is
04:45 - version of Eclipse for C++ eclipses a
04:50 - kind of generic development environment
04:53 - and the specific version of Eclipse for
04:56 - C++ is called Eclipse CDT so this is a
04:59 - second thing you need to install so just
05:01 - download and install that you might have
05:04 - to do some configuration after this to
05:06 - link to what it tells Eclipse why your
05:10 - compiler is and if you do if you do need
05:12 - need to you'll find that out certainly
05:15 - in the next tutorial because it won't
05:17 - work and you'll need to just google for
05:20 - instructions for your system on how to
05:22 - tell Eclipse CDT where to find your
05:26 - compiler so this is going to be a little
05:29 - bit challenging you're gonna have to
05:30 - probably do a little bit of googling
05:31 - perhaps some configuration depending on
05:34 - your system and you might have to but
05:38 - it's worth persisting with and believe
05:41 - me I well I've always thought anyway
05:43 - that getting your sit first C++ program
05:46 - running the first minimal HelloWorld C++
05:49 - program you know installing everything
05:51 - and getting the code in there and
05:52 - getting to that point it's the most
05:54 - difficult thing about C++ so give this
05:58 - some time and be patient try to install
06:01 - the compiler go new or mingw of its
06:04 - windows and install an IDE and I
06:06 - recommend CDT which will work on Windows
06:09 - or pretty much any system if you've
06:12 - already got Eclipse installed what you
06:16 - can do is you can go to the marketplace
06:20 - you go to help eclipse mock in place
06:22 - oops that's the wrong one
06:24 - cancel that help eclipse marketplace and
06:27 - just search for CDT in here you should
06:30 - be able to install it here I just type
06:34 - CDT in that box and just search for it
06:36 - CDT I've already got it installed so I
06:39 - don't know if this will actually find
06:41 - anything but you can install it into an
06:46 - existing Eclipse like that and you can
06:48 - also another way of doing that if you've
06:50 - already got eclipse is just go to this
06:53 - Eclipse CDT site type Eclipse CDT into
06:57 - Google go to download and then you can
07:01 - just put this URL here into eclipse
07:04 - so if you go to let's say let's get rid
07:08 - of that wizard cannot be closed okay
07:14 - that's nice but if you go to that's
07:18 - really annoying if you go to the Eclipse
07:21 - I think it's a help or Windows menu
07:22 - there's a option in that menu for
07:26 - installing software updates and you can
07:29 - just put this URL into a box if you
07:33 - select that menu option and you can
07:36 - install CDT there that's an alternative
07:38 - to using the marketplace but it's easier
07:40 - to use the marketplace and easier still
07:42 - just to download the CDT
07:46 - as a kind of standalone package yeah
07:53 - and so once you've done that then you'll
07:58 - have everything you need to get started
08:00 - with developing C++ programs and in the
08:03 - next tutorial we're gonna look at
08:05 - creating a really simple hello world C++
08:08 - program so if you install everything you
08:12 - think it's working move onto the next
08:14 - video and that's where you'll find out
08:16 - if it really is working or not so until
08:20 - next time happy coding
08:22 - [Music]
08:29 - you
