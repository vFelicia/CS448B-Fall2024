00:00 - hello in this video we're going to talk
00:03 - a little bit about what Java actually is
00:06 - so Java is a powerful general-purpose
00:09 - programming language it's very widely
00:11 - used it's been around quite a long time
00:14 - now and it will be around for a long
00:17 - time into the future so it's a really
00:19 - great language to learn as your first
00:22 - programming language or as your only
00:24 - programming language because people
00:26 - certainly do make careers entitled
00:29 - entirely out of Java and whatever kind
00:31 - of program you want to write there's a
00:33 - good chance that you can write it in
00:35 - Java just for fun I googled something
00:40 - like programs written in Java and I
00:42 - found this reddit page what are some of
00:44 - the biggest and well-known well no
00:47 - well-known Java applications used in
00:50 - this in the world and you can see just
00:52 - from me scrolling through this that
00:54 - there are an awful lot of things written
00:57 - in Java and it covers an awful lot of
01:00 - different areas so what is a programming
01:04 - language in general well basically
01:08 - programming languages can be divided
01:10 - into two types interpreted and compiled
01:14 - in both cases you write text files in
01:19 - your programming language so Java is a
01:23 - language in a way in the same sort of
01:25 - way that English or Greek or Italian are
01:28 - languages that is you can write down
01:32 - Java you can write down text in the Java
01:36 - programming language in any kind of text
01:39 - editor you know it's just some text then
01:42 - together to run on your computer you
01:44 - need some other step has to happen in
01:47 - order to actually run that text as a
01:49 - computer program so with interpreted
01:52 - programming languages what happens is
01:55 - your text gets fed to a thing called an
01:57 - interpreter which is just a computer
01:59 - program and that actually does whatever
02:01 - the text tells it to do now Java is not
02:04 - interpreted it's a compiled programming
02:07 - language that means that we take our
02:09 - text and we use some software to turn it
02:12 - into a
02:13 - or binary computer program which can
02:16 - then run and actually do things on your
02:18 - computer so quite often in this course I
02:22 - might mention compiling or building
02:25 - compiling means taking your java text
02:29 - and turning it into binary files which
02:32 - are actual computer programs that your
02:34 - computer can understand building means
02:38 - taking all the different binary files
02:41 - that you've created and building them or
02:44 - combining them into a single computer
02:45 - program so I might like tend to use
02:49 - these terms a little bit interchangeably
02:51 - compiling and building although they do
02:53 - mean different things don't worry about
02:55 - memorizing this at the moment all I'm
02:57 - trying to do is reduce your confusion
03:00 - not increase it so I just want to run
03:02 - some of these ideas past you so that
03:04 - you've got a bit of an idea about what's
03:06 - going on here so basically we write Java
03:09 - programs as some text and we compile
03:12 - them and build them into a program and
03:14 - usually that's more or less as simple as
03:16 - clicking a button after we've written
03:18 - the actual text most of what we're doing
03:20 - is just going to be writing that text in
03:22 - the java programming language if you
03:25 - want to create a particular type of
03:27 - program with Java so let's say you want
03:30 - to create Android program so you want to
03:32 - create websites or web applications or
03:36 - games maybe even you can create games in
03:40 - Java whatever you want to do first you
03:45 - would have to learn basically the java
03:47 - programming language and then later on
03:50 - you could learn how to use Java to do
03:53 - the particular type of thing that you
03:55 - want to do so if you wanted to create
03:57 - websites first you've got to learn Java
04:01 - and then you'd have to learn about
04:03 - creating websites with Java there may be
04:06 - other things that you have to learn so
04:08 - in the case of websites you'd have to
04:10 - learn more about web programming
04:11 - generally but basically that's the idea
04:14 - this course teaches you the java
04:17 - programming language so we'll be
04:19 - creating mostly textmode programs which
04:23 - might not sound very exciting but the
04:25 - thing is you'll be learning
04:26 - the Java language itself and that will
04:28 - give you a very very powerful sort of
04:31 - platform from which to then go and then
04:33 - particular areas of Java that may
04:35 - interest you
04:37 - many people build careers just entirely
04:41 - out of Java so beginners often think
04:44 - that they've got to learn fifteen
04:45 - different programming languages but you
04:47 - really don't lots of people just know
04:50 - basically one programming language like
04:52 - it like Java or C++ or something and
04:55 - they just stick to that programming
04:57 - language and it build a whole career out
04:59 - of it so although in this course I'm not
05:02 - going to teach you how to create Android
05:04 - apps or desktop apps we may touch on
05:08 - some specific things you can do with
05:09 - Java and I may show you some basic
05:11 - little examples to get you start started
05:13 - but we're not actually going to be
05:17 - looking at any particular speciality we
05:20 - are going to be looking at the java
05:22 - programming language itself writing text
05:25 - mode or console mode programs we call
05:28 - them but even so you're going to be
05:31 - learning a very very valuable skill here
05:33 - and it's hopefully gonna set you on a
05:36 - whole journey and enable you to do
05:37 - whatever you want to do with computer
05:40 - programming okay so until next time
05:43 - happy coding
