00:00 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:01 - at if else so we'll take this program
00:04 - here and it's important of course to
00:07 - make sure you've got a working version
00:09 - of this before enlarging it further I'm
00:13 - going to go to the last line in this
00:16 - code block here that the if applies
00:19 - to so we'll go to the next line and I'm
00:22 - going to delete the indent and write
00:24 - else
00:26 - colon and here let's say print your name
00:31 - is not John or whatever you want to
00:34 - write there so what does this do well
00:37 - it's probably fairly
00:39 - self-explanatory if this condition is
00:42 - true this code will be
00:44 - executed if this condition isn't true
00:47 - this code will be executed so this if
00:50 - else statement only ever executes one of
00:53 - the two code blocks it's either going to
00:56 - execute this if the condition's true or
00:59 - this if the the conditions
01:02 - false let's try it
01:04 - out enter your name John and it says
01:08 - your name is John hello and then program
01:11 - finished of course always executes
01:14 - because it's not part of this if out
01:16 - statement and if I type some other
01:19 - name it's going to say your name is not
01:22 - John or whatever you've put here and
01:24 - program finished again notice that the
01:27 - else has to be flush up against the left
01:29 - hand
01:30 - margin whereas the code in the else
01:34 - block the else code
01:36 - block that has to be indented by however
01:40 - much you've decided to indent things by
01:44 - so I've been using four spaces therefore
01:47 - this must be
01:48 - indented by four spaces also otherwise
01:52 - you'll get a syntax error and we've got
01:55 - a colon here as well after the else
01:58 - keyword try it out for your yourself and
02:01 - if you can think of any way to
02:02 - experiment with it that will usually
02:05 - help to improve your understanding a
02:07 - simple thing you could do is just add
02:08 - more lines right here into the else
02:11 - Clause hello you've been watching a free
02:14 - sample from my Python and machine
02:16 - learning for complete beginners course
02:18 - I'm uploading enough videos from the
02:20 - start of the course to get you started
02:23 - with python and machine learning the
02:25 - full course is absolutely massive if
02:27 - you're interested in it please click the
02:29 - link in the description the complete
02:32 - course covers not only basic python but
02:34 - also some fairly Advanced python even
02:37 - some desktop programming stuff and then
02:39 - goes on to machine learning and
02:41 - artificial intelligence until next time
02:44 - happy coding
