00:00 - hello in this video we're going to talk
00:02 - about basic string comparison in
00:05 - JavaScript
00:06 - so let's write use strict here and I'll
00:12 - have a string that's right text equals
00:16 - cat so we can check if two strings are
00:21 - equal with equals equals so let's write
00:24 - console dot log and text equals equals
00:30 - cat so these these two strings are equal
00:35 - so this equality test operator here
00:38 - should return true let's maybe put this
00:42 - in a kind of a comment which I start put
00:49 - this text so that we know what we've
00:51 - done here then if I run this so node and
00:57 - comparing strings to Jess we see that
01:00 - this indicates that the two strings are
01:03 - the same by returning true or by
01:06 - evaluating to true we can also use the
01:10 - slightly longer version of this operator
01:12 - so this that's the equality test
01:15 - operator this is the identity test
01:18 - operator what's the difference well
01:21 - we'll look at that in the next video but
01:23 - in a nutshell basically you probably
01:26 - some people think that you shouldn't use
01:29 - this short version it's kind of an older
01:33 - feature of JavaScript here this equals
01:36 - equals and some people call it the evil
01:39 - twin of the identity test operator so if
01:42 - in doubt use the longer versions so if
01:46 - you run this now again that says there
01:49 - they're the same it returns true we've
01:52 - got not equals as well so we've got and
01:58 - that also works with strings just as
02:00 - you'd expect
02:02 - so is it true that this test which
02:05 - contains the word cat is not equal to
02:07 - cat as that's going to be false in in
02:10 - all of these cases
02:12 - not equal and it's false that it's not
02:17 - equal it's false that it's not identical
02:19 - it is identical it is equal now
02:22 - surprisingly we can also use less than
02:27 - or equal to whist with strings so we can
02:31 - write texts for example this variable
02:35 - text less than dog is that true or is it
02:40 - false let's maybe just put this in a
02:42 - comment as well not exactly a comment
02:46 - but just some text to remind us of what
02:48 - we're doing here well this is actually
02:54 - going to evaluate to true because it
03:01 - just checks the alphabetical ordering of
03:03 - the strings involved so cat sorts
03:06 - earlier in the alphabet in the alphabet
03:08 - and dog because it begins with a C so if
03:13 - you think about the ordering of it it's
03:15 - true that cat is less than dog so if I
03:18 - run this now it's not a comment on cats
03:20 - or dogs but it says true cat is is less
03:27 - than dog in the alphabetical sense so of
03:30 - course you can use greater than you can
03:32 - use greater than or equal to with
03:34 - strings as well let's just check that so
03:37 - I could write text greater than or equal
03:40 - to dog is it true or is it false well
03:46 - cat is it's sort so earlier in the
03:49 - alphabet then dog so that's going to be
03:51 - false what else I think I think that's
03:58 - probably it's less than greater than
04:00 - notice that they're less than a greater
04:03 - than are are sort of case sensitive so
04:07 - here we've got yeah let's let's try
04:10 - comparing cat with cat with a capital C
04:15 - or dog maybe that's right dog with a
04:19 - capital D
04:22 - and I'll just replace the text in this
04:26 - string here as well so is this true or
04:30 - false that dog is greater than or equal
04:32 - to dog is false I think because in the
04:38 - character set that we're using here
04:40 - unicode character set capital letters
04:44 - are actually ordered earlier than
04:47 - lowercase letters so I think this is
04:50 - false let's just try it yeah false so
04:57 - dog is not greater than or equal to dog
05:00 - with a lowercase D all right that's it
05:04 - for this video and there are other ways
05:06 - to compare strings as well but most of
05:10 - the time these operators will will do
05:12 - the trick for you so until next time oh
05:14 - yeah if you're a beginner the important
05:16 - thing is I'll just say it again you've
05:19 - got to just try this out for yourself
05:20 - try them all out and make sure you
05:22 - understand them and pretty soon we're
05:24 - going to get onto practically using them
05:26 - with loops and conditionals these are
05:29 - we're still working at the moment with
05:31 - the absolute nuts and bolts the real
05:33 - building blocks of programming languages
05:35 - so until next time happy coding
