00:00 - in this video I'm going to give you an
00:01 - exercise which you can try if you want
00:03 - to remember the exercises are optional I
00:07 - wouldn't want you to feel that you've
00:08 - got to do the exercises and if you can't
00:11 - do them for some reason that you've
00:12 - somehow failed the important thing is
00:14 - only to practice so if you've got your
00:16 - own way of practicing if L if else or
00:21 - practicing anything else for that matter
00:23 - that's usually going to be just as good
00:25 - as the exercises that I give you so I'm
00:27 - going to call this exercise the fridge
00:29 - let's a comment here the fridge now I
00:33 - want to describe the exercise and for
00:35 - that I'm going to need multiple lines so
00:38 - I could type out multiple hash signs
00:41 - like
00:43 - this and then put text here or wherever
00:47 - as long as it's you know the right side
00:49 - of these hash signs but it's easier to
00:53 - use a different comment style to write
00:56 - multiple lines of
00:58 - comment python doesn't actually have
01:00 - multi-line comments as such but it does
01:03 - have multi-line strings normally we
01:06 - Define a string between double quotes
01:09 - you can actually also use single quotes
01:11 - it's exactly the same but let's say
01:14 - double quotes and put some text in there
01:16 - and of course that's a string but if you
01:18 - want strings that stretch multiple lines
01:22 - you can open and close the string with
01:25 - three
01:26 - quotes like
01:28 - this now I can also use this to create
01:32 - multi-line comments
01:35 - because Python's just going to read this
01:38 - and say okay it's just a string it's not
01:41 - even assigned to a variable I can
01:43 - basically just ignore it so it will
01:45 - treat it like a comment
01:49 - effectively so the exercise is this get
01:53 - the user to enter a temperature in
01:58 - Celsius if you're not used to using
02:01 - Celsius don't worry because that's not
02:04 - going to matter here now we're going to
02:06 - pretend that this temperature is the
02:09 - internal temperature of a fridge so it's
02:11 - being detected by some kind of
02:13 - monitoring
02:16 - apparatus and then we're going to print
02:18 - different things depending on the
02:19 - temperature if the temperature is less
02:22 - than
02:23 - zero print fridge too
02:27 - cold if the temperature
02:30 - is 0 to 4째 C
02:35 - print fridge okay or something like that
02:39 - if the temperature
02:41 - is 4 to
02:45 - 6째 print fridge too
02:50 - warm and if the temperature is greater
02:53 - than
02:54 - 6째 you're going to
02:57 - print fridge
03:02 - broken now there is some ambiguity the
03:05 - way I've specified this for example the
03:08 - temperature of 4째 is that in this range
03:11 - or is it in this range but I'll leave it
03:14 - up to you to decide how that's going to
03:16 - work the basic thing is just to create a
03:19 - program that basically fulfills these
03:21 - criteria so you're probably going to
03:23 - want to use a if L if else type of
03:27 - statement and the conditions can be
03:30 - things involving less than or greater
03:32 - than or greater than or equal or less
03:34 - than or equal or whatever and with
03:37 - exercises generally I recommend people
03:40 - to approach them by first looking at is
03:44 - there a bit you can actually do and then
03:46 - do that bit and then the other bits that
03:49 - you can't do you might figure those out
03:52 - later on as you go along but try to find
03:55 - some part of this that you can do even
03:58 - if you have to simplify it in order to
04:00 - be able to do it then simplify it and
04:02 - write a simpler version of it and then
04:05 - you'll get some practice which is the
04:06 - whole point of this really and also
04:09 - after that after you've written a
04:11 - simplified version of
04:13 - this maybe you can change it and make it
04:16 - a bit more elaborate and make it conform
04:18 - to this specification a bit more
04:21 - accurately see how you get on don't
04:23 - stress about it and we'll take a look at
04:25 - it in the next
04:27 - video hello you've been watching a free
04:30 - sample from my Python and machine
04:32 - learning for complete beginners course
04:35 - I'm uploading enough videos from the
04:37 - start of the course to get you started
04:39 - with python and machine learning the
04:41 - full course is absolutely massive if
04:43 - you're interested in it please click the
04:45 - link in the description the complete
04:48 - course covers not only basic python but
04:50 - also some fairly Advanced python even
04:53 - some desktop programming stuff and then
04:55 - goes on to machine learning and
04:58 - artificial intelligence until next time
05:01 - happy coding
