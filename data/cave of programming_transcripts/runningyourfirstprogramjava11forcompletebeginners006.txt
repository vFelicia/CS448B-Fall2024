00:01 - hello in this video we are actually
00:04 - going to run a program
00:05 - okay so we've so far we've created
00:08 - what we call a class and
00:11 - the class is a text file with the
00:14 - extension
00:15 - dot it's uh
00:18 - in a particular location in our project
00:21 - you should have something that looks
00:22 - kind of like this hello there is the
00:25 - package and in the package is a class
00:27 - called in this case app.java
00:31 - i'm going to add some code in this
00:34 - class here and then we're going to be
00:36 - able to run it
00:38 - so here it says to do auto-generated
00:41 - method
00:42 - stub so it's telling me that
00:45 - this is automatically generated and i
00:47 - can replace
00:48 - this thing here with some code this is
00:52 - actually a comment it starts with
00:54 - two slashes if you don't have that don't
00:57 - worry
00:58 - the the really important thing is that
01:01 - you need to write some code and you need
01:02 - to write it
01:03 - in the correct place between these two
01:05 - brackets
01:07 - we'll talk a little bit about the
01:09 - structure of this class i think
01:11 - in the next video um
01:14 - but for now notice it says at the top
01:16 - it's got package and your package name
01:19 - then we've got public class and the name
01:21 - of the class which is app
01:23 - we've got two curly brackets now within
01:26 - those two curly brackets we've got this
01:29 - public static void main string array
01:32 - args
01:33 - we'll be talking about this i know it's
01:35 - all horribly complicated
01:37 - looking at the moment and within those
01:41 - two brackets
01:42 - here that's where we need to write our
01:44 - own code
01:45 - i'm going to get rid of this comment
01:47 - it's not doing anything so i'll just
01:49 - delete it
01:50 - and in there i'm going to write sis out
01:54 - i'm going to hold down on a mac
01:58 - command key and probably on windows a
02:01 - control key
02:02 - and i'm going to press the space bar
02:04 - actually what am i saying
02:05 - on a mac it's also control hold down the
02:08 - ctrl key and press the spacebar
02:10 - and what should happen is it auto
02:12 - completes
02:14 - to this it says system.out.println
02:18 - and there's a couple of round brackets
02:21 - and a semicolon
02:22 - if for some reason autocomplete is not
02:25 - working in your eclipse
02:27 - you can maybe google autocomplete
02:29 - eclipse
02:31 - try and find out why it's not working
02:33 - hopefully it should work you should be
02:35 - control and spacebar i think uh pretty
02:38 - much on any operating system
02:41 - so what that what i did it was it it
02:44 - simply takes a shortcut
02:46 - a shortcut phrase sis out sys
02:49 - s-y-s-o-u-t
02:51 - and it changes it into a bit of actual
02:54 - legitimate java code so it's just
02:57 - that's just a way of avoiding typing
02:59 - this out
03:00 - because we'll probably have to type this
03:02 - a lot and it's just
03:04 - quicker to type cis out but if you can
03:06 - be bothered if you have the patience you
03:07 - can just type
03:09 - system.out.println two round brackets
03:12 - and then a semicolon
03:14 - now i'm going to click inside these two
03:15 - round brackets and put in two speech
03:18 - marks and in fact if i type one speech
03:20 - mark
03:22 - eclipse automatically puts in the other
03:24 - one for me
03:26 - now inside those two speech marks i'm
03:28 - going to type
03:30 - hello world and this is just text and i
03:33 - can put
03:33 - what i like but you have to be aware
03:36 - that there are some special characters
03:38 - some kinds of punctuation
03:40 - uh for example like the backslash
03:42 - character which if you type that in here
03:44 - it won't work you just need some
03:46 - ordinary text in there and if you want
03:48 - you can
03:49 - have a full stop or period as you call
03:52 - it in america
03:54 - and uh you know or an exclamation mark
03:57 - or whatever
03:58 - okay that'll do the trick now i want to
04:00 - make sure that that is saved
04:02 - so i'm going to go up to the top left
04:05 - here
04:06 - and click this save all button then it
04:08 - sort of goes grey
04:11 - okay so i've got my my program and it's
04:13 - saved
04:15 - there are several different ways you can
04:16 - run it
04:18 - one way is make sure the file is
04:20 - selected app.java and click this green
04:23 - run button another way is to right click
04:26 - app.java and go to
04:29 - run as hopefully you can see that
04:32 - java application just scroll down a bit
04:35 - here
04:36 - so run as java application
04:40 - and i get that menu by right clicking it
04:42 - but what i'm going to do is just
04:44 - select app.java and click the green run
04:48 - button
04:48 - in the top left here and if you do that
04:52 - you should see some output at the bottom
04:54 - and it should say
04:55 - hello world or whatever you've typed in
04:58 - those speech marks
05:01 - um if you don't see this console tab
05:05 - you should you should see it when you
05:06 - run your program and if you don't
05:09 - in window and show
05:12 - view you can click to make sure the
05:15 - console is actually showing
05:17 - so that catches some people out but if
05:19 - you just installed eclipse the console
05:21 - should be visible
05:23 - so you see there's a bunch of tabs here
05:25 - one of them is console and that's where
05:26 - your program output appears
05:28 - okay so if you try that you should
05:32 - find that you can run the program by
05:34 - clicking that run button
05:36 - and it should say hello world if you
05:40 - if anything goes wrong um go over the
05:42 - video carefully make sure you've done
05:44 - every step correctly
05:46 - if you get any error messages type them
05:49 - into google
05:49 - or an internet search engine and um
05:53 - just search for the error message and
05:56 - see what comes up
05:57 - see what people suggest about how to fix
05:59 - the problem
06:00 - hopefully this will go smoothly and when
06:02 - you've done that
06:03 - you've run your first java program and i
06:07 - know you're you're going to be totally
06:08 - confused and in the next video
06:10 - i think we'll talk a little bit about
06:12 - this program
06:13 - and what what it is and how it works
06:17 - okay so if you can actually get it to
06:20 - run that's a major step forward it's
06:22 - really really fantastic
06:23 - and it is normal at this stage to feel
06:26 - very confused
06:27 - expect to feel confused that's normal
06:30 - okay
06:31 - until next time happy coding
