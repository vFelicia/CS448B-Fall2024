00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming comm and this is another
00:05 - video in my series on JavaScript and
00:07 - node.js for beginners in this video
00:10 - we're going to take a look at the
00:11 - identity test operator then in the next
00:15 - video we'll talk a little bit about the
00:17 - Jarvis about the history of JavaScript
00:19 - and following that we're going to get
00:20 - into actually using these for some basic
00:22 - nuts and bolts programming that is using
00:26 - the kind of equality test operators that
00:29 - we've been looking at so as always I'm
00:33 - going to start with writing you strict
00:35 - doesn't matter if I use single or double
00:37 - quotes and that forces me to declare
00:39 - variables and that's how they're very
00:41 - well called days which are set equal to
00:43 - seven and alright console.log and seven
00:48 - equals equals seven let's write days
00:54 - equals equals seven so of course this
00:56 - this will give us true actually I'm
00:58 - going to use a terminal here that's
01:00 - built into visual studio code because
01:02 - that's probably easier than switching to
01:04 - another external Basch terminal all the
01:07 - time if I go to the View menu here and
01:10 - terminal I can open a terminal okay so
01:14 - if I write node and a name of my file
01:17 - this gives me true now there's also a
01:23 - equals equals equals operator
01:26 - let's first actually put this in double
01:31 - quotes just so that I can keep track of
01:34 - what I'm doing here we're just sort of a
01:36 - comment so there's also a version of
01:40 - this operator that has three equal signs
01:42 - and we can we can call that the identity
01:44 - test operator and in this case it it
01:48 - does the same thing it gives us true in
01:51 - this particular case now the difference
01:53 - is that equals equals we'll do all kinds
01:57 - of tight conversions to try to ensure
02:00 - that you get what it thinks you want
02:02 - whereas equals equals equals is a
02:04 - stricter kind of operator is it tests
02:08 - not only equality of also type you could
02:11 - think of it as an identity test operator
02:13 - it won't do any conversions so you see
02:16 - the difference if you put the seven
02:18 - let's say in quotes so if I put a number
02:23 - in quotes it becomes texts now equals
02:26 - equals will actually convert this text
02:29 - to two the number that it it seems to
02:34 - represent helpfully does this conversion
02:37 - for me and it will give true here let's
02:40 - try it so you can see true the identity
02:45 - test operator with three equal signs
02:47 - gives me false because it doesn't do any
02:49 - conversion so it says is days which is a
02:54 - number equal to 7 is that equal is that
02:57 - equivalent or identical to the text
02:59 - seven and the answer's no because okay
03:02 - they might both represent the number
03:04 - seven in one way or another but the fact
03:06 - is this is text and this isn't this is
03:09 - referring to a number so they're
03:11 - different things so this is the Equality
03:14 - test
03:15 - operator and this is the identity test
03:17 - operator and the identity test operator
03:20 - it will not helpfully convert one thing
03:22 - to another to try to get at your meaning
03:25 - or to put it another way it will test
03:28 - both where the two two values are equal
03:31 - and also whether they have the same type
03:33 - and if they don't have the same type
03:35 - it's going to tell you false so it's a
03:38 - stricter operator there's also a not
03:42 - version of this so if I were to write
03:45 - not here and also so not equal here and
03:49 - here we've got not identical and let's
03:53 - just change these comments here
03:56 - what are these going to give me what
04:00 - about this one
04:01 - will this return true or false well is
04:05 - is days which is the number seven is it
04:09 - is it not equal to the text seven that
04:14 - danced the question and in this case I
04:17 - would say well that's false they are
04:19 - equal okay one's texts and ones are
04:22 - number
04:23 - but this single this single equals
04:28 - version of the Equality test we won't
04:31 - worry about that it will convert them it
04:32 - will convert one thing to another so
04:34 - it's as if we're doing seven not equal
04:36 - to seven and that's that's false
04:41 - because 7 is equal to 7 whereas this
04:44 - will give us true 7 not identical to the
04:47 - text 7 that's true they aren't identical
04:50 - let's just prove that that is the case
04:52 - and I'm not lying to you so first one is
04:55 - false 7 is not equal to the text 7 is
05:01 - false because they are equal and second
05:03 - one is true so of course these these two
05:07 - are just flipping what these two are
05:08 - doing so here we get true and false and
05:12 - here we get false and true all right so
05:15 - if you're happy with that then do feel
05:17 - free to move on to the next video if
05:19 - it's puzzling though then please do try
05:23 - this out especially if you're a big if
05:25 - you are literally a complete beginning
05:27 - with this try out for yourself and try
05:29 - to get your head around what's going on
05:32 - here it's a really good idea and in the
05:34 - next video I'm gonna talk a little bit
05:36 - about some relevant history here which
05:39 - might help explain why we have two
05:43 - different operators for testing what
05:45 - seems like equality okay so until next
05:48 - time happy coding
