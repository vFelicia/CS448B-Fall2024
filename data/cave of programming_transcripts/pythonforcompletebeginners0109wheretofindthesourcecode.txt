00:00 - in this video we're going to look at
00:01 - where you can find the source code for
00:04 - this course
00:05 - since building the course I've
00:07 - reorganized the source code neatly into
00:10 - folders and subfolders so you should be
00:12 - able to easily find any source code from
00:15 - the course that you're looking for so go
00:17 - to github.com
00:19 - Cave of
00:21 - programming
00:25 - you click my repositories tab you can
00:28 - see that there is this python course
00:30 - link and that's the one that you want
00:34 - the direct URL is
00:39 - github.com Cave of programming slash
00:43 - python course so you can just go there
00:45 - directly if you want
00:47 - as you can see the source code is
00:49 - organized into course sections and
00:52 - within any particular section there are
00:55 - a bunch of folders containing the source
00:57 - code for all the different lectures for
01:00 - that course
01:02 - so it's probably easiest and most
01:03 - convenient just to look at the source
01:06 - code in here
01:07 - but you can also download it if you want
01:10 - there's a Code button here and you can
01:12 - download as a zip or if you install the
01:15 - git program you can clone it with Git
01:17 - clone and this URL now I don't
01:21 - particularly recommend trying to
01:22 - download this code and running it
01:24 - because you just don't gain anything by
01:26 - doing that anything you want to learn
01:29 - it's really important to type it
01:31 - yourself but nevertheless while you are
01:33 - typing code yourself you might want to
01:36 - check out the source code without having
01:38 - to refer back to the video and so you
01:40 - can find it all here I think it's mainly
01:43 - useful for that purpose if you do
01:46 - download it and run it sometimes you'll
01:48 - need to move data files into the right
01:50 - folder or install modules and to be
01:54 - honest you just won't gain much from
01:55 - that I strongly recommend watching the
01:58 - videos and then trying to type the code
02:01 - yourself experimenting with it a little
02:03 - bit doing any exercises I give you the
02:06 - most important thing is to practice
02:11 - this is a free video from my course
02:14 - Python and machine learning for complete
02:17 - beginners I'm releasing the first couple
02:19 - of chapters of this course completely
02:22 - for free on YouTube to get you started
02:24 - with python I plan to upload new videos
02:27 - here to YouTube every Monday and every
02:31 - Thursday for at least a couple of months
02:33 - if you're interested in the complete
02:36 - course which teaches you python from
02:38 - scratch and eventually progresses to
02:41 - things like creating graphical user
02:43 - interfaces and using neural networks
02:46 - principal component analysis cluster
02:49 - analysis all that stuff and much more
02:51 - besides then you can find a link in the
02:54 - description or just go to this URL on
02:57 - the screen right here if you finish the
02:59 - whole course you'll be able to write all
03:01 - kinds of general purpose programs in
03:03 - Python and use Python to do machine
03:06 - learning and artificial intelligence as
03:09 - well thank you for watching until next
03:11 - time happy coding
