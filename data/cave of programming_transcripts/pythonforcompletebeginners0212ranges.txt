00:00 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:01 - at some more advanced uses of the range
00:06 - function supposing we want a loop that
00:09 - prints out the values 0 1 2 and
00:13 - 3 if you practiced Maybe by now you can
00:17 - already do that from memory if not don't
00:20 - worry I remember when I was learning
00:22 - this stuff myself I did have to type out
00:25 - four Loops a whole bunch of times before
00:27 - I could remember how to do them that was
00:29 - when I was originally learning to
00:31 - program and python wasn't the first
00:33 - thing that I
00:34 - learned
00:36 - so let's write 4 I in range 4 colon and
00:44 - then under that indented let's write
00:46 - print
00:47 - I so what's this going to do we're
00:50 - creating a range which Remember by
00:53 - default starts at zero and it's going to
00:56 - iterate up to four so this range is
00:59 - going going to be the numbers 0 1 2 3
01:03 - it's not going to include four at the
01:05 - end of the range
01:07 - there and if we run
01:11 - this we get 01 2 3 now there are more
01:15 - arguments that we can pass to the range
01:18 - function so one thing we can do is
01:20 - specify the start of the
01:22 - range so let's say I don't want my range
01:26 - to start at zero I want it to start at
01:30 - one I could put one
01:33 - here it has to go before the four so we
01:36 - need one comma four this is the start of
01:39 - the range which is included in the range
01:41 - of numbers this is the end of the range
01:44 - which is not included in the range of
01:46 - numbers that we will Loop
01:49 - over so if I run this we get 1 2 3 we
01:53 - can also specify a step size as the
01:56 - third argument to this function if I
01:59 - copy
02:01 - this let's have here a print that's not
02:05 - indented just to create a new line in
02:08 - the output and I'm going to paste a copy
02:10 - of that so supposing we want the
02:15 - numbers 4 6 8 10 so what do we want to
02:20 - start on we want to start on
02:22 - four and what do we want to end on 10
02:26 - but remember the range of numbers that
02:28 - we produce will not include the end here
02:31 - so we want to put 11 and now we don't
02:34 - want 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we only want 4 6 8
02:40 - 10 so we want to skip every other number
02:44 - in other words we want a step size of
02:47 - two instead of the default step size of
02:50 - one so I can put two here and then if we
02:53 - run this we get 4 6 8 10 now we can call
02:57 - this the loop counter it count counts
03:00 - which iteration of the loop we're on it
03:03 - tells you where you are in the
03:06 - loop from a certain point of view and
03:08 - you can use it in whatever way you like
03:10 - sometimes you want to repeat some code
03:12 - though and you're not interested in the
03:13 - value of any Loop counter and if you
03:17 - want to do that let's just copy
03:21 - that what you can do is just use an
03:23 - underscore here instead of a variable
03:26 - name so this could be whatever you want
03:28 - I could write hello there that's a
03:31 - strange name for a variable but I could
03:34 - do that and I could print the value of
03:36 - hello and if we run this we get 468 10
03:41 - as before but supposing I'm not
03:43 - interested in what this value is I can
03:46 - just put underscore right there and this
03:49 - is just a common convention if I could
03:51 - still print the underscore that's a
03:53 - perfectly legitimate variable name but
03:58 - the point of using an underscore
03:59 - variable name is to indicate that you're
04:01 - not actually interested in the value of
04:03 - it that's purely there so that this four
04:07 - statement actually works so let's say I
04:10 - want to print hello three
04:14 - times I could just write this so for
04:17 - underscore in range three print
04:20 - hello I'm ignoring the value of the loop
04:23 - counter and I'm just printing hello
04:25 - three times try this out for yourself
04:28 - and it's pretty easy to make up
04:30 - exercises with this so for example can
04:33 - you create a loop that
04:36 - prints hello 5 hello 10 hello 15 and
04:41 - hello 20 and then stops try it out and
04:44 - see what you can come up with hello
04:46 - you've been watching a free sample from
04:48 - my Python and machine learning for
04:50 - complete beginners course I'm uploading
04:53 - enough videos from the start of the
04:55 - course to get you started with python
04:57 - and machine learning the full course is
04:59 - absolutely massive if you're interested
05:01 - in it please click the link in the
05:04 - description the complete course covers
05:06 - not only basic python but also some
05:08 - fairly Advanced python even some desktop
05:11 - programming stuff and then goes on to
05:14 - machine learning and artificial
05:16 - intelligence until next time happy
05:19 - coding
