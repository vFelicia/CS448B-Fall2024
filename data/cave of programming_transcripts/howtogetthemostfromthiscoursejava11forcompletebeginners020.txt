00:00 - hello before we go on to look at some
00:03 - worked examples of what we've seen so
00:06 - far I've got just a few more tips for
00:08 - you and these most of them relate to the
00:11 - course specifically first of all the
00:13 - source code if you go to github.com
00:19 - slash cave of programming this is where
00:24 - I keep my public source code so you can
00:28 - look at this look at whatever you want
00:30 - but if you click on repositories' and
00:33 - then go to find Java beginners 11 in the
00:38 - list click on that you can find here all
00:41 - the source code that we're working on so
00:45 - if I want to see this source code I can
00:47 - actually browse it and see it here which
00:51 - is helpful I noticed that when I provide
00:54 - these repositories some people want to
00:57 - download the whole thing and and build
01:00 - all the applications I would recommend
01:02 - not doing that you can do it if you want
01:04 - to but I would recommend not downloading
01:07 - it because you don't learn anything like
01:09 - that really what this is best useful is
01:13 - just consulting it if you've got
01:17 - something wrong somewhere and you can't
01:18 - figure out what it is of course you can
01:22 - look back at the video but it's probably
01:24 - easier to look at this source code in
01:26 - many cases so take a take a look at that
01:29 - and if you keep it open while you work
01:31 - then you can refer back to it okay so a
01:39 - second thing that I'm going to say here
01:41 - is to get the most out of the course
01:43 - always type out code and experiment with
01:46 - it so you could you can't learn
01:49 - programming just by watching videos it's
01:52 - like learning the piano or the violin or
01:54 - learning a human language for that
01:56 - matter if you just watch videos you
01:59 - aren't going to learn it what you have
02:01 - to do is use the videos as a source of
02:05 - inspiration and information type any
02:08 - code that I type in the videos make sure
02:11 - at some point you type it out yourself
02:13 - and even better try to think how could
02:16 - you change that code without breaking a
02:19 - program try to make some meaningful
02:21 - change to it
02:22 - experiment with it and the more you do
02:25 - that the more you'll learn you will find
02:27 - sometimes you'll create bugs and errors
02:29 - maybe you won't be able to fix them but
02:32 - if you spend some time trying to figure
02:34 - out why your program doesn't work even
02:37 - if you never actually figure out why
02:39 - that is at this stage all the time you
02:43 - spend doing that puzzling over it will
02:45 - really help especially if rather than
02:48 - just looking at it you also experiment
02:50 - with it try out putting the values of
02:52 - variables you know try to try to
02:54 - experiment with it kind of physically
02:57 - change the code try to get it to work
02:59 - and to run but the main thing here is
03:02 - type everything out and also experiment
03:05 - with it a little bit try to change it
03:07 - and still have it run in a meaningful
03:10 - way and do something useful because you
03:13 - won't learn just by watching videos it's
03:17 - a practical skill like learning the
03:18 - piano let's take a look at this one so I
03:21 - would say focus on practice not
03:23 - memorization or notes and the reason
03:26 - that I say this is because I've seen
03:28 - beginners try to learn programming by
03:30 - like they have a lesson or they watch
03:32 - some videos and they make endless notes
03:35 - on it or they try to they really strain
03:37 - their brains trying to memorize
03:39 - everything and I would say that's not an
03:42 - effective way to learn the effective way
03:44 - to learn is to practice think of it just
03:47 - like learning the guitar or whatever you
03:48 - gotta practice practice is the key to it
03:50 - so don't worry too much about memorizing
03:53 - things don't worry too much about making
03:56 - notes but practice everything so
03:58 - everything that you want to learn you
04:00 - have to actually try it out yourself
04:03 - check that it works experiment with it a
04:06 - little bit if you do that enough you
04:08 - will learn programming bit by bit you
04:11 - may sometimes feel very puzzled but
04:13 - eventually you're getting the hang of it
04:15 - and it's really a question of how much
04:17 - time you spend doing that you have to
04:20 - practice and a lot of practice is going
04:23 - to be needed but the good news is that
04:26 - after a certain
04:27 - programming tends to be addictive people
04:29 - tend to get addicted to it and time
04:32 - flies by not everyone has that
04:33 - experience but many people do that you
04:36 - start writing programs and when you
04:38 - reach a certain level of fluency you you
04:41 - get into this state of mind where you're
04:43 - just curious and you think well I could
04:45 - add I could add this new feature to this
04:47 - program see if that works and it becomes
04:49 - an addictive process for many people and
04:52 - that can really help with the practice
04:54 - if you're addicted to something
04:55 - of course you'll practice it a lot don't
04:58 - forget to go outside though you know and
04:59 - take breaks don't screw yourself up with
05:02 - programming but practice is the key and
05:06 - finally this is optional learn to touch
05:09 - type touch typing means being able to
05:12 - type on your keyboard without looking at
05:16 - the keyboard now I think only about half
05:20 - of all programmers for a guess have this
05:23 - skill and the others do what we call
05:25 - hunting and pecking they hunt and peck
05:27 - so they keep looking down at their
05:29 - keyboard they use 1 2 3 however many
05:32 - fingers and they just type the
05:34 - characters one by one that's fine it's
05:37 - totally fine but if you want to learn
05:39 - even faster then learn to touch tight
05:42 - you can find free touch typing programs
05:45 - on the Internet
05:46 - if I search for free touch typing you
05:49 - can find various links it to programs
05:52 - online they use on the internet that
05:54 - teach you to touch type and it's
05:56 - actually not that hard to learn to touch
05:58 - type probably most people can do it in a
06:01 - few weeks or less especially if you
06:03 - start touch typing your emails it's
06:06 - difficult at first to make the
06:08 - transition from hunting and pecking to
06:10 - touch typing but you can learn this
06:13 - quite quite quite quickly and when you
06:15 - learnt it your typing speed will
06:17 - increase a lot
06:18 - now although typing speed isn't a big
06:20 - deal in programming you can type slowly
06:23 - and you know you're still going to still
06:26 - going to be writing programs programming
06:28 - is not primarily about typing speed it's
06:30 - not so important but a major reason that
06:34 - people get discouraged with programming
06:36 - is they just feel it's taking them too
06:39 - long and too much effort
06:40 - to write code so they avoided writing
06:42 - code and you can earn a lot more
06:44 - effectively if you touch type for this
06:46 - reason in my opinion you can learn
06:48 - faster
06:49 - because you're less discouraged from
06:51 - writing code you don't think well how
06:53 - long will it take me to type out total
06:55 - height or you know how long you don't
06:58 - think like that instead you think and
07:01 - your fingers do the typing more or less
07:03 - so touch typing can help make you less
07:07 - reluctant to type code and by doing that
07:10 - it makes it easier to learn coding
07:12 - nevertheless that is optional and
07:14 - probably half of all programmers
07:16 - something like that they just hunt and
07:18 - peck they don't learn touch typing so
07:20 - it's up to you okay so until next time
07:23 - happy coding
