00:00 - in this video we're going to look at a
00:02 - possible solution to the exercise I gave
00:05 - you last time hopefully there were at
00:08 - least some bits of this that you could
00:09 - figure out how to do if you are going to
00:12 - follow the exercises in this course if
00:14 - you didn't manage to do all of it don't
00:15 - worry about it okay so first we need to
00:18 - get the temperature and we've already
00:19 - seen how to ask the user to enter a
00:23 - number with age for
00:25 - example so let's try to do this
00:28 - temperature we we need a very
00:31 - equals input and enter the fridge
00:37 - temperature so we've already seen this
00:40 - maybe you've already practiced this a
00:42 - bit so I'm not going to run the program
00:45 - just yet so I'm confident this will work
00:48 - now let's say if the temperature is less
00:52 - than Z
00:54 - colon and then with an indent
00:58 - print fridge is too
01:02 - cold okay that's the first bit right now
01:05 - what do you think will that actually
01:07 - work no it doesn't work why not well
01:12 - let's try it so Python and fridge
01:17 - solution. Pi enter the fridge
01:19 - temperature well this bit seems okay
01:22 - five and we get a trace B the problem is
01:27 - on line
01:28 - 16 and we're trying to compare a string
01:31 - with an INT right so the temperature
01:34 - that we've got here is a string because
01:36 - it came back from this input function we
01:39 - need to convert it to a int or a
01:44 - float now we could do that right here
01:47 - but we're going to be using temperature
01:49 - over and over again so here's something
01:52 - else that we could do we can say
01:55 - temperature
01:56 - equals so let's say that this is going
01:59 - to be a float because if you've got an
02:02 - INT if the user enters an INT like five
02:05 - that can be cast to a float it can be
02:08 - interpreted as
02:10 - 5.0 but if the user enters a float and
02:13 - you try to cast that to an INT like they
02:15 - enter 5.5 how are you going to interpret
02:18 - that as an in so let's take the most
02:20 - General option and use the float
02:23 - function to cast this to a
02:27 - float so what am I actually doing here
02:30 - I'm taking temperature I'm passing it to
02:33 - the float function that returns a
02:36 - floating point value an actual numerical
02:39 - value and then I'm assigning that back
02:43 - to this temperature variable you could
02:45 - have also use a different variable here
02:47 - if you want here I'm just reusing the
02:50 - same variable so here I'm assigning to
02:53 - the variable a string and here I'm
02:56 - assigning to the variable a floating
02:58 - point value
03:00 - this might not look legitimate to you
03:03 - but it totally is we can pass
03:06 - temperature to this float function and
03:09 - then store the return value of that back
03:12 - in temperature or maybe it's better to
03:14 - say technically I can make temperature
03:17 - refer to this new numerical
03:20 - value you could have also instead just
03:23 - put float
03:26 - here that would be maybe more in keep
03:30 - with with what we've already done if you
03:31 - do this then you don't need that but we
03:35 - are going to end up in that case doing
03:36 - this over and over again and this bit
03:39 - here well this is like the if statements
03:42 - we've previously seen it's just
03:46 - that remember here we need a condition
03:48 - that evaluates to either true or false
03:51 - and for that condition I've used the
03:54 - less than binary operator to compare
03:57 - temperature with the value zero
04:01 - so let's see if this works
04:05 - now enter the fridge temperature
04:09 - five okay it doesn't print anything and
04:11 - that's what I
04:12 - expect now let's try it again enter the
04:15 - fridge
04:16 - temperature minus 4 Fridge is too cold
04:20 - so so far it works now if you did
04:22 - attempt the exercise and you couldn't
04:24 - figure it
04:25 - out then you might want to consider
04:28 - pausing the video at this point and
04:30 - seeing if you can now complete the rest
04:31 - of this program we're going to carry on
04:35 - and take a look at the rest of it now so
04:37 - if the temperature is 0 to 4 print
04:39 - fridge okay so we want L if now L if
04:45 - temperature now we already know that the
04:47 - temperature is not less than zero if it
04:50 - was less than zero this would have run
04:53 - and then we won't get to this bit so the
04:56 - temperature is not less than zero all we
04:58 - have to do is check is it less than four
05:02 - and then we can say
05:04 - print fridge
05:08 - okay then we want to see if the
05:10 - temperature is between four and six now
05:12 - we already know if we get down here that
05:17 - the temperature is not less than four so
05:19 - let's
05:20 - say l if temperature is less than
05:26 - six
05:28 - print
05:30 - fridge too
05:34 - warm now the temperature could be four
05:37 - which is probably the ideal temperature
05:38 - for a fridge actually and this would
05:41 - actually execute let's just try it and
05:43 - prove
05:44 - it so if I run it and I say the
05:47 - temperature
05:49 - is
05:51 - four it says fridge too warm so you
05:55 - could of course you could alter the
05:57 - actual temperature cut off points here
05:59 - and we could also say less than or equal
06:01 - to four if we want and then if I enter
06:05 - four it's going to say fridge
06:09 - okay now what else okay if the
06:11 - temperature is greater than six print
06:13 - fridge
06:15 - broken well if we get to this point down
06:18 - here in this sort of compound if
06:20 - statement we know that the temperature
06:22 - can't be less than six it must be at
06:24 - least six so we might as well just say
06:26 - else here and say print
06:31 - fridge is
06:33 - broken let's see if this
06:35 - works so I want to
06:38 - test all these different
06:41 - options yeah and I forgot the colon
06:43 - don't forget the
06:45 - colon all right let's try it enter the
06:49 - fridge temperature minus 4 Fridge is too
06:52 - cold let's try
06:55 - zero fridge is okay because it only says
06:58 - fridge is too
07:00 - cold if the temperature is less than
07:04 - zero so 0 to 4 I want Frid okay so
07:07 - that's correct let's try
07:09 - four still fridge okay now let's try
07:13 - five fridge too
07:16 - warm what about
07:18 - six fridge is broken now and it's going
07:21 - to be the same for higher
07:23 - temperatures like 110 or
07:27 - whatever so this is working
07:32 - now I think whether you found this
07:34 - really complicated or not it's probably
07:37 - going to depend on how much you practice
07:39 - the stuff you've seen so far and it
07:42 - probably depends a little bit on
07:43 - aptitude some people think in these kind
07:46 - of very rigid logical terms that you
07:49 - have to think in to an extent as a
07:51 - programmer more easily than others but
07:54 - do not be discouraged if you didn't
07:56 - manage to do this it was a little bit
07:58 - tricky
08:00 - and there are multiple different ways
08:01 - that you could do it as well if you got
08:03 - it working by any means then give
08:05 - yourself a pat on the back I think and
08:08 - if you didn't get it working the thing
08:10 - to do now is type this out try it out
08:13 - for yourself and then try experimenting
08:16 - with it see if you can alter it maybe to
08:19 - add in some different temperature ranges
08:21 - or
08:22 - something and then see if it works as
08:25 - you expect when you alter it so you just
08:27 - need to play around with this a little
08:29 - bit if you didn't manage to get this so
08:31 - far if you can get to the point where
08:35 - you can write this code without looking
08:37 - at it then that's a really great point
08:40 - to be at I don't say it's absolutely
08:42 - necessary to continue with the course
08:46 - but if you want some way some concrete
08:48 - way of gauging your progress so far if
08:51 - you can get to the point where you can
08:54 - write this program without referring
08:56 - back to the code and just by looking at
08:58 - the specification here then I think
09:01 - you're doing an extremely good job hello
09:03 - you've been watching a free sample from
09:06 - my Python and machine learning for
09:08 - complete beginners course I'm uploading
09:10 - enough videos from the start of the
09:12 - course to get you started with python
09:15 - and machine learning the full course is
09:17 - absolutely massive if you're interested
09:19 - in it please click the link in the
09:21 - description the complete course covers
09:24 - not only basic python but also some
09:26 - fairly Advanced python even some desk
09:29 - top programming stuff and then goes on
09:31 - to machine learning and artificial
09:33 - intelligence until next time happy
09:36 - coding
