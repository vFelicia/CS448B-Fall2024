00:17 - hello this is John from cave of
00:20 - programming calm in this tutorial we're
00:23 - going to look at fall in C++
00:27 - I totally forgotten in last video that
00:29 - we still haven't covered the most
00:31 - important type of loop in C++ and I've
00:34 - saved this one for after we covered a
00:37 - while because and do-while because it's
00:39 - a little bit more complicated but it's
00:41 - very commonly used and very very useful
00:45 - so that the for loop looks like this
00:48 - first we have the keyword for then round
00:50 - brackets and we're going to put some
00:52 - stuff in those round brackets and then
00:54 - we have the curly brackets that contain
00:56 - the code we want to execute multiple
01:00 - times now in these round brackets here
01:03 - I'm going to put two semicolons like
01:07 - that and so that that divides the the
01:11 - area in these round brackets up into
01:13 - three sections here and we're going to
01:15 - fill in each of these three sections now
01:19 - this in itself is illegal for loop so
01:22 - let's see that working there should be
01:23 - an infinite loop I'm going to type C out
01:26 - hello and endler and let's just run this
01:35 - so we see we get we've got an infinite
01:37 - loop like with while true but what we
01:40 - can do is we can put stuff in each of
01:42 - these to control precisely how many
01:45 - times the loop iterates so I'll show you
01:50 - what what we most commonly do with a for
01:53 - loop although there are many
01:55 - possibilities here so in this section
01:58 - here in the first section we're going to
02:01 - declare a variable that we're going to
02:03 - use as a loop counter I'm going to say
02:05 - int I equals naught so I've set it to
02:09 - naught to start with so this section
02:12 - here will be run before the entire loop
02:15 - runs whatever you put in there it's
02:17 - going to run before the loop starts in
02:20 - this second section here we put a
02:24 - condition which the loop will execute as
02:28 - long as the condition
02:29 - the second section is true so this is
02:33 - where we put a condition that similar to
02:35 - what we had in the round brackets for
02:37 - the while loop or a do-while loop so
02:39 - what we typically put in here is going
02:41 - to be something like I less than let's
02:43 - say 10 so if you want a for loop to
02:49 - execute let's say 5 times you typically
02:53 - put I equals nor I less than 5 in here
02:55 - so that's going to be the number of
02:57 - times you want the loop to execute and
02:59 - notice that we've got I less than 10
03:02 - we're not saying less than or equal to
03:04 - 10 because the first iteration of the
03:07 - loop has I equal to 0 and the last
03:09 - iteration will have I equal to 9 and
03:12 - that's a total of 10 iterations and then
03:16 - finally we park on we put something in
03:19 - the third section here which will be
03:21 - executed after every time the loop has
03:24 - run once so what I'm going to do is put
03:28 - I plus plus in here which you'll recall
03:29 - I just Inc increments I increases the
03:33 - value of it by 1 so we're going to start
03:37 - with I equal to 0 the loop will keep
03:38 - going as long as I is less than 10 and
03:40 - after every time the loop as has rung
03:43 - this is going to increase the value of I
03:46 - by 1 and to see that working let's just
03:48 - put in here
03:51 - let's put I in there so we can see the
03:54 - value of it I'm going to save that and
03:56 - run it and here we can see that we've
04:01 - got 10 iterated iterations of the loop
04:03 - from 0 to 9 so you can miss out any of
04:06 - these sections or as we've seen all of
04:08 - them and you don't have to you don't
04:11 - have to follow and this kind of stuff
04:13 - you don't have to put this kind of stuff
04:14 - in there you can get creative and put
04:17 - all kinds of things in these 3 different
04:20 - sections but this is the most typical
04:22 - usage you will say something like for
04:24 - int I equals naught is less than 10 or
04:28 - whatever I plus plus and after you type
04:31 - this a few times you just get into the
04:34 - swing of remembering these conditions
04:38 - so although this looks quite complicated
04:40 - it is pretty simple really and to
04:44 - practice this and I would advise that
04:48 - you certainly go and type out a for loop
04:50 - and try to try to get to the point where
04:53 - you can type this whole thing without
04:56 - referring back to to this code so try to
04:59 - get to the point where you can remember
05:01 - this and create loops that iterate a
05:04 - precise number of times that you decided
05:06 - on an experiment with it a bit as well
05:08 - see what happens if you miss out the
05:10 - different sections notice that I is
05:15 - usually if we declare a variable like I
05:19 - within curly brackets is available
05:21 - within those curly brackets but there
05:23 - are some situations where you can
05:25 - declare and I in round brackets that
05:28 - precede the curly brackets and then once
05:31 - again I is now available within these
05:33 - brackets so the scope of I you say scope
05:36 - of this variable is these curly brackets
05:39 - we can use either but we can't refer to
05:41 - I down here if I say something like I
05:44 - equals 5 or whatever it's not going to
05:48 - let me do that if I try to build this
05:49 - project it's it's not going to build
05:52 - them so I have to save it first and
05:55 - project build so we see that I is not
05:59 - available down here but it is available
06:01 - within the curly brackets so as always
06:04 - don't forget to indents your code by one
06:06 - tab and extra tab within these curly
06:09 - brackets and if you have any doubt at
06:12 - all about your formatting just right
06:14 - click or use the keyboard shortcut and
06:16 - go to an source and format
06:22 - so that's it for this tutorial and until
06:25 - next time help you coding
06:38 - you
