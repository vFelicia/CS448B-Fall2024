00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:03 - a look at doing calculations so let's
00:07 - say I've got some people and their
00:10 - average height is one point let's say
00:15 - six seven meters so double height equals
00:20 - one point six seven now let's say I want
00:23 - to know I've got seven of these people
00:25 - and they're they're performing acrobats
00:27 - and they're going to all stand on each
00:29 - of those shoulders and I want to know
00:31 - how high seven of them will be standing
00:34 - on each other's shoulders so I could
00:36 - just write this out height times seven
00:41 - or if I if I like I could write seven
00:43 - point naught here it makes no difference
00:45 - and if I run that I find that the answer
00:48 - is seven of them on top of each other
00:51 - are going to be eleven point six nine
00:52 - meters high now what I could also do is
00:56 - I could write double let's say result
00:59 - equals height times seven and then I
01:04 - could output the result let's run this
01:09 - and we should get the same well the same
01:11 - result okay now there is one thing that
01:16 - beginners often tend to do which is a
01:19 - bad idea which is that beginners are
01:22 - liable to give variable names really
01:24 - short letters like are occasionally
01:29 - that's appropriate typically when you're
01:31 - using mathematical equations and a
01:33 - convention is that you would use for
01:35 - example an X or a Y then it makes sense
01:38 - to just use one letter but most of the
01:40 - time don't give variables one letter
01:42 - names because it gets very confusing
01:45 - another thing is in general don't give
01:48 - variables vague names so here I've
01:51 - written result what does that mean it
01:53 - really tells me nothing about what I'm
01:58 - actually doing here so it will be better
02:00 - to give it a more specific name give it
02:02 - the most meaningful name that you can
02:05 - you can also even use multiple words in
02:08 - your variables so I could create a
02:11 - variable called total
02:12 - Haight and what I do is by convention in
02:16 - the convention that Java usually uses
02:20 - the first word in your variable has a
02:23 - lowercase first letter so the variable
02:25 - starts with a lowercase first letter but
02:28 - any word after that has an uppercase
02:30 - first letter so total height will be
02:33 - written like this that makes it easy to
02:36 - read and it's also meaningful so it if
02:43 - okay if you don't know exactly what
02:45 - you're calculating and just kind of
02:47 - making something up to see how it goes
02:48 - then it might make sense to write result
02:51 - here but if you possibly can give your
02:54 - variable and meaningful name it's better
02:56 - to make it excessively long than to make
03:00 - it excessively cryptic by making it too
03:03 - short and too meaningless
03:04 - it makes your programs a lot easier to
03:06 - read okay so we're we're here creating
03:11 - the total height of seven people stood
03:13 - on top of each other now supposing they
03:16 - also have a flagpole the height of the
03:19 - flagpole are defining another variable
03:21 - so like this double flagpole height
03:25 - let's call it equals let's say the
03:31 - flagpole is two meters high I'll write
03:34 - to point naught and in fact this height
03:39 - here well that's not very meaningful
03:41 - because now I've got multiple Heights in
03:43 - my program I want to change it so that
03:47 - we have this site and this site wherever
03:50 - I've used height I want it to say person
03:53 - height rather than do that by hand since
03:56 - I've got multiple versions of it I'm
03:59 - going to right click and I'm going to go
04:02 - to source and I'll go to no sorry I'm
04:09 - going to go to refactor so right click
04:11 - it go to refactor rename and type a new
04:14 - name so I'm going to type here person
04:18 - height and it corrects all of all of my
04:24 - variables that are called height it
04:26 - it corrects the specific variable that I
04:29 - want to change okay so we've got the
04:31 - height of a person we've got a flagpole
04:34 - height we're calculating the total
04:36 - height of seven people on top of each
04:38 - other and I also want to add the height
04:41 - of the flagpole on toques I want to know
04:43 - how high the whole thing is seven people
04:45 - on top of each other and the top on is
04:47 - waving a flag pole holding it presumably
04:50 - by the very end of it using his or her
04:53 - fingertips let's run this I've got to
04:56 - save it first and so this this is what
04:59 - we originally have at eleven point six
05:01 - nine so if I add the flagpole height we
05:04 - should get thirteen point six nine let's
05:07 - add that in plus flagpole and to save me
05:12 - typing out the variable I can hold down
05:15 - control and press space and then it
05:18 - brings up a list of suggestions and I
05:21 - can hit return to select the first one
05:24 - okay let's let's run this and now we get
05:28 - thirteen point six nine one last thing I
05:32 - want to bring to your attention is that
05:34 - this looks ambiguous this expression
05:37 - because does it mean person height times
05:39 - seven and then add the flagpole height
05:42 - or does it mean person height times 7
05:46 - plus the flagpole height so you could
05:49 - add 7 to the float pole height and then
05:52 - multiply the person height by that or
05:54 - you could add 7 to person height and
05:56 - then add the flagpole height there are
05:58 - things there are rules called operator
06:01 - precedence rules which we're going to
06:04 - talk about a bit but for now when you
06:07 - have an expression like this and this is
06:08 - really good practice anyway put round
06:11 - brackets in to make it less ambiguous so
06:14 - if I put round brackets around this part
06:16 - that makes it clear that I'm adding
06:19 - multiplying the person height by 7 and
06:21 - after that I'm adding the float pole
06:23 - height hopefully you understand what I
06:25 - mean because the other the other thing
06:28 - that we could have done instead is I
06:31 - could add 7 to the flagpole height and
06:34 - multiply the person height by that but
06:36 - that gives us something else it's not
06:38 - what we want in this
06:41 - here we get 15 point zero three but what
06:44 - I want is to add the person hi what
06:50 - sorry multiply it by seven and then add
06:52 - the flagpole height let's run this okay
06:57 - soon I'm going to give you an exercise
06:58 - with this but there was a lot in that
07:01 - video
07:02 - so what I would recommend is that type
07:07 - this out yourself and run it and get it
07:08 - working and then make up your own little
07:11 - program think of something you could
07:13 - calculate no matter how silly we're not
07:16 - standing on pride here it's good to
07:18 - experiment with silly ideas think of
07:20 - something you could calculate and try to
07:23 - calculate it and let's put a comment on
07:25 - here in here with two slashes and I'm
07:29 - gonna write calculate height of seven
07:33 - people plus a flagpole there we go okay
07:40 - try it out for yourself and then try to
07:42 - make up a little program that does a
07:43 - calculation and see how you get on and
07:46 - until next time happy coding
