00:01 - hello in this video we're going to
00:03 - continue looking at format specifiers
00:05 - and I'll show you an answer to the last
00:08 - exercise that we looked at
00:10 - so the exercise was to change this to
00:14 - have nice round pot so we don't want it
00:16 - to say thirty two point seven seven
00:19 - seven we want maybe one or two decimal
00:21 - places there let's let's maybe get rid
00:26 - of this because I don't think we're
00:28 - going to need it these are some examples
00:31 - from the last video of using printf and
00:33 - format specifiers so to change this so
00:38 - that it outputs Celsius to two decimal
00:40 - places the first step is to change this
00:43 - to printf now if you try to do the
00:46 - exercise on the last video and you
00:47 - couldn't do it feel free to pause this
00:50 - video at any moment and then try to do
00:52 - it when you feel you've got enough hints
00:54 - of how to do it okay so I'm changing
00:58 - this to printf and then because I want a
01:00 - new line at the end I'm going to put a
01:03 - backslash n in it although that doesn't
01:06 - make any visible difference here because
01:08 - I've only got one line being output so
01:11 - if I change this to printf you can't
01:14 - tell that it's there's no new line at
01:17 - the end of it because there's only one
01:19 - line anyway but let's put that in in
01:20 - case we output more lines so I'm going
01:23 - to put backslash n at the end and that
01:26 - doesn't look any different so far okay
01:30 - so instead of putting Celsius here
01:34 - instead of concatenating it into the
01:36 - string I'm going to just have one string
01:41 - and I'm going to put percent F in it and
01:44 - then after so then this is one complete
01:51 - argument to printf it's it's one single
01:53 - string because i'm concatenating this
01:56 - string sorry this double value or yeah
02:00 - it's double value i'm concatenating that
02:03 - with this string to make one single
02:05 - string so now I'm going to put a comma
02:09 - in and I'm going to supply a second
02:11 - argument the second argument is going to
02:13 - be the value in Celsius converted value
02:17 - so that's going to be substituted into
02:20 - this percent F here let's run it okay so
02:24 - now it looks how it did originally but
02:27 - the value of doing this is that we can
02:29 - now specify how many decimal places we
02:32 - want so we can say percent let's say
02:37 - point one I just have one decimal place
02:39 - percent point one F and if we run that
02:42 - now it looks a lot nicer in fact it
02:46 - looks like is even rounded up the value
02:48 - it's a thirty two point eight which is
02:50 - great I could also do that with
02:54 - Fahrenheit so I could get rid of this
02:56 - concatenation here and here I could at
02:59 - the start I could put percent yeah let's
03:03 - say point one again percent point one F
03:06 - so now the first format specifier is
03:10 - that the value in Fahrenheit so that's
03:12 - going to be my first argument after this
03:15 - argument so the second argument I'm
03:17 - gonna write far n height and then the
03:22 - third argument is Celsius and it's going
03:24 - to replace this so that they're
03:25 - replacing these these arguments here
03:29 - second and third arguments to this
03:31 - printf method or replacing the format
03:34 - specifiers in order you know so the
03:38 - first first one is Fahrenheit second one
03:41 - is Celsius okay
03:43 - let's run that and well it looks great
03:47 - ninety one point zero degrees Fahrenheit
03:48 - is 32 point eight degrees Celsius
03:51 - hopefully that's correct
03:54 - I'm just wondering whether I should put
03:56 - anything else in this video there are
03:58 - other things I can tell you here we will
04:03 - perhaps leave it there for this video
04:05 - try that out yourself and get it working
04:08 - and see how it looks okay so until next
04:12 - time happy coding
