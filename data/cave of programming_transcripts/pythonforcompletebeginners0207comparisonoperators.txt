00:00 - in this video we're going to look at
00:01 - some more comparison operators in Python
00:06 - we're going to look at these if you
00:08 - start a line in Python with a hash sign
00:12 - like
00:13 - this or if you put that anywhere on a
00:16 - line in Python whatever comes after it
00:19 - on that line is a comment so you can use
00:22 - this hash symbol to add comments to your
00:25 - code some programs go overboard with
00:27 - this but it's probably much more common
00:30 - that programmers don't put enough
00:31 - comments into their
00:34 - code as a beginner you might feel like
00:36 - putting a lot of comments into your code
00:38 - or not it's up to you I would suggest in
00:41 - general that comments should be added to
00:43 - code in cases where you're writing a
00:45 - block of code and it's really not
00:47 - obvious what it does so you maybe want
00:50 - to make a note to say what that code is
00:54 - supposed to be doing but of course you
00:56 - have to keep your comments up to date if
00:58 - you change the code or otherwise they'll
01:00 - get misleading so let's take a look at
01:02 - these operators we've already seen the
01:04 - equality test operator equals equals we
01:08 - could write for example print let's try
01:12 - cat equals equals cat
01:15 - now on the face of it this looks useless
01:18 - but of course one or both of these
01:20 - strings would normally be a variable so
01:24 - it wouldn't be obvious what the result
01:26 - is going to be if I run this since
01:29 - they're both string literals of course
01:31 - we get true if I change one of them to
01:35 - something else then we're going to get
01:37 - false pretty
01:39 - straightforward and we've seen also that
01:41 - you can use this operator with
01:46 - integers so if I write here
01:49 - 5al equal 6 what's that going to
01:54 - return well this is going to evaluate to
01:59 - false and so we print false it's not a
02:02 - good idea to use equals equals with
02:04 - floating Point values because floating
02:07 - Point values are not stored precisely in
02:10 - the computer's memory so you can get
02:12 - misleading results from doing that with
02:14 - floating Point values the question you
02:17 - would want to be asking instead
02:19 - is is this floating point value close to
02:23 - this other floating point value rather
02:26 - than asking if they're equal which is
02:29 - not necessary as meaningful as you might
02:31 - think under the circumstances
02:34 - here but with integers equals equals
02:37 - works really well we've also got less
02:41 - than so we could write print five less
02:45 - than
02:47 - six well that should be true right so it
02:50 - says true and we've got greater
02:54 - than so 5 greater than 6 of course
02:58 - that's false now useful trick for
03:01 - remembering the difference between
03:03 - greater than and less than if you're not
03:05 - used to them they are found in
03:07 - mathematics as
03:09 - well is let's just zoom in a
03:13 - bit if you look at these symbols they
03:16 - both have a sort of big end to them and
03:18 - a small end right there's a big end
03:21 - there a small
03:22 - end if the smaller value is at the
03:24 - smaller end and the bigger value is at
03:27 - the bigger end then the whole thing
03:28 - evaluates to true
03:30 - if it's the other way around so in this
03:32 - case you've got the smaller value at the
03:34 - big end and a bigger value at the small
03:36 - end then these Expressions evaluate to
03:39 - false and you can see that works we've
03:41 - got true and false here
03:44 - it's the right way round so to speak and
03:48 - here it's the wrong way round
03:50 - surprisingly these also work with
03:52 - strings so we could say print cat
03:56 - greater than
03:58 - dog of course this is a topic that
04:01 - brings out strong opinions but leaving
04:03 - that aside is this going to be true or
04:07 - false let's run it and
04:09 - see so it's
04:11 - false why well this is basically doing
04:14 - an alphabetical comparison and dog
04:17 - occurs later in the alphabet than cat so
04:21 - in a sense dog is greater than cat here
04:25 - on the other hand watch what happens if
04:27 - I give dog a capital letter at the
04:31 - start so we did get false remember now
04:34 - we get true why is
04:37 - that well strictly speaking this isn't
04:40 - exactly an alphabetical comparison in
04:43 - fact every letter has a
04:46 - number in the Unicode table of
04:50 - characters and it's using those numbers
04:53 - to do the
04:54 - comparison you can find out what the
04:56 - numbers of letters are using the OD
04:58 - function let's print OD this is a
05:01 - built-in
05:02 - function and let's try it
05:06 - on C and we'll also try it on
05:11 - D and what we find is
05:15 - that the number of C in the Unicode
05:18 - character set is
05:20 - 99 and the number of D is only 68 so if
05:25 - we go to a browser and we search for
05:28 - Unicode table or something like
05:31 - that so we've got a table at this site
05:34 - unic cod.com it's pretty
05:37 - good and we can see here that in fact
05:40 - the capital letters occur in this table
05:43 - before the lowercase letters which
05:45 - explains why the capital letters have
05:49 - lower numbers associated with them than
05:52 - the lowercase letters so you can use
05:55 - less than and greater than with strings
05:57 - as well as with integers we've also got
06:00 - not equals so let's do
06:03 - print
06:05 - cat not equal
06:08 - to dog is that true or false well it's
06:12 - true because uh cat the text is not
06:15 - equal to this text dog so we get true
06:19 - there and we've got less than or equal
06:22 - to and greater than or equal to let's
06:25 - try we'll try numbers this time so
06:30 - five greater than or equal
06:34 - to 6 is that true or
06:37 - false it's false five is not greater
06:41 - than six it's also not equal to six so
06:45 - this is
06:46 - false let's try
06:49 - five less than or equal to five is this
06:53 - true or false well five is not less than
06:56 - five but it is equal to five so
06:59 - 5 less than or equal to 5 is actually
07:03 - true and that comes back
07:07 - true now what I'd suggest you do with
07:10 - these is as always I don't recommend
07:14 - stressing about memorizing this stuff
07:17 - but I do very strongly recommend trying
07:18 - it out try this out try out all of these
07:23 - operators with your own integers and
07:26 - strings check if they behave as you
07:28 - expect and if you find anything
07:31 - unexpected try to figure out why it
07:34 - doesn't work quite as you expect you can
07:37 - always come back to this code right
07:40 - here and if you're really unsure about
07:42 - this stuff then a good way to start is
07:45 - just literally typing out this it's
07:48 - really surprising how typing code out
07:51 - helps you become familiar with
07:54 - it it's as if a lot of the learning
07:57 - really does take place in your finger I
07:59 - find that once I've typed code it's then
08:02 - much easier to understand it after I've
08:04 - typed it so try all these out for
08:06 - yourself don't stress about memorizing
08:08 - them we're going to be using them as we
08:10 - go through the course but definitely do
08:12 - try them out hello you've been watching
08:14 - a free sample from my Python and machine
08:17 - learning for complete beginners course
08:19 - I'm uploading enough videos from the
08:21 - start of the course to get you started
08:24 - with python and machine learning the
08:26 - full course is absolutely massive if
08:28 - you're interested in it please click the
08:30 - link in the description the complete
08:33 - course covers not only basic python but
08:35 - also some fairly Advanced python even
08:38 - some desktop programming stuff and then
08:40 - goes on to machine learning and
08:42 - artificial intelligence until next time
08:45 - happy coding
