00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming calm now this is kind of a
00:05 - optional tutorial because I'm going to
00:07 - show you how to use my sequel on the
00:09 - command line if you don't know the
00:11 - command line for your system if you
00:14 - don't know command line console commands
00:16 - then you're going to get lost in this
00:18 - tutorial but I would advise watching it
00:20 - anyway because it will give you a little
00:22 - bit more insight into how my sequel
00:25 - works but don't worry about it because
00:28 - we're going to be using the workbench in
00:30 - subsequent tutorials
00:31 - so now that I've installed my sequel and
00:34 - I've made sure that it's stopped it's
00:36 - not started at the moment I'm going to
00:39 - go to terminal on my Mac so Windows has
00:42 - a Windows console and of course you have
00:44 - a terminal in whatever version of Linux
00:47 - you're using as well now my my sequel is
00:51 - actually installed I tracked it down to
00:53 - the following directory this is just for
00:55 - my particular system I'm going to go to
00:58 - slash user local my sequel and of course
01:03 - on Windows the commands that you see
01:05 - here are going to be different so you
01:08 - know you could either learn Windows
01:10 - console commands or just skip this
01:11 - tutorial as well as I say let's go to
01:14 - that directory here's my actual my
01:18 - sequel installation now if we go to bin
01:21 - here we'll see there are lots of
01:24 - programs in there and there are two
01:25 - really important ones one is called my
01:28 - sequel D and that's the actual server
01:31 - program it's your actual database itself
01:34 - so we could start that from a
01:36 - command-line if we added this directory
01:39 - the directory I'm in to the path
01:43 - environment variable and again if you
01:45 - google file to do that for example
01:46 - Windows 7 path environment variable or
01:50 - you know Linux add to path environment
01:54 - variable then you could add that
01:56 - directory there and then you'll be able
01:58 - to type these commands these programs
02:01 - that you see here from any location in
02:03 - your terminal otherwise you're going to
02:04 - have to change to that this directory
02:06 - before you can run these so let's try
02:09 - and run the my sequel
02:11 - my sequel server on the command line so
02:14 - to do that on a Mac and probably on
02:17 - Windows I have to use the sudo command
02:19 - to run this as admin and again this is
02:21 - not going to apply to Windows let's run
02:23 - sudo slash my sequel my sequel D and I'm
02:29 - going to specify - new root this
02:33 - specifies use the root user which is the
02:35 - kind of default user for my sequel if
02:38 - you specify the password you'll also
02:40 - need to say - P and your password like
02:43 - let me in for example with no spaces
02:45 - afterlife and P but I haven't specified
02:48 - a password so I just need this let's run
02:51 - this you'll have to enter yours your
02:54 - admin password you'll use a password if
02:57 - you haven't already run sudo
02:59 - if you're using Linux or Mac that is so
03:03 - now we can see it started up
03:04 - successfully I'm going to start a new
03:06 - terminal let's go to Shell new window
03:11 - with basic settings again this is just
03:14 - much stuff but this is standard UNIX
03:17 - UNIX command line stuff so this will be
03:21 - the same or very similar on Linux again
03:24 - I'll go to that directory so it's less
03:26 - user local my sequel bin and now I can
03:33 - connect with the my sequel command-line
03:36 - tool so I'm going to just type mice well
03:39 - I have to type dot slash my sequel on
03:42 - Windows it would just be the command
03:43 - name without the dot slash or at least
03:45 - last time I use Windows that was the
03:47 - case - new root and I run that now I've
03:52 - gotten my sequel command line so there
03:54 - are two programs here my sequel D the
03:57 - actual server itself the actual database
03:59 - and there's also that my sequel
04:02 - command-line tool which enables you to
04:04 - connect like database as a client as we
04:07 - say you're a client connecting to that
04:10 - database server and we're going to be
04:14 - issuing these commands in the workbench
04:16 - in future but I just wanted to show you
04:18 - this to help explain how this all works
04:20 - now I can issue a my sequel command and
04:22 - on the command line
04:24 - you have to terminate your commands with
04:26 - a semicolon so the simplest command that
04:28 - we can start off with is Shou space
04:31 - databases semicolon and ahead return and
04:34 - these are the different databases that
04:37 - I've got already by default in my my
04:40 - sequel server so you'll probably see
04:42 - something there hopefully you will and
04:45 - so although we've got one database
04:48 - server program we can have different
04:50 - databases in that so the different
04:52 - databases can be used for example by
04:53 - different programs or we can create a
04:56 - new database in there whenever we want
04:59 - to practice my sequel now I'm going to
05:01 - just quit that now so I'll type quit and
05:04 - it just says bye and we can close this
05:07 - to actually shut down this server from a
05:10 - terminal and you could like on Windows
05:13 - you could use your process manager or I
05:16 - forget what it's called on Windows but
05:17 - you have something that you can bring
05:18 - got to just shut down force processes to
05:21 - quit I'm going to use kind of UNIX
05:24 - command line here again and I'm going to
05:26 - go to shell new window on my Mac and so
05:30 - this if you're not familiar with this
05:32 - don't worry at all but I'm gonna type PS
05:34 - - EF - give me a list of processes in
05:37 - UNIX and I can then actually modify that
05:40 - by saying a pipe character and in same
05:44 - grep of my sequel and I will narrow down
05:46 - the list of processes in the UNIX type
05:49 - system to show you which ones are
05:51 - running that I have my sequel in the
05:54 - name so if I do that we can see that my
05:57 - sequel D is running here and that's the
05:59 - process ID a57 so I'm gonna say sudo to
06:03 - run as admin kill eight five seven and
06:08 - we've hopefully shut it down
06:11 - well it doesn't look very shutdown so
06:13 - let's try this ya fit actually we need
06:15 - this one here 909 let's try that the
06:20 - first one was the actual finger I'm
06:22 - typing now I just run that and with a
06:25 - bit of luck yeah it shut down so if you
06:28 - have if you do try this and you get lost
06:31 - then you
06:32 - problems shutting it down the thing to
06:34 - do would be just restart your computer
06:35 - hopefully after that it will work as
06:38 - normal and I will repeat my advice that
06:41 - if you do get into any difficulties with
06:43 - this you can't resolve them don't be
06:46 - afraid to Google it varies from system
06:48 - to system what you'll have to do but
06:50 - someone will have run into the error
06:52 - almost certainly that you're
06:53 - encountering and you can find that
06:55 - usually via Google searches so this all
06:58 - looks good and in the next tutorial
07:00 - we're going to connect via to my sequel
07:02 - workbench instead of via the my sequel
07:04 - client and we're going to start issuing
07:07 - commands so until next time happy coding
