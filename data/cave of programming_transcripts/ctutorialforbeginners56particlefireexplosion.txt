00:16 - hello this is John from cave of
00:20 - programming calm
00:21 - we're continuing our c++ tutorial
00:24 - tutorial for beginners here and if
00:27 - you've got this far congratulations
00:28 - because we've covered a lot of topics
00:31 - without so far building an actual
00:35 - program that actually does something and
00:38 - in the rest of this tutorial we're gonna
00:40 - I'm going to show you how to build this
00:42 - program I've called it particle
00:44 - explosion let's just run this and what
00:47 - this is is it's a program that manages a
00:52 - bunch of virtual particles which appear
00:54 - on the screen gradually change color and
00:57 - kind of circle around each other we've
00:59 - also got a nice blur effect here going
01:02 - on as well
01:03 - the reason I've chosen to build this
01:05 - program is well a variety of reasons one
01:09 - reason is that it gives you an extremely
01:11 - good workout with C++ so we're going to
01:14 - see some new concepts in the concept in
01:16 - their context of creating this program
01:19 - and some of those is going to be quite
01:23 - tricky but I'm going to explain
01:25 - everything as we go along along the way
01:28 - this also uses some mathematics but
01:32 - don't worry if your if your mathematics
01:35 - is not so good because we'll just be
01:38 - using some simple stuff like trig
01:39 - functions and you don't need to
01:41 - understand trigonometry to to be able to
01:45 - build this you can just use them this is
01:48 - my favorite bit by the way we get this
01:49 - sort of nest of white particles which
01:53 - initially have a kind of blue fringe
01:56 - another reason I chose this besides the
01:58 - fact that it really gets into some
02:01 - really good C++ is that it's not just a
02:07 - pretty pattern well this particular
02:09 - program is kind of just a pretty pattern
02:12 - but firstly particle explosions like
02:16 - this are widely used in for example
02:19 - games so if you're interested in games
02:21 - programming you will you'll learn
02:23 - some of the basics of games programming
02:26 - techniques by following this tutorial
02:30 - actual particle explosions are are often
02:34 - used to simulate fire or to simulate
02:36 - actual explosions in games and they're
02:39 - also used in artificial intelligence
02:43 - this is not an AI program but you could
02:46 - adapt this without too too much trouble
02:49 - to create a program that uses swarms of
02:52 - particles to actually for example find
02:55 - approximate solutions to equations which
02:57 - is something that I've played with a bit
02:59 - in the past and it's not too hard to get
03:02 - it to work you can have all these
03:04 - particles here you can think of them as
03:06 - being like a swarm of flies that are
03:08 - searching for food and you can get those
03:11 - virtual flies to search for food by
03:14 - finding the solution to an equation so
03:17 - if you are interested in AI you could
03:19 - take this further and build this into an
03:21 - artificial intelligence program and if
03:23 - you're not if like me you quite like to
03:26 - see interesting patterns then you bite
03:30 - just by tweaking this program you can
03:32 - create all kinds of effects you can
03:34 - create fountains and you can grow get
03:37 - particles to bounce around the screen or
03:39 - orbit around each other or whatever lots
03:43 - of interesting things you can do so yeah
03:47 - I think that's all I want to say for for
03:50 - this tutorial oh yeah and also if you
03:52 - are into mathematics then these particle
03:54 - explosions give you a lot of opportunity
03:57 - for tweaking them and creating sort of
04:00 - mathematical simulations of how objects
04:02 - move so starting in the next tutorial
04:07 - I'm going to show you how to build this
04:09 - and we're going to use STL which is a
04:12 - free kind of games programming framework
04:16 - or a media framework for C++ it doesn't
04:19 - give you many facilities in the way of
04:21 - for example creating 3d games or
04:23 - anything but it allows you to draw stuff
04:26 - on the screen draw images if you want to
04:28 - and use sound as well
04:31 - now actually distributing a program can
04:34 - be quite challenging I'll make a few
04:36 - remarks about this but creating
04:39 - installers and things like that is
04:41 - outside the scope of this tutorial but
04:44 - for most platforms you can probably just
04:47 - by doing a bit of googling you can
04:49 - figure out relatively painlessly how to
04:51 - distribute this program you'll just have
04:53 - to distribute a dynamic link library
04:56 - file along with it which will be called
04:59 - dot DLL on Windows and for this program
05:02 - I'm working on the Mac it was dot by Lib
05:05 - but anyway what we'll get into that a
05:08 - bit later on although as I say actually
05:11 - creating installs and things that's
05:13 - outside the scope of this tutorial
05:15 - ok so we'll start coding this in the
05:19 - next in the next video and until next
05:21 - time happy coding
05:30 - you
