00:00 - in this video I want to talk about
00:02 - something which is called a shabang or
00:04 - hashbang and this only applies if you
00:07 - are using a Unix like system so Mac or
00:10 - Linux or Unix basically not Windows
00:14 - however if you are using Windows stay
00:16 - tuned because I just want to make a
00:17 - couple of remarks about this hello world
00:22 - program now this should work fine if you
00:25 - set up your virtual environment and it
00:28 - was all working correctly so I don't
00:30 - think you should have any problems with
00:31 - this if you do get any error
00:33 - messages then I would suggest copying
00:36 - them and putting them in Google and
00:38 - seeing what comes up earlier versions of
00:40 - python actually let you type this
00:43 - statement without the round brackets but
00:46 - Python 3 does not let you do that so if
00:49 - you see code on the internet and it
00:51 - looks like this and it claims to be
00:53 - python code but it's not got round
00:56 - brackets in it that's for an old version
00:58 - of python it doesn't work anymore and
01:01 - the reason we've written print here is
01:04 - technically what we're doing is we say
01:06 - we're calling the print function we're
01:09 - basically running some code which has
01:11 - the name print and a reason it's called
01:14 - print is because when we display things
01:17 - on the
01:18 - console in computer programming
01:20 - generally we call that printing so
01:23 - printing in the lingo doesn't mean
01:26 - printing it out on a printer it means
01:29 - displaying text on a console so what
01:32 - we've done here is to print the text
01:34 - hello
01:35 - world and we also often call a string of
01:39 - characters like this we call it a
01:43 - string now with that out the way let's
01:45 - take a look at the main topic of this
01:47 - particular video the shebang so this
01:50 - will not apply if you're using Windows
01:52 - but I want to show it to you for the
01:54 - sake of completeness and even if you are
01:56 - using Windows maybe you will use a
01:59 - different platform one day perhaps in a
02:01 - job so on a Unix like platform we can
02:06 - type which python to find out the
02:10 - location of the Python program that
02:12 - we're actually
02:14 - running so the actual python interpreter
02:17 - that interprets the program we've
02:19 - written I see it's here so I'm just
02:22 - going to copy all of
02:24 - that and I'm going to go to the top here
02:27 - and
02:28 - type
02:31 - what you could call a hash sign and then
02:34 - a exclamation mark and I'm going to put
02:36 - this in and what that does is it tells
02:40 - your operating system to use this
02:43 - program to run this program the one that
02:45 - we've
02:48 - typed to actually run it I need to tell
02:51 - my operating system that the current
02:53 - user me has permission to run this file
02:58 - as an executable program program as a
03:00 - program in other words and I can do that
03:03 - by typing
03:06 - chod this is for modifying file
03:09 - permissions U plus X that means add
03:14 - execute permissions for the current user
03:17 - and then the file name which is
03:19 - hello.py and once I've done that I can
03:21 - run it like this I can type do/
03:25 - hello.py and it will actually
03:28 - run
03:31 - so once again this doesn't work on
03:32 - Windows but I'm going to often do this
03:36 - in this tutorial so I wanted to show it
03:39 - to you if for no other reason than
03:42 - that now the actual current directory is
03:45 - is this bit and I can replace the
03:46 - current directory with a DOT if I'm
03:49 - always going to run it from this
03:51 - directory and that still
03:56 - works so I'm going to be running
03:58 - programs both ways I'll use this shebang
04:01 - quite
04:02 - often and other times I'm just going to
04:04 - type Python and the name of the program
04:06 - it's the same either way this is a free
04:10 - video from my course Python and machine
04:13 - learning for complete beginners I'm
04:15 - releasing the first couple of chapters
04:17 - of this course completely for free on
04:20 - YouTube to get you started with python I
04:23 - plan to upload new videos here to
04:25 - YouTube every Monday and every Thursday
04:29 - for at least a couple of months if
04:31 - you're interested in the complete course
04:34 - which teaches you python from scratch
04:36 - and eventually progresses to things like
04:39 - creating graphical user interfaces and
04:41 - using neural networks principal
04:44 - component analysis cluster analysis all
04:47 - that stuff and much more besides then
04:50 - you can find a link in the description
04:52 - or just go to this URL on the screen
04:55 - right here if you finish the whole
04:57 - course you'll be able to write all kinds
04:59 - of general purpose programs in Python
05:02 - and use Python to do machine learning
05:04 - and artificial intelligence as well
05:07 - thank you for watching until next time
05:09 - happy coding
