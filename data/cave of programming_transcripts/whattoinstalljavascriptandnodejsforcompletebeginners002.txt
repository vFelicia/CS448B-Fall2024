00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming calm and in this video we're
00:04 - going to talk about what you need to
00:06 - install to get started
00:08 - with JavaScript and node J s so
00:12 - installation instructions are not really
00:14 - my thing and they're going to vary from
00:16 - operating system to operating system so
00:18 - my aim is here to give you enough
00:20 - information that you know what to
00:22 - install even if you have to look up
00:25 - installation instructions for your
00:27 - particular system so if you're a if
00:30 - you've already been programming for a
00:32 - while you this will be easy for you if
00:33 - you're a complete beginner you might
00:35 - have to do a bit of googling a bit of
00:37 - searching on the internet so the first
00:40 - thing that we need is we need some kind
00:43 - of terminal where we can write commands
00:47 - so if you're using Mac by default Mac
00:53 - cast this program called terminal and
00:54 - you start it up and the the language of
00:57 - the terminal is what we call bash and I
00:59 - can highly recommend bash so if you if
01:02 - you have a map you can just start up a
01:04 - bash terminal it's just there already if
01:06 - you're using Linux then you probably
01:08 - know what you're doing with terminals
01:10 - anyway and you probably also have a bash
01:13 - terminal available to you if you're
01:16 - using Windows it's possible that you're
01:18 - more of a beginner and then you need to
01:20 - look up some instructions now there are
01:22 - two different things you could do here
01:24 - for Windows one is to use the typical
01:27 - windows console but the other is you
01:30 - could install or enable a bash terminal
01:34 - for windows because bash is just so much
01:36 - nicer and more powerful than what's
01:38 - being coming with windows over the year
01:41 - in Windows 10 there is I believe a bash
01:44 - shell we call it a bash shell included
01:47 - with it you've simply got to enable it
01:50 - so if you just search for Windows 10
01:52 - bash shell you'll find instructions for
01:54 - doing that if you're using some other
01:56 - versions of Windows another possibility
01:58 - is there is this get bash as google get
02:04 - bash
02:05 - get for windows so you can download and
02:08 - install that and that gives you a I
02:10 - believe a basic bash shell that you
02:12 - should probably
02:12 - can use for this tutorial you probably
02:15 - won't need that but it's another
02:18 - possibility
02:19 - now once you've decided on what terminal
02:23 - you're gonna use whether it's bash or a
02:25 - Windows console or whatever it is you
02:27 - need some software that you need to be
02:29 - able to run within the terminal
02:32 - specifically we need to install node.js
02:36 - so if you search for nodejs you can find
02:39 - an installation package or program for
02:43 - your platform pretty easily just
02:45 - download it and install it and we need
02:48 - to get to the point where we can type
02:50 - two commands we type node let's try it
02:53 - note - V actually we can tie it node - V
02:56 - in a terminal and instead of saying
02:59 - command not found it actually returns a
03:02 - version number so the - V says we turn
03:04 - the version number we also want a
03:07 - command NPM - V which should also work
03:13 - should also return a version number
03:15 - that's the point that you want to get to
03:17 - where you can type these two commands in
03:18 - your terminal and and they give you
03:21 - version numbers so probably just
03:23 - installing them is is generally enough
03:25 - if you have if you have any problems
03:27 - don't be afraid to search for your
03:29 - operating system and you know something
03:31 - like install node J s that's what we're
03:35 - really talking about here a technology
03:37 - called nodejs
03:38 - windows for example you search for that
03:41 - you can find detailed instructions
03:43 - various pages on exactly how to install
03:46 - it you could also search for things like
03:49 - install nodejs windows bash or whatever
03:52 - your operating system is or whatever
03:54 - terminal shell language that you intend
03:57 - to use but bash is a good choice and
04:01 - again you can find instructions once
04:03 - you've got to the point where you can
04:05 - open a terminal terminal of some kind
04:07 - and you can type node and NPM and it
04:10 - does something rather than saying
04:12 - command not found then that's it you've
04:15 - got it installed
04:15 - ok so we're also going to need an editor
04:18 - we need a programmers text editor and
04:20 - the one that I'm going to be use using
04:23 - is called Visual Studio code
04:26 - now facial studio is a massive we call
04:30 - it an integrated development environment
04:32 - for what it's cross-platform but it's a
04:35 - massive piece of software which I used
04:38 - to use I haven't used to in ages is good
04:40 - but if you want certain features you
04:42 - have to pay for them visual studio code
04:45 - is a completely different thing
04:46 - confusingly I don't know maybe Microsoft
04:49 - wanted to just help promote Visual
04:52 - Studio by calling it Visual Studio code
04:54 - there's a studio code has nothing
04:55 - discernibly to do with Visual Studio
04:58 - Visual Studio code is a lightweight
05:00 - partly open-source programmers text
05:03 - editor I highly recommend it I
05:05 - definitely recommend installing this so
05:10 - again it's cross-platform you can use it
05:12 - on Windows wherever you like so that's
05:14 - Visual Studio code and if you search
05:16 - like you'll find it you can just
05:18 - download it and install it finally this
05:22 - is completely optional it's not central
05:24 - to the course at all but you might want
05:26 - to install git if you search for get not
05:30 - get to hang on and get and you look at
05:34 - that so this is git - SCM comm you can
05:39 - install this get software now git is
05:42 - there's a version of get integrated into
05:45 - Visual Studio code anyway you can use it
05:47 - from there but the ideal thing is if you
05:50 - want to follow along exactly with what
05:51 - I'm going to do including the get bits
05:54 - which are completely optional and
05:56 - nothing to do with JavaScript then you
05:59 - want to get to the point where you can
06:00 - also type let's try to get there's not
06:02 - an option - fee but get if you type that
06:06 - in your console it should also do
06:08 - something rather than saying command not
06:10 - found just get it's called get and what
06:15 - that is it's just a version control
06:16 - system it enables you to store the code
06:19 - that you're creating and store different
06:22 - versions of it and is it although it
06:24 - seems like unnecessary extra thing or it
06:28 - might seem like like that I threw a
06:30 - complete beginner it's so useful to be
06:33 - able to store your code in a way that
06:36 - you you're not going to lose it and
06:37 - still have different versions of it
06:39 - and so I'm going to actually create a
06:42 - video on next I think on how you would
06:45 - use how you're going to use get in this
06:47 - course so it's not a course don't get
06:50 - but we are going to use get if you can't
06:52 - be bothered with that really I do
06:54 - recommend it but if you really don't
06:55 - want to use it it's fine you can follow
06:57 - this course without using it at all okay
07:00 - I think that's it so basically you need
07:03 - to install nodejs
07:05 - you need to install Visual Studio code
07:07 - and ideally still get as well and you
07:11 - need a you need to terminal so you need
07:13 - to be able to go to a terminal and at
07:15 - the very least you need to be able to
07:16 - type note - V and P M - V and they need
07:21 - to do something you might need to Google
07:23 - for instructions on how to get those
07:25 - working ideally you should get get
07:27 - working there as well and you'll have
07:30 - Visual Studio code as your editor I
07:33 - think that's it so if you can install
07:35 - all that lot one way or another don't
07:37 - give up if you're a complete beginner it
07:39 - believe me it's not that difficult you
07:40 - just need to find instructions and
07:42 - ideally a Bosch terminal but you can use
07:46 - Windows console as well okay so until
07:49 - next time happy coding
