00:16 - hello this is John from cave of
00:19 - programming calm and in this video we're
00:23 - going to look at binary numbers so if
00:25 - you already understand binary numbers or
00:27 - you're just immensely bored by the topic
00:30 - feel free to skip this video but I
00:32 - wanted to insert it here because it
00:34 - strikes me that before I talk about
00:36 - types or maybe after I talk about C++
00:40 - types we probably should look a bit at
00:43 - numbers and computer memory for that
00:46 - matter and so in inner kind of what we
00:51 - call decimal numbers the normal number
00:52 - system we could write a number like this
00:56 - 372 let's say and what that actually
01:01 - means you might remember from primary
01:03 - school is it means two times one so this
01:08 - this bit is two times one this bit is
01:13 - seven times ten so seven times ten and
01:16 - this bit is three times 100 so this is
01:23 - the decimal system based on tens and the
01:26 - rightmost number here tells you how many
01:29 - ones you've got then it's how many tens
01:32 - then how many lots of ten times ten then
01:35 - how many lots of ten times ten times ten
01:37 - then how many lots of 10 to the power of
01:39 - five and so on and the binary number
01:43 - system is really simple it's really
01:46 - similar we just use north's and ones
01:48 - there are only two numbers in it and the
01:51 - way it works is let's take a number like
01:52 - this 1 0 1 1 what does that mean well
01:56 - here we've got 1 times 1 just as in the
02:00 - decimal system but here we've got
02:03 - instead of 1 times 10 we've got 1 times
02:07 - 2 so 1 times 2
02:09 - and here we've got 0 times 2 times 2 in
02:14 - other words 0 times 4 and here we've got
02:18 - 1 times 2 times 2 times 2 in other words
02:24 - 1 times 8 so altogether the number is
02:27 - going to be in decimal it's going to be
02:30 - 8 plus 4 no.not forks we've got no fours
02:35 - 8 plus 2 plus 1 which is 11 so this is
02:40 - 11 in binary let me just check now we've
02:43 - got yeah we've got 1 plus 2 that's 3
02:46 - plus there's no fours and we've got 8 so
02:51 - that's 11 and now the reason this is
02:56 - important is because the computer's
03:00 - memory is is organized in like a series
03:04 - of cells you think of it as like series
03:06 - of cells like this and each cell is
03:10 - called a bit so let's label one of these
03:14 - a bit so we've got four bits four bits
03:17 - here and to represent this number 1 0 1
03:24 - 1 which is 11 in decimal and we could
03:28 - switch each bit on or off so each bit
03:31 - has two possible States which we could
03:34 - call on or off or we could represent it
03:35 - with 0 or 1 doesn't matter really what
03:38 - we call it two possible states so we can
03:40 - make this on or whatever you like to
03:43 - call it we could say this is off this is
03:45 - on this is on and then we've represented
03:47 - the number 1 0 1 1 in binary which is 11
03:52 - hopefully I haven't lost you so far if I
03:54 - have don't worry too much because you
03:57 - rarely you rarely have to think about
03:59 - this as a program that's really as in
04:01 - seldom my Derbyshire accent rip really
04:04 - and really a quite similar for me but
04:07 - yeah you don't very often have to think
04:09 - about this but I just thought I better
04:11 - run it past you for the sake of
04:12 - completeness and so that's that's binary
04:15 - numbers for you and
04:17 - and Billy thing I want to mention is
04:18 - that bits in the computer's memory are
04:21 - organized into bytes so a bit is a byte
04:25 - so let's have one two three four five
04:30 - six seven eight so we've got eight cells
04:35 - here let's check this one two three four
04:38 - five six seven eight and this is called
04:41 - one byte so got bits and bytes and this
04:47 - is going to be like a limit to what size
04:51 - number you can represent in a byte and
04:54 - we're going to get onto that probably in
04:56 - the next video after the next one I kim
04:59 - won the next video but one and because
05:03 - you thing that you need to know really
05:05 - the practical thing here most of the
05:07 - time is just that you need to be aware
05:10 - that there are minimum and maximum
05:11 - values that you can fit into a certain
05:13 - amount of memory you also sometimes need
05:15 - to allocate memory to put stuff in it
05:17 - and then you need to be aware that
05:19 - memory comes in bytes and bits so that's
05:24 - all I'm going to cover for this tutorial
05:26 - very quick introduction to binary
05:29 - numbers here in the next tutorial I
05:33 - think we will get on to looking at C++
05:35 - types so join me then and until next
05:39 - time happy coding
05:49 - you
