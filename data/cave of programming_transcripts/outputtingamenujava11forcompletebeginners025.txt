00:00 - hello in this video we're going to work
00:03 - through a possible solution to the
00:05 - exercise I gave you in the last video do
00:08 - watch this video even if you
00:09 - successfully did the exercise because
00:12 - I'm going to make a few remarks here if
00:15 - you've managed to output this text by
00:17 - any means at all then basically you've
00:20 - you've done the exercise and you solved
00:23 - the problem if you couldn't manage to do
00:26 - it then maybe watch this video and try
00:30 - again try to get that working you should
00:32 - be able to do this especially you might
00:34 - need to watch the previous video again
00:35 - but you should be able to manage it okay
00:38 - so I'm going to store all the text here
00:40 - in strings so the first one let's call
00:43 - it prompt and set it equal to select an
00:47 - option and then we'll have also a string
00:52 - option 1 equals add an entry now you can
00:59 - use numbers in variable names like I've
01:01 - used one here you just can't put them at
01:04 - the start of a variables putting them at
01:06 - the start as a variable gives you an
01:07 - error but you can use some of other
01:09 - positions in your variable and we'll
01:12 - have two more of those which I'll call
01:15 - option two and option three option two
01:19 - is going to be viewed the database and
01:22 - option three is going to be exit we'll
01:28 - also have some numbers in here just
01:30 - we'll separate those out just to make it
01:31 - as complicated as possible let's call
01:35 - this value one we set it equal to one
01:38 - notice that this is a number and we're
01:42 - assigning it to a variable of type int
01:44 - which is an integer if I had and one in
01:48 - double quotes like that so this gives us
01:51 - an error because he would need type
01:53 - string because this is text so whatever
01:56 - you put in quotes it doesn't matter even
01:58 - if it's digits and it looks like a
02:00 - number it's not a number it's some text
02:03 - so stuff in quotes is treated as text
02:07 - whereas this without the quotes is a
02:11 - number and those things are there
02:13 - from numbers and text are treated
02:15 - differently in Java so it doesn't matter
02:19 - if you've got text that just looks like
02:20 - a number it's not number it's not a
02:23 - number here it's text because it's in
02:25 - quotes anyway we'll get rid of those and
02:27 - we'll copy this and we'll have another
02:32 - two of them so value 1 2 3 2 3 so we
02:40 - could just output those we could also
02:42 - store them in another string let's call
02:44 - it menu so what do we have we have
02:47 - prompt and then we've got option we've
02:52 - got value 1 and then we've got option 1
03:00 - and I could just type these out in a
03:05 - massive long line I could add them all
03:07 - together but I'm going to do something
03:09 - slightly different let's let's in fact
03:14 - start this off as just being an empty
03:16 - string alright and then we're gonna say
03:20 - menu plus equals what does plus equal do
03:25 - well this is the same as writing menu
03:32 - equals menu plus this other stuff so in
03:44 - the context of a string what plus equals
03:47 - does is it takes the existing string
03:50 - whatever is already in it which here is
03:52 - nothing and then it adds small stuff
03:54 - onto it so by this means we can build up
03:58 - the menu without having a hugely long
04:01 - line we're going to see another way of
04:02 - doing this later on but for here let's
04:04 - carry on like this in fact let's let's
04:08 - set this initially equal to prompt and
04:11 - then I can add on the values and the
04:14 - options and what I'm striving for here
04:17 - is I'm striving for elegance and trying
04:20 - to make this look beautiful because I
04:22 - want it to be clear and easy to read I
04:25 - want it to be very logical
04:27 - so I can see what's happening here the
04:29 - more beautiful your program is in
04:30 - general these are is to modify it and
04:34 - remember what it's actually doing and
04:36 - that sort of thing let's try outputting
04:38 - that so at each stage I'm using plus
04:41 - equals to add more text to the existing
04:44 - string it starts off as prompt and then
04:47 - it's prompt plus one add an entry yeah
04:53 - there we go
04:54 - then it's we take that string and we do
04:58 - plus equals and then join this on so
05:01 - we're using plus equals to keep we keep
05:03 - adding more texts to the menu so if we
05:07 - output that what's it look like terrible
05:10 - because it's all on one line there's no
05:13 - tabs or anything let's add in some tabs
05:16 - so to do that we could just we could
05:20 - just put them literally in in here that
05:23 - would work or here let's try it so here
05:26 - I'm going to say I'm going to put it in
05:28 - double quotes slash T plus do I need
05:34 - anything else I don't think I do at that
05:37 - point so the others are going to start
05:41 - with two slash T's so I'm gonna have
05:43 - slash t / t plus and we also actually
05:52 - want a dot and a space after the option
05:55 - so I need to add that in as well so
05:58 - let's put that here dot space plus okay
06:03 - so it looks like this let's go through
06:05 - and add all of these in so I'm going to
06:10 - copy that and paste it I'm trying to use
06:13 - as few keystrokes as possible as well
06:15 - because it saves typing let's run that
06:18 - and still not working
06:21 - because we need the newline it looks
06:23 - better though so let's add in some new
06:25 - lines let's say here plus slash n need
06:33 - double quotes there
06:35 - all right and I need to add these to the
06:39 - end of every line so now I finally I run
06:45 - this and I've got my menu here okay so
06:50 - now this is really a horrible program I
06:53 - would never normally write a program
06:54 - like that it's the best we can do if we
06:58 - on the one hand divide everything up
07:00 - putting everything into separate
07:02 - variables but on the other hand we stick
07:05 - to things that we've seen so far we
07:07 - don't use programming constructs that we
07:09 - haven't seen yet but with some more
07:14 - knowledge we could reduce this down to a
07:17 - much smaller program and at the very
07:21 - least a more elegant program that
07:22 - doesn't have all this repetition in it
07:24 - there's a lot of repetition in here
07:26 - which we could eliminate and we're going
07:28 - to see how to do that in a future
07:30 - tutorial so if you did something that
07:34 - output this text correctly then give
07:39 - yourself a pat on about if you did
07:40 - something horrendously complex like this
07:42 - and that's amazing that's really
07:44 - wonderful
07:45 - if you didn't then I suggest typing this
07:49 - out try typing it out for yourself to
07:51 - see what it does you can even output the
07:54 - menu like here before you've completed
07:57 - making it so you can see what that does
08:01 - so if I run this and I should have two
08:04 - menus I've got this menu fragment at
08:07 - this point and then I carried on adding
08:09 - two more options to it and I create this
08:11 - second menu which I output here okay so
08:14 - try typing this out if you can be
08:17 - bothered at least I know it's a bit
08:19 - verbose and see what it does
08:21 - maybe experiment with it check that you
08:23 - understand this check you understand the
08:25 - idea of adding more text onto an
08:27 - existing string okay
08:29 - so we're going to go on to look at some
08:31 - things that would make this a lot more
08:33 - elegant and have a lot less duplication
08:35 - in it but we'll leave it there for a
08:36 - moment so until next time happy coding
