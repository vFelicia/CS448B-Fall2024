00:00 - [Music]
00:16 - hello this is John from cave of
00:19 - programming Tonkin this is part six of
00:23 - their beginner's Java tutorial and in
00:26 - this tutorial we are going to look at if
00:29 - statements in the last tutorial we saw
00:32 - for loops and in the next tutorial we're
00:35 - going to look at getting user input but
00:39 - before we do that we're going to look at
00:41 - if so go to file new Java project as
00:46 - usual in Eclipse and I'll call this
00:50 - tutorial six next finish let's create a
00:57 - new class as usual by now you will
01:01 - hopefully remember how to do this pretty
01:03 - well I'll call it application and just
01:08 - for kicks I'm going to type the main
01:11 - method out I'm from scratch public
01:16 - static void main string array hogs which
01:21 - might sound like Chinese too or if you
01:24 - are Chinese it might sound like Greek
01:26 - but don't worry about that so if we've
01:30 - already seen one or two examples of
01:34 - conditional statements for example if I
01:38 - type bool boolean boolean what should we
01:45 - call it cond for condition maybe equals
01:48 - 1 less than 6 and then I can do sis out
01:54 - this out control space cons and this
02:00 - will display true when I run it true
02:05 - another possibility would be I could say
02:09 - let's say 3 greater than 8 which is
02:14 - false
02:17 - there's also a not equal to I could say
02:23 - five not equal to two which is of course
02:29 - true we're using that exclamation mark
02:32 - for not symbol here true or let's say
02:37 - five not equal to five which is false
02:40 - and there is of course a test for
02:44 - equality for equals equals three which
02:48 - is false it's really important to note
02:52 - here that a single equal sign means
02:55 - assignment it means you're setting
02:57 - something equal to something to test for
03:00 - equality you need equals equals it's not
03:04 - immediately obvious that the two things
03:05 - are different but if you think about it
03:07 - a bit they are two completely different
03:09 - things
03:12 - assigning equality and testing equality
03:16 - that is let's try five equals equals
03:19 - seven okay great
03:22 - false let's use these conditions in an
03:25 - if statement and if statement looks like
03:28 - this you type if which is the keyword
03:31 - and then you need a condition in round
03:34 - brackets after that and then you have
03:37 - curly brackets which enclose some code
03:39 - that you want to run if the condition is
03:42 - true so for the condition let's try four
03:47 - equals 4 which is true of course this
03:52 - out let's say yes it's true so I will
04:00 - run this code if this condition is true
04:03 - and if it isn't I won't do anything well
04:08 - what I do is I've got to get rid of this
04:10 - of course I use control D to get rid of
04:13 - whole lines which is an D shortcut yes
04:18 - it's true or if I give a condition isn't
04:23 - true let's say 5 not equal to 5 1 equal
04:28 - to 5
04:30 - then nothing happens now of course I can
04:36 - use variables in there which is sort of
04:38 - the whole point let's say I've got a
04:42 - variable integer maybe int in my int
04:50 - equals 20 let's say I can say if my int
04:56 - is less than 30 which it is then I'll do
05:00 - the print now often I want to take some
05:07 - kind of action and if the condition
05:11 - isn't true I want to take a different
05:14 - action so let's say my in less than 10
05:18 - okay this is false so at the moment
05:20 - nothing happens because this condition
05:22 - is false so it doesn't do the code but I
05:26 - could put a else statement so I type the
05:30 - keyword else and then I have curly
05:33 - brackets as well notice that Eclipse is
05:36 - automatically adding the second curly
05:38 - bracket when I type the first one and
05:41 - hit return and they are alt here I will
05:43 - type system to out dot println no it no
05:49 - it's false okay
05:54 - no it's false so or if I set this equal
06:00 - to something that is true my int less
06:02 - than 100 then I get the first bit but
06:07 - the else doesn't do anything there is
06:11 - also a else if for example I can say
06:17 - else if and then round brackets and I
06:20 - can put another condition in here so
06:22 - here I could say for example if mind is
06:25 - less than 100 I want to do this else if
06:30 - my int is
06:35 - greater than yes oh here I've got my in
06:39 - less than ten sorry and here I can say
06:42 - if mind is greater than 20 I'll do this
06:46 - so and I'll set my end to 15 and then
06:52 - nothing happens because this is false so
06:56 - it doesn't do this and this else else if
06:59 - condition is also false so it doesn't do
07:01 - this but if I set it to less than 10
07:06 - this will be true so I'll get this and
07:10 - if I set it to less than to greater than
07:13 - 20 I'll set this equal to 30 then I get
07:18 - this condition what happens if I say
07:21 - else if my int less than 20 and set it
07:27 - equal to 5
07:28 - now both conditions are true but if I
07:32 - run it as you can see these are kind of
07:35 - mutually exclusive so it's saying if
07:38 - it's less than 10 yes do this forget
07:41 - about everything else and that's the
07:44 - idea behind else if this is an
07:46 - alternative so if one of these if this
07:50 - clause is true and it does this it's not
07:54 - going to do this this only happens if
07:57 - else if this this isn't true and this is
08:03 - I can combine if else if and else of
08:08 - course so I can say else this out none
08:12 - of the above
08:14 - and I can say so this says it's less
08:19 - than 10 let's make this say it's greater
08:23 - than 20 and that this be 15 now this
08:28 - isn't true this isn't true so it will
08:31 - just do this because this is what it
08:34 - does if none of these conditions are
08:36 - true none of the above
08:40 - as usual if this seems complex just have
08:44 - a play around with it and try grating if
08:46 - some else ifs and else's and see what
08:50 - happens and of course usually you
08:55 - probably use this with some kind of
08:57 - importance on all the results of some
08:59 - kind of calculation and in as a sender
09:01 - next tutorial we'll get onto looking at
09:03 - user input for now let me just show you
09:07 - one more thing
09:08 - we've seen while loops before so a while
09:13 - loop could look like this I can say int
09:17 - loop for example equals zero so I have a
09:22 - loop counter which usually you set to
09:24 - zero to start with but doesn't it
09:26 - doesn't have to be while loop is less
09:30 - than 5 let's say do loop this out and
09:36 - I'll write looping plus loop now so this
09:44 - the moment is an infinite loop if I run
09:46 - this it just loops and loops and loops
09:48 - and because loop is always less than 5
09:52 - so it will always do the loop and I
09:54 - could stop that by incrementing the loop
09:58 - here loop plus plus will add one to the
10:00 - loop as we saw last time he will add one
10:03 - to the loop counter and in this case
10:07 - every time the loop executes so now we
10:10 - have naught 1 2 3 4 but another
10:13 - interesting way of doing it which is
10:16 - sometimes useful is I could say if loop
10:19 - equals 5 then break and the break
10:25 - statement just immediately stops the
10:28 - loop executing so this will just jump
10:33 - out of a loop if I type yeah let's let's
10:42 - types this out here and I'll type
10:45 - running
10:47 - okay so well why isn't this working if
10:53 - loop is equal to five break oh I've got
11:00 - to increment loop right let's put loop
11:03 - plus plus here okay so I'm setting loop
11:07 - equal to zero I'm saying do the loop
11:09 - while loop is less than five but screw
11:12 - that I'm going to just put true and have
11:15 - an infinite loop here and then here I'll
11:19 - say if loop equals five break out of the
11:22 - loop and here I increment the loop so
11:25 - now if I run this you can see what's
11:28 - happening is it's printing looping zero
11:31 - running looping one running and so on
11:34 - till we get to five and then as soon as
11:38 - the loop is equal to five so it still
11:40 - does this but then the if says if loop
11:43 - equals five break and at that point it
11:45 - jumps out of the loop completely jumps
11:48 - out and it doesn't even get to these
11:49 - statements here there's no running down
11:51 - here okay that's it for this tutorial
11:57 - and I hope you'll join me again next
11:59 - time you can find more information and
12:02 - tutorials on cave of programming comm
12:06 - and until then happy coding
