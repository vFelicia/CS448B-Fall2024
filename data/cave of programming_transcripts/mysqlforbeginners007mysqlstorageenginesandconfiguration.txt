00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming calm in this tutorial we're
00:04 - going to take a look at my sequel
00:06 - database engines so although this is not
00:11 - a tutorial on my sequel database
00:13 - administration it is a tutorial on using
00:16 - my sequel as as an end user and on
00:21 - learning sequel and working with in my
00:23 - sequel database nevertheless there are
00:27 - some configurable configuration options
00:29 - that affect how my sequel works so
00:32 - before we go any further we're going to
00:34 - have to take a look at some
00:36 - configuration related stuff because
00:39 - you're going to need to know that in
00:41 - order to predict how your queries are
00:44 - actually going to work so I'm I've
00:48 - already typed a used tutorial one but
00:51 - there's no harm in typing it again so
00:52 - we're using the right database and now
00:55 - I'm going to type show engines and
00:59 - execute that now what on my sequel
01:03 - engine is is it's a module a part of my
01:07 - sequel that deals with your sequel and
01:11 - constructs tables basically I'm not sure
01:15 - if the actual code that passes your
01:17 - queries is part of the engine but
01:19 - certainly the part of my sequel that
01:22 - constructs tables and decides what they
01:24 - can do what it can't do that's called an
01:27 - engine and there are my sequel supports
01:30 - various different engines now most of
01:34 - these I haven't used but there are two
01:36 - really important ones that you should
01:38 - know about historically my sequel as I
01:42 - remember it this is according to my
01:44 - memory and I've been working with my
01:45 - sequel probably since around 1999 I
01:49 - think historically my sequel was built
01:53 - around and I don't know how to plants
01:55 - these names but I'll make up for
01:56 - pronunciation it was built around this
01:58 - my by some engine now that was while it
02:03 - was a good start but it didn't support
02:05 - some really important features of
02:07 - databases it didn't support as I
02:10 - remember it didn't support trans
02:12 - and I presume still dozen it didn't
02:15 - support foreign keys even which as we'll
02:17 - see later on are really important to use
02:19 - so it was a big step forward later on
02:22 - when my sequel came out with this
02:24 - I know DB engine which does support
02:27 - transactions does support foreign keys
02:29 - and if you do show engines hopefully
02:32 - you'll see that I know DB is set to the
02:34 - default now it's possible to change
02:38 - which engine you use and you're probably
02:40 - not going to want to for this tutorial
02:43 - you're going to want to make sure that I
02:45 - know DB is the default engine unless
02:48 - there's something even newer and better
02:49 - that's come out since this tutorial in
02:52 - which case you could switch to that but
02:54 - in this tutorial we're going to be using
02:56 - the I know T V engine it is possible to
03:00 - it's possible to specify on a table by
03:04 - table basis which engine your table uses
03:08 - and again most of the time that's
03:09 - probably going to be pretty useless but
03:12 - it's quite common that if you see a
03:14 - sequel script that's intended to be
03:18 - executed to create a complete database
03:21 - after every table it will specify which
03:23 - engine each table is using and it's
03:26 - normally going to be the same engine
03:27 - every time and it's normally going to be
03:29 - I know dB
03:31 - so in case you see that in the script is
03:33 - kind of important to know about if we
03:36 - type in here show table and status we
03:40 - can see which engine each of our tables
03:44 - is using we've only got one table at the
03:46 - moment and it's using the default
03:48 - I know DB but I could change that and
03:51 - there are a number of ways they could
03:53 - change it so let's create a table let's
03:56 - call it test and I'll give it just one
03:59 - column so let's say int int and I'm
04:03 - going to say next
04:04 - after this bracket I'm going to say
04:07 - engine equals and pick a different
04:09 - engine so the only one I've actually
04:11 - used is this my I son so let's go ahead
04:15 - and try that so I've executed that I've
04:18 - created the table and now let's look at
04:20 - show
04:20 - table status and we see that we've got a
04:24 - test table using this my I some database
04:28 - I'm going to delete that for a moment
04:31 - let's say drop the table test and we'll
04:34 - see another way of doing that so another
04:36 - way you could do this is you could set
04:37 - the default storage engine for your for
04:41 - your session so you could say set
04:44 - default yeah this is right I think set
04:48 - default storage engine equals my I son
04:56 - let's try that looks good and now let's
05:00 - do show tables so there are tables just
05:05 - to remind ourselves we've only got one
05:07 - table now called users and I'm gonna do
05:10 - show tables status okay that's good and
05:16 - that's also do show engines so we see
05:20 - that this one say we've got users is
05:22 - using I know DB as we saw before SH
05:24 - let's do the shell engines now we can
05:26 - see that my I son is set to the default
05:28 - so we'll try creating another table so
05:32 - great table I'll call it test again I'll
05:34 - say it's just a one column ID and I
05:37 - won't specify a storage engine so I'll
05:39 - execute that and then we'll do show
05:42 - table status and now we can see that the
05:47 - default really has been changed to my I
05:49 - son as we we also saw when we did when
05:55 - we did show and show engines struggling
06:01 - to remember because these are commands
06:03 - that I very infrequently use most of the
06:07 - time you don't need to bother with this
06:08 - but I'm just want to show you show you
06:10 - this so you kind of are familiar with it
06:13 - and you're not puzzle if you come across
06:14 - it and you do want to make sure we show
06:17 - engines you do want to make sure that I
06:19 - know DB is set to the default so let's
06:23 - set I know the DB back to the back to
06:26 - the default and say set default
06:30 - storage engine equals I know DB I don't
06:38 - think capital letters make a difference
06:39 - though but I'll put it all in capitals
06:42 - because that definitely works and then
06:44 - again we'll do show engines and now we
06:48 - can see yeah I know DB is back to the
06:50 - default now if you let's say you've got
06:53 - my sequel installed and you find you're
06:55 - using it's a recent version of my sequel
06:58 - so it supports IMDB but you're for some
07:01 - crazy reason you find that is using my I
07:03 - some you can change it in your session
07:07 - as we've just seen or you can specify it
07:09 - after every table that you should use I
07:11 - know DB if necessary if you're the
07:15 - administer administrator of your my
07:19 - sequel server yourself you can also
07:22 - change this in a config file so this is
07:25 - this is not what this is kind of taking
07:26 - is a little bit away from the point of
07:28 - this course as a whole but I'm just
07:31 - gonna demonstrate that quickly so if you
07:34 - look in the my sequel folder you'll find
07:37 - this a my sequel dot CNF if you're using
07:41 - Linux or some kind of UNIX type system
07:43 - like the Mac and it's probably going to
07:45 - be called dot ini' if you're using
07:47 - Windows now although this is present in
07:49 - my my sequel installation folder here in
07:53 - fact on the Mac and you would have to
07:56 - check this if you want to do if you want
07:57 - to do it for Windows you have to check
07:59 - where the default location of this file
08:01 - actually is because it's actually not
08:03 - here this isn't the one that's actually
08:05 - being read on my system which is a Mac
08:08 - so let's go to a terminal now and again
08:11 - if you're not familiar with the terminal
08:13 - really don't worry about it because it's
08:14 - this taking us off the main point of
08:16 - this tutorial anyway but what I had to
08:18 - do was I had to go to where this file is
08:23 - actually located it's going to see the
08:25 - user local my sequel which is where it
08:29 - happens to be great it happens to be
08:30 - located on my mark and it could be
08:32 - different for yours and this is it's
08:35 - really just a kind of demo dummy
08:37 - configuration file and if we look at it
08:39 - is pretty simple it's just most of the
08:44 - most of these options are just comments
08:45 - or they just commented out but what I
08:48 - did do what I've already done here and
08:50 - I've added this myself because at least
08:52 - in my version here it didn't already
08:54 - exist I've added this option default
08:57 - storage engine equals my by some so this
09:01 - is how you can configure it if you want
09:03 - to so on my mark there actual location
09:07 - that this file is really read from is in
09:09 - slash etc and of course it's going to be
09:11 - different on different systems so you
09:13 - have to Google this if you want to do it
09:15 - so here's my my dot CNF it will be my
09:20 - dot any on Windows I'm gonna do sudo
09:23 - fine my dot CNF so I'm just using some
09:25 - unix commands i'm familiar with already
09:28 - you could edit this in any editor as
09:32 - long as you have to make sure it's not
09:33 - read-only otherwise you know you're not
09:36 - gonna be able to save it
09:37 - and this first check that there is an
09:40 - already a default storage engine option
09:42 - in there and there isn't here so that's
09:45 - of it in fact let's stop the server
09:48 - first let's go to the system preferences
09:52 - and just i'm gonna stop the my sequel
09:54 - server and if i get a right bad name
10:00 - password for my mac it will really help
10:02 - a lot more haste in their speed okay so
10:06 - I've stopped here now I'm gonna put in
10:09 - here default storage engine just like
10:14 - the edited the nonworking demo version
10:18 - but now I'm really editing the version
10:20 - that's actually being used so I'm going
10:21 - to talk to my I son right in here and
10:26 - this is my sequel D session so I've
10:30 - saved that and I'm gonna start my server
10:34 - again let's go to System Preferences
10:39 - start my sequel server then I'll go back
10:42 - to my my sequel workbench
10:44 - and I'm gonna quit it stop course is
10:46 - probably still not working we open a
10:48 - connection and I'm gonna do show engines
10:51 - we don't actually after you do use
10:53 - database before show engines your show
10:56 - engines doesn't apply to a particular
10:57 - database and we can see here that my I
11:00 - son is set to the default so before I do
11:04 - anything else I'm going to set it back
11:05 - to I know DP because einem DB is the one
11:11 - at least at the moment that you really
11:13 - want to be using so I'm just going to
11:14 - comment this out with a hash sign which
11:17 - is a common symbol that just turns this
11:19 - into a line that's not going to be
11:21 - actually read and I probably should have
11:24 - stopped the server really before I read
11:27 - it today but in any case I'm going to
11:29 - stop it now and restart it and we're
11:33 - gonna go to the workbench when it's
11:36 - running do so engines probably I need to
11:40 - reopen a connection show engines and now
11:47 - we see I know DP is the default game so
11:51 - now that the thing that you really want
11:53 - to take away from this tutorial is you
11:55 - need to do show engines and check that
11:57 - IMDB is the default fuel system if it
12:00 - isn't and you are the administrator of
12:03 - your server you can change the default
12:06 - in a config file and that will make sure
12:08 - that even after you restart the server
12:09 - I know DP will remain the default if
12:13 - you're not the administrator you have a
12:15 - choice between either using set store
12:21 - set default storage engine set set
12:24 - storage engine is what it used to be
12:26 - when I set default storage engine equals
12:30 - I know DB you could use that but we have
12:33 - to remember to do it every time you open
12:34 - a connection to my sequel or you could
12:38 - specify it every time after you create a
12:40 - table like create table test ID int and
12:48 - equals equals I know DB but that's kind
12:54 - of a lot of hassle so if you're lucky
12:56 - just do show engines and you'll find it
12:58 - is the default already okay that's it
13:01 - for this tutorial until next time happy
13:03 - coding
