00:00 - [Music]
00:17 - hello this is John from cave of
00:20 - programming calm this is tutorial number
00:22 - 9 in our series of beginners Java
00:24 - tutorials and in this tutorial we're
00:27 - gonna look at the switch keyword in Java
00:30 - switch allows you to take different
00:32 - actions depending on the value of a
00:35 - variable a bit like if except that
00:39 - switch is more efficient under some
00:42 - circumstances
00:44 - now switch perhaps isn't used all that
00:46 - much by some professional developers
00:50 - including myself but it's it's certainly
00:55 - something that you'll get quizzed about
00:57 - on courses and tests and it's a handy
00:59 - thing to know about so let's say I'm
01:03 - going to create a scanner object here so
01:05 - I can read user input and I'll say
01:07 - scanner input equals new scanner system
01:11 - dot in and an eclipse or press ctrl
01:15 - shift o to add the java.util.scanner
01:18 - importer and then I'm gonna get a value
01:22 - now you can only use switch to check
01:25 - certain types of variables and the most
01:29 - common to that you'll check are probably
01:31 - int and string so let's try a string
01:37 - here I'll say string text equals input
01:39 - tart get line so we're getting some text
01:43 - on the user and I'm also going to sorry
01:47 - not get line but next line and I'm also
01:52 - going to put a prompt here this out
01:54 - control space please enter some text
02:01 - actually let's say please enter a
02:04 - command because I'm going to pretend
02:07 - that I'm operating some kind of machine
02:08 - here via text commands so here I've got
02:13 - my text that the user has entered and
02:16 - I'm gonna say switch brackets text
02:20 - excuse me
02:23 - and so let's say text has the value
02:29 - start the user type start I want to take
02:32 - some action execute some code and if
02:35 - they type stop I want to execute other
02:37 - code and if they type you know runs
02:39 - mother code and so on and I can use a
02:43 - switch to do exactly that so I'll say
02:45 - case and then I have to say the thing
02:51 - that I want to check against text so
02:53 - let's say case start and then some code
02:58 - that you want to execute for example our
03:00 - same machine started and then underneath
03:03 - that you need a break keyword so for
03:07 - every value of text that you want to
03:10 - check you need a case statement starting
03:14 - with the case keyword the value that you
03:17 - want to particularly check the variable
03:20 - for and a colon and underneath that you
03:23 - type some lines of code that you want to
03:24 - execute if your variable happens to have
03:27 - this value an any half break so let's
03:31 - have another one you could have as many
03:32 - as many of these as you like I'll just
03:34 - put in two I think
03:36 - stop : sucess out machine stopped okay
03:45 - don't forget the break and then you can
03:51 - also have a default case which is
03:53 - optional but if I say default : this is
03:58 - the code that will get executed if none
04:01 - of these alternatives are matched and
04:04 - you can have as I say as many as you
04:06 - like yet it can be 10 or 20 or whatever
04:08 - so I'll say here commands not Rick cog
04:12 - nice recognized and the default bit has
04:17 - to go to the bottom and I'm going to
04:21 - press ctrl shift F here for format which
04:24 - will just reform up my code slightly in
04:26 - Eclipse
04:29 - I don't know what happened there okay
04:34 - and now yeah windows thank you thanks
04:40 - Bill Gates and now I'm going to just I'm
04:46 - gonna just run this this is a complete
04:47 - program so I'll click the green
04:49 - run-button and we will see it will say
04:54 - in a minute please enter a command here
04:58 - we go if I enter something like some
05:00 - rubbish like this it's gonna say command
05:02 - not recognized because this is what it
05:05 - does if none of these are matched but if
05:07 - I run it again and I type start for
05:10 - example machine started or of course
05:13 - stop machine stopped now as I say you
05:17 - can only switch on certain kinds of
05:20 - variables and in turn in and string or
05:23 - the most common two that you will use
05:24 - here anything else or most most other
05:29 - things you would want to use like an if
05:32 - statement and the other thing to note is
05:35 - that these must be constants you can't
05:39 - have case case blocks that's try to
05:45 - check a variable here you're the only
05:48 - variable can be this variable here and
05:50 - these must be constant values strings or
05:53 - integers or whatever okay well that's
05:56 - the switch statement covered have fun
05:58 - with that and in the next tutorial we're
06:02 - gonna start looking at classes and
06:04 - objects if you've been following this
06:06 - series of tutorials we've covered all
06:09 - the really basic building blocks of Java
06:11 - programs now and you can already write
06:13 - pretty complex programs and we're going
06:17 - to get on some slightly more advanced
06:19 - concepts in the next tutorial which will
06:22 - be number 10 so I hope you'll join me
06:24 - then and you can find this code on cave
06:28 - or programming comm and until next time
06:30 - happy
06:34 - [Music]
06:45 - you
