00:00 - [Music]
00:18 - hello this is John from cave of
00:21 - programming calm this is the second
00:23 - tutorial in our series of Java tutorials
00:27 - for complete beginners and today we're
00:30 - going to look at variables in Java don't
00:34 - worry if you don't understand every
00:37 - absolutely every single last thing in
00:38 - this tutorial because learning a
00:41 - programming language is like learning an
00:43 - ordinary language and you just have to
00:46 - practice it and gradually it sort of
00:48 - sinks into your head I'm gonna use the
00:51 - hello world program from the last
00:53 - tutorial as as a starting point here so
00:57 - what is a variable I'll give you an
00:59 - example I'm going to type int and I'm
01:03 - gonna make up a name here my number
01:07 - variables are like boxes that you can
01:10 - put values in and we've got different
01:15 - sizes of boxes in Java that can hold
01:19 - different kinds of things different
01:21 - types of boxes I should say and what
01:24 - we've done here is I've made up a name
01:26 - my number a notice I've given it a
01:28 - lowercase initial letter but I've
01:30 - capitalized the second word of it and
01:35 - that's that's a sort of a convention in
01:38 - Java and my number is a type int which
01:42 - means integer meaning that this box can
01:45 - hold a an integral number a whole number
01:50 - in other words negative or positive
01:55 - so here I've I've created the box and we
01:58 - say I've declared the variable and I can
02:02 - now put a value into the box I can say
02:07 - my number equals 88 or whatever and I'm
02:13 - now initializing the variable so I've
02:16 - declared the variable here now I'm
02:18 - initializing the variable and I can
02:21 - output this by the same method that we
02:23 - used in the first tutorial I'll types
02:25 - this out
02:27 - I'll press control space and Eclipse
02:29 - creates this system dot out dot print Ln
02:32 - print line for me I think put my number
02:36 - in there and if I click the green
02:39 - run-button it outputs 88 now here I've
02:44 - I've declared I've declared and
02:47 - initialized the variable in two separate
02:49 - steps but I can declare it and
02:52 - initialize it at the same time I can say
02:55 - equals 88 up here I can get rid of this
02:58 - line and that is just the same thing now
03:03 - in Java
03:04 - there are eight primitive types of
03:07 - variables and we're going to go through
03:12 - these really quickly and then in the
03:14 - next tutorial we'll look at classes a
03:17 - little bit classes and objects so we've
03:21 - got an inch here and it's a 32-bit value
03:25 - in Java if you don't really know what
03:27 - that means don't worry it doesn't really
03:29 - matter basically if you want an integral
03:31 - number a whole number then using in
03:35 - usually sometimes you'll see short which
03:39 - is four well it's a 16-bit value so it
03:44 - can hold slightly smaller numbers still
03:49 - you can fit quite a lot into it
03:51 - probably up to I don't know maybe 30 mm
03:55 - I think and we can output that the same
04:00 - way sis out I short and there's also a
04:06 - long version of an in for really long
04:08 - numbers by long and these these names
04:11 - here by the way it could be anything I
04:13 - could call these Apple cat you know
04:16 - absolutely anything at all so I'm just
04:19 - making up names for variables let's up
04:23 - on that this out this out my long
04:29 - this is a 64-bit value for really big
04:33 - numbers you can put a lot a lot bigger
04:35 - numbers than than this in there it's
04:38 - also what if you want a floating-point
04:39 - number
04:39 - you usually use a double this means kind
04:43 - of double precision extra precision sort
04:46 - of thing so I can put like you know some
04:50 - some number in there this out my double
04:56 - a presto and there's there's no long
05:03 - version of double but there is a short
05:04 - version called float and there's a
05:06 - slight complication here which is if you
05:09 - type a floating point number in in Java
05:13 - like this by default it's a double so
05:17 - you have to put an F on the end of it to
05:20 - get a float but these doubles and intz
05:24 - are the most commonly used values here
05:28 - my lonliness a bit less common in
05:32 - addition in addition to these five
05:34 - there's also three other other
05:37 - interesting types there's a char type
05:40 - which can hold a Unicode character and
05:45 - you can specify a character by putting
05:47 - it in single quotes like this it could
05:50 - be any character on your keyboard
05:51 - I just put Y as I say that's that's
05:57 - Unicode 16-bit Unicode just means you
06:00 - can represent basically a whole bunch of
06:02 - crazy characters using this there's a
06:06 - very useful boolean site which i guess
06:09 - is named after I think it was George
06:12 - Boole or possibly Boulos and I'm sure
06:15 - who invented boolean logic and this can
06:20 - just hold true or false this how I
06:30 - true or I could change that default and
06:33 - that's all you can put in that and
06:36 - finally we've got the white type which
06:42 - can hold just eight bits of data so it's
06:45 - the number negative or positive but it's
06:48 - it can only go up to about 127 I think
06:54 - and often that's quite useful sometimes
06:57 - you want to represent a whole load of
07:00 - data by an array of bytes and you can
07:05 - use this and you know precisely how much
07:07 - space it will take up okay so we just
07:12 - starts it for declaring boxes and
07:13 - shoving stuff into them in the next
07:17 - tutorial we'll we will look at some non
07:20 - primitive types classes and objects so I
07:27 - don't forget it's more info and
07:29 - tutorials on cave of programming calm
07:32 - and I'll catch you next time I hope
07:34 - that's all then happy coding
07:43 - you
