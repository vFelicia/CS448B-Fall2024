00:00 - hopefully at this point you've got
00:01 - python installed to the point where you
00:04 - can run it from some kind of console
00:07 - now you're going to want some really
00:09 - basic familiarity with your console
00:13 - at the minimum you need to know how to
00:15 - change from one directory to another in
00:18 - your console
00:19 - to make things a bit easier although
00:21 - it's not essential I'm going to
00:24 - recommend that you install Microsoft
00:25 - Powershell so if you go to the internet
00:28 - and type something like install
00:31 - Powershell
00:35 - then you can easily find instructions
00:38 - for doing this for different platforms
00:42 - so you need a way of interacting with
00:44 - your computer within a console like this
00:46 - one
00:48 - and the program that lets you interact
00:50 - with your computer lets you type stuff
00:52 - and that understands your commands we
00:55 - call a shell so Microsoft Powershell is
00:58 - just a kind of shell when you start up a
01:01 - console or a terminal like this
01:03 - some kind of program is already running
01:06 - in this case I've got something called
01:08 - said shell or Z shell running by default
01:11 - on my Mac but now that I've installed
01:14 - Powershell if I type pwsh
01:18 - it runs Microsoft Powershell
01:21 - and I think this is a pretty nice shell
01:23 - to use like I say this is optional
01:26 - but I probably would recommend that you
01:29 - install it and use it especially if
01:31 - you're new to this
01:34 - you are going to want to learn a few
01:35 - basic commands now you're going to see
01:37 - me typing commands in this course in
01:40 - Powershell
01:43 - but they may sometimes be specific to my
01:45 - Mac the good thing is you really don't
01:48 - need to know many of these commands
01:51 - really if you can change from one
01:54 - directory to another and maybe list the
01:57 - directory that will probably be enough
01:59 - so on a Unix like system you could type
02:03 - LS to see what's in your directory
02:06 - and you could type CD in a directory
02:08 - name to move into a new directory
02:11 - so for example I can type make da and
02:15 - the name of a directory I want to create
02:19 - call it hello
02:21 - and then I can do CD space hello that
02:24 - stands for change directory to go into
02:26 - that directory and I can type LS which
02:30 - lists the content of the directory at
02:33 - the moment there's nothing in there
02:35 - and that will probably work for you
02:37 - whatever platform you're using if I do a
02:40 - search here and I search for
02:42 - Powershell commands that work on Linux
02:45 - and windows or something like that
02:47 - I get this list of commands and the
02:49 - commands that I just used are in here
02:51 - make the
02:54 - CD for change directory LS to list the
02:57 - directory so those commands will
02:59 - probably work on your system you can
03:01 - probably do what I just did
03:04 - but
03:05 - if you find they don't you can always
03:07 - look up a really basic Powershell
03:10 - tutorial or maybe you know the commands
03:12 - that work on your system like on Windows
03:15 - I think it's the dir to list the content
03:18 - of a directory and windows also uses CD
03:21 - so this stuff will probably work for you
03:24 - and I recommend that you do install
03:26 - Powershell and activate it
03:29 - by typing pwsh because it's a pretty
03:33 - nice shell especially for beginners and
03:35 - if you already
03:37 - are comfortable with using a console on
03:40 - your system and you like using the
03:42 - console as it is that's also fine you
03:45 - can just carry on using that but I do
03:47 - want to emphasize that occasionally I
03:49 - might type things in a terminal that are
03:51 - not Central to the tutorial
03:55 - that you could do in some other way
03:56 - using Explorer or finder on the Mac or
04:00 - whatever
04:01 - and they might not work on your system
04:03 - but that's okay because
04:06 - you won't you don't absolutely need them
04:08 - you just need to be able to
04:12 - basically navigate the file structure in
04:15 - your console using Powershell or however
04:17 - you prefer this is a free video from my
04:21 - course Python and machine learning for
04:23 - complete beginners I'm releasing the
04:26 - first couple of chapters of this course
04:28 - completely for free on YouTube to get
04:31 - you started with python I plan to upload
04:34 - new videos here to YouTube every Monday
04:37 - and every Thursday for at least a couple
04:39 - of months if you're interested in the
04:42 - complete course which teaches you python
04:45 - from scratch and eventually progresses
04:47 - to things like creating graphical user
04:50 - interfaces and using neural networks
04:53 - principal component analysis cluster
04:56 - analysis all that stuff and much more
04:58 - besides then you can find a link in the
05:01 - description or just go to this URL on
05:04 - the screen right here if you finish the
05:06 - whole course you'll be able to write all
05:09 - kinds of general purpose programs in
05:10 - Python and use Python to do machine
05:13 - learning and artificial intelligence as
05:16 - well thank you for watching until next
05:18 - time happy coding
