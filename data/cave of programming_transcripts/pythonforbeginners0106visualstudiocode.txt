00:00 - the next thing that we need to install
00:01 - is an editor for python if you've
00:05 - already been following some python
00:07 - tutorials you probably have your own
00:09 - favorite editor and you can use that
00:12 - otherwise I would recommend using visual
00:15 - studio code if you search for visual
00:19 - Studio code
00:24 - then you can find this Visual Studio
00:26 - code editor which is a lightweight open
00:30 - source free editor from Microsoft and
00:32 - it's really good whatever you do don't
00:35 - confuse this with Visual Studio Visual
00:38 - Studio is a massive
00:41 - integrated development environment for
00:43 - various languages we don't need that
00:45 - what we need is Visual Studio code which
00:48 - is this lightweight editor so if you
00:51 - install that then
00:53 - start it up
00:55 - and when it starts up
00:57 - you're going to see a home screen that
00:59 - looks a bit like this it won't look the
01:01 - same because I've already been using
01:03 - this for a while but it's going to look
01:04 - something like this
01:06 - the next thing that you want to do is
01:09 - install an extension for working
01:11 - specifically with python now there may
01:14 - be a link to that on the home screen
01:17 - and if so click that and install the
01:21 - python extension if you don't see it
01:24 - there's this icon here which says
01:26 - extensions when I hover over it like
01:28 - it's like some building blocks
01:30 - and if I click on that in there I can
01:33 - search for python
01:35 - and just install the first suggestion
01:39 - that it makes and that will probably do
01:41 - the trick
01:43 - this is going to do stuff like highlight
01:45 - your code intelligently so it will help
01:49 - you to
01:50 - figure out which bit of your code does
01:53 - what basically
01:55 - once you've got the extension installed
01:57 - there's an icon at the top here called
02:00 - Explorer and if you click that it
02:03 - enables you to explore your files
02:06 - and what you need to do is create a
02:08 - folder on your system where you're going
02:11 - to put your work where you're going to
02:13 - put your python files for this tutorial
02:15 - then click open folder and navigate to
02:19 - that folder just click it and open it
02:25 - and from then on whichever files you
02:28 - create you'll be able to see them listed
02:29 - on the left here and you can open and
02:31 - close this just by clicking the icon
02:37 - you can create files in here in the
02:40 - typical way there is a file menu which
02:43 - is probably off the area of recording
02:45 - here maybe but if I click that there's
02:48 - an option new text file and that's what
02:50 - I would normally use because python
02:53 - programs are just a collection of text
02:55 - files one or more text files
02:59 - and the Python program that we've
03:01 - already been running is a kind of
03:04 - interpreter which interprets those text
03:06 - files you write python code in the text
03:10 - files
03:11 - and then you tell The Interpreter to run
03:14 - that code and it runs it
03:18 - Visual Studio code also has a built-in
03:20 - terminal which means you probably don't
03:24 - need to use your systems terminal I'm
03:27 - going to be using the terminal on my Mac
03:29 - sometimes other times I'll use the
03:31 - built-in terminal in Visual Studio code
03:33 - it's just a matter of preference so
03:36 - there's a menu called terminal and if I
03:40 - go to that I can go to new terminal
03:43 - and I get a terminal like this the
03:45 - important thing is we need to set this
03:48 - up just like we set up the other
03:50 - terminal
03:52 - so if you want to use Powershell you can
03:54 - type pwsh like before if you've already
03:58 - got it installed that should work
04:02 - and
04:03 - you need to activate your virtual
04:06 - environment or create one if you haven't
04:07 - already created one so I haven't already
04:10 - created one in this folder I don't think
04:12 - so I'm going to type
04:16 - python command just like we did before
04:20 - hyphen M femf vev like this
04:31 - so I wait for that to install and then I
04:33 - activate it with
04:35 - fan slash bin slash activate Dot PS1 and
04:40 - I run that and then I've got my python
04:42 - virtual environment
04:44 - right here and I can use it there is
04:47 - actually also
04:49 - a Powershell extension if you click on
04:53 - extensions here and search for
04:56 - Powershell
05:01 - there's this extension right here now I
05:03 - haven't used that it may be
05:06 - more convenient
05:08 - than installing Powershell from the
05:11 - website and then I don't really know
05:13 - what it does to be honest but you can
05:15 - try that out if you want to and I'm sure
05:18 - it's good
05:21 - but one way or another
05:23 - you need to be able to see a terminal
05:24 - and you need to have
05:27 - Powershell activated if you're going to
05:29 - use Powershell which I recommend and the
05:32 - virtual environment for python has to be
05:35 - activated when you use it and once
05:37 - you've got that
05:38 - you're ready to begin writing python
05:42 - programs and running them this is a free
05:45 - video from my course Python and machine
05:48 - learning for complete beginners I'm
05:50 - releasing the first couple of chapters
05:52 - of this course completely for free on
05:55 - YouTube to get you started with python I
05:58 - plan to upload new videos here to
06:00 - YouTube every Monday and every Thursday
06:03 - for at least a couple of months if
06:06 - you're interested in the complete course
06:08 - which teaches you python from scratch
06:11 - and eventually progresses to things like
06:14 - creating graphical user interfaces and
06:16 - using neural networks principal
06:19 - component analysis cluster analysis all
06:22 - that stuff and much more besides then
06:25 - you can find a link in the description
06:27 - or just go to this URL on the screen
06:30 - right here if you finish the whole
06:32 - course you'll be able to write all kinds
06:34 - of general purpose programs in Python
06:36 - and use Python to do machine learning
06:39 - and artificial intelligence as well
06:42 - thank you for watching until next time
06:44 - happy coding
