00:00 - hello my name's John and I'm the creator
00:03 - of the website Cave of programming comm
00:06 - and this is the first video in a
00:08 - complete course on I hope it will be a
00:11 - complete course by the time I finished
00:13 - it on JavaScript and node J s so I
00:18 - started web programming I think it was
00:20 - in like 1997 or something was a long
00:23 - time ago and I couldn't have anticipated
00:26 - that JavaScript would end up turning
00:28 - into this powerful fully fledged
00:30 - language that you could actually have a
00:32 - whole career in because when I started
00:35 - web programming and well for a long time
00:37 - afterwards JavaScript was really a thing
00:40 - that he used to add a little bit of
00:43 - interactivity to websites I can't even
00:46 - remember really
00:48 - when JavaScript came out but for a long
00:49 - time it was a pain in the neck because
00:51 - it ran differently on different browsers
00:53 - and it was a language that ran within a
00:55 - browser it wasn't some free-standing
00:57 - programming language but with no js' all
01:01 - that has changed javascript has changed
01:04 - into a powerful independent fully
01:07 - fledged programming language in its own
01:09 - right you can create websites with it
01:11 - you can create web servers you can
01:14 - create desktop applications in this
01:17 - course my intention is that we're going
01:19 - to learn the JavaScript language itself
01:21 - so we're going to be doing a lot of
01:22 - stuff on the command line but I want to
01:25 - eventually at the end of the course to
01:27 - show you at least one example of how you
01:29 - could use JavaScript to create let's say
01:31 - maybe a simple website something like
01:34 - that so my plan is actually to make this
01:39 - course and then I'm going to make a
01:40 - course that isn't going to be free on
01:42 - react probably but this is a
01:45 - self-contained course in the next video
01:47 - of course I'm hoping that you eventually
01:49 - buy my paid course in the next video
01:52 - we're going to look at what you have to
01:53 - install to get going with JavaScript and
01:55 - node.js
