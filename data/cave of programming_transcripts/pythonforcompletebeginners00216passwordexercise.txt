00:00 - now I'm going to give you an exercise
00:02 - and the exercise is to write a program
00:04 - that we've already seen but without
00:06 - looking back at that program so this is
00:09 - what the program does the exercise is to
00:11 - write a program that asks the user to
00:14 - enter a password and it Compares that
00:17 - password to a hardcoded password in
00:20 - other words you're going to write the
00:21 - correct password directly in your Python
00:25 - program if the password that the user
00:27 - entered matches the the correct password
00:32 - the program prints greetings Professor
00:34 - Falcon and it
00:36 - exits if the password is entered
00:40 - incorrectly the program prints access
00:43 - denied and then it asks for the password
00:46 - again but it will only ask for the
00:48 - password again a total of well two more
00:51 - times so it will ask for the password a
00:53 - maximum of three times if the user keeps
00:56 - entering it incorrectly and after that
00:59 - if they've not entered it correctly it
01:01 - will just exit without printing anything
01:03 - further other than access denied so have
01:06 - a go at that and remember one of the
01:10 - most important principles of software
01:12 - development is that we don't repeat code
01:16 - unnecessarily so you don't want to have
01:18 - three inputs in there asking for the
01:21 - password that might not be a terrible
01:24 - starting point but you don't want that
01:25 - in your final program you need to use a
01:27 - loop in here there are mult multiple
01:30 - possible ways to write this program and
01:32 - if you can get it to work without code
01:35 - duplication in your
01:37 - program then you've succeeded at the
01:40 - exercise and if you can't it's okay cuz
01:43 - the important thing is trying and I'm
01:45 - not just saying that really the
01:46 - important thing at this stage is you
01:48 - have to start trying to write programs
01:50 - because that's what will ultimately make
01:53 - you good at computer
01:56 - programming we'll look at a possible
01:58 - solution in the next video video hello
02:01 - you've been watching a free sample from
02:03 - my Python and machine learning for
02:05 - complete beginners course I'm uploading
02:08 - enough videos from the start of the
02:10 - course to get you started with python
02:12 - and machine learning the full course is
02:14 - absolutely massive if you're interested
02:16 - in it please click the link in the
02:19 - description the complete course covers
02:21 - not only basic python but also some
02:23 - fairly Advanced python even some desktop
02:26 - programming stuff and then goes on to
02:28 - machine learning and artificial
02:31 - intelligence until next time happy
02:33 - coding
