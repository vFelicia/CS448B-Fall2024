00:16 - hello this is John from Cave of
00:20 - programming. comom in this tutorial
00:22 - we're going to look at um passing values
00:25 - two functions so here I've got the code
00:27 - from the last tutorial and I'm going to
00:29 - start actually by changing this because
00:32 - uh one thing I forgot to do in the last
00:33 - tutorial was rename this function this
00:36 - function that we created uh is um it's
00:40 - called process selection but it's
00:41 - actually just getting user input and the
00:43 - selection is processed down here so I
00:47 - could just rename it by hand but let's
00:49 - uh use an eclipse shortcut which is very
00:51 - handy if you've got a lot of um calls to
00:54 - the same function because you can call
00:56 - them repeatedly that's part of the idea
00:59 - and uh you're not sure where they all
01:00 - are so let's just right click this
01:02 - function select it and right click and
01:06 - go to refactor rename and I'm going to
01:09 - give it a new name so I'm going to call
01:11 - it um type in here get input and you'll
01:16 - notice Eclipse has renamed this for me
01:20 - as
01:21 - well now I'd like to split um I'd like
01:26 - to split this code off into its own
01:28 - function so I'd like main to just
01:30 - consist of three function calls show
01:33 - menu get input and process
01:36 - selection uh but at the moment the
01:38 - problem there is we get the selection
01:41 - here and then we have no way of um
01:45 - passing it to um a function that then
01:48 - process processes the input let's have a
01:50 - look at how we can do that so I'm going
01:52 - to type here void process let's call it
01:56 - process um process selection process
01:59 - input it doesn't really manner process
02:01 - selection and I'm going to take this
02:04 - switch statement here I'm going to cut
02:06 - it like this paste it in process
02:10 - selection and so the problem we have now
02:13 - is that uh the selection variable here
02:16 - which is it's the it's the user input
02:18 - that we get
02:20 - here um from here is not available in
02:23 - process selection and to make it
02:26 - available we can type stuff in these
02:28 - round brackets here
02:30 - so we want to pass an integer to process
02:33 - selection and I'm going to type here int
02:36 - selection in these round
02:38 - brackets and now in the main uh function
02:43 - I can type process selection just as
02:46 - before with round brackets because it's
02:49 - a function call and we need we need um
02:52 - to have the round brackets when we call
02:53 - a function as we have um here and here
02:58 - and here but but now I'm going to just
03:01 - type in these round brackets selection
03:04 - so the changes we've made are just we've
03:06 - we're putting the in integer value that
03:09 - we want to pass into these round
03:11 - brackets here when we call the
03:13 - function and uh we've changed the
03:16 - function here uh so that in its round
03:19 - brackets it says in selection this is
03:21 - actually declaring a
03:23 - variable and uh we call this passing a
03:26 - variable and when we pass the variable
03:28 - we're actually copying the value in this
03:30 - variable here copying it uh into this
03:33 - new variable here so this in selection
03:37 - it's not the same as this again it's a
03:39 - completely different variable and the
03:42 - scope of this variable is these curly
03:44 - brackets while the scope of this
03:46 - variable is these curly brackets so as
03:50 - we're returning we're actually uh
03:52 - creating a completely new variable and
03:54 - we're copying the value of this variable
03:56 - into this variable and they don't have
03:58 - to be named the same either
04:00 - so um we could um call this something
04:04 - completely different let's do that
04:06 - option so if I was writing this program
04:08 - just for
04:09 - myself I'd probably call this and um
04:15 - this and this I'd call them all input uh
04:18 - because um I'm I'm well aware that those
04:21 - are completely different variables but
04:22 - because I don't want to confuse you here
04:24 - I'm going to give them all different
04:27 - names uh so this int option receives the
04:31 - value from uh selection here and um it's
04:36 - it's it's a bit like uh throwing a value
04:39 - down a choot so you can think of this as
04:41 - a chute and here we're throwing the
04:43 - value of this variable down the Chute
04:45 - and here we receive it in the value uh
04:48 - option and option it has the right size
04:52 - to receive that value so we're sending
04:54 - an INT down the shoot so to speak we're
04:57 - passing the function an INT and um the
05:00 - function parameter also has Type int so
05:03 - it can it can receive that value we can
05:05 - copy that value into it uh so now our
05:08 - main function looks really simple and it
05:10 - and it shows you exactly what's going on
05:12 - we're showing the menu we're getting
05:14 - user input here and then we're
05:17 - processing the user input here
05:20 - processing the selection that the user
05:21 - made Let's just try that and check that
05:23 - it works so I'm going to run
05:25 - this and when it finally builds and runs
05:29 - that c selection let's say one and it
05:32 - says searching because it's executing
05:34 - case one here so that's it for this
05:37 - tutorial um in the next tutorial we're
05:39 - probably going to look at passing
05:40 - multiple values to functions but to
05:43 - practice this again I'd suggest taking
05:46 - the tutorial uh the project from the
05:48 - last tutorial and creating this new
05:50 - function try to do it without referring
05:52 - back to this source code but if you get
05:54 - stuck refer back uh but try to do it as
05:56 - much as possible from memory and equally
05:58 - if you've written some other program uh
06:01 - just try to declare a function that um
06:04 - that accepts accepts some kind of
06:06 - variable you could return stuff from
06:09 - functions as well as passing stuff to
06:11 - them so it's not a problem combining
06:13 - this kind of thing with this kind of
06:15 - thing you can do that and in the next
06:17 - tutorial we'll look at passing multiple
06:19 - values to functions so that's it for
06:22 - this time and until next time happy
