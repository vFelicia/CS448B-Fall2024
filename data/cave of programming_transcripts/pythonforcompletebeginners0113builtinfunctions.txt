00:00 - in this video we're going to talk a bit
00:02 - more about this program and we're going
00:04 - to talk about buil-in
00:05 - functions so again there will be a lot
00:08 - of
00:09 - lingo a lot of technical terminology in
00:12 - this video but you don't have to
00:13 - memorize it or even fully understand it
00:17 - you'll get used to it gradually as you
00:19 - go through the course so the first thing
00:22 - that we do in this program is we declare
00:24 - a variable and assign this string to it
00:29 - in other words we create this variable
00:31 - and we attach this value to
00:34 - it if you've used a different
00:36 - programming
00:38 - language like Java or Pearl or C++ or
00:42 - whatever you may have got used to using
00:45 - some kind of word there on the left of
00:48 - the
00:49 - variable to say look I'm declaring a
00:52 - variable but python doesn't have any
00:55 - such word to declare a variable in
00:57 - Python you simply assign a value to it
01:02 - so in C++ you might type this in Java
01:06 - you might type this with a capital
01:08 - letter in JavaScript VAR in Pearl my and
01:12 - so on in Python there is no special
01:16 - keyword for declaring
01:19 - variables then we use this print
01:22 - function to display the text enter your
01:25 - name what actually is a function a
01:28 - function is just a block of code that
01:30 - you can run via its name we then use the
01:34 - input
01:35 - function to get some text from the user
01:39 - and we assign that text to this variable
01:43 - called name now functions in Python can
01:46 - be passed values so they can they can be
01:49 - passed values either by giving a literal
01:53 - value to them or giving them some
01:55 - variable that refers to the values you
01:58 - want to pass to them in other words we
02:00 - can send some data to a function when we
02:04 - call the function when we run the
02:07 - function which the function can then do
02:09 - stuff
02:10 - with so here's an example where we are
02:13 - passing a string literal to the print
02:17 - function we are giving the print
02:19 - function some data to work with namely
02:22 - this and we call these bits of data that
02:25 - we passed to functions function
02:28 - arguments now here we can see an example
02:30 - of a function returning some value to
02:34 - the main program where it was called so
02:38 - not only can you pass values to
02:40 - functions you can get values back from
02:45 - functions we say that functions can
02:47 - return values and here the input
02:51 - function returns whatever text the user
02:54 - types and we then declare and assign
02:58 - another variable
03:01 - and then we're just joining some strings
03:02 - together and printing them out with the
03:04 - print
03:05 - function now we can change this program
03:08 - a bit if we take this string here and
03:11 - I'm going to cut it from there and paste
03:14 - it into the round brackets of input
03:17 - let's get rid of this print and if we
03:20 - run this now it does the same thing as
03:23 - before except I can now type my name on
03:26 - the same line as this text so if you
03:30 - pass a string to input it will print
03:33 - that text before waiting for the user to
03:36 - enter
03:37 - input and you're going to get
03:40 - both the stuff that input
03:43 - prints and the stuff that the user Types
03:46 - on the same line so it behaves more like
03:48 - a sort of a shell apart from that this
03:51 - program works exactly the same as before
03:54 - so definitely try this out if you
03:55 - haven't already try the program out and
03:58 - try doing this
04:00 - and you might want to see if you can get
04:01 - a program to do something a bit
04:03 - different like for example can you get
04:06 - it to ask the users's age after it asks
04:09 - for their name and then output the age
04:12 - along with their
04:14 - name anything you can do to practice at
04:17 - this stage is going to be very
04:21 - useful so input and print are built-in
04:25 - functions in Python they're built into
04:28 - python
04:31 - we can create our own functions as well
04:34 - and we're going to look at that later
04:36 - you might wonder what other built-in
04:39 - functions there are in Python let's go
04:42 - to a web browser and search in buil-in
04:46 - functions I'll search for python.org
04:50 - because that's the most authoritative
04:54 - place to find this list I think here we
04:58 - go so so these are all of Python's
05:01 - built-in functions and again you don't
05:04 - have to memorize this by the end of the
05:07 - course you will have seen and used
05:09 - almost all of these functions so do try
05:12 - playing around with this a bit and see
05:15 - what you can make it
05:16 - do this is a free video from my course
05:20 - Python and machine learning for complete
05:23 - beginners I'm releasing the first couple
05:25 - of chapters of this course completely
05:28 - for free on YouTube to get you started
05:30 - with python I plan to upload new videos
05:34 - here to YouTube every Monday and every
05:37 - Thursday for at least a couple of months
05:40 - if you're interested in the complete
05:42 - course which teaches you python from
05:44 - scratch and eventually progresses to
05:47 - things like creating graphical user
05:49 - interfaces and using neural networks
05:52 - principal component analysis cluster
05:55 - analysis all that stuff and much more
05:58 - besides then you can find a link in the
06:00 - description or just go to this URL on
06:03 - the screen right here if you finish the
06:05 - whole course you'll be able to write all
06:08 - kinds of general purpose programs in
06:10 - Python and use Python to do machine
06:12 - learning and artificial intelligence as
06:15 - well thank you for watching until next
06:17 - time happy coding
