00:00 - now we can write our very first Python
00:03 - program so in visual code let's create a
00:05 - new file I can do that from the file new
00:09 - text file menu or I can expand my folder
00:14 - here and click this either way we need
00:17 - to call it something with a py extension
00:21 - I'm going to call this
00:23 - hello.py so
00:27 - hello.py now I'm going to make sure
00:29 - there's no Extra Space on the left here
00:31 - and I'm going to type
00:33 - print round brackets so a pair of round
00:37 - brackets and open a close bracket and
00:39 - inside those round brackets I'm going to
00:41 - put a pair of speech marks notice Visual
00:44 - Studio code is actually putting the
00:45 - closing pairs in for me and between
00:49 - these speech marks I'm going to type
00:52 - hello world or whatever text I like then
00:55 - I'm going to save this with file save or
01:00 - maybe control s on Windows command s Mac
01:02 - whatever you prefer now I need a
01:04 - terminal to run this it is actually
01:07 - possible to run it within Visual Studio
01:10 - code there's a run button
01:13 - here but I'm not going to normally be
01:16 - using this you can see it did run
01:17 - actually it does say hello world here
01:20 - but what I'm going to do instead
01:22 - normally is I'm going to go to a
01:24 - terminal so I can use either the console
01:26 - on my system or I can open a terminal
01:30 - from the terminal menu in Visual Studio
01:33 - code but either way what I really need
01:36 - to do is make sure I've got Powershell
01:39 - activated if I'm going to use that so
01:41 - I'll type
01:43 - pwsh and above all make sure the python
01:46 - environment is activated so we run this
01:49 - with the right version of python so I'm
01:52 - going to type
01:55 - here/ fm/ bin SL activate press the Tab
01:59 - Key to auto complete and P S1 for the
02:03 - Powershell activate script for the
02:05 - virtual environment so since this is a
02:08 - Unix type system I can type clear now to
02:10 - clear the screen that might not work on
02:12 - Windows CLS might work but you don't
02:15 - really need to do that now I'm going to
02:17 - type python let's maybe just get rid of
02:20 - this sidebar just by clicking the icon
02:22 - up there python and a space and then the
02:26 - name of the file I created so hello.py
02:29 - and I click return and it says hello
02:33 - world so a couple of points about this
02:36 - firstly space does matter in Python so
02:39 - you can't have Extra Spaces here it's
02:42 - not going to work if you have space
02:44 - there you can have space above it if you
02:46 - want that still works just fine with the
02:50 - up Arrow here I can actually bring back
02:52 - that command and run it
02:55 - again and when I type something that
02:58 - comes in purs like a round bracket or a
03:01 - curly bracket or a square bracket or
03:04 - speech marks or single quote marks I'm
03:07 - usually going to type the per before I
03:11 - type anything else so notice I type the
03:14 - open and the close round bracket then I
03:16 - went back and filled in the open and
03:18 - close speech mark and then I went and
03:21 - put the text in the middle of the speech
03:23 - marks the reason for this is that there
03:26 - are a lot of pairs of things in computer
03:29 - program
03:30 - not as much in python as in many other
03:33 - languages but you still get a lot of
03:35 - them and I think generally it's better
03:38 - to type a full pair of anything so you
03:40 - know you definitely got the closing
03:42 - bracket or the closing speech mark or
03:45 - whatever before you fill in whatever
03:49 - goes in the middle of them so try that
03:52 - out for yourself to get a Hello World
03:55 - program working is a huge achievement
03:58 - and honestly it's all downhill from here
04:00 - in a good way well that might be a
04:02 - slight
04:04 - exaggeration we're going to look at some
04:06 - tricky things but if you can do this you
04:08 - can do anything I think in the world of
04:11 - coding this is a free video from my
04:14 - course Python and machine learning for
04:17 - complete beginners I'm releasing the
04:19 - first couple of chapters of this course
04:22 - completely for free on YouTube to get
04:24 - you started with python I plan to upload
04:27 - new videos here to YouTube every Monday
04:30 - and every Thursday for at least a couple
04:33 - of months if you're interested in the
04:35 - complete course which teaches you python
04:38 - from scratch and eventually progresses
04:41 - to things like creating graphical user
04:43 - interfaces and using neural networks
04:46 - principal component analysis cluster
04:49 - analysis all that stuff and much more
04:52 - besides then you can find a link in the
04:54 - description or just go to this URL on
04:57 - the screen right here if you finish the
05:00 - whole course you'll be able to write all
05:02 - kinds of general purpose programs in
05:04 - Python and use Python to do machine
05:07 - learning and artificial intelligence as
05:09 - well thank you for watching until next
05:12 - time happy coding
