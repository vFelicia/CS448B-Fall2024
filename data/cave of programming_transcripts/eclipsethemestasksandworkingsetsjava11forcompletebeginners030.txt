00:01 - hello we're going to finish this section
00:05 - by I'm just going to show you some
00:07 - Eclipse tips and tricks a few things you
00:10 - can do with eclipse so hopefully you've
00:12 - created that last program you've got it
00:14 - all working you put in the scanner close
00:16 - and or maybe you've created a similar
00:19 - program of your own there are lots of
00:22 - other things that we can do with strings
00:24 - and we're going to be seeing more of
00:25 - them in the course but rather than
00:27 - overload you with a massive list of
00:29 - everything you can possibly do with a
00:30 - string I'm going to introduce them more
00:33 - try try to introduce them more sort of
00:35 - organically as we go through the course
00:37 - and what I'm going to show you in this
00:40 - video is just a few Eclipse tips and
00:44 - tricks so one thing you can do in
00:46 - Eclipse is I'm using the dark theme here
00:49 - which in this version of Eclipse seemed
00:52 - to be the default and I sort of decided
00:54 - just to go with it but the default used
00:57 - to be and the light theme but you can
01:00 - switch between them and select which one
01:02 - you prefer so if you go to eclipse
01:05 - preferences so maybe that menu is
01:09 - different on windows I'm not completely
01:11 - sure might be in file or something on
01:14 - the Mac I get a particular menu called
01:17 - Eclipse but regardless however you
01:19 - usually go to the Preferences in
01:22 - programs in your operating system go to
01:24 - that you should be able to find the sort
01:27 - of Eclipse preferences somewhere and in
01:30 - this dialog if I type theme and just
01:33 - click appearance here so I've got
01:38 - theming enabled and the dark theme is
01:40 - selected if I want I can select the
01:43 - light theme and I'm going to click apply
01:47 - in close well and then I'm going to
01:50 - restart eclipse because otherwise
01:52 - there's sort of the change from one
01:56 - thing to another might not exactly be
01:59 - complete so I'm going to restart it
02:03 - so there are a few built-in themes and
02:05 - you can find many more on the internet
02:08 - so that's that's completely up to you
02:10 - you can get Eclipse to look sort of more
02:14 - how you want it to look here we go so
02:16 - it's very light now I'll use this for
02:18 - the rest of this video although it's
02:20 - hurting my eyes because I want to show
02:25 - you some things that don't seem to work
02:26 - one of them doesn't work too well in a
02:28 - dark theme something else I want to show
02:30 - you is working sets so you see we've got
02:35 - a lot of programs open here a lot of
02:38 - projects I should say it's becoming a
02:41 - bit cluttered and I can make that more
02:43 - manageable using working sets so this
02:45 - worked fine in a dark theme when I tried
02:48 - it but if you look at a packet Explorer
02:51 - on the left here and if it's not showing
02:54 - you can go to Windows Show view and
02:57 - package Explorer sometimes strangely the
03:01 - console disappears and you can make it
03:03 - reappear by going to window show view
03:05 - console and if you manage to completely
03:08 - scrub your windows in Eclipse you can go
03:11 - to window perspective reset perspective
03:14 - those are all good things to know
03:18 - actually I should also mention that on
03:21 - the top right here these are
03:24 - perspectives so if I click this button
03:27 - we can open other perspectives and what
03:29 - a perspective is is it's just a
03:32 - collection of windows that are geared to
03:35 - a particular task let's cancel that and
03:37 - we are using the sort of Java
03:39 - development perspective and that's what
03:42 - we want for the moment so working sets
03:46 - if I look at a package Explorer there's
03:50 - a little down arrow just there the View
03:53 - menu if I click that I can go to select
03:56 - working set and here I'm going to I'm
04:01 - going to click new and I'm going to
04:06 - select Java I mean make sure that's
04:10 - actually showing on the video here click
04:12 - Next
04:13 - and I'm going to create a working set
04:16 - name called projects projects 1 I'm
04:23 - going to click the add all button to say
04:26 - that all the projects that are open
04:27 - should be part of this working set so a
04:31 - working set or at least the way I use it
04:33 - is really nothing but a collection of
04:35 - projects let's click Add all and click
04:38 - finish so I'm back on this dialog here
04:43 - if I click OK nothing's changed but
04:47 - let's let's do that again and create
04:49 - another working set let's click the down
04:52 - arrow and go to select working set and
04:56 - again I'm going to click new select Java
05:02 - click Next and I'll create another
05:05 - working set called projects 2 and I
05:09 - won't add any projects to that I'll just
05:12 - click finish and click OK now I've got
05:17 - two working sets of projects so if I
05:20 - click the little down arrow another time
05:23 - and click select working set I can
05:28 - select projects 2 or 1 or both so let's
05:33 - try projects 1 and that's got all the
05:36 - projects in it because I added all the
05:38 - projects to work in set 1 if I click the
05:41 - down arrow and go to select working set
05:43 - projects 2 and on tick projects 1 then
05:48 - it's blank now it's sort of cleaned it
05:49 - all up let's close that so my projects
05:53 - are all still there it's just that
05:55 - they're hidden so that that's really
05:57 - useful because if you've got lots of
05:59 - projects open you can decide which ones
06:01 - show at any given moment don't forget
06:03 - you can also just right-click them and
06:05 - close them but then the the icon would
06:07 - still be there in that case so this this
06:10 - just helps you organize your projects
06:12 - and one last thing that I want to show
06:14 - you quickly which didn't work so well in
06:16 - the dark theme unfortunately it was
06:18 - usable but only just
06:21 - due to sort of clashes of font colors is
06:24 - this task list
06:25 - so I can add tasks for myself here if I
06:30 - click hopefully I can remember this new
06:33 - task let's try that and select local and
06:38 - click finish I get this view coming up
06:42 - this task view let's create a task for
06:45 - myself so I want to make another video
06:49 - about primitive types video let's say
06:53 - that's a task for me to do I want to
06:55 - make later on and I could select a date
06:59 - when it when it's to be completed among
07:04 - other things so here but I won't do that
07:08 - you can do it if you want and and this
07:11 - is what I found currently didn't work
07:13 - very well in the dark theme you could
07:15 - use it but you couldn't see these
07:16 - numbers unless you clicked on them or
07:18 - any of this so that was quite confusing
07:20 - but I won't use that anyway what I'm
07:22 - going to do is just save that and you
07:26 - can see it's here in the task view it's
07:33 - appeared there I can add categories as
07:35 - well so if I click this little down
07:37 - arrow and we get out into the middle by
07:41 - the new icon I can go new category I'll
07:46 - create myself a category called videos
07:49 - click OK maybe I can drag this task into
07:53 - that category let's try yeah that worked
07:57 - or you can you can select it when you
07:59 - create a new task you can select
08:02 - category a few crated categories and you
08:05 - can mark tasks this complete so you can
08:08 - probably one of these buttons does it I
08:10 - don't usually use this a lot let's
08:13 - right-click here we can go mark as
08:15 - complete and then it gets a line through
08:18 - it or we can right-click mark as
08:21 - incomplete so it's quite useful quite a
08:23 - handy thing and if you don't like that
08:25 - you can just get rid of it if you want
08:26 - you can just click that arrow it's gone
08:29 - get rid of the outline as well if you're
08:30 - not using that let's go to this task
08:34 - view and go back to the console it's
08:36 - maybe open a file
08:38 - and if you do all of this and then you
08:41 - get confused and you want your default
08:44 - windows back you can go to window
08:46 - perspective reset perspective and it
08:50 - will bring them all back ok we'll leave
08:52 - it there for this video try those out
08:54 - for yourself so we've got working sets
08:57 - and tasks and themes if you're
09:01 - interested in themes ok
09:04 - so until next time happy coding
