00:01 - hello this is John from Cave of program
00:03 - programming. comom in this tutorial
00:05 - we're going to take a look at how to
00:07 - delete all the data from a
00:10 - table uh so when you're learning SQL
00:12 - often it's really useful just to be able
00:14 - to clear out a table without deleting
00:16 - the table itself and at the moment if I
00:19 - do use tutorial one which is my database
00:22 - name and I do show tables we can see
00:26 - that we've got this um we've got this
00:28 - users table so so if I do select star
00:31 - from users that's just going to have
00:33 - whatever junk in it you happen to have
00:35 - added in the course of your
00:37 - experimentation now to delete data from
00:40 - a table you can just do delete from
00:43 - table name I just want to draw your
00:45 - attention to the fact that select has a
00:47 - star in it but the delete from statement
00:50 - which we'll see in a second doesn't and
00:51 - that's because when we do a select as
00:54 - we'll see later on you need to specify
00:56 - which columns you're going to actually
00:58 - output and star means output all columns
01:03 - now since a delete just works on all the
01:06 - different fields in a row so all the
01:07 - columns you don't need that star with
01:10 - the delete statement so we would just
01:12 - type delete from in this case users this
01:16 - isn't going to actually work but let's
01:18 - run it so it says in the console here in
01:21 - the action output pane you are using uh
01:25 - safe update mode and then there's some
01:27 - more information that if you're a
01:29 - complete beginner if you're new to this
01:30 - you won't understand yet although we're
01:32 - going to cover stuff that it mentions in
01:35 - the
01:36 - future uh basically there's a setting in
01:39 - SE in my SQL which the default option is
01:42 - to not let you do a delete without
01:45 - actually narrowing down which particular
01:48 - rows you want to delete but for learning
01:51 - purposes often it's better to switch
01:53 - that off if you've got a production
01:55 - database with data in it that you need
01:56 - to keep safe it's a really good thing
01:59 - that you can't just delete all the rows
02:02 - without specifying which particular rows
02:04 - you want to delete and that's what this
02:06 - option prevents you doing it prevents
02:07 - you deleting all the rows without
02:10 - actually specifying particular rows but
02:13 - for this tutorial purpose for the
02:15 - purposes of learning my SQL we're going
02:17 - to want to switch that option off so you
02:20 - can check what your option is set to by
02:22 - doing select and what we're really
02:24 - interested in is the value of this
02:27 - variable in the session which is going
02:29 - to whatever the default is so let's say
02:32 - two at
02:33 - signs session
02:37 - Dot and it's SQL safe updates I think
02:41 - let's run this and we see that that's
02:43 - set to one meaning it's on so if it was
02:46 - set to zero that's off so session SQL
02:49 - safe updates is what's what's
02:50 - controlling this behavior and we can
02:52 - actually do
02:54 - set uppercase or lower case doesn't
02:56 - matter
02:58 - set C
03:00 - SQL safe
03:02 - updates equals zero let's try
03:07 - that uh that's that seems to have worked
03:10 - I'm always surprised because it's really
03:12 - hard to remember uh these the exact
03:15 - syntax of these commands that I don't
03:16 - use very often and so it's SQL safe
03:19 - updates with underscores in there let's
03:21 - check the value of the session variable
03:24 - now and see what it is so now it's set
03:26 - to not and now
03:28 - finally we we can do delete from
03:32 - users run that so we see now that it
03:35 - executed fine you can see that in the
03:37 - lower Pane and if we do
03:39 - select star from
03:43 - users then um we see there's nothing in
03:46 - it
03:47 - now uh so do try that for yourself try
03:51 - doing a delete from and the name of a
03:53 - table you've created and put some data
03:56 - in and probably it won't work so then
03:59 - you need need to check the value of this
04:01 - session SQL safe updates variable with
04:04 - this kind of syntax and then you can
04:07 - actually change it if it's set to one
04:09 - you can change it to zero and check it
04:12 - again to make sure it really has changed
04:15 - and then you should be able to do delete
04:17 - from and your table name to delete all
04:19 - the rows in your table Okay so until
04:22 - next time happy coding
