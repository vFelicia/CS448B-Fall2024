00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:02 - a look at outputting variables so so far
00:07 - we've got this really simple program and
00:09 - I've created a copy of this and I've
00:11 - called it outputting variables so maybe
00:15 - create a new program yourself and we're
00:19 - going to change this code okay so one
00:23 - thing I should say here is that it's
00:26 - it's really really valuable to just type
00:29 - stuff over and over again I think it's
00:33 - it's too easy to imagine that
00:35 - programming is primarily an intellectual
00:38 - exercise of course it is an intellectual
00:40 - exercise but a lot of the learning that
00:43 - you need to undertake is kind of related
00:47 - to your fingers it you have to get into
00:50 - the habit of typing things and getting
00:52 - used to typing them and you sort of
00:54 - develop a kind of almost a muscle memory
00:57 - and you get used to just typing
01:00 - particular programming constructs so
01:03 - rather than copy your last project
01:06 - always type it out again for the moment
01:09 - and if you want to really accelerate
01:12 - your learning learn to touch tight tight
01:14 - without looking at the keys and you can
01:16 - find lots of programs on the internet
01:18 - too to help you with that but anyway
01:23 - okay so I've got this program here and
01:26 - we're out putting the value total but I
01:29 - can actually add some text to that so
01:31 - within the round brackets here of system
01:34 - dot out dot print line I'm going to
01:37 - write total number of animals let's put
01:45 - a colon there this is just text and then
01:48 - a space and then I'll close the speech
01:50 - mark like this and then after the
01:54 - closing speech mark here so after this
01:58 - I'm going to put a space and a plus
02:01 - space and then total now before we
02:05 - discuss what this is let's see it
02:07 - running let's run it and it says
02:11 - total number of animals 12 which is much
02:15 - more helpful if you're actually going to
02:17 - write a program for example I don't know
02:19 - to help you calculate something help you
02:22 - do your tax whatever obviously it's very
02:26 - useful to output text with your numbers
02:30 - so we've already used a plus sign here
02:34 - and what this plus sign did was we added
02:38 - the values stored in these two variables
02:41 - together or as a quick way of saying
02:44 - that I could say that it adds these two
02:45 - variables together yeah it's the number
02:48 - of cats the number of dogs adding cats
02:50 - and dogs these two variables are both
02:53 - have type int or integer variables now
02:57 - what we're doing here is something
02:58 - different the plus sign actually has a
03:00 - different meaning we've got some text
03:03 - here and we are adding a an integer to
03:08 - it so you can't add text to integers you
03:12 - can't add like the word giraffe to the
03:15 - number 13 let's say it makes no sense
03:18 - what this is actually doing is it's
03:21 - turning this number into some text and
03:25 - concatenating it with this text so it's
03:29 - essentially it's joining the number to
03:32 - some text it's kind of a text operation
03:34 - and the result is what we see in the
03:38 - console below which is this we can also
03:43 - output so after we've declared the
03:46 - variables and given them values we can
03:49 - output all of them if we want let's
03:51 - write that let's try that let's write
03:53 - this out control space and number of
04:00 - carts and plus cats notice that I left a
04:08 - space before the closing speech mark the
04:12 - everything within the closing speech
04:15 - mark within the speech marks is just
04:17 - text so even this space is just some
04:19 - text but it looks nicer when its output
04:23 - if we put space there because
04:25 - we got this nice space here and it's
04:28 - really important to strive for
04:30 - legibility and beauty in all of your
04:33 - coding it'll make it a lot easier so if
04:37 - I write number of cats and then plus
04:38 - cats and then output that let's run it
04:43 - so it says number of cats seven total
04:45 - number of animals twelve
04:46 - let's output the number of dogs as well
04:49 - so I'm going to write it here number of
04:55 - dogs one thing this is really useful for
05:00 - is helping you to get bugs out of your
05:03 - code because whatever variables you have
05:05 - in your program you can quickly output
05:08 - the values of them just using this owl
05:11 - system dot out dot print line and that
05:13 - can be very very helpful so now we're
05:17 - outputting the number of cats dogs and
05:19 - the total number of them let's take a
05:21 - look there we go and let's also add some
05:27 - other number of animals in here so I
05:30 - could write int what else would you keep
05:33 - in your house maybe some people keep
05:35 - rats I don't see how it's going to be
05:37 - possible to keep all these animals from
05:39 - devouring each other but anyway so
05:42 - interrupts equals let's say we've got
05:44 - three rats which is three too many in my
05:47 - opinion but you know each to their own
05:49 - so we've said in total equals cats plus
05:52 - dogs we can just add another plus there
05:55 - and we can write rats we can add them
05:57 - all together
05:58 - cats plus dogs plus rats let's output
06:02 - the number of rats as well since we've
06:05 - output the number of cats and dogs
06:07 - number of rats and plus rats so we were
06:14 - just using this plus to join the number
06:17 - of rats with this text here okay finally
06:21 - let's try this and there we go we've got
06:26 - a number of cats number of dogs number
06:27 - of rats and the total animals is fifteen
06:30 - which is too many but there you go ok
06:33 - try this for yourself experiment a
06:35 - little bit add add stuff together
06:37 - doesn't
06:38 - to the animals can be whatever you want
06:39 - the important thing is to type it out
06:41 - and create your project from scratch as
06:44 - well don't copy it copying is useful but
06:49 - at this stage the important thing is to
06:51 - get practice writing out code okay so
06:55 - until next time happy coding
