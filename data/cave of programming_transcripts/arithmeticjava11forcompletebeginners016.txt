00:00 - hello in this video we're going to take
00:03 - a look at arithmetic in Java so we're
00:06 - gradually beginning to get towards
00:09 - writing something that really looks like
00:11 - a computer program and might actually be
00:13 - useful so let's let's delete this this
00:18 - is a copy of the program I was working
00:20 - on in the last video and we've got in
00:27 - arithmetic obviously we've got well four
00:30 - operators that are very commonly used
00:32 - we've got we've got plus plus operator
00:37 - these are called binary operators
00:39 - because they work on two values together
00:42 - you know like three plus four there's
00:44 - two values so it's a binary operator and
00:47 - in the general name for these things is
00:49 - they're called operators we've also got
00:52 - divided and in Java this symbol for
00:55 - divide is a slash like that you have to
00:58 - get the right kind of slash if you're
00:59 - going from left to right it's you'd have
01:02 - to go up up a hill if you imagine sort
01:05 - of I'm gesturing with my fingers which
01:07 - of course you can't see but it's like a
01:09 - hill sloping upwards from left to right
01:11 - we've also got multiply and in Java
01:17 - that's an asterisk and in fact these
01:20 - conventions are common in very many
01:22 - programming languages and we have
01:26 - subtract subtract which is the normal
01:30 - sign it expect it's a short dash like
01:32 - that let's try these out a little bit so
01:36 - we'll have some variables in fact you
01:42 - can't just use sis outs maybe we should
01:44 - also just do that to start with and then
01:46 - we'll take a bit more of an extended
01:48 - look at this in the next video I think
01:50 - so if I write system dot out dot print
01:53 - line seven plus three we expect to see
02:00 - 10 and of course we do see 10 there we
02:05 - go
02:05 - we'll try some try some other things
02:08 - we'll try all of them
02:11 - so if we try 9/3
02:15 - we should see three so we try this so we
02:23 - say it says three here's a surprise if
02:28 - we do let's say ten divided by three we
02:35 - run this we still get three why is that
02:39 - well if you divide one integer by
02:46 - another integer the remainder will be
02:48 - discarded so you won't you won't get
02:51 - back a floating-point value you'll still
02:56 - get back an integer value so for example
02:58 - 5 divided by 2 would be 2 because we're
03:03 - just discarding the remainder of 1 if
03:06 - you divide an integer by an integer then
03:09 - the result will also be an integer but
03:12 - you can use floating point values so if
03:15 - I divide 10 point zero by let's say well
03:20 - let's say 3.0 then we'll get the answer
03:25 - that you might expect 3 point 3 3 3
03:28 - recurring so you can see that with
03:31 - floating point values it works and
03:33 - you'll get a floating point answer even
03:36 - if only one of your values is floating
03:38 - point so for example if we divide let's
03:42 - say let's try dividing nine by four
03:50 - point naught let's try that so if we do
03:58 - that we should get yeah we get two point
04:01 - two five two and a quarter so that that
04:05 - works because one of the values is
04:08 - floating point one floating point value
04:13 - gives floating point result now what
04:18 - I've just done what I'm actually doing
04:19 - here which actually I should have
04:21 - mentioned and I think I've maybe touched
04:23 - on it briefly
04:24 - I have but if you write two forward
04:28 - slashes like this everything else that
04:30 - you write on that line is a comment it's
04:35 - very useful to write comments in your
04:37 - code but it's better to use them to
04:42 - describe kind of what you what you're
04:45 - intending to do overall or what you've
04:47 - done overall there's not much point
04:50 - putting a comment saying output 10/3
04:56 - because you should learn that you should
04:59 - learn that you should learn to
05:01 - understand that just from seeing this
05:02 - code and also if you write a comment and
05:05 - then you change the code and you don't
05:06 - change the comment you can seriously
05:08 - mislead yourself so comments are
05:11 - important but generally better saved for
05:14 - blocks of code where otherwise it
05:16 - wouldn't be clear what the intention of
05:18 - it is for that sort of thing
05:20 - we'll take another look at this at least
05:23 - in a video shortly actually okay let's
05:26 - carry on with this so if I write this
05:29 - out let's try so we've got we've got
05:34 - plus we got divided and let's try
05:38 - multiply so three times four we expect
05:43 - out to be twelve there we go it works
05:46 - and of course subtraction so let's let's
05:51 - do 3 minus 4 because that should give us
05:54 - minus 1 and if we actually run this we
05:57 - see that indeed we get minus 1 so try
06:01 - all of those out for yourself and put
06:04 - some comments in as well just to kind of
06:06 - describe what you're doing although they
06:08 - may be a bit overly precise unnecessary
06:11 - at the moment it's good to get into the
06:13 - habit of using comments a little bit try
06:16 - them all out and don't forget to try
06:17 - into integer division like this one and
06:20 - assure yourself that it doesn't it
06:24 - discards the remainder it doesn't work
06:26 - quite as you might otherwise expect okay
06:29 - and try floating point division as well
06:32 - you can try all of these with floating
06:34 - points and integers if you can be
06:37 - bothered
06:38 - okay so until next time happy coding
