00:00 - in this video I just want to talk about
00:02 - a few things we can do with this hello
00:04 - world program and I want to give you a
00:06 - few tips for working with Visual Studio
00:09 - code well on my machine the menu is
00:12 - called code it could be called something
00:14 - different or this menu option could be
00:17 - somewhere else on your system but you'll
00:19 - find it pretty easily there is an option
00:21 - called preferences
00:23 - and in there we've got an option of
00:26 - for keyboard shortcuts and it's worth
00:29 - getting a bit familiar with this or at
00:31 - least having a look at it
00:33 - so for example if I want to duplicate a
00:36 - line let's type line
00:38 - we can see that there is a command for
00:41 - doing exactly that we can this is going
00:44 - to look different on your system if
00:45 - you're using Windows but on the Mac I
00:48 - can press shift alt and the down arrow
00:51 - to duplicate a line downwards and you
00:53 - can also duplicate the line upwards and
00:55 - there are lots of other useful commands
00:57 - that you can find in here by searching
01:00 - and it's very easy to set your own
01:02 - custom commands so you don't need to
01:05 - memorize these but if you find yourself
01:07 - doing something a lot some kind of
01:09 - editing action it is worth having a look
01:12 - in here and seeing if there's an
01:14 - existing shortcut or if you can create
01:16 - one to an existing command
01:20 - so let's try that out I'm going to just
01:22 - duplicate this line and you can do this
01:24 - just by copying it and pasting it or you
01:28 - can do it using the shortcut command
01:31 - so if I save this and then run it
01:38 - then of course it prints hello world
01:40 - twice by the way there is a peculiar
01:43 - thing I've noticed about
01:46 - Powershell at least on my system which
01:49 - is that if I don't go through this step
01:51 - of modifying the file to be executable
01:54 - so I can run it just by typing the name
01:57 - of it it actually fails silently which
02:01 - is unusual behavior for a shell and that
02:04 - can be confusing so if you don't see any
02:06 - output and you're using Mac or Linux
02:09 - then maybe you just got to add
02:11 - executable permissions for it but I can
02:14 - also run that of course like this and
02:16 - you can put pretty much whatever text
02:19 - you want in here
02:22 - let's try that
02:25 - so what I would suggest is that you try
02:28 - playing around with this really basic
02:29 - program just try putting more lines in
02:32 - there try putting different text between
02:35 - these double quotes
02:36 - and see what happens you can put almost
02:40 - any text in here
02:43 - so what we're doing here is we're
02:45 - calling the print function
02:48 - so we're running some code called print
02:51 - in other words
02:52 - and we're supplying it with a string so
02:56 - in other words a string of letters
02:59 - some characters and you can put more or
03:02 - less any character in here there are
03:04 - just one or two things that might cause
03:06 - you problems
03:08 - in particular a backslash like that has
03:11 - a special meaning within python strings
03:14 - so I'm not sure what will happen if I
03:16 - try to run that
03:18 - well actually it works anyway
03:20 - so Python's pretty forgiving with things
03:22 - that could go wrong but maybe something
03:25 - like this does that work
03:29 - it actually does okay
03:32 - so you can type more or less anything in
03:35 - here but it's possible you could come
03:38 - across something
03:40 - that you can't type but generally most
03:42 - things are going to work
03:44 - another thing that I want to mention
03:45 - about Visual Studio code is that it has
03:49 - this thing called the command palette
03:51 - so on my system this is in the view menu
03:54 - and I go to view command palette
03:58 - and then let's type code in here
04:01 - and I find this option shell command
04:03 - install code command in path
04:07 - so things that are in what we call the
04:09 - path in your shell those are commands
04:12 - that are accessible in the shell
04:17 - like for example the python command so
04:19 - if I do that
04:21 - then in my shell here in Powershell
04:25 - I can actually open files by typing code
04:28 - and then the name of the file
04:30 - so of course this is already open but
04:33 - let's try closing it
04:35 - and do that
04:37 - and you can see it works and that's I
04:39 - find that really useful sometimes but
04:42 - the normal way to open a file
04:44 - would be to use well file open or use
04:47 - the Explorer here which you can toggle
04:49 - with this icon and you can see that
04:51 - there I'm able to open hello.pi
04:55 - and I've got this files.txt just because
04:58 - I created it but actually I'm not going
05:00 - to use this
05:01 - and I can also delete it from here as
05:04 - well if I want
05:06 - and of course this VM directory that
05:09 - contains your virtual environment stuff
05:10 - so you don't want to mess with that this
05:12 - is a folder I've created you don't need
05:14 - to create it but I'm trying to
05:15 - reorganize
05:17 - source code a bit so it's going to look
05:19 - nice when you when you finally see this
05:21 - so at the moment you probably only have
05:24 - hello Pi present here plus the VM
05:29 - directory okay so have a go create a few
05:32 - new new lines a few new lines of print
05:35 - statements as we call them
05:38 - and and try putting other text in it and
05:40 - just see what happens this is a free
05:43 - video from my course Python and machine
05:46 - learning for complete beginners I'm
05:49 - releasing the first couple of chapters
05:51 - of this course completely for free on
05:53 - YouTube to get you started with python I
05:57 - plan to upload new videos here to
05:59 - YouTube every Monday and every Thursday
06:02 - for at least a couple of months if
06:05 - you're interested in the complete course
06:07 - which teaches you python from scratch
06:10 - and eventually progresses to things like
06:12 - creating graphical user interfaces and
06:15 - using neural networks principal
06:17 - component analysis cluster analysis all
06:21 - that stuff and much more besides then
06:23 - you can find a link in the description
06:25 - or just go to this URL on the screen
06:28 - right here if you finish the whole
06:30 - course you'll be able to write all kinds
06:33 - of general purpose programs in Python
06:35 - and use Python to do machine learning
06:37 - and artificial intelligence as well
06:40 - thank you for watching until next time
06:42 - happy coding
