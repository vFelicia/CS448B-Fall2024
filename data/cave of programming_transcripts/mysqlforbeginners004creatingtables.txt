00:00 - hello this is John from cave of
00:02 - programming calm in this tutorial we're
00:05 - going to create a simple database in my
00:07 - sequel workbench we'll add a table to
00:10 - the database add some data to it and
00:12 - then query the table so my my sequel
00:16 - server is already running as I can tell
00:19 - if I go to this little utility for
00:21 - stopping and starting it so I'm going to
00:23 - go to my sequel workbench and on the
00:27 - home screen here so if you're not on a
00:29 - home screen already pretty properly are
00:31 - you need to click this home button in
00:33 - the top left corner here's a connection
00:35 - I've already created I'm just gonna
00:37 - delete that for the moment so we can
00:39 - start from scratch I'm going to click
00:41 - the plus button buy my sequel
00:43 - connections and we'll give this a name
00:45 - so let's call that tutorial alright I'll
00:48 - just call it default because this is the
00:50 - only my sequel instance that I'm going
00:53 - to connect to with this workbench so
00:56 - we've got the user name in there we've
00:59 - got an IP address here which is the kind
01:02 - of local IP address of this particular
01:05 - machine so this isn't on the internet if
01:07 - it was on the internet in this database
01:09 - my database server this IP address will
01:13 - be different and this is a port which
01:15 - we're going to connect on is the default
01:17 - for my sequel 3 3 0 6 and again if you
01:21 - are on the internet somewhere you use
01:22 - this information to connect your
01:25 - database but the defaults here which
01:29 - were already filled in for me apart from
01:30 - the connection name they're good for
01:33 - connecting to my local server so I'm
01:35 - going to click test connection it says
01:38 - it's ok so we'll click OK and now I've
01:41 - got this icon here so if your version of
01:44 - my sequel workbench works a bit
01:45 - differently don't worry about it you
01:48 - just need to go through this sort of
01:49 - equivalent steps whatever they are on
01:51 - your version to get this working and it
01:53 - will be something similar to this let's
01:56 - double click this connection though so
01:58 - now it's opened a tab where I can write
02:01 - sequel commands I'm going to start with
02:03 - show databases and I'm going to execute
02:06 - that I could use the lightning strike
02:09 - button bhangra news command and
02:12 - turn command and enter and on Windows I
02:15 - guess it would be control and enter but
02:17 - that will execute the command if you've
02:19 - got the cursor on this Lions let's do
02:22 - that so we can see these are the
02:25 - databases I've got at the moment and I'm
02:27 - going to delete this command that I've
02:28 - just typed and bad create database let's
02:33 - call it tutorial 1 and execute that the
02:37 - same way and then I can delete that and
02:40 - we can go back to show databases show
02:44 - databases so now we see and that we've
02:49 - got the tutorial one database created
02:51 - and we also see in the lower pane here
02:53 - which is really important that all the
02:55 - commands executed successfully so if you
02:58 - type something incorrectly then you'll
03:00 - see red arrow icons down here but these
03:03 - are all green showing me that all my
03:04 - commands are running it's really
03:06 - important to keeping an eye on that pane
03:09 - down here let's make it a bit bigger too
03:11 - to cheder your sequel commands are
03:14 - running correctly now I can go ahead and
03:18 - create the table but first I need to
03:20 - tell my sequel that I want to work with
03:23 - this particular database that I've just
03:24 - created so I'm going to type use
03:27 - tutorial 1 which is the name of my
03:29 - database and execute that and again we
03:32 - see from the lower pane that it's
03:33 - executed successfully so you'd normally
03:37 - have like one database per different
03:39 - application that you're going to use to
03:42 - connect to it so if I'd if I have some
03:45 - application that I want to use a
03:47 - database I want it to be a shared
03:49 - database that I'm going to put on the
03:50 - internet for example then I create a
03:53 - different database within the my sequel
03:56 - database server like this for every
03:58 - application and everyone using that
04:02 - application could connect to the same
04:04 - database so we've created the database
04:07 - and we're using this database now I'm
04:09 - going to create a table so I'll say
04:11 - create table and let's give it a name
04:15 - let's call it users and after another
04:18 - space I'm going to put two round
04:19 - brackets and in here I need to specify
04:22 - what columns might
04:24 - has so we'll just give this one column
04:26 - to start with I'm gonna call the column
04:29 - username it doesn't really matter
04:32 - whether you make this uppercase or
04:34 - lowercase I prefer lowercase myself in
04:39 - the early days of sequel uppercase was
04:41 - more common and we're going to have to
04:44 - say what type this column is so what
04:46 - type of thing does it store I just want
04:49 - this to store text and I don't know what
04:50 - the length of the text is going to be so
04:53 - I'm going to just say text here textures
04:55 - have built in my sequel type so this is
04:59 - one of the types of things that you can
05:00 - store in a date in a table column let's
05:04 - execute that and again we see the green
05:07 - icon at the bottom here showing me that
05:09 - my syntax was correct then it's type
05:12 - show tables and execute that so now we
05:17 - can see in this sort of middle pane that
05:19 - is showing me the results of that query
05:21 - and it's saying we've got this table
05:23 - called users so we've just got one table
05:26 - in our database called users I can also
05:28 - if I want to see more information about
05:30 - that table because I've forgotten what's
05:33 - actually in it
05:33 - I can type desc users and execute that
05:39 - and then we see that we've got one
05:41 - column in there called username of type
05:43 - text they thought it also tells me that
05:46 - it's allowed to be null so we could put
05:48 - like no empty values in there if we
05:51 - wanted and sequel the syntax of secret
05:55 - verse vary a bit between different
05:57 - databases and the commands that you use
05:59 - to switch to a database or view a table
06:02 - these in particular tend to vary between
06:04 - databases so desc users this might be
06:08 - different in a different database and
06:10 - also things like create database and
06:13 - show tables but the sequel commands you
06:17 - use to create tables they're fairly
06:19 - standard but again there's going to be
06:21 - minor differences between different
06:22 - types of database like Oracle or my
06:25 - sequel and in particular the types that
06:27 - you can use text or infer integers or
06:31 - whatever they're going to differ a bit
06:32 - between different kinds of databases so
06:35 - let's
06:36 - let's actually add some data to this
06:38 - table so we know we've got one column
06:40 - called username I'm going to type here
06:42 - insert into and the name of the table
06:46 - which is users and we're going to put
06:50 - round brackets in there and specify the
06:52 - columns that were inserting into so we
06:54 - just want to insert until the username
06:56 - column so I put that in your own
06:57 - brackets then after the brackets and
07:00 - then its height values and another pair
07:03 - of round brackets and in the second pair
07:04 - of round bucket round brackets I can
07:07 - specify what values I want to insert and
07:11 - what I can only insert one value at a
07:13 - time here so let's in double quotes
07:15 - means double quotes because this is a
07:17 - string it's some natural text rather
07:20 - than being say a numerical value so we
07:24 - put it in double quotes and that's I
07:26 - didn't air a user name like Bob I'm
07:31 - gonna just execute that again we see
07:33 - that it's executed successfully and now
07:36 - well we could change this and add
07:39 - another value in there so we'll have two
07:40 - rows and information in our table then
07:42 - let's change Bob to Vicki and execute
07:45 - that again so now we've got two users in
07:48 - our database and to see all the values
07:51 - in this table in our database he can add
07:54 - multiple tables in a database and you
07:56 - usually do but we've just got this one
07:58 - so I want to I want to look at all the
08:01 - values in this table now that I've
08:03 - inserted into it and to do that I'm
08:05 - going to type select star as asterisk
08:09 - from and the table name which is users
08:12 - and if I execute that we can now see
08:15 - here in the middle pane two values Bob
08:17 - and Vicki so when you see all of this
08:20 - stuff at first it seems really
08:23 - complicated and some people have a
08:25 - tendency to make a lot of notice and
08:27 - really agonize over it intellectually
08:29 - but the thing you have to do is just
08:32 - type this type nice commands don't worry
08:34 - about the fact that you don't understand
08:36 - them fully at the moment perhaps just
08:38 - type them out and get them working make
08:40 - sure you can actually type these and
08:42 - execute it so have a go this yourself
08:44 - create your own database call it
08:46 - whatever you like the database name and
08:49 - table
08:49 - names they will probably have to not
08:52 - have spaces in them in any case it's
08:56 - good practice certainly not to put
08:57 - spaces in database or table names but
09:00 - you can make it whatever name you like
09:02 - for your database or your tables in the
09:05 - database so try creating a table add
09:08 - some data to it and select the data from
09:11 - it so you can actually see it follow
09:12 - through the steps that I've actually
09:14 - done here because that's the really most
09:16 - effective way to learn and in the next
09:19 - tutorial we'll look at what else we can
09:21 - do we'll look at doing some more complex
09:24 - inserts and selects probably so until
09:27 - next time happy coding
