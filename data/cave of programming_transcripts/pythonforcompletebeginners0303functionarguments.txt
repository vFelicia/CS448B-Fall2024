00:00 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:01 - at function arguments let's create a
00:04 - simple function I'm going to use the
00:07 - defa keyword and then I'll make up a
00:09 - name like
00:11 - greet and so we've got the round
00:13 - brackets the colon and I'll make this
00:15 - function just print
00:18 - hello now let's create a main function
00:21 - So Def main round brackets column and
00:25 - this is where we put the code that
00:27 - basically starts off our program so for
00:30 - the moment let's just call greet in
00:32 - there and then at the bottom of the
00:34 - program we're going to run main we're
00:36 - going to call
00:37 - Main so we call Main here main simply
00:41 - calls the Greet function that's all it
00:43 - does and the Greet function is going to
00:45 - print hello let's run it and see what it
00:50 - does so it just says hello now supposing
00:54 - in main we do some stuff before we call
00:56 - the Greet function namely I'm going to
00:59 - ask the user what their name is let's
01:02 - say name equals
01:04 - input what is your name and we'll create
01:08 - a sort of prompt here for them to type
01:12 - at so I run the
01:15 - program it says what is your name then
01:18 - it says hello now it would be nice if I
01:21 - got this greet function to print hello
01:23 - and then my
01:25 - name but the problem is how do I get
01:27 - name from here in Main
01:31 - to here in the Greet function where I
01:33 - can actually print it out
01:35 - usefully and we do this with something
01:39 - called function arguments so an argument
01:42 - as I've said previously is a piece of
01:45 - data that you passed to a function and
01:46 - we have been using those we passed here
01:49 - for example an argument to the input
01:53 - function what if we could pass an
01:55 - argument to the Greet
01:57 - function which we could then use inside
02:00 - greet let's in here in the round
02:04 - brackets type a variable name which I'm
02:07 - going to make up let's call it
02:10 - username so this is literally just the
02:12 - name of a variable that I've literally
02:14 - just made up and typing variable names
02:17 - within these round brackets here
02:20 - actually creates this variable but now
02:23 - greet expects us to pass some data to it
02:26 - because of this so I can pass name in
02:29 - here
02:30 - and name will end up in this variable
02:33 - here so we can actually print it out
02:36 - let's put a space there and then do plus
02:43 - username so you can think of these round
02:45 - brackets as a bit like a kind of a chute
02:49 - you're getting name here and then you're
02:52 - throwing it down the
02:53 - Chute and where does it appear it
02:56 - appears here so it lands in this
02:59 - variable here
03:00 - and then we can actually use it let's
03:02 - just run this so you can see what it
03:04 - does what is your name John and it says
03:07 - hello John so this variable username it
03:10 - has nothing to do with this name
03:12 - variable it's a totally different
03:14 - variable but it ends up referring to the
03:16 - same piece of data which is whatever
03:19 - name the user enters at the prompt I
03:22 - could also call this
03:24 - name I could write name here if I want
03:26 - and then I have to write name there
03:29 - but it's important to realize that
03:32 - this bit of code here is actually
03:35 - creating a new variable called name
03:37 - which has nothing to do with this
03:39 - variable called name there's no
03:40 - connection between them yes these
03:42 - variables are both called
03:44 - name but they're not the same variable a
03:47 - kind of connection is made only in as
03:50 - much as we are passing some data to the
03:53 - Greet function which the name variable
03:56 - at this point refers to and that ends up
03:58 - in this name variable here let's change
04:00 - this back to username because I think to
04:03 - start with that's less
04:05 - confusing to have different names for
04:07 - these two
04:09 - variables in fact every variable has a
04:11 - scope that is it has a region or area of
04:14 - the
04:15 - program where the variable actually
04:17 - exists so this name variable here is
04:21 - going to exist within this main function
04:25 - and this username variable exists within
04:27 - this greet function and outside of that
04:30 - they don't exist so if I put some code
04:33 - here and try to write print
04:37 - name I'm just going to get an error
04:39 - because outside of this function name
04:42 - does not exist that's outside of the
04:45 - scope of this name variable we can only
04:48 - refer to it inside the function so if I
04:51 - put some
04:52 - code into this function code block then
04:56 - of course we can refer to it
05:00 - so let's get rid of this and the thing
05:02 - to do with this I think is just type it
05:05 - out and get it working as usual and you
05:08 - can play around with it a bit you could
05:10 - try defining another function see if you
05:12 - can pass some different piece of data to
05:15 - a different function maybe whatever you
05:17 - like but the important thing is to type
05:18 - this out and actually see it working
05:22 - after you've typed it yourself you've
05:23 - been watching a free sample from my
05:26 - Python and machine learning for complete
05:28 - beginners course I'm uploading enough
05:31 - videos from the start of the course to
05:33 - get you started with python and machine
05:35 - learning the full course is absolutely
05:37 - massive if you're interested in it
05:39 - please click the link in the description
05:42 - the complete course covers not only
05:44 - basic python but also some fairly
05:46 - Advanced python even some desktop
05:49 - programming stuff and then goes on to
05:51 - machine learning and artificial
05:53 - intelligence until next time happy
05:56 - coding
