00:00 - hello in this video we're going to talk
00:02 - a bit about formatting and this isn't an
00:06 - incredibly important topic we're soon
00:09 - going to look on we're going to go on to
00:11 - look at the really the fundamental nuts
00:14 - and bolts of programming but it's
00:16 - important that we get this right at the
00:19 - start there are some things that we must
00:20 - get right before we really even begin
00:23 - and this is one of them so let's create
00:27 - a new project let's go to file new Java
00:29 - project I won't keep doing this with
00:32 - every video but I'm doing this just a
00:34 - few times because it is important that
00:36 - you remember it and do try it yourself
00:38 - let's let's call this formatting and
00:40 - make sure I've got jari 11 selected
00:43 - click Next on tick create module in
00:46 - folks we're not going to use that now
00:48 - click finish and right-click the project
00:51 - that's been generated and go to new
00:53 - class let's give it a class called app
00:56 - and put it in a package called
00:58 - application and tick to say that I want
01:01 - a public static void main click finish
01:03 - ok so we can add some statements to this
01:08 - now I want to just point out Java is
01:16 - Java is a programming language that has
01:18 - been influenced by various other
01:21 - programming languages and two particular
01:24 - influences on Java were C and C++ so in
01:30 - Java if we create a statement let's
01:33 - write this out hello so this is a
01:39 - statement it's kind of one piece of code
01:41 - that does something and it finishes in a
01:44 - semicolon and that idea of finishing
01:48 - statements with a semicolon comes from C
01:53 - and C++ maybe there were other languages
01:56 - that use the idea earlier but as far as
01:58 - Java is concerned this is a C or C++
02:01 - thing and C and C++ were too Pro or 2
02:05 - programming languages that have been
02:08 - around for absolutely ages and are still
02:11 - extremely widely used
02:13 - similarly these curly brackets Darcy and
02:17 - also a C++ thing so he come from these
02:20 - other programming languages as do many
02:22 - other things in Java now there are
02:30 - fundamentally basically two different
02:34 - ways of formatting your brackets in
02:38 - these programming languages so one way
02:41 - is when you open a curly bracket like
02:44 - this like this one here or this one here
02:50 - here and one style puts each opening
02:55 - curly bracket on its own line like this
02:59 - now you can use that in Java but I don't
03:04 - recommend it because by far the most
03:06 - popular style in Java is to put the
03:10 - opening curly brackets on the same line
03:12 - as the sort of code that identifies
03:16 - what's about to happen in these curly
03:19 - brackets so the curly brackets and the
03:23 - code within them we call it a code block
03:25 - and code blocks usually have something
03:29 - written before them that basically says
03:32 - what they are or what they do so we put
03:36 - the the opening curly bracket on the
03:39 - same line is that bit of code that says
03:41 - basically what's going to happen
03:42 - essentially in in the code block so I
03:48 - recommend you use this uses style and
03:50 - Eclipse makes it easy to type code like
03:53 - this anyway space doesn't really matter
04:00 - in a java program you can you can put
04:05 - blank lines in let's type Sissel how are
04:09 - you you can put them in where you want
04:13 - them and you basically just add blank
04:15 - lines for readability I am a computer
04:20 - so that will run and we could also do it
04:25 - without those without so many blank
04:27 - lines on the Mac here I can use command
04:31 - D to delete an entire line and I think
04:34 - on Windows probably ctrl D will do the
04:37 - trick
04:37 - that's a handy shortcut so put blank
04:40 - lines in and you use space generally to
04:43 - make your program readable try to strive
04:46 - always to make your program look
04:48 - beautiful you know and look logical and
04:51 - readable ok so we're going to talk about
04:57 - Auto formatting in the next video and
05:00 - we're going to talk about indentation
05:02 - which is a very important aspect of
05:05 - formatting so until next time happy
05:07 - coding
