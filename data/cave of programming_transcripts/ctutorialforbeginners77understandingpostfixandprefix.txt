00:17 - hello this is John from K programming.
00:20 - comom I wanted to kind of come back and
00:23 - added uh maybe one or two kind of bonus
00:26 - videos to this course with little things
00:28 - that I um probably have have in many
00:31 - cases touched on but um didn't really go
00:35 - into explicitly and in this tutorial I
00:37 - just want to mention the postfix and
00:40 - prefix increment and DEC and and
00:42 - decrement operators we've seen that if
00:44 - you've got uh let's say a an integer
00:47 - like this well it has to be an integer
00:49 - really or some kind of integer type
00:51 - let's set that to eight we can we can
00:54 - type stuff like value
00:57 - Plus+ uh that's the that's called the
01:00 - postfix increment operator and then we
01:03 - can do see out value like
01:06 - this so if we run this of course we get
01:11 - nine okay we've got to build it first
01:14 - that would probably
01:16 - help so um this this isn't any anything
01:20 - unexpected we've seen this before it's
01:22 - pretty simple and we get nine uh but we
01:26 - can also use this in prefix form so that
01:29 - was post fix but we can also type this
01:33 - prefix whoops so if we run this once
01:36 - again we get nine and the same is true
01:40 - of the um of the decrement operator we
01:44 - can type this to decrement decrease the
01:47 - value of value by one so now it's seven
01:50 - and that also exists in a prefix form
01:53 - like
01:54 - this which will also give us seven so
01:56 - what's the difference between prefix and
01:59 - postfix so the answer is that if you
02:02 - have an expression let's um well here
02:05 - here for example we we do have an
02:07 - expression uh with postfix the value is
02:10 - going to be used U and then incremented
02:14 - with prefix it's incremented and then
02:16 - used so if we look at this now what
02:19 - we're going to get is eight so we see
02:21 - that's eight that's because it used the
02:23 - value and then incremented it if we did
02:27 - this on the other hand it's going to
02:29 - increment the value and then use it so
02:32 - now we actually see nine and with this
02:35 - version it was actually incremented so
02:38 - if we output this again
02:40 - now then you can see that it was
02:42 - incremented so the second one's going to
02:44 - be nine here it's just that on the first
02:47 - one because it's postfix it used the
02:50 - value and then it incremented it whereas
02:52 - prefix would increment it and then use
02:54 - it so you can see exp Expressions um
02:58 - like for example int
03:00 - uh number
03:02 - equals uh value
03:05 - Plus+ and let's do see out on
03:09 - number so what's what's value going to
03:12 - be here so we see that U we incremented
03:14 - value started off eight we incremented
03:16 - it so it was nine and we output nine
03:19 - here to confirm that so now uh can can
03:22 - you guess what this what this is going
03:23 - to be well let's let's see if your guess
03:26 - is right it's actually going to be still
03:30 - nine but of course if we if we um if we
03:35 - did a prefix version here so it it has
03:38 - incremented value if if we actually
03:40 - output value
03:41 - here let's let's output value and let's
03:44 - also say value is
03:48 - now and let's say here number
03:53 - is so value is being incremented to
03:58 - 10 but um
04:00 - so here it's 10 you see but number is
04:02 - nine because it's postfix and we
04:05 - actually used it before incrementing it
04:08 - but if we if we use
04:11 - prefix then we're going to increment it
04:13 - and use it so now number and value are
04:15 - going to be the same they're going to
04:16 - end up the same both as 10 so that's
04:19 - really important to know and sometimes
04:22 - some people use prefix and Pro postfix
04:26 - in really complicated expressions and uh
04:30 - it can get really con confusing it's
04:32 - important to know about it but really um
04:36 - the majority of the time in my view
04:38 - unless you really need it it's better
04:41 - not to rely on prefix and
04:44 - postfix uh it's it's better to um to try
04:48 - to make your Expressions a bit simpler
04:49 - but people do use it in Expressions so
04:52 - it is important to know about
04:55 - it okay so that's it for this tutorial
04:58 - until next time happy chosing
