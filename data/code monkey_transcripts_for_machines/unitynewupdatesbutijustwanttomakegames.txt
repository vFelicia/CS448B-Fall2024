hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so everything is still on fire I'm trying to work on my game today but it kind of feels like everything is blowing up so I really can't focus this morning I was trying to do the same thing that I always do every day and answer just some regular questions from my tutorial videos but with so many comments on the last video it's really hard to find them there have been some updates since yesterday like for example apparently now green Styles no longer count for the totem and fraud and malicious attacks also supposedly don't count but no Clarity on how exactly they will identify those apparently Game Pass also either does not count or Microsoft won't supposedly pay for that again no Clarity on how exactly this will happen demos Charities and tests also apparently do not count so things are still constantly changing no idea what will have changed by the time that this video goes live and honestly also no idea what they can even do at this point to regain the trust that so many people have lost but I also want to clarify something myself in my last video I focus mainly on analyzing these changes through the lens of my own personal experience as a song of indidev and from that hyperspecific lens meaning none of my games won't ever make a million dollars for my particular use case my conclusion was nothing changes now because not because the fact that I was calm and not extremely angry because that some people took it as me defending these changes or something calling me a Shell or accusing me of being paid by unity it was my most disliked video by far so let me just be perfectly clear do I think these changes as a whole are net negative yes do they affect the specific way that I work no that's really it if I was UNT CEO I would not have implemented these changes but I don't work for Unity I have no power all I can do is just like you look at these changes analyze how they will impact me and the way that I work and then act accordingly the only thing that I can promise you is really that in these videos I won't always be honest and share my genuine point of view whether that's positive negative or neutral so that means if I've analyzed things and I'm calm then I'm not going to pretend to be angry just because everyone else is also angry if I told you that I was planning to quit Unity that would not be true the game that I'm currently working on is made with unity whatever game I made next will also be made with DNT the many tutorials that I'm still planning to make in the future they will also be made with DNT the engine itself is still an excellent piece of tech capable of building almost anything but like I said that is just my personal point of view I can fully understand people for whom this is their breaking point if that's you then that's fine I am not trying to change your mind unreal and Godot are both excellent engines nowadays you really can't go wrong when picking any engine the game's industry is huge there's a mountain of different ways to make games different ways to monetize and this change that they made this one is going to affect everything on developer in different ways all I can really do is just speak based on my own experience and I only have experience as a solo steam in the dev I cannot speak as to how this change will affect every single corner of the entire game industry I'm really just a random guy in my room making videos and making games just like you if this affects you negatively if you are against this change then I highly highly encourage you to make some noise Make your voice heard on the forums I know tons of unity people are reading all the feedback and passing it on to their higher ups although please don't harass the public facing Indie people they also have no power to change things directly honestly this blew up so much that I really have to believe that they won't either revert it completely or make some serious changes but at the same time like I said I'm not sure there's anything they can do to regain trust at this point for some people this was a step too far and they can never trust CNT again perhaps they could completely walk back these changes instead of just trying to clarify what exactly counts as an insult perhaps they could make a new Yola that legally guarantees they can never again change the terms after the fact basically like the title says I really just want to make games that's really it I started using Unity back in 2012 because it was the only option and I've kept using it over these past 10 years because the engine as a tool still allows me to build any game that I can imagine for me that's pretty much the only thing that counts the engine itself has no change in any way and the new pricing does not affect devs at my scale so that is why I'm calm and not super angry like most people also part of the reason why I'm not super angry or scared about the future is simply because I used to be a flash developer my livelihood was completely tied to flash then it eventually died as I found my way in TNT so perhaps that's also why I'm more calmed than most people I know that if this truly is the beginning of the end for ENT if that truly is the case then I trust my own skills to be able to survive into whatever comes next but right now all I really want to do is just make games so I'm going to edit this video and get back to working on my game while watching how all of this will unfold alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
