hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tones and assets help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for August 22. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered all the best free new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it and next video I will be covering the Tapas and effects let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them as always there's links to the US in the description and as bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now Unity is having a sale with tons of the best assets discounted and if you're a fan of realistic fantasy then check out the latest Humble Bundle features quite a lot of assets from Infinity PBR it's got some gorgeous dragons creatures and dungeons there's lots of realistic weapons and armor all in a high poly realistic Style with tons of variations the bundle also includes some courses by Jason Wyman as usual it's a super deep discount over 90 off so if you like this style go ahead and pick it up with the link in the description alright so starting off with some fun soft body physics this this is how you can have some soft squishy objects interacting with physics it works on any mesh so you can make some really nice squishy jelly or you can even apply it to a player character so this would be great for a kind of boxing game to add some nice deformation when taking a punch and you could also use the included soft body controller to make a game where the player plays as some kind of slime so this one is really interesting really nice effect and yes it is pretty cheap next up if you're unlike me and math is not your strong point then this acid looks perfect rather than trying to come up with math to calculate projectile trajectories you basically just give it a force and in launch position to see where it lands or you can give it a Target and currently the velocity needed to get there within a certain amount of time so if your game uses rigid body physics for the projectiles then this can be quite useful up next another really interesting one here is yolua I must say that Lua is one of those things that I've heard tons of great things about but never actually use it myself if you don't know Lua is a scripting language it's widely used in modifying games lots of games enable custom modding logic and you write that custom logic in Lua so this hasn't as a framework to help you write little code that easily interacts with unity game objects so if you're curious to experiment with adding modding to your game definitely go ahead and research lower then if your game has some procedural placement of some objects look at this you'll if you try placing objects similarly randomly it can produce quite strange results with some objects too close together so this tool lets you place them all in a much more natural way it works in both 2D and 3D and also has a snap to terrain feature so you just select your prefabs click a button and that's it next up if you have some complex meshes and you need some extremely accurate colliders look at this one if you've ever tried using the Bounty mesh colliders you will see that the shape is primarily focused on a lower number of polygons and not necessarily on accuracy so you end up with tons of edges that have no visual but they do have a collider this tool gives you a lot more control over exactly where the con leather shape is so you can make it perfectly match the visuals it's super easy to use they include editor and lets you paint on your objects to Define all of the con leather Parts this one is version 2 so it's an extremely well built well Polished in battle tested tool then if you want a quick way to handle lots of weapons look at this one it's a weapon projectile system it works in both 2D and 3D you can easily spawn tons of projectiles or do some raycast shooting it helps you handle collisions firing and secondary modes you can change firing speed clip sizes reload and tons more also supports burst fire with multishot and the whole thing works with object pulling so it's also extremely performed definitely an interesting asset if you want to quickly jump start your projectile creation then here's a fun one a runtime level term so it's a fully for legend level editor that runs while the game is playing it works on a voxel Channel system so you can Define whatever voxels you want and place them anywhere you can modify the Skybox modify colors fog and so on again all of it while running in runtime it even lets you bake occlusion calling so the level ends up being super performant and also supports nav mesh baking the levels are stored in a Json format making it super easy to upload to a server and share files between your players next if you want to make a card game and you need a controller here's a fun one it's very easy to use you can get it up and running in a few minutes if you've never tried making a card game then believe me this is extremely useful building all the driving physics for yourself is a ton of work there's tons of fields and curves you can play around with to get the exact physics Behavior you want for the car and there's also a demo you can try out for free then here's a really awesome one that I'm thinking of getting myself it's called asset inventory if you're like me and you buy tons of assets it can be tricky to know what you have in all of those packs so this one is a really awesome way to search through all of those packs to find exactly what you're looking for it features super fast searching lots of previews so you can see exactly what you're looking for and the main thing is you don't have to import them into your project so you don't end up with tons of clutter in your project just to try to find a specific asset you can even add custom sources so that's also super useful for me since I own lots of facts from Humble bundles at the centy store so it's really awesome and it's pretty cheap so I'll definitely pick this up for myself up next if your game has skin mesh renderers and you want some extremely accurate breakouts look at this one usually you use a simplified capsule highlighter when trying to handle collisions with characters that works for most cases but if your game requires some extreme Precision then a simple and capsicle Ladder will not work so that's where this asset comes in this one is a compute Shader so it's extremely efficient this would be perfect for some super accurate bullets or maybe some punches or just find the exact edge of the character to place some armor or some object alright so those are my top 10 new tones and systems on the MTS store for August 22. there's links to all the description and this bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and if you're a fan of realistic fantasy then check out the latest Humble Bundle also check out my own free Internet on store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to
