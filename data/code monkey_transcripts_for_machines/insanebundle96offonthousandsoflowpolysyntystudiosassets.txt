hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here's a very pleasant surprise that i totally wasn't expecting an extremely excellent bundle all about cinti assets they are in their low poly signature style and being a humble bundle means that as an insane discount you can get them at 96 off so this bundle to me is a nobrainer as you may know i'm a big fan of the lowpoly style they already have quite a lot of cindy packs and yet i didn't have many of these so i picked that up right away there's a massive amount of variety here you have tons of characters some zombies some city characters fantasy and more then you have several massive packs which also have many more characters you've got an off spec i've been looking at this one for a while looks perfect for many kind of tycoon games then the scifi pack just this one is worth over a hundred dollars by itself it has over 600 assets then the town pack really nice and cozy the farm pack would be perfect for any kind of farming simulator game or maybe something like stardew valley the pirate pack has lots of pirates and some gorgeous ships the prototype pack this one is great with lots of variety i'm actually using this one for an upcoming mini game then you have the spy kit with a gorgeous car and lots of gadgets and the polygon explorer perfect for any kind of indiana jones inspired game so as you can see it's a massive bundle with thousands of objects thousands of prefabs for an insanely cheap price so it's worth it for just a single one of these so unless you absolutely hate this style or you already have all of these then i would highly recommend you pick this up the amount of unique game genres you can build from this bundle is just insane also i recently made a video on games using assets where i found some games on steam that were very clearly using assets and specifically cinti assets and i checked out their player reviews and looking at those no one cares that the game uses assets all the players want all they care about is that the game is good so if you're the kind of person who refuses to buy assets because you're afraid the players will call you lazy or a cheater or something like that if that's how you think then go check out that video and see how all that matters is really if the game is good so yeah for me this was a very pleasant surprise i definitely got it right away i'm thinking an interesting video would be to make some mini games with these packs so let me know if you'd like to see something like that and of course the link in the description is also an affiliate link so if you pick it up through there you get some awesome assets for all of your projects and i get a nice commission so thanks for watching i really hope you like these assets and you put them to good use and i'll see you next time
