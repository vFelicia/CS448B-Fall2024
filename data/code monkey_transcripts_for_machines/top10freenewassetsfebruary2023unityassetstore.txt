hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for February 23. in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and the next ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them speaking of free is something that I'm guessing all of you are already familiar with I recently launched my 10 hour free course I'm really happy with the resultant reception has been literally 100 positive I don't think I saw a single negative comment and the plan of asking you to like the video to make it go viral on the YouTube algorithm that plan worked right now the video has 200k views which is 10 times more than normal amount so thank you all so much I truly hope the course has helped you on your own Game Dev journey and a special thank you to the people that did buy the complete optional paid course or did a super thanks or became a channel member thanks to you I did manage to break even on the money that I spent on the assets so thank you also for you right now the SSR is giving away an asset apparently it's a new one every week so you just go into the link and use the coupon crosstalk fails to get a camelli for free there's also a sale on new and training assets so if there's something you saw recently in one of these asset list videos it might be discounted alright so on to the top 10 list starting off with a nice pack with a bunch of low poly Furniture every time I see one of these packs it gets me inspired to make my own game like The Sims or you can just use it to make a house for whatever game you're working on it's a really nice low poly Style with a whole bunch of objects then for a nice effect here is some electricity VFX there's over 30 effects really nice amount for a free pack all of them look really good so these could be used for some hazards in your game or maybe some magic effects next here is a nice tune it's for helping you build documents it looks extremely detailed I'm surprised that this is free you can write just about anything so you can ask documents within other documents you can include text image code whatever you want whatever you need to make your documentation very easy to read there are lots of documentation tools but if you want one directly inside Unity then this free one looks great up next here we have some really nice shotguns they are very low poly with some pixelated textures I quite like how they look they don't look perfect for any kind of retro inspired FPS it features 5 models their own shotguns but still have some nice variety then here's an interesting one it's a python interpreter that works directly in your game definitely a very Niche tool but if you have some kind of python library that you'd like to use in your game then this would be great you can even combine both Python and csharp in the same script next here we have a nice prototype low poly pack it's always handy to have one of these packs it has quite a lot of unique elements to help you prototype tons of game types so you could make a first person shooter a card game a plane game maybe a 3D platformer or a topdown shooter you have tons and tons of options then here is a nice zone for setting up RPG attributes so you can Define things like health strength decks and so on and then it features a nice tool set where you can easily add modifiers it seems very well made using a proper interface and some generics so if you have a game idea with lots of attributes and this can definitely help guide you in the right direction next here we have three unique characters they have a very nice very casual style if you have some text in your game and it's something where you don't have any models then and something like this would be great for example a game with an overhead camera where you drive around a large city maybe these could be your NPCs up next here is a visual editor for lean twin lean twin is a twinning package which can be really useful but I believe it's all code base which can be a bit tricky to use so this one works on top of that to make it really easy to use with some custom inspectors it looks really nice with quite a lot of options and then if you need a bunch of textures here's a nice free pack it features 20 realistic textures they are only in 4k with 6 maps to protection so this really is a very high quality pack and if you like this style then this tab has tons more packs alright so those are my top 10 free newests on the NTS store for February 23 there's only some in the description also check out my own free internet apps on the store alright hope that's useful and check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
