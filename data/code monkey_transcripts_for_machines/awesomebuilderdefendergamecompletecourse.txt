hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this course you will learn how to create a builder defender game the design is a really interesting mix between a city builder and a tower defense game so if either of those genres are something you're interested in then this course is just for you with the knowledge you will learn from this course you will be able to make city builders rts's tower defense games tycoons village simulators and much much more even if you are not interested in these particular genres the course will still teach you a ton regarding how to structure a game from start to finish how to use cryptomol objects managers animations effects and so on about me i'm a professional indie game developer with several successful games published on steam covering a wide range of genres i've been programming for over 20 years and using unity for almost 10. also a couple of years ago i started a youtube channel making free tutorial videos to share my knowledge to help you learn how to make your own games if you'd like to try out my learning style before purchasing the course you can watch the over 300 videos available for free on the youtube channel they are presented as clear stepbystep tutorials just like this course now a bit more about the game like i mentioned the game is a really interesting mix between a city builder and a tower defense game so the player has the ability to place buildings and those buildings gather resources there's three starting resource types wood stone and gold although everything is set up in such a way that you can easily add more resource types the resource generation is based on proximity so a wood harvester needs to be placed near trees in order to gather wood the buildings take some time to be constructed and it shows the progress with a nice visual element and a really awesome shader then we have some enemies they are simple but don't look great our hq can defend itself by shooting arrows we can place more towers to add more defenses over time more and more enemies won't be spawned until the player can't take it anymore so it's all about placing buildings gathering resources in order to place more buildings and defending your hq for as long as you can then the whole game has tons of effects and lots of awesome features you can see some cool shaders some glow screen shade post processing a tone tip lots of ui elements smooth camera particles and so on so the final game plays really great and it feels really satisfying the song of course starts with a completely empty project starting completely from scratch and step by step we'll get to this point every single thing in this game is made inside of this course so there's no hidden code anywhere everything is made while on screen also everything is built in a very clean and modular way so you can easily take this as a base and expand upon it with more building types enemies maps resources and so on this course is presented as a thorough stepbystep guide where i will show you exactly how to do what i'm doing and why it is that i'm doing it so you can learn to think like a professional game developer this course will cover a bunch of topics including how to create a building system hand on building construction and resource management handle enemy ai with attack logic and a health system along with projectiles build up the world with resources in specific places and polish it all up with tons of effects particles sound and so on also learn the basics of unity tools like shadowgraph post processing scene machine and much much more as for requirements you really just need to know the absolute basics of unity and csharp so if you know how unity works what are game objects and components what is monobehaviour and the basic csharp syntax like variables and functions then you should be able to follow everything without any issues if you feel confused or unless at any point in the course then make sure you post your questions in the q a section i will be there to help with whatever issues you may have also every single lecture also contains the starting project files as resources so if you missed one lecture or want to get a refresher on a particular lesson then you can go there and download the resources and follow it from there alright so go ahead join me on the course and let's build this awesome game together
