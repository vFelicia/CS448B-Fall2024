hello and welcome i'm your code monkey so i make a ton of videos on a lot of topics i'm always trying to give you some good information so you can become better at making your own games and making your dreams a reality that's my goal with pretty much every video that i make now one simple question did you see my recent videos unlike the inventory tetris or the cleaning minigame or the house building system chances are there are some videos that would be very useful to you but the youtube algorithm simply didn't recommend them so you missed out on those videos which means you missed out on some knowledge that could help you make your games even better or give you some ideas for your next project now just in case you're not familiar with how the youtube algorithm works essentially the more videos of a channel that you watch the more they get recommended to you so if you click on every single video of a channel then youtube won't keep recommending it but at the same time if you don't watch one or two videos then youtube might stop recommending that channel altogether regardless if you're a subscriber or not now in this channel i try very hard to cover on lots of topics to keep the channel interesting so i do tons of video topics in different formats and i assume that some people are more interested in one topic and others prefer a different one so i don't expect everyone to be interested in every single video that i put out so let's say for example you're someone who really likes watching the tutorial videos but you're not really that interested in the monthly game releases or the asset review videos if that's the case then because you didn't watch some videos then youtube is less likely to recommend the next tutorial video that i put out which means again you might miss out on some knowledge that could help you greatly in making your next game so that's the problem and in order to try to solve that problem i've made a simple update to the website you can log in and go to your account settings and manage email notifications the goal with this is essentially to put the power in your hands so rather than relying on youtube making the decisions for you and only showing you some videos and not showing others you can instead make sure you're always notified and then you can decide if you want to watch each video or not you can set it up to receive the normal monthly newsletter where i highlight some of the videos for that month as well as any new announcements and news or you can receive one email each week with that week's videos or get an email when each video goes live you can get notified of new announcements like new courses new games or assets and specifically on the live streams this might be very useful since so many people seem to miss them or if you just want to make sure you never miss anything just select them all and then you decide so like i said the goal with this is to put the power in your hands i really put in a ton of work into making lots of videos to help you on your game development journey and it sucks that sometimes i might make a video that could very well be perfect just for you but if youtube doesn't recommend it then you might never see it so hopefully with this simple update those kinds of issues won't happen again and you get to decide what videos you want to watch instead of having youtube decide for you alright hope that helps check out the website to set your preferences stay tuned for lots of exciting new videos thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
