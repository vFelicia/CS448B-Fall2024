here's a quick empty tip one very important concept in writing clean code is to never use magic numbers magic numbers are numbers which are used without being clear what they're doing so over here i have some code changing the position and then doing a distance check so i'm changing the position by 20 and testing for the distance by 5. this is some simple code so you might be able to figure out what it means but still it should be clear what the code is doing the 20 in here means the movement speed that's why it's changing the position and multiplying by the direction and the 5 here what it means is the attack distance so if the distance to the target is less than 5 units then he will attack we can make this code much more readable by simply defining variables for these numbers so we simple foiled for the attack distance and a float for the move speed if any of these numbers are used elsewhere then we should define them as either class variables or as constants with this simple change now it's much more clear that we're moving the unit and then testing if the target is within the attack distance always remember to keep your code clean by defining clear variables instead of using magic numbers subscribe for more tips
