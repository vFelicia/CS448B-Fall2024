hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights that were released in july of 2021. just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all the kind of games that i could build this one is the only set of paid assets and effects i've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and the best tools and systems go watch those if you haven't seen them yet let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the assets in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order also the latest unity megabundle is ending very soon this is a massive discount at 95 off so if just one asset looks interesting then home bundle is worth it i picked it up myself primarily for the awesome spell effects and the interesting cable simulator like i said it ends very soon so check it out quickly and by the way check out my own assets on the store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your game and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create some custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out alright so starting off with a really awesome animation pack the great dual blade anime set the animations by this developer are always awesome very stylish very punchy this one is all about having a character with dual wielding blades you've got attacks combos rolls defense and so on i really love just how stylish they are i'd love to use this one in some future melee action videos then a pretty interesting pack low poly industrial there's tons of low poly assets but most of them are normal cities or fantasy so this one is pretty nice and unique lots of industry related objects you've got a bunch of factories reactors containers and giant cargo ships this would be great for making some sort of simpsonlike game next up a really good looking scifi pack called cyberpunk under siege it features tons of modular pieces for you to build your own cyberpunk environments the pack includes the assets and also the turret with the particle bullets shown in the video really great looking realistic visuals then if you want just a single asset but super high quality here is a 4k pistol it's a very highly detailed model includes ammunition with the cartridge and channel and also it's fully rigged so it comes with 15 animations this highend model would be pretty great on just about any first person game then for something quite unique here is a ocean environment pack you've got a bunch of rocks and some seaweed a bunch of creatures some sharks jellyfish and other fish types it also has a spline system for easily animating all the creatures i can see this being super useful if you want to build a game sort of like subnautica next up for some materials here is a great pack they are stylized and look really great tons and tons of variety in six themes you've got ice forest desert lava water and jungle use these to populate your world with some gorgeous textures then we've got a new polygon pack this one is all about shops it's their usual signature style really good looking low poly assets features fully modular buildings tons of food items and props since it's modular you could use this in combination with my house building system and let the player build their own shops contains 14 characters with tons of attachments and also a bunch of environment objects like roads sidewalks and so on so you can definitely build an entire mini town with a shopping center with this pack i can see this one being awesome for building some sort of multikun game then a whole bunch of character effects here is the character shader pack 2. tons of effects and all of them are pretty great so you've got cartoon hologram petrify shake glass and tons more you can also modify the attributes exposing the shader in order to further customize them if you want just a single effect you can grab it individually but with this pack you get all of them with a nice discount up next some really awesome samurai animations if you've been playing ghost of sushime and you'd like to make a prototype sort of like it then this pack is great lots of great animations both using a katana as well as a short bow in total over 500 animations they are very high quality very punchy animations just add some sound effects and some particles and it wouldn't look excellent and of course they are all humanoid animations so they work with any character if you want a hyper realistic modern military character here's a great one it's modular so by mixing and matching you can get near infinite possibilities lots of equipment male and female bodies tons of props radios vests and a bunch of firearms if this style fits with your game then this is pretty much the only character pack you need if you're looking for some particle effects here is a great pack the black mage spells it's all about spells so perfect for any sort of fantasy game great looking particles some very creative smells includes 10 unique effects along with icons as well as some sound effects for something quite unique here is an antique city pack this one is great if you're working on something like a gladiatorial management game or maybe a city builder set in ancient times and the assets are also pretty detailed so maybe you could also use this in first or third person then here's a super cool highend robot with a strange name i really like the design on this one perfect if you're making some sort of futuristic dystopian game you get the robot along with a really cool futuristic weapons as well as a whole bunch of animations you've got wonking running shooting or death so you can use this and make it as an enemy or make this your player character do you want to build a farming game well here's a really nice modular farm tons of pieces for you to use and make an infinite variation of buildings again this is a great pack to use with my house building system lots of pieces you can use you can build houses huts barns mentions or just about anything it's got a pretty nice realistic visual with some very high quality textures then something nice and jolly here is kyutsu features 15 animals in a really cute art style very unique animal so you've got a lizard bison anteater red panda if you like this art style then this developer also has more packs with even more animals maybe you're working on a flying game here's a futuristic scifi fighter pack it's one realistic plane with lots of variation i quite like the design on this one looks futuristic but not too surreal i've never actually done any videos on flying game mechanics so looking at this one makes me want to research that topic or maybe you want to build some normal houses here is a realistic house pack features both interior and exterior almost 200 unique models really high quality and correctly scaled to make sure that it's all accurate great if you're making a game sort of like house flipper or maybe someone like the sims then for something a bit more toony here is a suburban pack premassive pack over 800 prefabs also includes 70 premade buildings and interiors and it even includes vehicles with fully working interiors and doors it's a really massive pack so if you like this art style it's a great choice or maybe go back into the 80s with these super stylized sky boxes includes 15 preset sky boxes all of them great looking very unique but you can also customize it and build your own define your own sun shape and watch it over the horizon if your game is all about neon then this one is a nobrainer or maybe for something more calming here is a countryside open world it's a very large countryside scene really great to just drag and drop and start building your prototype on this preset map or just use only prefabs and build your own scene
