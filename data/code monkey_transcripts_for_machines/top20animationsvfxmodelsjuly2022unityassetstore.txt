hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the as the source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for july of 22. even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them and see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all the kind of games that i could build this one is a list of paid assets and effects i've already made two videos covering the best free new ads and the best knowns and systems as always there's links to the apps in the description and as bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order now you might have noticed that i didn't do one of these videos last month the reason for that is because i was super busy working on my turn based strategy course which is finally done after five months of work if you want to take your game dev skills from beginner to advanced and check out the course and by the way check out my own asks on the store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your game the mouse cursor system pro which is a really easy to use tool to help you create custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out and the free health system which easily lets you add help to any object in your games also quick mention right now the unity ssr is having a sale there's tons of visuals and tools including almost everything i covered in my asset review series there's even a bonus coupon with up to 15 bonus discount and i'm recording this a few days before but the centi store might also still be on sale so if you like their style and you need some visual assets check it out alright so starting off with a really awesome animation pack this one is all about gun fu or gun kata it's very much inspired by john wick there was also a recent game called john wick hex i still haven't played it but it looks super cool with this animation pack you can definitely make something just like that and some of these animations also seem to be very much inspired from equilibrium which is one of my favorite movies so i'm definitely a fan of this one i wish i had the time to make a quick prototype using this pack then here's some awesome stylized vfx it's got tons of effects about 40 of them and all of them with multiple elemental variations like you've got fire electric ice dark and many more really a great way to easily add tons of polish to your games next up here's an interesting one it's a realtime global illumination volume now i'm not entirely sure what this is doing but it looks like it supports mass amounts of lights and making the scene look really natural this works on top of the regular lighting and it works in urp then if you want to build some houses here's a modular house pack it's got tons of parts for you to build an endless amount of houses all of them different from one another there's over 300 prefabs modular parts for both the exterior and the interior and if you just need a really good looking suburbs then check out the included demo if the previous asset is too pretty then here's a postapocalyptic pack this one features lots of debris everywhere lots of destroyed buildings and various houses you can see broken concrete everywhere some rust utility boxes so this one would be pretty great for a kind of realistic apocalypse game then if you want some super high quality super high resolution soldiers check out this one really insanely detailed with a massive amount of modular pieces you can easily customize the camouflage in the patches you can attach all kinds of objects to the helmet so things like night vision radio face shield and many more it also includes the original photoshop and blender files so you can customize them even further to get exactly what you want if you're making a realistic military game then this one is really all you need for all your characters next up here is the latest cinti studios pack this one is called ancient empire it features their gorgeous low poly style that i'm sure you know i love this one is all about some kind of roman greek style which is something that i especially adore so this would be a really perfect asset pack for making some kind of gladiator game maybe something with spartans or perhaps a roman city builder or maybe something in the vein of assassin's creed features a ton of assets over 700 detailed prefabs all in their gorgeous lowpoly style then if you're working on a zombie game and you need some animations check out this one all of them are motion captured so really high quality you've got tons of variations for wonking dying crawling and many more features 4 unique animations on pretty much all poses up next an interesting effects pack this one is all about animating titles so this could be perfect to apply for example for your studio name or perhaps to add a bit of polish when the player enters a new area or perhaps when the npc character is introduced and their name is shown so tons of effects super easy to add to make your title text really shine then for a nice minimalist pack here's 37 hyper casual characters i think i covered the first volume of this one in a previous video i really like the concept of having really unique body types and using that combined with some basic colors to separate all of your players and npcs this could definitely fit perfectly with any kind of minimalist game or perhaps you're looking for some kind of weird geometry shaders look at this one just in case you don't know geometry shaders are shaders that modify the actual mesh so the vertices on the object they can look really interesting when applied to a high poly mesh just like this one it works on urp and this creates some really interesting results if you're making a dinosaur game check out this one it's a super high resolution dinosaur now i'm not too familiar with dinosaurs so not sure if this one is based on a real animal or something original either way it looks pretty massive and intimidating includes the high quality mesh with textures along with 20 animations then here are some 3d signs this could be great for pointing the player in the right direction or perhaps you can use them in some kind of 3d menu it includes various 3d icons and also a bunch of 3d letters and numbers then as usual every month there's always some gorgeous car models here's a nice lamborghini inspired one definitely a mishmash of models kind of looks like an aventador mixed with a diablo it includes the model exterior as well as the interior and works very well with many car controls if instead of a car you just want the engine check out this one it's a 4 cylinder engine all of the pieces are muddled so you can easily take them apart i could see this one as an excellent asset for making some kind of car mechanic simulator game if you need some stylized characters kind of like fortnite check out this one it's a female character with a pretty nice model you've got massive 4k textures it's a high quality model super easy to use next up here's some really smooth 2d splash animations these are sprite animations they are really smooth perfect for any kind of 2d game if you're looking for some pixel art check out this one it's got a bunch of really unique sidescrolling enemies they are all extremely different includes 8 enemies all with various animations then if you'd like to make some kind of rts game here's a perfect pack it includes a ton of characters with different variations for different factions you have some regular soldiers some weird robots and even some tanks and then if your game involves some buffs or debuffs check out this one in total you have 12 auras some really high quality effects all of them look pretty interesting so they can represent whatever you want alright so those are my top 20 new assets on the unity store for july of 22. there's links to on the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get
