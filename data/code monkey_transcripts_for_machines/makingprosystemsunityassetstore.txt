hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and over the years i've made over 400 videos covering all kinds of systems the videos are usually just simple demos to showcase how something works and nothing else the goal is to educate you and not necessarily to build a productionready system but i would like to expand upon some of these systems and make them into proper easy to use packages that you can easily drag and drop into your games without much effort so for that i've decided to try making pro versions of some of those assets the goal is to expand upon them and make some proper versions that are feature complete and super easy to use and of course since my whole channel is about teaching these assets will also contain a very detailed video going through all the code step by step so you can learn how it all works which kind of means that each asset will in itself be a sort of mini course one system that i covered in a free video a while ago was the mouse cursor system so the very first pro asset that is out right now is the mouse cursor system pro this is a fully featured system for adding custom animated cursors onto your games nowadays in order for your games to find success you absolutely need to stand out from the crowd and adding some custom animated cursors is an easy way to add that extra bit of polish to make your game really shine it comes with a custom editor that makes it super simple to use you just draw a texture in any program you want then create a new cursor object and drag the texture onto it use the editor to set up everything like all of your frames the frame rate and set the clickable position and that's it it all works perfectly included with the acid are 24 premade cursors you can easily apply to your games and again it also comes with a very detailed walkthrough video going through all the code step by step so you can learn how it all works so if you just want to use it it's super simple and easy to add to your games and if you want to dig deep and learn how it all works then you can do that too as i mentioned i covered the basis for this system in a free video before so if you want you can put in the work and try to build yourself or you can just pick up the pro version which will save you a ton of time and give you a very easy to use feature complete system along with a detailed walkthrough video which works as a mini course there's a link in the description to pick it up and you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order i'm really excited about this idea there's quite a bunch of systems that i covered on the channel that i'd love to expand upon and turn them into proper assets so let me know in the comments which ones you'd like to see so perhaps the grid system or maybe the crafting system or some mml agents examples or maybe a factory game template let me know what you'd like to see alright thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
