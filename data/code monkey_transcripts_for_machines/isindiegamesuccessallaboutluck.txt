hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and a while ago I saw this post on Twitter talking about the realities of game development and what success is all about it got a lot of attention on Twitter and then also on Reddit This Thread has lots of useful info and some numbers on this one specific game which is very much representative of the general results of a lot of Indie Games however it also has a bunch of statements about the Indie Dev industry that are not accurate so I want to give you my point of view the particular statement that I really disagree with is that it's all about luck and as a Dev you have almost no control as if the game is just a lottery ticket now I really don't want this video to come off as any kind of attack on this Dev I know how much it sucks to have a flop I've had a bunch of those myself so I fully understand that this Dev isn't really in a good state of mind to think too rationally it really sucks when you spend years on something and you get zero results so if the dev is watching this please don't take my comments too harshly I'm just using this game and these tweets as an example to talk about some topics that a lot of people think about I will first discuss the indie game Market in general and then more specifically on why I think this particular game didn't sell as well as the dev wouldn't like by the way way this video is a new format I'm trying out where I give you my thoughts on some topic I have a different perspective from a lot of people since I've been doing Game Dev for over 10 years now with many published games so I think hearing my point of view on some more General topics can be available to some of you there's lots of things that are very important with regards to Game Dev other than just technical tutorials so let me know in the comments and like this video if you enjoy this kind of just talking format so to start with the thread actually has some actual sales numbers for the game for about 5 months these are indeed pretty much numbers that I would expect for something like let's call it someone's second game for a first game you would probably only sell a dozen copies and for a second game maybe a couple hundred and most indie game devs don't make more than one or two games so the Empire would say these numbers are absolutely an accurate representation of the great majority of Indie Games then some stats on emailing press streamers and content creators they sent out over 2 000 Sim keys and about 10 of them created some content this I would say is actually higher than expected but it all depends on who those 2000 press people are if you email some smaller channels people that get something like 100 views per video you might need to get more content created since those people will likely be very appreciative of getting a steam king but with Sophie views it is unlikely to lead to any sales then a bunch more sets on the state of the indie game Market over half of the games make essentially nothing there's only about 15 to 20 of games making over 50k after that is the charge showing the number of releases every year there are more and more games coming out not to mention that all of the other games that already exist they still continue existing meaning if you launch a game this year you are still sort of competing with something like Terraria that came out a decade ago so there's lots of stats in this thread and they are indeed accurate and they do paint a pretty tough picture this Dev also makes an excellent point that perfectly encapsulates why I would never tell someone to quit their job and gamble everything on their first game would you accept a job if they said you would only get paid after several years of work and with no guarantees of how much that will be and there's still a huge chance it won't be much less than minimum wage this is indeed the reality so definitely don't quit your day job expecting to make the next stardew Valley I will definitely not lie to you and tell you that all of this is wrong and finding success as an indepth is super easy it's definitely not it's really difficult but with that said the opposite of that that it's all about luck and nothing else is also not true that's pretty much a conclusion that this Dev reached after I'm looking at their stats they say that the idea of a meritocracy is a complete illusion and people should stop pretending that luck isn't a gigantic Factor this is where I would definitely disagree with it I would actually say that the Indie Dev Market is pretty much as close to a meritocracy as it can be however there's one huge asterisk when I say that people listen that and they think okay so that means I just have to make a good game and that's it and no that is not what I'm saying at all making a good game is only a tiny tiny portion of what is required to find success nowadays meritocracy means you need a good game coupled with good marketing you can't just focus on making the game and completely ignore marketing and expect to find success that will not work nowadays if you do then yes that strategy is indeed completely depend on luck I've made a video while ago all about marketing and I titled it the most important skill to be a successful game upper that is not an exaggeration that really is the reality also the concept of a meritocracy is depend on the quality of the final product meaning it has absolutely nothing to do with how much effort you put into it there are some excellent games that are indeed excellent that were made in just a weekend and there are some really poor games that were made in years this is one fallacy that a lot of Indie devs fall into how much effort you put into the game does not matter when it comes to finding success with players the players only care if the game is good they don't care how long it took to make it might sound harsh but that is the truth you can sacrifice years of your life building something whereas someone else can build something in a weekend and the players might prefer the other game that's really just how it is if you're regular on this channel then you've certainly heard me talk nonsouth about the importance of wishlist speaking of that go ahead and wishlist my own Sim game Total War Liberation we can look at cmdb to guess how many wishlists this game had at lunch we can look at the chart and we can see that just before release the game had about 90 followers the general rule of thumb is that wish lists are 10 times followers so this means that the game had probably under a thousand wishlists at launch if you show me a game that has a thousand wishlists my guess would indeed be exactly the results that this game got a couple dozen or a couple hundred copies wishing lists are an excellent predictor of sales that is why everyone myself included asks you to wishlist their game nowadays if you want to find success you need to launch with a bare minimum of at least like 5 000 wishlists anything less than that and you're unlikely to be better that launch when the game releases one of their main tweets is also very much a false premise talking about the handful of positive reviews that the game has and using that as a way to state that the game is objectively good the only thing that this means is that those handful of reviewers did enjoy the game that's it it does not mean that the game is objectively good you can't really make a statistically valid conclusion on just a dozen reviews now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that the game is banned I'm mainly saying that looking at a headphone reviews does not prove the game is objectively good and somehow based on that it should have sown much better so my advice to you as a developer is don't download yourself into thinking your game is objectively a masterpiece just because a handful of people liked it another extremely important concept is what does success really mean this word means different things to different people in the thread this developer talks about vampire survivors and stray as examples of success let me point out that these are not examples of success instead these are examples of Mega massive Monumental success I really take issue with this kind of mentality because it completely ignores the huge spectrum between those two extremes there is a ton of space between games that make five thousand dollars and games that make a hundred million you don't need 100 million to consider that success personally I consider myself a successful indie game developer I've made eight games I've been making a living from my games for over 10 years now and of course none of my games have made a hundred million so yes you can definitely count Mega hits on one hand but the games that make say between 50 and 100K there are plenty of those those are not just 0.16 of new games I actually made a blog post a really long time ago titled sustainable living as an indie bottom feeder I made that blog post just before launching my game hypernites which was certainly not a mega hit like vampire survivors and actually did worse than I expected but since my costs are very low it was still very much enough for me to make a living basically what I'm trying to say is that success is relative for some people like me living in Portugal making 1K a month is considered a success but someone living in San Francisco they might need 10K a month just to survive but regardless of your definition of success no one needs 100ml to survive there's a huge spectrum between selling zero copies and the massive Mega hits speaking specifically about this one game and analyzing what might have caused it to some importantly first of all like I already said wishlist under 8 000 wishlist is not a good amount I'm sure if the dev is listening they might be shouting at their screen saying I was too busy working on the game to handle marketing and yep I do get that it's really difficult but that is the reality of the market you can't just make the game you also have to Market it then on the game itself visuals are extremely important if you have subpar visuals you need something truly magical to stand out the amount of games that have found success with some poor Visions can be cutting on one hand so things like undertale it needs to be that kind of special to make it for me I have my regular seam new release videos where I go through the new release list and pick 10 interesting games if I I had seen this game and maybe I didn't I probably wouldn't look at it for more than 3 seconds I'm sorry if that sounds harsh but that is a reality nowadays you need good Visions you need to send out the game itself also doesn't really seem to have any unique hook it looks like yet another turnbased RPG with really nothing special to make it send out the title is somewhat intriguing it's called video game fables but the description just has a generic turnbased RPG so any couple all of those things with a very high premium price point of 20 dollars you really end up in a place where it's really tricky for someone to buy maybe the gameplay is really excellent but with these visuals with no immediate apparent unique hook and with a high price point very few people won't take the ammo and actually buy it when there are so many other games at this price point or lower so to give a clear answer to the question in the title is in the Game Dev all about luck I would say absolutely not but that also does not mean that success is easy it most definitely is not it is very hard but if you have a good unique hook if you have good presentation if you Market your game before launch and gather over 10 000 wish lists and of course if the the game is good regardless of how long it took to make with all of those conditions yes I believe success is very much possible very much within your control as much as it can be some amount of luck is always a factor but if you work hard and you work smart then I believe that luck is only a small portion of the final equation as an example I'm currently working on my next steam game total worm Liberation I talked about my hopes and goals in the announcement video I'm not relying on luck to achieve any of those I thought long and hard to come up with what I think is a pretty good unique hook I focus hard on the visuals to make them the best they can be considering I'm not an artist I'm obviously marketing the game over here on this channel on my Twitter on my other games and everywhere I can and of course I'm working hard on actually developing the game to make it the best game that I can make and like I mentioned success is relative if you look at my goals you won't see that none of my definitions of success are based on selling a million copies finally just one message to the dev this game in case they're watching they mentioned that they've only suffered from depression and anxiety and obviously this is not a helpful result my advice to that is remember that Game Dev is a marathon it is not a Sprint so don't put your entire life worth on a single game for me I've been working as an indie Dev for over 10 years now and all that time I've had a bunch of success and also a bunch of Fallout the followups do hurt they are indeed very painful but remember it's just one game of the many that you won't hopefully create for example I was really crushed when my game survived Squad gauntlets flop really hard I love that game I still do nowadays I think it's really interesting I worked on it for over a year and on launch I don't think it even sold 100 copies that definitely got me down for quite a while it was very painful but after that I made gamecorp DX which ended up being one of my most successful games ever so remember it's a marathon it's not a Sprint if a project goes bad take some time off then study what went wrong figure it out and use that to make the next one better if you do then I am certain you won't find a success that you're after in the long run
