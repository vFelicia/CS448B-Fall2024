hello and welcome i'm your code monkey so last month i launched the complete visual scripting course which involves the making of two awesome games without writing any code and now for the past few weeks i've been working really hard on this one it's an fps which will be added as a completely free update to the course it's an interesting design with all the things that you would expect from an fps there's multiple weapons with a simple pistol a shotgun that fires multiple pellets and a rocket launcher with area of effect damage there's a zoom ability and a shield deflector there's also a really nice hook shot where the player aims towards the wall and gets pawn towards it there's two enemy types as well as a really cool embossed battle there's coins health pickups weapon pickups doors keys and tons more and just like the other games on the course all of this is built using only visual scripting so there's no code used anywhere everything is made using the official unity visual scripting tool and the course starts completely from scratch and goes through the making of several games step by step all of the project files and assets are included and i'm always available for answering questions in the q a section so like i said i've been working really hard on this one for the past few weeks and i'm almost done this one should be out by next week i'm really pleased with the final result and i'm really happy that i made the decision to work on this game as a future free update rather than trying to get it all done by the initial release making that decision gave me the time to do it on properly so the platformer and action rpg games are both great and then this fps also turned out great packed with tons of features so if you're interested in learning how to make games using visual scripting go check out the course the game builds upon the knowledge gained while making the other two games so go ahead pick up the course and go through those two in order to be ready for when this update goes live also just a quick mention the unity new year sale is almost over and in a few days check out the video where i covered some highlights and if you'd like pick up some assets to then using the fps game the going with my courses is always for you to learn how to make games and make them your own by using whatever assets you want so you can pick up some assets then use them when following the course alright so stay tuned for the fps free update coming out next week thanks for watching and i'll see you next time
