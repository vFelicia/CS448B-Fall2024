hello and welcome I'm your K monkey and here it is all the advanced lectures in my complete C course around right now I just published the last 22 Advanced lectures this cover topics like ASN programming unsafe code nulls multithreading and a bunch more so this update makes the course fully complete it starts from the absolute Basics like teaching how exactly does code run line by line and what is a variable then teach you some more intermediate topics things like events and interfaces and I'll finally the advaned section this one teaching lots of very interesting C features that you might not know about in total in the complete course there are 97 lectures 587 frequently asked questions 567 quizzes and 177 interactive exercise this really is very complete I put my 10 years of C knowledge in this one course so if you know absolutely nothing about C and you go through this course and if you do it by taking it slowly bit by bit making sure you understand everything along the way if you do all of that and by the end you will have gained an awesome skill set now personally I love C it's a really great language I really love the syntax and it can be used for just about anything you can make games you can make console apps websites you can do things in AI iot Robotics and really anything so I definitely believe you should learn the language and you should learn everything the language can do and also like I mentioned in the very beginning when I first announced this course my goal for this was to have fre versions over here on YouTube but actually before that let's just see a quick overview of the advanced lectures we're going to start off with an interesting Advanced topic that I actually only started seriously using just recently it's reflection I had to learn this myself in order to make the exercis for the companion project reflection is how you can dynamically inspect your code and work with it without directly calling any function functions or reading any Fields next is going to be a simple but interesting one it's how you can make some function extensions this allows you to extend a type with more functions without having to modify that type itself this is really useful when you don't have access to the type itself when you don't have source code access then we're going to learn about static Constructors these are kind of like the normal Constructor but they run just once for the entire class after that we're going to learn about the type of keyword this lets us get a system. type object of any type that we have this is very important to use alongside reflection then in lecture on name of this one helps you get a string name for some kind of type this is really useful to help you avoid strings in your code next is the size of operator this one lets you get the size of your types like for example you can see how an INT is four bytes a short is two bytes and a BTE is just a single BTE so this helps you know how much memory your code will use then in lecture on default simple and very useful way to get the default value of some type if you do default of an INT you get zero if you do the default of a ball you get false if you do the default of some object you get null and so on so using this keyword is much better than hardcoding some default values after that we're going to have a lecture on expression bodied members this is a really interesting very compact way to write simple short functions there's no need to write all the usual function boilerplate code this one is basically just a Lambda after that we're going to see a lecture on records this is a super simple way to create immutable types to organize your data next we're going to learn about the null conditional operators this is how you can easily test for null before doing something like for example before firing off an event then a lecture on the null coing operator this one lets you quickly test against null and if it is null return the default value after that we're going to learn about the tary conditional operator this is an excellent super compact Syntax for making a very simple if you have the condition with an if and an L so it's all very tiny very useful next we're going to learn about the main function in a console app and how to pass in some command line arguments this is a really important one because there are many interesting programs that you can build that don't need any kind of UI so a simple console app that you can control with some command line arguments that one is always going to be an excellent option then in lecture on nullable this is how you can make any type support null even value types like an or ball you can make them nullable to support null this can be much better than having to predefine some special value something like minus one next we're going to see a lecture on span this is a super efficient way to do Logic on array or slices of arrays importantly is how this does not actually create any new data it does not cost any new memory does not create a new object this one is basically just a pointer meaning it is insanely performant then in lecture on bitwise operators this is how you can work with individual bits of data in this lecture I'm also going to teach the basics for how binary works next we're going to learn about enum Flags this is how you can turn your enom into bit masks which then allows you to make some interesting combinations then a lecture on preprocess processor directives with this we can give orders to the compiler itself we can Define symbols and include or not include some code in the compilation next in lecture on the keywords ref out and in these are really useful they help you get more that out of a function than just a single return type and they also help you work with types as references even if they are valid types after that we're going to learn about data boxing now this does not have anything to do with punching people it's really all about putting data inside a box this is an interesting property based on the fact that everything in C extends from object next we're going to learn about Dynamic this is a really interesting very Advanced topic with Dynamic we can work with types that don't actually exist so we can define something as Dynamic and call functions or read films on that type on that object even if they don't really exist that validation logic is only going to run at runtime not at compound time so this Dynamic this is really useful especially when working with data you got from some kind of web server then a lecture on the class indexer with this you can make your own custom type support access through an index just like a list or array you can add whatever logic you want and make it read only or read right next is a lecture on attributes with this you can add metadata to your code then that metadata can represent whatever you want you can use reflection to analyze it and do something to it after that is a lecture on Anonymous types really interesting quick way of organizing some data without having to First Define a specific type you just do new open up the braces and it will automatically create a generated type related to that is the next lecture on tupon these are very similar they also allow you to organize some data without first defining a type in this lecture I also cover the differences between Anonymous types and tupon next is going to be a lecture on using I disposable this is a really interesting code block and interface that helps you make sure you don't forget any kind of cleanup code after that we're going to learn how to create custom override operators using these we can add support for our own classes to do things like addition or multiplication we can Define the logic of what exactly it means to add two custom player classes together and also Define the logic for comparing two custom types meaning defining the logic for what exactly thises mean to do an equals next is in lecture on link with link we can easily do query operations on any collection of data whether it be a list or array or some XML or some kind of database we grab that data then we can query for some conditions and select just a few elements we can sort some things we can do a union and so on if you're familiar with SQL then link will be quite familiar afterwards we're going to learn about Wind forms this is how you can make visual C programs you have your toolbox and you just drag and drop the components here I'm also going to talk about the other visual program tools things like WPF and net Maui as well as how Unity itself doesn't have to be used just for making games you can make normal applications with unity next is going to be a lecture on dlll import the elaborate import how to use exter and work with the windows API so this one is going to be a great like leure to learn how to interact with external libraries then a lecture on asserts and unit testing in general with this you can validate your own code to make sure everything is behaving exactly as intended next is going to be a lecture on writing unsafe C code and working with pointers now this one this is a very very Advanced topic technically if you know what you're doing you can make some impressive stuff with unsafe code but C has a safety for a reason so definitely only use this wisely then we're going to learn about as synchronous programming specifically how to use async a wait and task this is how you can have some code that takes some time like for example contacting a web server and keep waiting for a response without blocking your program this is extremely important in making sure your program feels nice and responsive after that comes a super important Advanced lecture this one is all about multithreading this is how you can take advantage of all the cores in a CPU to make them all do work at the exact same time when then properly you can get some insane performance improvements but it is also very very easy to make mistakes so this one is very much a definition of an advanced topic where you must know exactly what you're doing so that's everything we learn in the advanced section as you can see there's lots of really interesting topics all the lectures are already available so if you already have the course just open the page and you'll see new lectures right away and if you don't have the course you can pick it up with the link in description or alternatively like I mentioned many months ago when I first announced this course the goal was to have a premium version and a free version basically if enough people bought the premium version if so then I would make the video lectures free here on YouTube and yep I'm happy to say that it did surpass my thresholds that is why both the the beginner and the intermediate version those are already free over here on YouTube so now I'm launching the advance section on the premium version and the free video containing the video lectures for the Advent section that won't be coming out in one month now if you can afford the premium version that's a great option it includes the companion project which contains a ton of frequently asked questions a bunch of quizzes and importantly some very interactive exercises these certainly help you learn by doing instead of just watching videos then obviously the premium version has no ads you also get access to the private Discord community and the wickly private live streams where I answer all your questions so if you can't for the premium version or if you already have then that's awesome I hope it helps you a ton it's linked in the description but if not then that's okay you can already go watch a free beginner and intermediate section for free here on YouTube and a free YouTube video with the advance section that will be coming out in one month now I'm really happy with how this course came out it covers lots of topics and I think it actually has a really nice smooth learning curve so wherever you are in your Learning Journey beginner intermediate or advance I am sure you can learn something from this I really do love CP I think it's an excellent language I think it's a very valuable skill to have it really gives you the power to build so many awesome things so I truly hope that this course both the free and the paid versions I really hope it helps you gain that very valuable skill all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
