hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're going to review all the videos published in October 2018 let's begin so October had several videos covering systems in various triplea games these are great to recreate and learned various components that make a system work and how each of them combines into a final effect the most complex was the data effect from reddit Redemption it's a really cool effect and it was great when converted into a 2d game the effect in the video is composed of several things first the postprocessing to change the color of the whole scene then the slowmotion effect and the ability to place tags and have tags on enemies follow that enemy the video goes indepth into how each thing works and will help you analyze effects in games by looking at their individual components there were several videos from Assassin's Creed Odyssey first we had the mercenary bar which represents your bounty in the game if it reaches a certain threshold mercenary won't come after you making the bar require some interesting logic to get the bar and the icon between each bar working then we have the adrenaline system it is used for various abilities in the game and we use it the same way in the video on the spartan kick so essentially you gain adrenaline per enemy you attack per kill and for each successful dodge it's a great video to learn how to organize a simple system and identify unique actions unlike a successful dodge with the adrenaline system working we then recreated the Spartan kick it's a very powerful kick that since enemies flying away implementing it requires capturing an action on the player side but also dealing with the behavior for flying away when kicked on the enemy side and finally we create the adrenaline bar so we can see the bar filling up whenever we gain adrenaline this is similar to the mercenary bar but since we don't have any icons at the end we can make it more dynamic the bar dynamically occupies whatever space we define for the background and splits itself up into as many segments as we want so by using this code in a game it would be trivial to have an upgrade to increase the number of bars then there were three videos continuing our recreation of spiderman in unity 2d first we made the enemies move until then they were completely static and only served as a punching bag so we have the code for them to chase the player then we got to work on creating the first spiderman specific ability the web zip since the perspective isn't topdown we couldn't add web swinging so web surfing is very cool turns it we point the mouse into a specific location and hit space then our spider man fires his webs from his hands in to the target when do I have reaches the target he pulls himself towards it's a great feeling ability with some interesting code for dealing with the process of waiting then pulling him towards the target and finally a slide at the end so with that we then got to work on another Spiderman ability shooting web projectiles this video essentially teaches you how to make a simple projectile it spawns a web project eye only moves it towards the target position while checking for collisions along the way we have the nice effect when the web reaches its maximum distance and the whole effect looks great for a beginner content there was a video on how to make the simplest character movement it's a very easy to follow video starting from scratch capturing keyboard input and moving the transform whilst playing animations then we took that base and added collision detection with it some ray cast before we moved into position in order to note four walls again very simple but very useful if you are a complete beginner also this month Baracus made a great video challenging himself to make a game in just 10 minutes then at the end he issued the challenge to whoever won to participate I joined in using a somewhat different approach rather than starting completely from scratch I used the video to highlight the power of writing clean reusable code so by using many systems and assets that I've created in the past I managed to create a pretty complex scene in just 10 minutes the final scene is essentially a barebones RTS which is a tough janitor to create we have two functions that we can spawn and they attack each other was having a health system and a visual bar and a lot of special effects then using that scene as a base in the next video we expanded upon it by starting to make it more like a proper RTS so we had gathers very much like we did in the gatherer AI series then we use those resources to spawn more gatherers and warriors on with nice RTS you I showcasing the constant progress of building each unit I intend to continue doing videos on this and so when we get to something similar like Age of Empires there was a quick video summarizing the whole simple AI resource gatherer series in just three minutes I go over all the videos in series and how each of them builds up to the final scene I think making a summary when I finish a series is a great way to set things up for the future in case you're interested in an ongoing series but getting lost waiting for the videos you can check out the summary when it comes out and then watch the whole playlist and also two videos continuing they create a graph series this series is very much in depth so if looking to learn how a graph is created it will help you immensely first the tooltip video which is great for learning even if you aren't interested in making a graph I'm planning on making a separate video on the tooltip since it's such a useful component and not many people might see it if it's part of a long series then in order to prepare a graph to support realtime updating we have to create the bar chart visual object it's not a great video that teaches you how to organize your code by using interfaces and separate classes so that was it for the month of October 2018 I hope you found the video is helpful and learn something along the way if you have questions regarding any of the videos feel free to post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
