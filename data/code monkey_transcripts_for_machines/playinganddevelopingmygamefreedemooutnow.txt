it's like someone's okay foreign foreign how's it going all right I'm trying to oh crap I'm hearing myself okay all right I'm also trying to figure out how do I stream onto Steam I've never done this before so just a second uh all right okay I think this should be working hey Super Chat thank you so much all right thank you sorry just a second just trying to okay so I think steam should be working now so if I refresh the page and if there you go let's show up in there alright so that's good all right okay so I think everything is working I'm guessing you can all hear me okay okay all right I think everything is working everything seems correct so just everything that is good good uh yep all right okay just put everything this one over here all right okay good oh did I this is good okay now I'm a bit can oh okay it's just the never mind just the the preview here wasn't was stopped for some reason but anyways all right I assume everything is working it's a preview okay I think it is working all right this is a bit strange because I'm trying to stream to multiple places at once so trying to figure out if everything is working correctly uh all right so I'm going to assume that everything is correct seems correct and okay all right so hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here yeah thank you big daddy Game Dev thanks so much for the Super Chat thanks so much how's your demo doing it's doing quite well actually in terms of wishlist got like 500 wishlists in two days in terms of feedback got a mountain of feedback I still haven't gotten through all of it so if you post a a comment with a bunch of feedback don't worry I'll get to it I try to go as much as possible but yeah there's so much stuff so much awesome stuff so thank you all so much for the feedback that has been super useful so yeah I'm trying to get through all of that I've got my todo list right here and it's got like a billion things on it so I'm going to try to do a little bit of progress and see how much I can do uh all right so let me try doing a bit of work try to answer some questions just a bunch of things okay so first thing that I would like to implement is the chase mines making them jump up a little bit so let's try doing that okay some more visual scripting tutorials uh probably not I mean ideally I would like to but yeah there's just so many things that I have to prioritize so yeah going for visual scripting I don't think so but it is quite interesting I mean the course that I made in terms of logic that is all still very much up to date so if you want to learn how visual scripting Works definitely go watch that uh okay so let me make the chase mines make them jump up so I'm gonna be first get a nice testing save scene so here I got a scene and let me spawn a zombie by the way if you haven't picked up the demo well of course you can go on to seam and you can go download the free demo uh and if you haven't tried the last version on the last version I had this little debug window so it has all kinds of funny things so this is actually super useful for for developing the game so I can spawn any kind of object I can completely research at experience and so on and I can also spawn the zombie so this is going to be quite useful to test out how I want the chase mines to work so let me see versus Zombie I drop the mine and just go straight basically I wanted to be able to jump up before it actually goes because right now it can actually get stuck on a bunch of these buildings so if I spun another one and if it goes oh why is it only spawning down there that actually doesn't help uh we only try picking up one from here and if I drop the mine there eventually as he approaches or anything okay come on come on there's the mine there and I think it's already yeah it's already trying to move but it can't quite get there because it gets stuck and only after a while it gets so basically I want to make them jump up and then Chase I think that should be quite a nice thing okay then unit testing in unity no not really although I do kind of do test driven development in the sense that I try to make sure that all the code that I write all of it is testable so I don't actually write the tests but I do make sure to make sure that all the code that I write isn't the testable Okay so let me just all right so this is the chase mines let's see one I've got and looking for Target so it's just a basic state machine so look for Target find the Target and I think that this should be quite simple right because I'm using a a rigid body so actually this should be quite easy I should just need put velocity Vector 3 dot up by a little bit let's say 10f that is probably too much but I think that should be all that I need if it goes like this then it should go is it working you see us nope not right now although with the ideas that I have for the final game eventually when I add uh the goal is you basically colonize One Planet you make it fully automated then you go on to another planet colonize that one get a bunch of resources so it has a whole interplanetary network and when I get to that scale I might actually need ECS so I might Implement not actually fall on entities but at least just the uh the job system that I won't probably need to implement that so yeah right now no ECS but in the future you probably won't need to okay so let's see coming from the oh did you all right yeah it did work but it jumped a bit way too much okay so 10 is way too much let's put just five all right future plans with dinky Gardens well I wrote a little bit on the main menu but yeah basically I've got a ton of things so right now the demo is essentially a alpha build of the game so the idea is still to come out in uh around the end of July perhaps August so it's still got quite a while all right so let's see if that mind jumps up as that one gets closer so let's see if it jumps up enough in order to busantly jump over all these buildings in order to be able to actually hit the target okay there and there you go with the jump up all right awesome so yeah I do think that does work okay let me spawn a whole bunch of them and see if they work so spawn a whole bunch of them okay that is way too much but yeah let me pick up and let me drop a bunch of Mines so just throw yeah right because they're already so as soon as I throw it it actually goes up because it's got a bunch of all right but yeah it does work look at that it jumps up so that is all right but that one jumped up but okay but yeah it did all right so yeah I do think just this one change actually works quite well okay great all right awesome game released internally access I'm probably not going to do only access so or I guess the demo over here this is essentially Early Access so I'm keeping the demo even after the festival so I'll keep developing the game and keep updating the demo so pretty much if you go ahead and play the demo please give me your feedback and I will pretty much keep that going probably until release yeah that's pretty much what I won't keep doing okay all right so yeah the chase mine jumping up that was a simple one that was nice okay the other one that I want is the research making it out of progress because that one is actually quite uh quite annoying so once again thanks so much for the Super Chat uh yeah because that one is so if I go if I continue can I go over here into research and I research and let's say the red personal yeah this one is going to take quite a bit so basically having to press e every time is a bit annoying so let's see if I can figure out how to do this uh okay so for this one let me go over here on the player so the active game action okay let me actually go into the research lab so on the research lab because you can finally rest a while yeah I definitely want to I was hoping to rest a little bit this week but I definitely want to take advantage of you know when the when the uh Festival is ongoing so with lots of people playing the game giving me their feedback I definitely want to take advantage of that so yeah it's probably going to be until next week that I can finally rest a little bit hey good morning thanks hello hey thanks for being here okay so for the research yeah I think I just need to make a different one yeah yeah the autoprobe is pretty much just so you don't have to press e every time so basically every time the progress ends I wanted to start automatically so for that reason why I just need to create a new type of action instead of using my generic time action but actually uh because the action part is actually something that I haven't implemented way too much so just a little bit by the way if you want to see the scale of the of the game so here are all of the tons of script monologies that I have for the recipes resource notes all the objects all the things that can be carrying and over here all of the various scripts that make up the game so really quite a lot of stuff and most of this was actually written in the past two weeks so in terms of scale this it was really quite quite insane making making all this work in such a short amount of time but yeah I'm quite happy with the progress okay uh C sharp chords for beginners yes I have my my free course which is started at beginners and intermittent users so if you're a beginner go ahead go through them lots of people have gone and they've really enjoyed it so give it a try okay so I want uh what was the because I know I did some uh player action so I'm gonna get into the player visual uh because I got a yeah The Gather resource section yeah let me just find this one so over here let me find the gather resources action uh right this is DUI so it's not here so down here get a resource section and let me say uh purpose okay uh so research action something like that all right research action okay so we search action and basically I'm going to have yeah it's pretty much the same thing I'm going to have some kind of time let's use the same time so I use 2f so let's go with 2f so research timer and then over here for the research timer Max and yeah pretty much is doing the exact same thing so just Waits a little bit and then ends okay great uh uh you prefer using event handlers in action yeah just to keep with the the standard so yeah pretty much I always use event handlers uh I only use actions when I actually want to delegate not really an event so yeah for the most part I just stick with the standard use regular event action even handlers and yep works quite well uh yeah for the research timer okay all right so basically what I need to do is make sure yeah it's really just this so then I go into research lab instead of creating of that type I created this type and now I don't even have any action primes I don't think okay so now I'm trying to think how do I make the because basically for the player where do I got the active game action so like for example I've got the on action completed and I think I can make it so that when the action completes I can essentially just queue up the next action Okay so all right but I actually need to interact with it as well but actually the lab there's only ever one lab so all right so this actually quite simpler all right so I've got the action completes and yeah I can actually just put it over here so okay so here if the active game action active game action if this one is of type research action then then the player completed a research action and then I'm basically going to start a brand new one so if it is a research action that I'm going to repeat it so repeat the same action and if it is not don't ah don't repeat the action okay so if I'm going to repeat the action I pretty much just need to create a brand new so create a new one uh right how do I because I just do the get and yeah I already know the yeah so I can actually run the exact same code right yep I can actually just run the exact same code so when the action is created so I can just do the active game action the interactive one the interactive one is going to be the not the HQ the research lab there's only ever one research lab so I can just access it like this I just do well let's actually call it I interactable interactable equals the research lab instance as I interactable okay so I've got that one I go into that one get and create the start action you do it get the action and then oh the action complete that's inside the the thing right sorry if I'm not reading chat I'm trying to trying to think a little bit so that is why I happen to use find I previously used to use it quite a lot but nowadays I never use it so nowadays whenever I want to reference I just do a serialized feeling so for example over here the player visual requires a reference to the player animator so I just drag the references directly instead of using fine so yeah nowadays I never do any I never use fine at all okay application generosity made a profound and longlasting positive impact on give death Community oh that's awesome hey I'm glad I'm glad the videos have been useful to you that's awesome as long as you keep watching I'll keep that I'll keep making them so thank you all so much for being here yeah it's nice why do you cast into interface just so I don't have to rename all these the code is already made to work with an interface so just keep working with an interface uh okay so I think actually like this it should already work oh it's actually good I forgot that I had the tristart interaction right because I use this for the okay so that actually makes it quite a bit simpler right right yeah okay so this part this might actually make it a bit similar so first I reset it just in case something goes wrong and then I try to start the action that will automatically fire off the event and something okay so let's see if that is working where's my thing down here all right okay you don't need the as interactable uh not up here since it's going to cast it automatically just when I need to kind of things since that one does implement the interface as long as I use it and the function expects an interface it won't automatically cancel okay so let's go down here let's research something let's say ammo let's start researching all right didn't work why did it not work uh okay when the action completes so let's do a debug.log let's see what happened this one is research action all right let's see make a minimap yeah I'm thinking I don't know if I'll make a mini map or just say just saying uh basically just an arrow pointing back to each to the HQ so I don't know because minimap is nice unlike minimaps but right now the UI is already starting to become a bit cluttered so yeah trying to add minimap is going to make things quite a bit more complex okay so it's still using a timed action so I didn't actually change that so research action all right as always basic issue I just forgot to save the file so yeah because this one yeah it's already using that one yeah it doesn't even take any action params no just like this all right that should fix it oh hey Jason enchant hey Jason how's it going nice all right uh using Quantum console in this project yes I am and if you're actually uh if you're playing the demo you can actually access the console I mean right now I made this debug menu so it's not real necessary but if you press shift Escape yep over here is the Quantum console which has been quite useful so I've got a bunch of debug commands that I was using for testing but then I just made this debug window so if you click on the secret little pink button over there everything works quite well uh okay so if I go into ammo let's grab some ammo alright I just forgot the visual video there you go now it does that and I can cancel any time so now I don't have to press e every time I can just press and wait and everything works all right that's pretty good so that should make it a lot more intuitive so that people don't get lost in trying to actually make the action now let me just apply the same visual so the visuals this is still going to require quite a lot of refactoring actually let's use the building construction so for the research action and do I gotta stop one I don't think I gotta stop one nope don't okay great if you work in a game Studio nope just by myself all right let me get rid of the logs no longer need them and actually don't need this code because I can just use the try starting Direction and I also don't need yeah since uh yeah right I don't I can know the active game action and if it is on then I'm going to repeat it and if not then well don't repeat it all right nice okay cool all right challenge you to make a video tutorial without using IF else it's a bit of a weird challenge I mean I I love switches so yeah that could definitely definitely be done uh okay so just making sure that everything still works ah I don't want to pick up some power all right there you go so now it does ah crap was I building no did I put it the wrong way around what did I change oh never mind yeah I'm not very smart yeah uh I thought I didn't need that yeah see this is kind of the issue when writing code on stream which is yeah that's the problem is that my brain if I was working by myself I would see that obviously I needed like this I can't do it the other way but since I'm on stream and my brain is trying to think and talk at the same time things work not very well what is the is keyword you can use that to test if a certain objective is a is of a certain type or implements a certain interface or something like that so in this case I can test if the action that the player is taking if it is a research action if so then I'm basically taking it just like that so basically over here the active game action contains an action so this is of type iGame action and then I'm checking if it is a research action which is an action which implements IEM action which in itself just has a basic interface so start cancel get the progress and so on all right okay so that's another test done uh oh right I still need to save the mines so what I was saying right the research Auto progress and if you want to see how I how I handle my design list there you go super basic I have no idea if the camera can actually see that there you go lots of tasks lots of things I need doing so yep still a lot of work to do okay uh right okay so that is working now what do I want all right I want to save the mines because that's actually that is actually an object type that is not being saved how to use YouTube apri to create a live chat overlay uh affectionately I keep forgetting the link for the thing but there it is so if you go onto this page where you can customize the livestream character if you want and if you go down to the bottom you can see the various tutorials for how I made this live stream feature so basically just involves contacting the YouTube API so you can do that with a basic HTTP request then for the animation for the characters these are mesh based animations and this is basically just a transparent TNT window and then I'm basically tinting and randomizing all the characters so quite a lot of things oh hey Jason sorry is also here hey nice lots of people that's cool uh uh right I guess today is yeah at 7 pm it's actually pretty late for me but I guess it's pretty early in the US so yeah I guess that makes sense all right uh okay so let me save the minds because right now let me just first of all verify the issue throw away change the email uh no but you can either use the contact form to email me and I'll change it manually or you can just create a new account so basically the account is really just the email and password so you can just create a brand new one and everything won't work okay so basically the issue is okay so I put a bunch of Mines then I go I save the file then I go back outside I go in single player continue and nope there are no Minds okay so let's fix them and that should actually be pretty easy I just need to go into my save system and just over here got all of the objects that I'm saving so for the mine uh I think the mine is actually quite simple so yeah pretty much just need to save the position I think so let me actually go into oh crap go into the chase mine let me go inside this one oh so I already added the save I just don't think yeah I just didn't call this anywhere but I already saved it I already gotten loading so I really actually don't need the reference to that okay so this should actually be quite easy so let me go into the save system so first of all let's add some more data to the save objects so let's go into the chase mine and story save object so this is going to be the chase mine save object list then over here I just need to create the list so quite a bit of copy pasted code definitely need to figure out some other way because right now as more and more object types happen this becomes quite a bit more unwieldy but so far it's unmanageable okay so the chase mine and basically just looking for all of the objects that exist in the world trying to find all of their of their types all their things Chase mind save object list then I save that save data okay so that is going to save everything and then down here I just need to load it so just need to go into the chase mine they don't follow these same patterns so quite a lot of copyfaced code but at least it's all pretty much exactly the same so go into the Chase mine load save this one object and yep that should be doing okay dark mode yeah dark mode burns my eyes I can look at it for more than five seconds literally I don't know what is it with my eyes but if I look at the white letters on a black background my eyes cannot focus they get all messed up so that is yeah I really can't do it I can look at it for more than a few seconds it really messed me up all right so let's play some mines here let's go save the file go back main menu continue and if there you go got the mind all right awesome okay great so mines can now save all right so next one I want a dinky spawn indicator okay so how am I going to do this hmm give me one has white letter yeah but it's not it's just a tiny thing so like this doesn't bother me but if it was an entire window all black with white letters yeah that lack of contrast really gets quite messed up okay so I do that one or maybe the remaining building refund oh how about the energy because the energy actually has yeah over here basically yeah if I spawn the energy I can spawn a massive amount never actually stop so let me actually is this stinky doing anything I guess doesn't matter so well actually if I got since I've got a bunch of debug things let's pick up some more interactive Bots let's build them and put it interacting with that and there you go and build another one actually yeah instead of placing the Bots although that shouldn't have happened I think I just saw a bug so if I'm carrying one of these ideally I shouldn't yeah right why am I inspecting the interactor bot yet it's missing it's missing something there all right so I can go I can interact with it and yep and basically the thing is I want to limit that but first let me actually fix that bug that I just saw so let's save it okay saving players on like you are saying I did make a video on that quite a long time ago and even though the video was made quite a long time that is still exactly how I do things nowadays so saving and loading to a file with Json that is still exactly how I do it nowadays so basically for each of these like for example over here the chase mine so I just create a save object in there I put all the data that I want to save and I just get the save object so that is common over here on the save system so it just Cycles through all the chase mines and gets the save object for all of them so it stores them in that list and then I've got that list stored in an even bigger save object so this save object this is the main save object which then contains all the save data for all the individual objects and then using this save object I just convert into Json which basically converts into text or not saving binary I mean this is a single player game so if you want to hack the the save files to get more resources by all means go ahead that's not really a concern of mine uh so yeah basically just using Json to save them and then bring them back and just loading them and for loading them in this case this one only takes is the position so we're only just going to instantiate a Chase mine on this position and that's really it so yeah in terms of save file that method that I covered in that video quite a long time ago yeah this method is still going so this was in 2018 and yep nowadays I still do pretty much is only the same thing all right generic dictionary yeah that's interesting newtonself does have some weird issues or at least for me usually it has problems with serializing Vector threes it is a very strange thing all right okay so where was I already forget all right the oh right first let me fix that bug so on the interactor bot there was a bug on this one which is on the can interact where is the can interacts here it is uh carry this can interact if it does not have oh it's the yeah because I don't like to see Canon correct alternate so no I need to remember how I uh let's see into the crafting machine so yeah basically let's see I just test if it is carrying something if not then I can't so let's go where's my interactor but not the ey where's the interactor bot script just close can interact alternate there it is there it is this one see if this one is being carried then you cannot interact with it and if the interwriter is holding something then you also cannot inspect this guy this dot name String kind of inspect it while carrying something okay so that should hopefully fix that issue all right binary is just better and more compact I mean that's technically true but these save files right now are 20 kilobytes so that's really not size isn't really a concern right now and yeah if you want to learn more about saving then definitely go ahead and ask Jason sorry go watch his his talk on game that I've done about serialization and decentralization because that's basically that's basically what uh saving and loading is all about just serializing and deserializing data so all right so uh the issue was that I was holding something and I was interacting and right now okay great so that's one bug nicely fixed uh right now the other issue is you have way too much power is being generated so I want to stop that and basically I need to basically I want to do the exact same thing is on the dinky so what did I call it the gather resource node thinking Behavior so yeah over here it tries to find things tries to move the object and it tries to see if it can actually spawn so it does a query in order to find all things so let me go huh where did I add it did I oh that's good oh okay so now I'm thinking yeah because I had it on the interactor thing not the other one okay so this is actually a bit trickier than I thought or maybe not I can actually just go yeah if I go into the uh what did I call it the power generator manual yeah I guess I can just extend the can interact so see how this one is going to yeah try to spawn the power right so I guess just on this one I can do a bowl can spawn power and over here I'm just going to do the basic thing so I'm going to do that I'm going to look for don't look for a carry object how to customize my character follow the the guide on the website you can draw a thing and so on uh okay so Kim spawn power yeah the power is a carry object right yes so I see if it is a carry object then I check if the carry object dot carry object as so if this one equals the game assets instance let's grab the carry object list so and gravity power so it's power so if it is power then do an end so uh Power amount okay and up here Power Plus was and then okay so let's do you know let's call it pretty much the same thing so private const int for the resource object nearby Mount Max let's say just three okay so basically I don't want to spawn more power if there's already at least three of them so if power amount is bigger than that how big or equal to that if so then return false so cannot spawn power and if not then yep everything does works over here return true so on the interact I'm basically going to check if can spawn power so if I can no if I can not spawn power then I'm going to basically return phone so I cannot interact with this and I'm going to need to return a positive game message so this is basically the message that shows up on the interactor UI and for the negative game message let's say something so uh cannot generate power too many already spawned uh it's not a good message only spawn nearby too many already nearby something like this okay so if you cannot spawn the power then he's going to do that and same thing over here for the try spawn interact let's do another check even though this should never cause problems but if you can spawn power then you spawn it if you don't then everyone lose motivation how do you regain it uh the answer is don't hold my own motivation I know that sounds I know that sounds strange oh I've got the power right here I didn't even know that so I can actually use that instead of using the Singleton makes it a bit better uh yeah so basically pretty much motivation is a very uh uncontrollable thing so I would say try not to rely upon it so I would say try to write from a list write a nice student list of everything that you need to do and then just force yourself to do them as long as you really want to achieve the final goal then I would say rely on that instead of actually having relying on motivation which is something that comes and goes but as long as you focus on being professional doing the work as long as you do that then motivation isn't really a factor so for me even on the days when I don't really feel like it I know that if I want to actually finish the game there are a bunch of things that I need to do so I've only just pushed through and finally actually do them so yeah uh all right okay so I think it's already working I've got there's way too many of these of these caps on Bots go away uh let me take it can I tell you to interact with something else no I can't and I can also not yeah that's a bit tricky what tune shade do they use this one is it's called quibly so on the asset store ah crap because I don't have a link to the SSR it's quibly which is this one an anime Shader and looks really nice and has a nice outline so that is actually perfect for the interaction so as I approach something basically just change the outline from black to white and that alone makes it super easy to be able to select things so yeah it's uh pretty nice uh okay so yeah that already works so right now even if I were to disable this one so oh I can actually disable well that's interesting well I can disable that one okay sound is no longer going to pick up anything and these are going to generates some power and now don't generate any more because there's already way too much okay great so now let me just actually use a proper number so I don't know maybe seven seven within radius of five yeah I think that's uh maybe six all right what is this game about it's a nice automation Colony building management game so lots of things right look at that lots of resources whoo okay great so yep that is indeed working so I've got a limit so you can no longer spawn infinite power so that's good uh there was something else which was if I tell what is this one doing adding power well it doesn't really matter doesn't uh let me just is there a dinky over here what is he doing I don't know uh okay so let me tell him to interact with that and basically the issue was yeah I think the issue was with I don't remember there was some issue with this was like spawning the hmm don't debug menu in demo yup it is there so if you go on the right side the little pink button if you're using the very last uh the very last version yep it is right there so I'm asking please let us move items yep I did Implement that on a few buildings so actually I should probably work on that right now but yeah for a few buildings like for example this I don't grab a machine there are now these two so refund that one converts it into the resources you use to make it and if I put back in the capsule there you go picks up a Capstone so now you can pick it up and place it somewhere else so no I just need to actually apply that to all of the other ones uh so yeah let me try doing that basically limit the energy generator okay so that's good all right I also need to sync the dinky Behavior okay uh yeah because that one is going to be a bit tricky yeah for the other ones because how is this one okay so yeah it's the interactive bot that does not have it because I implemented it just on the building this game Loop you are aiming for and to be more of a roguelike no it's more of a longer campaign thing so it's meant to be one playthrough rather than constantly uh going so basically you spawn on a level then you spawn your very first dinky you use that dinky to make more dinkies gather more resources do a bunch of things then do some research then replace the dinkies with automated machines then when the when the planet that you start on when that planet becomes fully fully automated then basically there's going to be a second layer on top where you can go into a second planet colonize that that one is going to have some different resources maybe different dinkies different enemy sort of things so yeah it's pretty much going to be like that so going to a planet colonize it go into another one colonize it mix all the things so yeah something like on the scale of Dyson Sphere program not not quite like that because that's an insane scale but something like that where you got multiple planets and interplay internal Logistics that's pretty much what I'm going for uh okay so let me go into the building uh any upon the building already implemented the put back in capsule and the refund building okay so basically I just need to implement that also over here on the interactor bot which should actually be doable I don't know let me see oh didn't I save this nope okay uh but yeah so basically I've got the put back in the council does this will not have a destroy itself I don't think so no it only has for the carry out oh it does so am I calling this heifer uh oh no I think I just made it as part of the interface oh because this one is a carry object right yeah that's why it implements this one all right okay so yeah basically just need to put it back in capsule and refund building so all right yeah I just need the building caption list so so let me just because this one has a carry object but that's not the capsule right yeah so let me put a building capsule so for the building capsule so all right keep the UI separate not overlaid over one canvas yeah it just makes it super easy to uh to actually work on it so right now all of the UI Windows those are all separated but I've got a super basic script so let me pick one of these got a reset position script all it does really just says just grabs the rec transform and sets the anchored position and size Delta to zero so basically as soon as the game starts all these windows get positioned on the in there but yeah while developing it is really nice not to have all of them overlapping so I don't need to constantly enable and disable things in order to see them I can just position them all over and everything works quite nicely all right you can throw Apple above building is this okay above building sure you can throw it wherever you want uh yeah actually in terms of collisions I do think most buildings actually do have collisions so yeah you can you can have quite a bit of fun with throwing lots of things uh okay so yeah I think that is actually all that I need for this in order to refund the building if I've got the building capsule I can get the crafting recipe so I can get all the contents and if I go yeah I think this one is really just the 22 Force dropping carry object where that I put this yeah I put it on the network despawn and I've got the all destroyed and on any destroyed okay so yeah I'm going to need to implement this because this one yeah this one does not extend that one right so you're pretty much going to need to implement a on destroyed over here and let's also do it on any destroyed and this is a static event so let's clear it and oh I did not make it static uh okay because I need the on network despawn and I don't have any here all right so because I'm going to need to do pretty much the exact same thing I'm going to need to force drop the carry object and then despawn it so yeah all right so basically put back in capsule I'm going to instantiate the capsule I'm going to destroy this one then on this one I'm going to force drop in case this one is carrying something which I don't think this one can actually yeah this one is not a parent so this one fan sure it doesn't it's not a problem okay whichever Contour float over a simple phone I mean if you want it to be a constant then you should make it a constant so over here this max range the range for the interactor bot this is never going to change so yeah pretty much if a value never changes then just go ahead and make it a Content that makes the code quite a bit more clear yep I just need to uh because right now you can directly interact with them so that is the issue but yeah that is also uh I need to make a UI for them in order to be able to do it but yeah okay so anyways I do think this one should already be working so if I go into the interactor.i yeah I just counted this out because I didn't actually finish implementing it but like this should be work I gotta say my voice is not made for constantly talking on the live stream do you go surfing no I'm not very much an aquatic person so yeah surfing swimming not really my thing I much prefer dry land uh okay so let me just go here enable the buttons and technically with that this should be working we need to keep using ugs or use something like Facebook uh I'm not sure I mean so far ugs is actually working quite well I mean the demo has actually got quite a lot of uh quite a lot of people playing it and yet I'm still on the on the free tiers so yeah I think ugs is working quite well so far all right so I go I interact with one of these I put it back in capsule and nope nothing works whether it's not work I got an error okay what's the error all right because I forgot to assign it of course it's always a simple bugs and simple issues uh that's not what I want where's my so the carry object no the interactor bot is it in where did I put it did I make it oh I made it the building object yeah that's why I couldn't find it okay so the interactor bot let me just see if it's over there on that list uh okay so for the interacting I just need to assign the only cap zone for the interactor bot yep there you go just like that that didn't break anything okay great so yep and let me also uh just never pause just so I can easily see the errors because with all of with all of the characters down here it's kind of hard to see the the console down there all right so let's go continue and try to do that so I go up to one of these inspect put back in capsule and it does work except this one did not hide itself so okay so I just gotta fix the UI so how did I do that I can just go into the crafting machine because I did it in the exact same way yeah I basically just need to store the reference and yeah that's it yeah just listen to the event and when the event happens yeah that's how I was that's how I was doing that so up here right because indirect body is not a building that is why this one is not uh so interactor but on any destroyed then go and I'm pretty much going to do the exact same thing so I can actually just copy this if it isn't interactive bot then I'm going to hide it and yep all right so that should fix it okay which Unity on license did you buy I mean right now I've got uh Unity Pro because uh since I'm part of the unity insiders thing they give me a pro key but yeah before that I had the plus is that the name yeah I have the the uh the one above the free so pretty much I mean I think that one is just like 20 bucks a month or something like that so yeah definitely a if we're going to make games and trying to make it professionally then yeah that's a pretty and low cost all right so only does this work so I can do that I can refund it there you go with that a bunch of only oh right I didn't add visuals for the electronics just yet so so yeah this one is just a a green all right that's fun okay great all right so that does work so I can do that one the other one that I needed was the moving object I think I had one up here yeah there's one over there oh this is kind of the issue is that it moves way too fast but yeah okay so I need to do pretty much the exact same thing on the on the moving objects so that's the where's my moving up the carry vehicle and I think I already added yeah I did already add the buttons the other day I just didn't actually because I put out the last update was yesterday at 9 00 PM as I was dying wanting to go to bed so um all right this game do you expect to sell on the first week uh I think the goal that I put on my I I did talk about my goals in the in the announcement video and the this one right here uh yeah so basically the goal was I actually don't remember what I said what did I say a thousand was that it was my yeah where did I put my final goals where did I put it oh there it is busily my goals for the game so the ideal ones and then the good and the great so yeah basically they only said five thousand wish list that is the minimum which right now is at 2000 which is actually going pretty well so it releases in two months hopefully I should be able to hit at least five thousand so with that I should be able to sell 500 copies and in year one maybe some 1500 and that would make a monthly income of about a thousand bucks so that would be my minimum to consider this success which would be a fun month so I think I'll be able to hit this and who knows perhaps I'll be able to hit this one so that should be interesting all right uh okay what was I doing the carry vehicle so let me go inside my carry vehicle okay so I'm going to need to make the events so what did I call on any destroyed or demolished destroyed okay so on any destroyed and this one equals no and let's make another look on one even though I'm actually not using the local event but yeah sure I guess doesn't hurt say I'm going to do pretty much the same thing so I'm going to obviously need to refactor this at some point in the future after the after the festival is done so I just need the building capsule so just the building capsule put it like that and just for this it should already be working okay so that's good so we just need to assign it yep to write some C plus plus I think I wrote a little bit in in college so a long time ago but yeah never in any serious capacity so I remember I've just seen where I was constantly getting segmentation fonts that was so frustrating back then I didn't really have any skills when it comes to debugging so yeah just seeing and everything segmentation font I had no idea what that meant that was so frustrating that was definitely definitely quite tricky yeah uh okay so building capsule I just need this one to be the carry vehicle and just with that this should only be working let me just go into the UI where's my carry vehicle only y instead of the building on destroyed uh carry vehicle start and then destroy just rename this so carry your vehicle on destroyed like that alright think about the one being Java compared to C sharp uh they're actually quite similar I did I did do quite a bit of java once again also in college that was fun uh yeah Java was was interesting and going from java to csharp was super easy so yeah that was a nice transition also before I was into Unity I was making games for several years using Flash and and Flash action script 3.0 that was pretty much the same thing as you have pretty much the same thing as C sharp so that was pretty easy put back in cap Zone and nope why did it not work could I not did I forget to add the right of course I forgot to remove the comment all right used to be Portuguese yep same I mean I live here so yep uh uh okay so UI window workflow like uh during development those are placed all over the place but when the game starts running they all get merged over there and now they're pretty much all disabled so now for example where's the carry vehicle UI so as I approach the carry vehicle and as I interact with it there you go the window enables and is now visible so put back in capsule and now it is hidden disabled any of the rounds so did that work oh yeah it just it just dropped the thing that the vehicle is carrying okay great uh so yeah I can pick it up I can drop it constructed what happened about your squad game what do you mean what happened what happened it was made I don't know uh all right so yeah that does work all right so I can put this one back in the capsule oh man my voice already messed up I have no idea how can people do live streams for several hours I've been when did I start at 6 30 so it has only been one hour and my voice already messed up so yeah is each one a separate canvas nope I just got one canvas and all of these UI elements those are on challenge of the same canvas except for the World objects so for these ones these are all individual separate canvas so for example over here the power indicators each of these objects like over here the interactor bot it's got a worm UI so this is a warm canvas same thing all these are one canvases then the dinkies themselves they also got a bunch of worn canvases so they've got they've got a world UI to show the hunger bar the health bar the other linky and so on so yeah quite a lot of UI stuff all right you make yourself doing you're really active breathe a bit yeah it's kind of tricky too actually Tonk yeah do any work live streaming yeah yeah that is because it is it's definitely a skill so it definitely so I definitely admire people who can live stream and tonk nonstop for hours on end that is really impressive yeah and being able to think and talk at the same time so yeah it's a doing this is quite uh mentally demanding mentally and physically yeah it's a quite tricky say QA streams yeah those are definitely quite a bit easier trying to do I mean it does help that I've got my todo list in my side so at least I don't have to think about what to do next I can just look at all my tests and figure out which ones work on next Okay so I do think I implemented the caption on all of them so let's see what I do if my character is not how I customize them how did you do that did you add a a custom texture because those need to be uh manually validated so I'm going to see if there's any new uh any new pointer textures okay so I'm going to see that but use Trello nope for project management I've got a text a text object and then I've got a nice basic todo list super huge on lots of pages that's pretty much how I handle things so yeah don't really use Trello or something like that uh okay what was I doing just look at the other UI figure out if there's any of them that's on this not okay so yeah I think those yeah the waste dispose on the tower the Caribbean actually this shouldn't be called waste I forgot that I renamed that because that one can be used to dispose of anything so that should really be just called disposal all right I mean when we can play Squad game you mean Survivor Squad I mean that game is already out so you can go play it if you want if you want to see what was my very first steam game you can go ahead and play it although gauntlets is the sequel which I'm really happy with how this came out I'm really I'm really proud of how this one happened I do think even nowadays I do think it's an interesting game it's got some interesting mechanics some interesting design obviously visually it's quite a bit subpar but in terms of terms of mechanics in terms of what I built for this game I still really like it so yeah I do still I do still think this game is really nice uh okay so I see a bunch of quite a lot of custom characters let me actually validate them uh right there's another one and I think that's it okay another one yeah because the character validation that is manual so I need to go through the list click the button in order for them to work okay so I think I validated all of them so now let me just now it should download so if any of you over here have a custom character uh okay so I don't know if it didn't download or if the people that made it did not so artem okay I do see that you uploaded one but it's the yeah you need to link your uh YouTube account so that the live stream overlay knows which character blocks you say your character already validated it but it doesn't have the so just go into your user page and Link the YouTube account so that it knows okay uh uh right what was I doing uh uh okay so they only got yeah they cannot oh right there's only ah there's the crate object yeah that one is going to be quite tricky all right fine let me try doing that one quickly so I'm going to need another UI to make it for that one so let's put it up here and I'm going to put this one that's going to call the crate container building UI and inside yeah I'm just going to have the close the refund the capsule this one has no settings no nothing so create container oh crap I can see it sorry uh all right so let me just definitely get one of these just make it easier all right so for the Crave container building UI uh so the correct interior building UI oh crap okay about doing a 3D character that can have different cloth options to wear uh that's a bit tricky there's a I did make I did research that topic a little bit when I made a video on character customization uh customization and there's basically a ton of options that you can take so it can be as simple as just just spawn something on there so it can be just spawning objects but then if you've got skin mesh renders that becomes a bit more complex if you've got bones even more complex so yeah doing character customization there are plenty of options so just research on the option and see which one best fits your game okay so the crate container building UI all right so on this one I don't have that one I've got a close I've got the crate container building for the create container building then I'm going to eventually just do that just do that I register the UI I need the crate container building to implement those events I'm going to need to I can't rename it because it's it's bugged on oh this one all right because that one is a building so that one actually makes that part quite a bit easier so going to down this one for crate container building on any of them open it all right instead of an interactor bot this is all create container building say this kind of thing where it would be helpful if this was instead uh generic script instead of constantly having to rename all of this so yeah uh yeah I don't have any slight interactive ones so I don't have any of this on the update visual I just set it on permanent close I don't have any extra things and so on it's normal Liberation yep the goal is to go back to that in 24. so yeah that is hopefully going to be it should be a fun a fun project that I definitely want to get back to it but yeah it's going to take quite a bit of work so that is why for now I swapped this simpler project even though it's actually been quite quite a lot of work to get this work even though even though it did start as a super simple project uh I wouldn't say that it has gone way too far out of scale but definitely definitely quite a bit uh trickier all right okay so I've got the crate container building so I need the on any open UI so for this one let me go into the uh the crap interact alternate right because I didn't even add that of course of course so let me see it's always easy to remember how I implemented on somewhere else so yeah pretty much you can interact alternate and yeah I can pretty much just copy the exact same options because on this one next on this one I'm never doing an interact alternate so that is going to be interesting to see uh this one is being carried this one can never be carried so that is not an issue if it is holding something then it should be able to yeah so pretty much the contract alternate is always going to work okay I need to make sure that this does not break any of the other logic so I've got the can interact yeah I think I'll yeah I think actually that should be the easiest way so return can interact especially the same condition so if I can interact then I can do the interact alternate so yeah all right so that should work so negative game message okay so they can attract alternate that one works and then I just need the on any open UI when do I call this yeah it's really just the try and try contact that is wrong just all I do I call the UI okay I like that all right so that should be able to trigger the on any opening Y and then on the create containing UI on this one I should be able to open it and all right okay so I think this should work okay make an indepth dots tutorial anytime soon uh yep I mean right now I'm super busy trying to get this working but yeah next month I definitely want to research dots try to see what has changed and all kinds of things so yeah should be fun still doing the kitchen chaos cars Ah that's awesome I hope you're enjoying it I hope you're learning quite a lot yeah that was a fun game to work on that was interesting I mean I mean that game and the followup multiplayer course was essentially what inspired me to make this game so yeah that's a definitely was fun making that course how to make these characters on Livestream I covered the pretty much all these tutorials at the end of this page that covers pretty much how it all works so pretty much is an HTTP request to work with YouTube API then some mesh based animations and this is an entire transparent TNT window so that's pretty much it or to keep up with all new software changes uh pretty much just constantly reading the news so every time Unity announces something I always see it on Twitter or their blog post or maybe they tell me directly on slack or something like that so yeah definitely there's quite a lot of stuff but yeah it's a tricky keeping up uh okay what was I doing I was uh right on one of those kind of yeah way too many testing objects okay let's Place one over here let's build it uh nope oh right because he's gonna say that I cannot interact hmm yeah because on this one you try to see if it is carrying something and if it isn't then it's going to say no ah crap that's tricky hmm ah damn it because I really did not want to be copy pasting all this code I wanted a bit better what do you use for Version Control for me I use the most basic thing possible which is just a basic zip file at the end of every day just make a basic zip file with a project and that's really it I mean since I work solo just by myself there's really no need for anything super complex so yeah for me Super Bass again it works first motivation thank for all the videos oh it's awesome thank you for watching them yeah I'm glad the videos I found you it's awesome thanks uh okay so yeah basically uh the problem here if it is a carrying object parent and carrying something but why do I care if it's a trying to think yeah I guess the other one the I've got the interactor bot and I've got the other one uh okay so basically the problem is whatever the sector is carrying cannot go inside a parade okay so that should not go inside the parade but it should still just always okay let me think yeah because basically the issue is if it is the same type or not so actually um so can interact so if you can interact then obviously just return to the right way if not I think I can still use on those conditions and then just check if crate container so if this one is holding nothing so if this one doesn't actually is this one holding a yeah it is holding a carrier so it has carry object I think like that it should work so if this one yeah if this one is not holding something that I'm going to return true so I can't try to answer it and if it is holding something then I shouldn't be able to interact with this one I think that's I think that should do it okay okay hopefully that works so let's test put a pack from the asset store but it just doesn't work uh you got to be a lot more specific than that I mean if you want someone to help you you can just say it just doesn't work just what does that mean do you not can you not import them can you not see the animations can you not see the assets do you see them in pink do you see them just saying it doesn't work that is not very helpful uh okay right different error what exactly went wrong the Y has been destroyed oh right because I forgot to clear these static events right of course uh or I didn't even no he didn't did I not yeah no oh right well that's on so this should have been breaking something wasn't it okay that's strange on the crate container build okay that's strange that should have been causing some kind of bug before but it didn't okay I guess nothing was listening to that one that's a bit strange all right anyways that should fix it um you play General Zero Hour yep that was an awesome game yeah I loved I love playing generals although Zero Hour itself the expansion I never got too much into it but yeah generals itself was really awesome and playing Red Alert Red Alert 2 that was so cool Tiberian sun was very strange so yeah playing command conquer as a kid was really awesome really fun okay great so just like this already working can go I can refund it any of it works I can pick it up and it even works for things like for example this one which is busy I can take some stuff out interact alternate put back in capsule and yeah now I can move objects with a manual all right awesome for the character when I make an animation controller for some reason it goes in the same state every time state that chosen muscles tab I don't know that sounds very specific to the animation I would say add some debug.logs to see how you're setting the animation parameters and all the things and so on please don't spam come on I'm just by myself don't make me mod chat yes hand only joins yes that is something I would like to eventually cover pretty much just handles ordering objects but yes all right we'll come up to Kitchen chaos yep I would also like to like to cover that as always my issue is just time so yeah all those things I would love to cover them if only I could find the time alright so yeah I do think that all of the yeah just the mining machine Okay so let me just do that one as well yeah because that's the only one missing oh in the fracking machine also needs moving actually right now there was something else that I wanted to do all right I want to check the synchronizing the dinky Behavior so for that I'm going to need to make a build let me just go into the player settings put it on windows so I can test it out okay so let me build and run think about starting a twitch Channel yeah for me I don't really I mean doing live streams those are really tricky so yeah I mean I've been doing this for an hour and a little bit my voice already messed up I'm already really really struggling so yeah I don't see myself becoming a fulltime streamer anytime soon so yeah for me streams are just very much sporadic whenever they happen and yeah trying to uh trying to just do the basics so yeah uh uh uh right so I want to test and see so let me if I just continue and on this one oh right it's on this one ah crap I forgot yeah right so for testing I need to change this a little bit so I need to make sure the other scene shows up first all right so that should not work let's make another build like kitchen case now we built the defender oh that's awesome well I hope you'll learn a lot from Kitchen cows that was fun so I hope to learn a lot nice okay all right make a better tutorial at first yep I definitely want to expand upon the game's tutorial there's still quite a bit so yeah right now I definitely do want to expand upon the options okay so I've got a client connected and basically the issue is yeah the client inspects something and it says their own items so it's not currently synchronizing the state okay so let me think how do I solve this so let me go into the dinky the actual dinky script and for the Behavior I've got the active dinky Behavior but I cannot really synchronize this can I actually this is a network Behavior so maybe I can synchronize this huh uh uh okay let's see huh does this actually work I don't think so can I make a a network variable this I oh um because I all right trying to think yeah because this one sets it right I think I'm actually um okay I'm trying to trying to think actually yeah all right no active dinky Behavior index natural variable just natural variable with ends all right so I've got this one and on network spawn let's add a listener on this so I'm probably going to need that so I've got this guy when that happens do I change the uh on the key Behavior changed I guess I could uh I guess I could fire that on this one as well so that the client actually learns about it are you Portuguese yep I am we'll make another q a well I'm trying to work and answer questions at the same time so I'm kind of trying to kind of trying to do both at the same time thank you for kitchen chaos huh it's awesome well you liked it nice General web dev languages would be a good idea to write a server for a game uh maybe but that sounds very strange I mean if I were making a game with dedicated server I would just use Unity for the dedicated trying to do that trying to do a custom web server to handle the dedicated server that sounds real tricky like you would have to translate Unity objects into something in your web server so that would be quite tricky so personally no I would just you I mean technically it is possible you're just throwing bytes around but yeah doing something like this yeah uh Discord yeah sorry I'm not on Discord so I don't know guys what's this game idea I mean you can go play it right now so the demo is available on Steam nextfest so go ahead and go there and also if you haven't already go ahead and add it to your wish list so I'm basically working on the demo right now trying to keep working out okay what was I doing changing the active index okay so this is the because basically for this one yeah this one doesn't actually so could it be this easy all right okay put this one equals yeah if I'm just going to synchronize the index I can go in there on this index so this new value or let me grab the Active network variable.value so I can just scroll down so debug.log let me do the active linky Behavior on this one so all I need to do is when I modify the active dinky Behavior so when I go on to this one so update behavior that one cancels it and sets it on idle and this one is always going to run the server so like this it should work so I go into the dinky Behavior array can I get an index of oh I can't get an index of I need to do system.array dot index of index of firstly rain then the value which is all the active dinky Behavior rights okay so yeah pretty much just like this so every time that I change the active thinking behavior I'm going to update the network variable so I'm just going to cancel it and it's going to modify it and yeah I think that is the those are the only places where I'm actually saving and setting it all right okay so let's see if the client is receiving those messages okay let's try building and running to your own how to make a transparent window assistant from fiber or telegram I mean I did Cover a transparency window so for that part I do have it it's the same thing that I that I'm using down here for the overlay so that's how you make a transparent window and then for how you contact that I mean you gotta look into their API but it's going to be the same thing that I'm using down here so how to do an HTTP request from Unity so you combine those two with whatever API you want and yep you can build pretty much any interesting overlay you want okay so I've got the demo here let me just start a brand new game okay so let me uh go back in the main menu let's create a new game and on this one let's connect as a client okay so I've got the client connected and now let me open up the console to be able to see things oh crap Network prefab not found this one also no okay so that's strange I'll have to look into that one um right so you got the player ID was Alan supposed to okay so if I go here if I tell you to gather resource nodes from this area go ahead and on this one any of the review did work it did got the gather resource node behavior and if I go into this one I inspect all right awesome okay so that's already working well that's cool okay I didn't expect that to be that easy but it was really just synchronizing a basic end and yeah it worked right away so if I spawn another linking is going to be idle so yep that one is idle and now on the host I'm going to interact with it I'm going to tell it to do something and the idle icon should disappear and start the order any of it does and I go and I inspect yep it is indeed doing that and I can go on this one can I tell them to pick up objects uh well I can't because that one is well tell it to follow me and now if I go into that one and yeah that one is falling all right awesome okay so that works so that's cool all right all right I didn't expect that one to be actually that easy so that was a fun one yeah thank you behavior is nicely synchronized all right okay one more thing that I want to implement the waste chance because right now the game doesn't have too much waste don't you want to work at a game studio with a team not really I enjoy working by myself and over here in Portugal there really aren't many oh well that's fun well so there's a bug that I gotta fix all right so let me add that the noise because that is going to be quite tricky so yeah uh fix dinking Fong Wu player disconnects all right so I'm gonna have to fix that one that is going to be tricky all right for another easy one I need to save the tutorial or even Portugal yep right here okay I want to make a drop down an input field from text mesh Pro but I can't interact with it what do you mean by that being transparent shouldn't be shouldn't stop you from interacting with it as long as the object is uh as long as the object is marked as a raycast Target then you can interact with it whether it's transparent or not in fact that's how you can make basically a blocker image if it's an image and it's got raycast Target enabled then it's going to receive events so yeah oh Elian hey how's it going oh if you've been working on the game I hope it's going well nice become an indie Game Dev oh that is awesome hey I hope it goes well that's cool yeah doing paperwork is tricky but hey that makes it official so congrats that's awesome nice all right um transparent window I can't interact with the input field do you mean you have an input you have a transparent window on top if you have a transparent window on top and you want the clicks to go through then you do the opposite you go into that window that image and you said raycast Target to false alternatively you can add a canvas roof if it's more than just an image you can add a canvas group and make the entire canvas Group which is going to be this object and whatever it is a channel this and you can disable unbox recast and that will be able to go through any objects in the UI so I'm working on it right now while I'm listening to you oh that's awesome well best of luck with development let's go uh okay all right so I want to save the tutorial because right now I'm pretty sure that I didn't save it uh what did I call the tutorial mention let me just close these windows there's way too much stuff here uh right here the tutorial isn't really saving so I need to save all of this okay that should be easy so let me see the other simple systems that I'm saving what's the closest yeah I guess the tech tree even though this one is actually quite a bit complex yeah the HQ is doing like that yeah okay but let me go into the tech tree click on this yourself nope I picked up pretty much all the assets from the accessor I think the only things that I made myself were yeah pretty much the visuals for the the windows the things but yeah all these visuals so this one is for the Cynthia scifi pack the background that is also from the city scifi pack the characters are from different one so yeah I'm planning to make a video covering all the assets that I'm using to make the game which should be should be a a fun video should be interesting okay so I need to save and load the tutorial and for that I really yeah this one is an enum so that is actually going to be super simple so that's the only data that I need to save just see the journal stage and nothing else because everything else is already perfect so yeah just the tutorial stage equals the Eternal stage and I don't need any of this so I pretty much don't need any of these uh add an afternoon with action oh that's actually interesting because the way that I was making the tutorial okay so that completes and goes on to the next tutorial all right I don't need I just need to exactly and the activate to turn on that one is going to the so I actually yeah but I should probably do it afterwards in order to prevent any issues so yeah just go into the yeah let's go into the save object and grab the Eternal stage just activated and yep that is going to do that I don't have Super Chat button I don't know are you talking on YouTube I don't think I changed anything so uh how many wishlists are you getting per day on the steam Fest on the first day it was like 300 which was really nice I was expecting something like 150 so again in 300 that was really good and on the second day was 200 so yeah that's really so far it has been really good I mean I was hoping to make uh to get about a thousand wishlists uh for the seam Fest so getting 500 on the first two days that is really cool yeah your FPS course you use some you're talking about the visual scripting course yeah that one is just fully visual scripting there's no code anywhere on that course so yeah although of course everything that is being built there you could definitely do it with csharp if you wanted that would be a a fun challenge to be able to go through that course and convert into C sharp that would be interesting so the tutorial manager let me save that so I've got the HQ and for the tutorial manager I'm going to go tutorial manager so I've got an instance have you got an instance okay great so that is going to save all that and just go tutorial manager load the tutorial manager okay so that should really be it so saving the tutorial State should be quite easy you are so good at programming bro not really good more experience I would say uh just because I've been writing code for 25 years so yeah by now it's pretty natural just anything that I any of these sets that I have on my agenda todo list I know that I have the skills required to actually build them I just need to actually do it so uh yeah so yeah pretty much the answer is always just experience okay so let me craft a quick container all right so let's go although I think yeah I do think that all of these uh tutorial stages according to this math as a programmer I mean just the basics as long as you know the basics that is going to be more than good enough so write this one uh yeah so as long as you know some basic math some basic Vector math pretty much that's all you need you don't need anything complex for me I actually don't remember then I fail in calculus or I think I filmed once and then I made it on the second semester I don't know but yeah complex math is definitely not my thing so yeah you don't need anything to complex just basic algebra basic uh trigonometry whatever it is vectors things that's uh pretty much oh yeah if you want to do super low level graphic stuff then yeah that requires quite a lot more math but if you're just working with UNT just working with an engine they don't really need too much all right uh only this one is not listening to that section like this I do think it should only be working okay so the tutorials on the Staple in the second dinky so let's save the file name go back into the main menu and let's continue and okay that was shh huh okay that went because kind of like uh okay that's a bit odd because I did do the activate tutorial and the tutorial oh I still forgot to add this message let's get rid of it um why did you okay that's strange the tutorial skipped all of these why did you skip all these the function timer didn't load it went into the dinky Behavior which then fired off the event all right hmm okay so that's interesting because basically it's going to all right actually why did you go into that one did I mess up the logs that's a bit strange oh no it makes sense I think yeah he's going in to feed dinky which he shouldn't be but all right because he unloads it right away all right I'm trying to figure out what is he in logic not the active tutorial but the so let's unlock here how's this code compounds so quickly uh I don't know uh sometimes people talk about being stuck in the compilation for minutes and I don't know for me I don't think my CPU is anything too special I think I've gotten like a 5950x which is pretty good don't get me wrong but it's like four years old something like that so I don't know it's it's strange people talk about how their code takes ages compound words for me even on a big project it still doesn't take too long so it is strange okay let me see how is that actually loading trying to make another Unity course yeah sure of course I mean the issue is always finding time to do things but yeah especially one on Unity dots I definitely would like to make a nice one mini project on that so that is definitely something that I would love to have time to do okay so he's going to load but that's not what I now I don't even remember what did I save because I was on the second okay let me make the save file again because I'm because I don't remember what did I save let's save debug download on my tutorial stage just to see what am I Saving right here you can say on the automatically we're unload yeah uh previously it was only reloading when I go but yeah but right now I think it was this version they changed the defaults which annoyed me at first but right now it's actually working quite well video of a problem are you talking about the asset thing I think the best of crap let's not continue I think the best thing is contacting the asset store developer if you're having problems with some specific asset that is probably going to be the best thing skip my question I skipped your question about game architecture that is a very broad topic that is something that is really difficult to cover but yeah uh uh but I did make sure to talk about that quite a lot in my hey Timber Jones hey thanks for being here nice uh but I did cover that quite a lot in my free course so in my 10 hour course I do talk about code architecture quite a lot so if you want to focus on that definitely go ahead watch the course and yeah I talked quite a bit about General architecture things okay so order it let me Spawn that one and I think this is where I yeah okay so I built it and this is where I saved it I think all right so I'm saving on the state clone the second dinky so let's see if I save if I go and it saves clone second leaky okay makes sense so now let's go out let's go back in actually I didn't need to close but okay uh let's go back into the main menu and let's continue and now unloading why did you go back to that one oh never mind right of course what okay now I'm a bit confused oh right because I didn't actually print the thing right because I've got the afterload action so basically spawning on the dinky is automatically completing the first one and then goes into the second one and yeah so on yeah yep it is the Cynthia scifi worlds pack yep that is indeed the one all right okay so this is a bit confusing but I think I've figured out face pops up here that I still need to finish the freedom of course yeah definitely go for it how how much you have left definitely take your time go slow just a little bit day by day and soon enough you won't have it completed yeah uh okay I'll beat procrastination procrastinating you with you all right but just make sure that when I finish the stream which will be in about 30 minutes definitely go ahead and watch the course follow it for about 10 minutes if you do just a tiny bit every single day then even if it takes you sometimes people are like sometimes there are some comments on that on that course people saying something like oh I feel bad because it took me like a month to go through the course and I'm thinking it took me a decade or more to learn everything that course so if you're if you manage to go through the course in one month or two months or three months or whatever you're already doing so much better than me so yeah definitely take your time go slow just a little bit and if you fully understand everything then you will have learned quite a lot so yeah I appreciate it well I appreciate you watching it so thanks for being here all right okay so basically the issue is that I'm loading the tutorial on this tutorial is loading on the Clone second dinky but then as the tutorial unloads that it is going to load that stage so it is going to activate the stage for cloning the second thinking no that actually makes no sense no it does it does make sense yes because it's going to listen to this one which in turn is going to fire off the events okay so one way would be over here instead of completing right away I would have to check for the dinky amount that's one way to do it or perhaps a simpler way you just download this after a little bit just make sure that tutorial loads after the end which actually yeah actually if I just load the tutorial at the very end I think that should solve all of those problems I think so so now it should spawn the dinky go like that and you should no longer skip onto thinking it should go even tell the second one to grab resources oh right because I'm just listening for all right yeah okay so I think this this one fixed it but I think I should still fix the other one how to make a better round game and I'm new on TNT well if you are still a beginner I would definitely encourage you to limit your scope do something much smaller making a battle round game that is a massive scope that's a huge project so I would not recommend that genre for beginners so I would say watch my free course which is a nice easy to learn things so yeah definitely say focus on something much smaller or maybe do something like Flappy Bird maybe Tetris maybe PacMan yeah if you're a beginner that's the kind of skill that you should be thinking of instead of instead of a battle round which is quite complex but anyways okay so it worked so here I am calling a second Nikki and yep it did work perfectly so it goes into that one and it wasn't like that and the tutorial state is now correctly saving and loading all right awesome okay so another one so save the tutorial State yep and if you just join you didn't see how do I handle my todo list where's my camera I don't see hey there you go that's all the all the things just super basic todo list just like that that really helps beat uh procrastination motivation all kinds of things so as long as I got a list of things to work on I can just go through all these lists and yeah pretty much is complete my tasks one by one all right so yeah my what do you do in your free time I mean I go walk my dogs um I go to gym I go for a run uh uh pretty much it yeah pretty much that's the only free time that I've got I was playing I was playing something and I was really enjoying it but yeah that was like three weeks ago since I since I started really crunching on making this demo getting everything done in time so yeah it's been about three weeks since I touched Zelda so yeah next week when things hopefully become a bit more calm I definitely want to get back to it and hopefully complete the game because I was really enjoying it it's a really interesting game lots of interesting systems so yeah I definitely would like to have some free time to get back to it that should be should be fun uh okay what was I doing so the remaining buildings refund I think that one is working great all right so let me just do the mining waist chance okay because that one is uh so for that let me go into the resource node so okay or is it resource node oh yeah the resource amount for the resource note Okay so uh okay so we're here let me do a float for the waste spawn chance and by default it's going to be zero okay so now let's go for example onto the oh let's say on the player I'll sound on the player actually it's on the shh on the yeah it's on the resource node itself hmm so on the resource node I got a resource node so okay so on Canon tract okay I'm going to do whatever and on try interact oh this was one of the first ones okay come or pressing the search that's control and the uh comma thing so the comma control comma goes into this control all then you can search for types so in order to move between things for example find the player I can find all the references for the player or I can go into the player.cs and it opens up the player file so that is actually a super useful shortcut yeah pretty useful and then control tab for switching between the tabs that is actually quite useful if you do just once it goes back and forth if you go multiple times you can go into learning and you can even click with the mouse that also works so yeah definitely learning how to make uh learning how all the shortcuts work that is quite useful okay uh right so the try interact now the problem is that back when I implemented this I was still still doing okay so basically I want the the let me do it here uh so float for the what did I call it the resource node waste one chance uh okay so boom spawn waste equals random.range so I'm going to randomize between 0 and 1f and so if this one is under the resource node so the always one chance if so then true if not oh just like this yeah oops uh right yeah so the spawn chance if I put it at one then it's going to spawn 100 okay so if spawn waste then I'm going to want to spawn some waste if not then I'm going to want to spawn the regular resources okay how old are you I just turned 35 about a month ago so that's interesting yeah I guess for for a bunch of people 35 is super old no honestly I definitely don't feel it I still feeling pretty young so yeah definitely it's nice okay it's one way so this one I'm spawning an object and giving it to the parent yeah this is some of the first code that I road so I'm going to need to kind of refactor this way I do think this is the one that it spawns the objects and then adds the oh right it has the explosion Force okay or do I give it to the player no I think yeah all right uh so I go into the I carry objects spawn a carry object and I'm going to spawn of waste so let me go yeah probably store it in the game assets so carry object list spawn some waste on this transform dot position okay so I think that's it that should actually be quite easy all right could not code for game objects uh become limiting in larger size games technically yes I mean they say that it's limited that it's meant for small scale games although I haven't yet tested to see what the limits are I mean right now for the game that I'm developing I actually I don't have it very well optimized meaning all of the tons of name the yeah yeah basically all of these objects those are only networking so there's quite a lot of objects roaming around here and right now everything some Works in multiplayer so I don't know what are the limits they do say small scale but over here I've got I don't know maybe a hundred objects Maybe 15. 50 objects and I've tested it with up to four players and everything still worked quite well so yeah I don't know they do say that it's meant for small scale but so far I have not yet uh encountered the limits of those so so far I'm quite happy with net good for emerge that has been quite well thank you enough for kitchen chaos multiplier oh that's awesome make a working multiplayer third person shooter oh that's really cool hey congrats yeah that's nice yeah congrats on learning something and building upon it that is really awesome that's how you really learn so yeah great job nice uh uh uh okay what was I doing you should make a zoom scroll wheel for this game yeah right now the camera is fixed just because I didn't have time but yeah I definitely want to add a tiny bit of zoom in zoom out I want to be able to rotate the camera that's actually one of the things I've got on my todo list so you know so yeah definitely want to implement that and what Brazilians nice thanks for being here yeah what time is it in Brazil right now since it's on the other side I assume it's like 3 P.M Maybe sounds nice hey thanks for being here yeah on this random wedding say it's nice about demo is being discovered and doing over on team yep so far it's actually doing quite well I mean in terms of wish lists it got 500 wishlists in the first few days so uh so yeah so far I'm quite pleased with the with the results on things so yeah it has all been it has gone quite well and the response has been great and lots of feedback so thanks for all the people who have been playing to them and giving feedback it has been it has been tricky to keep up with everything there are still a bunch of messages that I haven't replied so I still gotta gotta go back to that so yeah thank you all so much for the feedback it has definitely been extremely useful in terms of adding tons of stuff to my tomatoes yeah right 3 P.M in the US yeah nice uh okay what was I doing research uh research resource notes all right so let me go into my resource node so okay let's see the food let's say the food is going to spawn waste every single time so put it on one all right so let's see if now food instead of spawning food let's see if it spawns some waste hopefully it should which should be fun so let's continue do yeah do pretty much this one so here's some food and if I go let's see anything did work it did spawn some ways so there you go instead of food I grabbed some waste all right so that's a cool mechanic that's exactly what I want to do so yeah if the players on top he gets a bit buggy so maybe I should spawn it a little bit above Maybe yeah let me Spawn it just a tiny bit above so uh when I'm spawning the way so I'm transforming opposition points like the three dot up yeah just got up just one unit that should be enough to do it uh and let me actually play around should the player automatically pick it up uh he does if it is the right thing but for Waste I do think it makes more sense for it to just show up since waste uh is not intended so I do think that not picking it up automatically I do think that is hopefully better so for this one well let's say for food spawns your waist and on the gem green let's say 0.5 and let's see what that one does all right running out of water so it's gonna be about time in a little bit okay let me continue hey a custom character hey that's nice that's fun all right let's go that's one oh right did I put zero on the phone yeah right I put zero on the food so it's funny food okay so that's good use a special keyboard mouse uh nope it's all prebasing although I do have a a little wrist uh thing because I really this keyboard is actually pretty nice it's actually pretty and low profile but still just using it without this this is a very steep angle so I really like just a little rubber thing that really helps like this I can type no problems and the most being Wireless also helps uh really good in terms of making the mouse room light really easy to hold uh right okay so as I do that okay so good news is it worked bad news is why did the dinky seems like the dinky is a dinky oh I think I might have made it essentially uh not go through the interact action let me go into the gather resource node dinky Behavior so this one yeah exactly it's going to gather the resource and then spawns it all right I do think the logic should more be hmm uh right I made that because okay let's do practical test should spawn waste test chance should spawn waste and I'm basically going to do this and if so then you're going to do that if not then you're going to do that so let's make this one public so now on this one I can go into the resource node test shoots one way so if you do that if so then I'm going to want this one waste and if not and let's put it on times two F just make it is only the same and if not then you're going to do that and this one doesn't actually remove the amount right yeah it doesn't okay good uh right okay so now the dinky should also be Gathering waste so let's see if that does happen nightmare fuel Knockouts it was a bit of a strange Sprite uh how did you come up with the dinky name well I actually asked Che GPT so I I talked about that process a little bit in the announcement video so if you want to see how that that came about me I pretty much asked Chachi BT to give me a cute sounding words for for some cute creatures and it generated a bunch of them and one of them was dinky which I thought was quite fun so that was that was interesting all right yeah it's Quantum waste so that's cool all right so that did work now obviously I still gotta design all the things inside the spawn chains obviously these ones are not supposed to spawn waste but this one oh it was a experience belt right yeah yeah I think so because it seemed like it spawned two of them make sure yeah right it's an experience palette yeah but two is spawning a bit too high so I think I'm just going to put one yeah on both them yeah 2f is a bit too high so just put one F even though yeah I guess I can omit it if it's one F hmm I'm lucky best man ever oh I mean it's great download that my videos have don't you only Shadows from image collusion yep that is actually that is true and that is actually a funny thing which actually wasn't funny at all that was actually very frustrating but basically uh so one of the last things that I did before I published the demo was work on the environment so I built the environment out of a whole bunch of things it is actually it is actually one task that I really dislike doing so building this entire map that was really annoying trying to get something but I finally got it working and once I got it working for some reason there's something in the Shader that these environments use that somehow makes it all messed up so so basically the answer was to remove the Shadows uh where do I because that is still a a visual bug that I cannot figure out no right I disabled it on the other one so if I go on settings on the renderer and I cast Shadows so now on this one over here on the editor everything actually still works quite well so if I go in let's go continue spawn and there you go works well so the character has a shadow so I can pick up something I can throw it yep got Shadows perfect but now if I were to make a build and this is the part that really destroyed me now let's see if the bug still happens or not because basically the issue was as soon as I made a build for some reason the build had flickering shadows and I have no idea what was going on and my only answer was really just the only Shadows so let's see if the first if the same thing still happens where's you get the graphics yeah I got them pretty much on from the asset store so I just made some basic Sprites myself everything else just comes from the asset source so yeah would you switch from to these 3D games well the answer is because I learned how to use the assets order that's pretty much it because for me I only know how to draw to the assets so uh so yeah North to move to 3D as soon as I learned that the accessor exists I was able to do that and yep there you go here's the problem so this is why I had to disable Shadows this is a bug that I still have not figured out I have no idea what is causing this it only happens of this if I run on the editor there are no problems no issues nothing but over here on the build I don't know there's something with the normal something with the mesh there's something very strange but yeah the strange thing is really how the editor works perfectly fine here in the shadows everything works great but on the build itself for some reason everything gets messed up the player character the shadow appears and then disappears so yeah very strange graphical bug I have no idea what is going on I'll have to inspect this figure out why is this happening this is very very strange yeah I definitely also hate those bugs that only haven't built I thought everything was working great and then everything suddenly broke what is the graphic quality in the building it's the same one so both are using the exact same uh the exact same render pipeline asset everything is exactly the same so I have no clue no idea why this is happening so I've tried I tried baking the light and it didn't didn't work didn't do anything all these objects are marked as static so yeah yeah I do think it is something in the Shader so I'll have to look into it this is actually pretty complex Shader it's from the it's from the asset pack so it's a trip planner Shader I have no idea if that is what is causing the issues but yeah it is on this Shader because if I use a different Shader and everything works uh without issues so yeah there's something with this Shader on this build that for some reason for some strange reason it just bugs out so so yeah basically that's the answer as to why there's no there's no no shadows in the final game right now yep I did try out the normal bias I I tried changing everything I was spinning from like two or three hours modifying all of these settings all of the things I was changing the distance changing the Cascades over here saying the depth buys the normal base I was modifying all this try tons of stuff and nothing actually worked so so yeah that was something that was really insane I have no idea what the answer is but The Simple Solution is really just disable the Shadows which actually since the game does have the ambient occlusion it actually ends up quite well I don't think I don't think it's too noticeable I mean now that I've mentioned it now you will notice that it's liking quite a bit of Shadows but thankfully for the game the way the camera is set up it doesn't look too noticeable but yeah I'll definitely have to figure out how that is working throw Shadow casting terrain Yep this is not a it's not an actual terrain it's just a just a mesh render with a mesh so yeah ah boy my voice already messed up uh right uh okay so all right so I was just doing that one so the mining waste chance let me just set some basic boundaries and I'll have to balance them and do things whatever this Shadow issue another projects nope never so yeah very very strange thing uh right so the resource node the food should not spawn any chance I came physically oh I got that open okay come on taking it hey give me uh right okay okay baby okay all right okay um right so the food for the gem black motivational dog yeah can our dog write some code maybe I don't know I've never asked her uh okay so yeah maybe the gym black the gem Grand this one is not supposed to spawn any waste and the purple on this one is meant to be quite wasteful so like 0.7 then the red let's say 0.4 the envelope let's say 0.2 and the stone also zero okay so just some basic things then I'll have to I'll have to balance all of this all right um okay so I think that's gonna be it because my voice is already messed up and yeah but I didn't manage to do quite a lot of things so yeah the money waste chance that oh actually no actually I don't know that I fully did this uh because there is still the mining machine because since I didn't implement it on the resource node itself it was on yeah it was on this one okay so I also need to implement the same thing on the mining machine so let me just do this and verify things say it's really as simple as that so on the money machine it is going to ask the same question so should you spawn waste if so spawn some waste if not then spawn this end for the mining machine yeah for this one let's put it on the 2f and everything should work okay so let me just verify that the mining machine is working and with that everything's gonna be pretty good I will stuck at constructing Rock I mean it's awesome that he made it that far but yeah the rocket right now doesn't have a a fully uh an end goal so yeah sorry about that but yeah I don't have uh yeah the rocket only has two stages right now yeah that actually reminds me that I should probably I should probably add at least just make it functional so yeah sorry about that I'll try to I'll try to fix that in a little bit uh okay for now let me just focus on this one so I made the that one have a Spanish let me use let me spawn a mining machine so let me pick up one of these craft it and let's see if it goes and there you go it spawns a bunch of waste all right so that's cool all right awesome so it's working on the mining Machines working on the player and it's working on the denkis so I can go into all these and everything works all right let me just go into the food okay okay so yeah actually since I'm here might as well try doing that so yeah basically because it's on the rocket oh I actually did Implement these stages well then it's gym uh for that but yeah so actually yeah I think the uh I think the only issue is that well let me try let me try doing this so only like the main menu let me start a new game and now in fact I'm currently braced on separate lines yeah everyone has their preferred sound for me I quite like them like this but yeah if you like it on new line by all means go ahead and do it uh just follow whatever makes sense to you uh did I not put the rocket here oh I did Capstone rocket we got 99 Rockets okay so let's place oh why does the rocket okay that's strange why do you not have a material assigned oh no that's weird oh because I didn't set the didn't I wait why are you even all right because I put it just the black one so okay so let me just quickly fix that and actually I just need to just open up the network prefile just make sure that nothing breaks where's my rocket uh uh so the rocket base is right there just make sure uh okay so on the rocket base send yes to yourself nope I'm using various asset tags because I definitely cannot do I cannot do any visuals myself so yeah I am not uh doing that okay so just on the selected just put the standalized and the selected even though it shouldn't be interactable so that is why pretty much is scalable I mean that depends on the scale uh right now I've managed to get up to something like uh 15 networked objects with four players and everything still works so yeah that really depends on exactly what you mean by scale okay so let me spawn a rocket and some crate containers okay so let me take the Rockets So on the rocket and build it ah crap ah crap did you ah I hate this bug this is an annoying uh net code for game objects bug where sometimes if you modify a prefab for some reason over here on the prefab list for some reason this one goes missing this is a really annoying bug I really hope they fix this this is something that has driven driven me insane for quite some time so for some reason when you modify something sometimes it generates a brand new uh prefab instance prefab thing and for some reason that was on the references so I need to go back to all the objects and drag all the references so I need to put it in there and over here let me find the rocket base and yep I've got a missing prefab so I need to drag the reference and okay I think that's it okay how many years with unity uh I started in uh December of 2012 so where are we 23 so I've been using Unity for a bit over 10 years yeah it's been quite quite a while quite some time yeah definitely quite a bit of time how many players have you tried to run a netcode for your Market I've only tried up to four so yeah I haven't done any any serious stresses so yeah that is actually something that I very much would like to do try to push it to the limit to see how far it can go but yeah so far I'm actually quite happy with how it all works it is all I need places uh yeah so far uh yeah the uh the netcode the overall that works quite well okay how old are you and how long in programming uh I've been I start writing code I started writing IRC scripts back when I was 10 years old so if I'm now 35 it's been 25 years so yeah quite a long time quite a long time no inputs have one green Crystal okay so I need to get the green crystals and then the the other ones okay let me let me Spawn some just to be able to see some some green crystals and then I'm going to need I think it's some Stone so let me drop some Stone here some green crystals there on this have control support yep I didn't manage to to make it over here in time for the oh this one also doesn't have a oh it takes food uh but yeah the final version will indeed have Gamepad support so yep there's definitely something that I need to implement okay so let me pick up some food so these interact and okay to put it this way it's difficult or easy to make a decent living out of publishing in the games the answer is it really depends on what this uh decent living mean for you that really is the answer I mean one of the things that has helped me quite a lot is in with the fact that I live in Portugal which is a low cost of living country so when I first started doing this professionally and I was making enough to move out of my parents house I was living on about 700 bucks a month so so yeah if you only need 700 bucks a month to to live then in the game development is actually quite doable but on the other hand if you only live in something like San Francisco and you only and you need 10 grand a month in order to consider it a decent living then yeah at that point it is quite uh quite a lot more different so so yeah the answer is whether in The Game Dev is easy or hard it really depends on your costs the more you spend the harder it is uh okay so basically the logic is working it simply just never completes okay so I'll have to I'll have to come up with something because you know like this let me just inspect the debug uh Network object ID I've got the building capsule and the stage oh stage is undone yeah so I just need a rocket form UI so I need to figure that out um so the rocket World UI all right okay so I'll have to fix that but for now I'm already pretty messed up my voice is going it's almost 9 p.m so ah so yeah definitely uh need to go it's only got to do a lot of work a lot of things but yeah but yeah this was a productive live stream I did manage to do quite a lot of tests so yeah quite a lot of progress I'm just going to clean up things a little bit and put out an update hopefully in the next 30 minutes something like that so yeah that should be interesting situation where you're studying programming but worrying when you are you try to do something you struggling a lot I mean struggling he's definitely part of the learning process so yeah if you if you are struggling with with the learning something that's perfectly normal don't get frustrated just keep going a little by a little all right okay so I'm really all messed up so let me just set things
