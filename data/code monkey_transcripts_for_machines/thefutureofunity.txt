hello and welcome I'm your KMI Unity recently had their yearly unite conference I was there and it was great to meet tons of people in a previous video already did a quick summary of the keynote which is the most important talk in all of these events then the second most important talk that one is the road map which I just made available they just published the entire recording there's a link in the description if you want to go see the whole thing for yourself but here are my quick highlights although honestly there's quite a lot of stuff coming in the future so my quick summary isn't as quick as I would like and if you use unity in anyway check out my ultimate un over course the goal here is to help you learn how to make better games faster by teaching you about tons of unity tools that can be super useful that you might not know about I just put out the fifth free update making in total s lectures each covering a different tool or feature of the engine check it out to the link in the description starting off with the most obvious one which is the naming scheme starting next year Unity will go into a regular version number so instead of being named off the year it's simply named Unity 6 but that's really it it's just a name change so instead of next year having the 2023 LTS inste it will simply the 6 it won't work just like an LTS and I believe it's meant to come out towards the end of the year now in terms of things coming in the future there's a ton of stuff lots of info on graphics on new platforms there's a bunch on multiplayer and of course a bunch on AI perhaps surprisingly there is barely a mention of Dots here there's only a vague mention of an integration at the very end now I spoke to Laura at unite and from what I understand their goal right now this year their goal is pretty much a stabilization their goal is really just focusing on the core and getting that nice and stable they're actively listening to all the feedback from all the dev that are currently using dots in production and they are taking all that feedback and pretty much making the core as stable as it can be before they start adding tons of features personally I believe that is a good plan really focusing on the core before adding tons of stuff but of course that does mean that right now there's not much being announced so maybe 2025 maybe that won't be the year of dots now one very big part about this road map is on the entire multiplayer section and for this entire section I would say the keyword that stood out for me is pretty much streamline pretty much everything they announce that is coming in the future is meant to make everything simpler and easier to work with for example there is a multiplayer Center coming soon this one looks quite interesting you basically pick from a handful of preset game genres then set a bunch of fields like how many players is it fastpaced or slow paced and then tells you the various Unity gaming Services tools that would be helpful in that genre and allows you to very easily install all of them in just one click l i also mentioned a bunch of specific game templates are coming soon so it's going to be interesting to see what genes they focus on in order to help you iterate faster they are continuing to work on the multiplayer play mode if you followed my free multiplayer course and you know how it actually takes quite a bit of time to make a proper build in order to test anything in multiplayer so this tool which pretty much lets you run multiple instances of unity at the same time this one should really help speed up iteration then relay integration is also supposedly going to be quite a bit simpler just press a button and it should work for the multiplayer play mode they're also making it work very easily with a dedicated server and speaking of dedicated servers they're also streamlining just how easy it is to push a build to that dedicated server I made a tutorial on using Game Server hosting and for that you need to manually make a build you need to manually upload it to the dashboard and then manually start and then you can connect so simplifying that entire process to just a simple button click that sounds awesome and then they are pretty much taking streamlining to the max by announcing something called the multiplayer Services SDK so basically all these Services these won't work with just a single SDK now there aren't many details on this so I'm not entirely sure what this means but it does seem how instead of just initializing each service individually you can just work with the SDK and somehow initialize all the men at once that does sound like it would streamline things but I'm not entirely sure how this is meant to work in technical terms different Services require different setups so I'm not sure how exactly they're going to streamline this process but I'm definitely curious to hear more does sound interesting something also great is they are adding a new distributed Authority mode meaning instead of just one host you can actually have multiple players that have authority over certain parts of the world the one question I have right away is so does this mean that netod for game objects is now going to support much more types of games for example could you make a complex large open world MMO something like that in N for game objects if each player does does have authority over a certain part of the world then technically that should be possible so that sounds interesting as you can see from all this there's lots of stuff on multiplayer they already got a ton of tools I already covered a quick video on a whole bunch of those tools so with all these tools that already exist streamlining all that process in order to be able to use them that sounds like a really great Focus then the other big improvements coming in the future are obviously on Graphics this is something that visually looks good of course and because of that most of this was already shown on the keynote itself coming in un6 is the GPU resident raar then there's also GPU calling and spatial temporal post processing these are three features that apparently are enabled with just a single button click and make every scene run pretty much faster now for me as someone who is not a graphics programmer I always enjoy hearing how with just one button click my game won't perform faster then coming in the future are adaptive Pro volumes these look really awesome they're already available right now in agrp and unity 6 they will also be coming to urp supported on both mobile PC and consoles these let you have some really high quality lighting it almost looks R traced but but importantly at a fraction of the cost it supports data streaming for super large worlds it works with VFX particles and you can make it per pixel or per vertex so all in all this feature looks really awesome it looks like it will really impact the lighting quality of pretty much every un game then the VFX graph is also getting a bunch of improvements there's going to be a custom hlsl block allowing you to write custom shed code and work directly with VFX ra it is getting support for 6way lighting in order to make your particles look much much better it will also support motion vectors which from I understand allows you to build some really complex things and it will support spawning details which sounds like an interesting use Case by the way if you want to learn how to use the regular decal projector I just added a lecture to it on my latest free update to my ultimate unity over course then Shad graph is also getting a bunch of improvements one interesting one is a heat map color mode this one basically tense your Shader graph nodes in different colors depending on how performance intensive they are this should be really good for helping you make your shaders much more performant there are also a bunch of new samples I really want to find the time to be able to look at these I've seen a few of them they look really ni nice then a bunch of General performance improvements for VR it is getting fiated rendering this is a really excellent feature that I really hope a lot more games are going to start to adopt and agrp is also getting a bunch of enhancements to their water lighting and so on so rendering does seem to be improving quite a lot in unity 6 and a lot of it in ways that benefit even people like myself who don't really push visuals to the Limit then the future of platforms as always Unity continues to support pretty much any platform that exists the big one coming soon is the Apple Vision Pro and vision OS Unity was right there as soon as the official announcement was announced the device is coming next year and you can right now start working with the vision o SDK Sometimes the best thing you can do is simply be early on a brand new device so if you have some interesting ideas for the Apple Vision Pro then maybe look into the SDK and maybe get something ready right before launch AR and VR are also getting a bunch of improvements there's crossplatform input hand tracking and gestures and a bunch of project templates I still haven't found the time to be able to touch VR but it's amazing to see how it keeps improving day by day year by year another big platform is mobile and apparently only one huge addition is adding support for mobile web support this is what got the most amount of Applause during the road map talk now I'm not a mobile expert but apparently it's a big deal to be able to run Unity on a mobile web browser without requiring it to install a native app related to that is web GPU this is the new standard that is currently being worked on that technically grants the browser direct access to the GPU this would make rly intensive games possible even on just a simple web browser that does sound really interesting although from what I understand this Stander is still very much in its infancy so believe it is still going to take quite some time until this is properly implemented in every browser in order to help you build for these platforms that is going to be a very expanded build profiles window this seems like a really great addition to once again streamline everything so with this there will no longer be a need for making complex editor build scripts you can just do it straight from this window make as many profiles as you want for debug for rless builds for supporting Android iOS windows and so on so this one of those things that looks tiny but should be extremely helpful and then obviously they are working a ton on AI sentes is their on device model which is available right now and they've already released early access to their Muse tool stack there's Muse chat Sprite and texture that are available right now and behavior animate and sketch those are coming soon one Improvement that I definitely want to see is just how quickly will Muse chat learn about new Unity features personally that use case seems extremely useful to me whenever I make videos on some new tool I have to do a ton of research that involves a lot of reading documentation a lot of trial and error I have to do all that because when I cover some brand new tool there are no tutorials so being able to ask M chat some questions about some new tool I think that could help me in my own process they're also planning to continue improving the models for texture and Sprite and for this I would say they definitely do need to do that I only briefly used these tools in a live stream a while ago and I definitely found the output to be subpar it works for super quick prototypes but not much else basically the issue as it were the issue is that they are actually doing things the right way they're licensing all the data to make sure there are no copyright issues for you as a developer that's a great thing but of course because of them being being slow and careful that means those tools are quite underdevelopment when compared to any other tool basically right now these generation tools these are outputting what the other AI tools were outputting about 2 years ago so they're quite a bit behind personally I do like their focus on actually solving the copyright issue I think that's a great thing and that is definitely something they should focus on but it does come at the cost of quality so I do hope in next year they really improve these models then the big ones coming in the future are Behavior animate and sketch for Behavior this one won't let you design Behavior trees honestly for this one I'm not really interested in the AI specific Parts but that to all for having the various graphs for describing various Behavior States I think that tool even without some AI I think that could be very useful then for animate personally as someone who can't really animate anything for this one I'm very interested does sound quite useful and for sketch this one lets you create entire prototypes just based on natural language and importantly it is made with realtime collaboration in mind so I think this tool this one can be quite useful when doing something like a game Jam all in all AI is still a topic that a lot of people dislike so over the coming year they really need to make these tools look insanely useful in order to convince developers to actually use them in their workflow and then even further out there's a slide on the very far future basically their focus is still on iteration speed Andrew mentioned how the goals to have no loading bars that definitely sounds like great Focus then upgrading their net version and continuing to upgrade to Corr and like I said lots of dots entities integration that won't come over time after the core is nice and stable so as you can see from all this there's Lots coming in the future Lots on Graphics multiplayer and really just making everything more streamlined Unity definitely made a big blender when they announced the runtime fee which will start to take effect on this version unit6 even with the changes they made to it and how the final proposed fee even how that sounds pretty reasonable despite that a lot of people still feel like they broke their strust so they need to work really hard to regain that and thankfully looking at this unite keynote and road map it does seem like they're working really hard to make un6 a really awesome version all these updates sound really awesome so I'm definitely looking forward to seeing all of this come to fruition I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this what did you think about the keynote and now the road map in general if you want you can go watch eone 1 hour road map video there's even more detail on some of these topics and a bunch more that I didn't have time to cover also check out my ultimate D over course to help you make better games faster all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
