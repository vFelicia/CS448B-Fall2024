hi there this is a quick tip for how to keep your code clean with a serialize field attribute so let's say you have a script and you want to set some variable here in the editor now one way you could do it is simply go into the script and make a public variable if you do this you can indeed go into the editor and now here it is a film that you can easily drag something on to it however doing it this way is very dirty since you end up making public variables that really should be private so that means that you have the unintended consequence that you have another class in here as you can see we can easily modify this tree variable so if this one is meant to be only used inside this script then we should not use public so we should put this as private and doing so this will now show an error since we can unlock it access it however in doing so since this is no longer public and then what shows up in the editor so sometimes you might have a variable that you want to keep private to keep your code clean but you also want it to be editable inside the editor so you can either drag reference or modify someone like a units movement speed so we can keep our code clean by leaving it as private so we cannot access it outside of our class and we simply add the serialized film attribute this way our variable is still private and we still cannot access it from outside of this class however if we go into the editor as you can see there it is it shows up in there and we can drag it as if it were public and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
