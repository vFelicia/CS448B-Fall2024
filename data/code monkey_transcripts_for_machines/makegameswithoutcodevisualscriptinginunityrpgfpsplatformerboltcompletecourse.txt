hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this course you will learn how to make complete games from start to finish all using unity visual scripting without writing a single line of code in this course you're going to build not one but three games a platformer a action rpg game and an awesome first person shooter by bundling several games you will learn how visual scripting works and how you can apply it to any game about me i'm a professional indie game developer with several successful games published on steam covering a wide range of genres i've been programming for over 20 years and using unity for almost 10 also a couple of years ago i started a youtube channel making free tutorial videos to share my knowledge to help you learn how to make your own games so if you'd like to try out my learning style before purchasing the course you can watch the over 300 videos available for free on the youtube channel they are presented as clear stepbystep tutorials just like this course so a bit more about the games in this course you're going to build not one but three complete games by building various genres you will better learn how to use visual scripting in any scenario first we start off with the platformer game this is the simplest one and works as a great introduction to visual scripting starting off just by learning how to handle movement physics collisions jumping and so on then as you'll learn the basics we start adding more features and the final game is a simple but very nice platformer so there's moving platforms there's multiple levels hazards coins lava and so on the second game is the action rpg this one is a very complete game with tons of features it's got multiple weapons multiple enemies and hazards there's coins and pickups dungeons with portals cannons and lava so the final game is really feature rich once again all of this built without writing a single line of code this one is more complex thanks to building on top of the knowledge gained while making the platform again and the third game is a first person shooter which takes all the knowledge gained in the previous two games and applies it to 3d it features multiple weapons enemies pickups coins a boss fight and an awesome hookshot mechanic all three games are included in the course from start to finish and they are set up to provide a nice smooth learning curve so first you'll learn the absolute basics in the platformer and then continue learning and apply that face knowledge to the action rpg and then to the fps so by the end you will have three complete games as well as the knowledge to then be able to go ahead and use visual scripting to make any game in any genre you can think of visual scripting also works as an excellent tool for learning programming even if you've never written any code by the end of this course you will have learned how logic works and how objects and scripts interact with another with that knowledge if you want you can then go ahead and easily learn programming or stick with visual scripting so this is a great course both for absolute beginners who want to start commonly from scratch and also great for more advanced users who want to see more advanced use cases for visual scripting or just want to see how to design and implement some interesting mechanics this complete course is presented as a thorough stepbystep guide where i will show you exactly how to do what i'm doing and why it is that i'm doing it so you can learn how to think like a professional indie game developer every single lecture also includes the complete project files so you can download them and follow along exactly as i'm doing if you feel lost or confused at any point in the course make sure you post your questions and i will be there to help with whatever issues you may have alright so go ahead join me on this course and let's learn how to master visual scripting and build some awesome games together
