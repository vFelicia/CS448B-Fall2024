uh right so please zone get rid of it and nope why did i what did i forget wait oh come on this is that issue oh i remember i remember having this issue quite a couple of years ago and drove me crazy right the issue is that unity doesn't actually refresh the parentchild relationship it doesn't refresh it right away so over here i'm calling destroy but when this ends this guy is still going to be a child of this one i'm pretty sure this is the issue because i'm pretty sure i went crazy with this issue at one point in the past so if i unparent it and then destroy it now the parent list should be correct i hope let me just delete that one there you go down there you go now it does work so that's the issue it's the issue that's drove me crazy so long but yep great there you go another perfect example of the power of experience that's the power of experience because i had that issue where if you destroy it it still counts as being a child so that is why i was doing a refresh then going through all the children and so on and was adding them again because this guy apparently still exists oh boy yeah that's annoying but thankfully yeah so if you ever try to destroy things always know that they're not actually destroyed at least when it comes to parent children relationships so what happened here is if you have a child object and you call destroy it's not really destroyed instantly it still exists and if you check the channel count or cycle through the children it's still there so if your logic is based on the assumption that the channel list is updated instantly just like i was doing here then everything breaks one solution is to manually unparent the object and then let unity destroy that object sometime in the future remember that so you don't go insane just like i did many years ago wondering why a supposedly destroyed object was still alive as a child
