hello and welcome I'm your kudmaki and I've got one month left to finish my game that's one month to take this and turn into a complete polish game so here's all the tasks that I need to do in this time as well as my advice to you for how to finish your games they're only say they set to October 2nd that's going to be the first Monday of October my main advice to you when choosing a launch date for a game is to look at what festivals and sales are going to happen and when you absolutely do not want to launch during a festival or Steam Sale doing that will absolutely kill your game so don't do that so for me date that I picked was for Once Upon reason the next team Festival that is going to happen on the week after that then in midoctober over there you've got Halloween then you've got like Friday then Christmas and New Year and so on so given that for me my goal is to launch a game this year the latest that I can launch is pretty much just that one week so unless something really serious happens something really drastic then that date is probably going to be the date when the game will launch which of course means that the game needs to be done by then with that in mind here's my quick advice to you on how to finish games and my advice is simply just to find an MVP that's a minimum viable product so basically just cut down everything for your game to the absolute Bare Essentials just figure out the absolute minimum thing that fully works as a complete game and focus on doing just that importantly is make sure you do that way before your targeted release date The reason for that is because you want to leave some time for doing nothing but polish it is much much better to have a smaller but highly polished game as opposed to a huge game with tons of content but all of it is very unpublished so for me lately I've been working towards getting that mvp done I actually wanted to get it done by the end of August but of course as always with everything everything takes longer than expected there are three massive tasks that still need to be done in order to make the game complete the first one is the interplay internal Logistics this is what I've been working on for the past few days basically the ability for the player to colonize another planet then being able to set up resource chains and transport resources between the planets then the second massive task this one is commonly reworking the defense mechanics right now the zombies are only extremely basic they just spawn randomly they move towards the dinky and they do an attack I need to rework all of this I'm going to make some fix small points I'm going to set up some wave spawning set up a day night cycle I'm going to set up different zoombies that require a different ammo to kill and so on and of course I'm going to need to make it on work both in the real world and the off world the going was for the player to set up on defenses so that when they're in one world they don't have to worry about the other world and finally the last task is making the intro Mission basically I want the game to start on some kind of spaceship which will teach the player the basic controls as well as work as a sort of mini story now for me I'm definitely not a writer but still it helps to have some kind of basic story to guide the player the players are going to start off in the spaceship learn some basic controls then basically the spaceship is going to crash on the first planet and that's how the game starts probably I think making that little mini intro Mission I think that is going to add some nice structures to the game so those are the three massive tasks that I need to do in order to get the game to a complete state but then after that like I said comes the time for polishing I really need to get those tasks done as soon as possible so I have plenty of time to publish and that's not just visual polish it is also adding all the random features that a complete Game must have for example I want the game to be fully playable with the controller that is something I still need to add with that done then I will also test the game on the sim deck to make sure it also works on there it should be pretty simple once the controller support is already implemented another important thing is localization my advice to you is do not ignore that same is indeed massive but the English audience is actually just a small portion of it so if you just make your game in English you are actually ignoring a huge amount of people that could enjoy your game then the music and sound effects right now it's all super basic pretty much only button sound effects just a single song I definitely need to add a ton more on that and then of course adding in lots of visual polish I've already had a bunch of animations in the last few updates but everything is still a bit way too static I want to add lots of movement to the entire game make it all feel a bunch more alive then making multiplayer work personally is also very important again the game is meant to work both in single player and multiplayer right now the multiplayer isn't working in technical terms but there are a lot of visual effects that the Lions just don't see so I definitely need to fix that then also need to publish in lobby scene right now it's actually still in the exact same same super basic one that I initially made in my free multiplayer course I just copy pasted that entire scene back into this game after that I would also like to add the various theme features so that's adding some achievements trading cards Simplot save possibly adding modding support to the workshop and a bunch more I'm also going to need to make a brand new trailer now for this one I should probably make that one quickly a good trailer held together wish list quite a lot so my advice to you is definitely make sure your trailer and your Capstone both aren't as good as possible and when all of that is done basically I'm going to need to constantly play test the game and balance all the numbers and before release I also want to make a massive updated demo and basically ask all of you to play the game and give me your feedback ideally that should help make sure that the launch version when the game finally comes out that one is as awesome as I can make it and as bug free as possible so I'm looking at this whole list I must say I'm quite a bit stressed right now there's certainly a ton of work to do personally I know that I can be extremely productive when I put my mind to it so in 30 days I do know that I can make a mess amount of stuff for example the interplanetary system that one has been really complex to implement it involved tens of scripts thousands of lines of code it's insanely complex but I didn't manage to get it on working in about a week so looking at that what I can do in 30 days that is quite a nice amount of time but still that is quite a lot of work I really want to make sure that the final game is as excellent as I can make it then in terms of expected results right now the wish list numbers are a bit lower than I would like it doesn't look like it's going to hit the 5K minimum actually the other day someone asked me if it helps when someone has a game to their wish list even if they're not going to buy the game like I said here the answer is yup it does help the most important thing on Steam is just the wrong number of wish lists so a higher amount only to more visibility as the game comes out then after that initial surge steam is going to check the conversion rate and basically if wishlist and just regular sales if the game sold well then it's going to keep promoting the game if not then it's going to basically stop so if someone wishlist but then doesn't buy the game that actually still helps the initial surge even if it doesn't help afterwards but again my hope is that the game is actually good so that if the game gets some visibility from seeing right in the very beginning then then people who have never heard about the game they won't try it out they won't buy it and hopefully enjoy it so that said go ahead and add game to your wishlist if you haven't already now I probably won't hit that 5K minimum however at the same time the goal with this project really isn't massive sales success so I'm okay with that my number one goal when I started this project back in March was simply I want to make a game this year it has been four years since my very last team game which is way too long so for me just completing this project I'm going to consider that a huge success I'm going to keep trying to make regular videos trying to mention the game as much as possible together as many wishlist as I can before the release but the main priority is we're only just making an excellent game even if the sales numbers do end up being low I still really want to make sure that everyone who does play the game has a great time and of course in this channel I also want to really practice what I preach that's another reason why I decided to make this game I want to make sure that when you watch my videos when you follow my tutorials you know that what I'm teaching here comes from actual real world experience so with that I hope you've enjoyed following this journey I hope with these Devils I hope that by hearing my thoughts on these topics I hope it has helped you with your own games with that said now I've got to get back to work so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time
