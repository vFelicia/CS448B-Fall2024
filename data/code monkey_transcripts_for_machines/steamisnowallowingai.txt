hello and welcome I'm your kmy so a while ago there was big news that se was apparently Banning games with AI I made a video on that original story basically there was a game that was clearly using Ai and seemed banded because of it however a game came out right now it's called the finals it is a huge game it is heavily being promoted by Steam and the developers themselves did mention they are using AI specifically for voice generation also back when the news came out people point to this game high on life and how it was also apparently using AI but also was not banned so this leads people to think this one of those cases where triaa devs get an exception and Indie devs get screwed is that really the case is that what is going on here and at appearance the answer is not really but maybe it appears they're mainly just enforcing the same thing they said in the original news which is how they cannot ship games in which the developer does not have all the necessary rights it appears that this is really their main objection to AI it's really just a question about rights and IP and it appears they are enforcing the rule right now as they were back then meaning this game the finals this one is indeed actively using AI they did use voice clones in order to make some more Dynamic voices throughout the gameplay but they also point out how that voice AI has been trained on contracted voice actors which supposedly means that they bought the rights to so supposedly they pay these actors for the en licens to use their voice to generate things and in this scenario there are no copyright issues because they specifically bought those rights however publicly I couldn't actually find any more details on specifically exactly what they licens there's only this vague mention in this interview and really nothing else so it appears that if val did question this game it appears that they managed to convince valve and give them proof that they did actually get the license to be able to use it the other notable example high on life this one apparently cover the walls with midjourney AI art so the question is this legal or not does this give them the right to be able to use them in the game there's been a case going through the course trying to decide that this is legal or not the judge recently dismissed the claims against all of these except for stability AI now I'm really not a lawyer so I cannot analyze exactly what this means I don't think that this means that all a is suddenly all clear I don't think think that's the case from what I understand the general consensus is AI is still very much in a legal gray area so back to the question is team now allowing AI art just for triaa developers in s screwing Indies the answer appears to be simultaneously yes and no based on that legal gray area big devs like for example high on life in the finals these big ones they can apparently convince valve that they do own all the rights to be able to use it and if you can convince them that you do have all the rights then you can use AI but smaller in deps are probably going to have less of a voice so convincing valve is going to be quite a bit more tricky one thing that I've mentioned that I really like about how Unity is specifically going after AI basically they train their models entirely on data and images that they own or license so in theory that means that any outputs from untii those are not going to have copyright issues they have also vowed to help defend people against copyright lawsuits Adobe and various others have also done the exact same thing so technically for some of these tools if you do use them you should be free from copyright issues but at the same time like I said this is a legal gray area if you are a large triple developer CH are you can get a direct contact directly at valve and be able to convince them that you're in the clear but if you are an indie Dev like me someone really tiny with really not much of a voice even if you show them all this and you say that you do own all the copyright you might still be unable to make vum listen to you and the game might still get rejected in the end the question of is steam now allowing AI art the answer is technically yes but also no at the same time if you can prove that you own only the input data sets and technically that is legal and technically you should be able to do it but again that is still very much a legal gray area now if you are a small inde the dev like me then personally I would avoid using it for the most part or maybe sure use it but only from specific places that do mention the source of their input data sets things like unai or adobe Firefly places that make it clear that they technically own all the input so they should own all the copyrights and importantly if you do use it use it in such a way that would be easy to replace if SE had some issues with it for example if I were to use AI art or AI sound or anything with AI in a future project I would simply organize all my project files to very clearly separate what is AI and what is not and then if when I submit my game to see it was rejected due to AI if that happened I would simply replace all that with normal non AI stuff for a tiny IND the dev like me and probably also you that would probably be the best case as opposed to trying to convince Val that you own all the copyrights and if you don't want a then check out the hum bundle with tons of asses and tools all of them made by humans or if you're into the lowly sty check out the C store which is currently having their holiday season sale so if you're looking for non AI assets check out the links in the description so all this is definitely a very interesting topic AI is really not going anywhere so I'm very curious to see how this whole thing how this story how steam AI the legal gray area and all this I'm very curious to see how all this develops in the coming year
