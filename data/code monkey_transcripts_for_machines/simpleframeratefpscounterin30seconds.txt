how to make a simple fps counter the simplest method is with some quick math you already have access to time dot delta time this is the number of seconds in lab since in last frame so with some basic math just divide one by down to time and yep it works that's the most basic method although this one is constantly changing for something a bit more stable you can keep track of multiple frames just making lists to store multiple delta times constantly replace your own values with new ones then calculate the average from all of those and now the frame rate reading is nice and smooth
