hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey if you're a beginner just getting started with Game Dev it can actually be quite overwhelming learning all the different disciplines that are required to make just a single complete Game you basically need to learn how to use the engine then you need to learn programming you need to learn how to do some Art 3D modeling animation sound design music UI ux and so on you need to learn how to make Health Systems level systems pathf finding how to do some artificial intelligence State machines spines water lights World streaming Safe Systems and tons tons more the list for all the things needed to make an entire complete game is nearly endless for a beginner the prospect of having to learn all of this at once just make your very first game can definitely seem quite daunting it is indeed quite a lot of stuff looking at all of this everything that is required to make a game really makes you think how it's actually a miracle how any game ever gets completed personally when it comes to learning I highly recommend you focus on making multiple small games as opposed to just one really massive game and one way to do that to make multiple games quickly is to actually focus on just the unlimited number of all these required skills just focus on Unlimited a number of them instead of trying to learn all of them for your very first project so if you are a beginner and you want to learn how to make games then one option is just make tons and tons of prototypes that's a valid way to learn however I also highly encourage you to take those projects to completion there are so many challenges that really only show up at the end of a project and if all you do is really just prototypes then you're never really going to learn about those so my advice is to make complete games small games of course make them as small as possible and in order to do all of that and still learn my advice is to really just focus on learning a handful of these things per project and then plug your skill gaps with some assets I believe this is a much better approach as opposed to trying to build it all yourself all on your own on your very first project which for the most part usually ends up with really just abandoned projects that's what happens to most people so focusing on learning just one skill per project is probably going to help you actually reach the end and end up with a complete game that you can actually play and for that the SSR is an absolutely invaluable tool to help you make your own games you can get pretty much anything you need whether it be some complex systems some models animations or literally anything there's tons of free stuff and tons of paid stuff Unity sponsored this video because their spring sale has just started which features over 300 of the best assets at 50% off since these are picked from the top assets on the store literally every single one of these is excellent so if you were to just randomly buy something absolutely at random you definitely could not go wrong and on top of the regular discount there are some really awesome Flash Deals at 70% off that refresh every day I highly recommend that you bookmark this page and check it very regularly in order to see if there's anything you want on a really nice see discount all the links are down in the description I'm going to browse the S and highlight my favorite ones that I think you should get in a little bit but before that back to the original topic for example for your first game let's say you'd like to make some kind of souls like Adventure game now making a game like this actually involves quite a lot of disciplines quite a lot of skills so maybe for example for your first project you really just want to focus on your programming skills visuals are actually the easiest thing to pick up from the store so first you need a character it could be straight from this pack in fact with just this one pack you could make all the characters in your your entire game then of course a character is going to need some animations so it could be from this sword animation pack after that you need some kind of environment so you could combine it with this gorgeous medieval castle for something really nice and then games need some kind of enemy so you could grab some enemies from this giant pack put all that together and here is a super simple game that I built myself in a few hours I built this while only focusing on my main skill set programming and using some assets in order to plug my skill gaps you could build this exact same thing yourself either as a complete project or as a learning project by picking up these visional assets you could focus solely on the logic part of making your game and even in terms of logic maybe you want to focus just on something like making a combat system or a wor spawning system meaning you can also get help for building all the other systems so instead of building a health system from scratch you can pick up my own health system asset which is free and it's actually pretty robust then instead of building your own safe system you can use Easy Save which is one of the highest rated asset on the store maybe instead of building your own custom saate machine maybe you could use something like Behavior designer andad of spending a mon of time researching how to do some really efficient really cool destruction instead of all that time you could just buy a tool like rire if you put all of that together you have a really great complete game while also gaining a ton of knowledge in the process as opposed to what I said in the beginning which is if you try doing everything yourself chances are you're probably just going to quit the project Midway through so basally my advice for the beginners is make tons of small games and focus on just learning one specific thing per each game and then use the accur in order to plug your skill apps that's really one of the best ways to use the sess story effectively in your Game Dev Journey or alternatively maybe you just suddenly came up with an interesting game design idea that you want to test out in a prototype really quickly for that you can use the multitude of really excellent game templates on the store like one of the highest rated ones is this one top down engine like name implies this helps you create games from a topown perspective super easily so starting from a template like this one can save you a ton of time you can basically very very quickly just validate your game idea before you end up putting months or years into it these can really help speed up your development at least in the Pro timing stage so perhaps you test out the idea in order to see if it does work and then if it does perhaps you keep building upon it or maybe rebuild everything from scratch both options are perfectly valid but by using these assets this really helps speed up the pro timing stage so you can test and validate your idea again before you put any significant amount of time into it and even for non beginners like myself the ssur is still an invaluable tool the main H case that I mentioned a while ago using it to plug your skill gaps it is absolutely still applicable to non beginners like in my case I'm a programmer that's my skill set I am not an artist I am not a 3D modeler or animator so for my last game than you Gardians the only way that I was able to build that game was by using assets I didn't use that many code assets since that's my main skill set so I built pretty much all the code myself but I absolutely use the accur for pretty much the entire visual side of the game the buildings were from an asset pack then the customizable characters from another one the dinkies also came from a pack and so on I bought all the animations I bought some shaders some particles also use some really super awesome tools to help me polish the game namely feel and text animator if I had not used the ssur at all if I had not used any assets then the game would simply look much worse if I had to make all div Visions myself and also it would have taken 10 times longer since I'm really not as efficient at 3D modeling as a proper 3D modeler so by using assets to plug my skill gaps I was able to work much faster and make a much better game one asset that I've use in pretty much all my seam games is the AAR pathfinding project this is an insanely fast pathfinding asset I starting using it 10 years ago for my game Survivor Squad I use it back then because I need path finding for hundreds of units and back then I did not have the skills to be able to write some efficient multithreaded code however nowadays nowadays I actually do have that skill I could write some preperformance multithreaded pathfinding system if I wanted to but doing so would cost me quite a ton of time and given how I Dre to spend that time doing many other things I really value time more than money I got no problem paying a few bucks to buy an asset that someone already spent a th000 hours building so with assets other than just pluging your skill gaps even if you do have that skill you can still pick up asset to save you a ton of time you can spend just a little bit of money to save thousands of hours and in this specific case I really don't think I even bought this s on a sale so I think I probably paid 150 bucks for it 10 years ago and it has certainly been worth it I mean like I said I've used it in pretty much every single one of my games and throughout all of those I have grossed over a million dollars so spending 150 bucks 10 years ago to allow me to do all this that was definitely a very worthwhile purchase just remember that assets are really just to old to help you make your games if you're making games just for fun if you enjoy doing 3D modeling or programming and your go is simply fun if so then by all means continue building everything yourself but if your main goal is having a complete game at the end then using assets can really help save you a ton of time on that journey and make your game better in the end also let me make just one quick note if you're the kind of person who doesn't want to use assets for fear that players won't turn on you if so then let me point you to a video that I made quite a while ago on that exact topic basically the TDR of that video is players do not care all that players want are really just fun games to play if your game is fun then that's all that matters it does not matter if you bought the assets or you built everything from scratch you don't get bonus points for doing it all yourself in the end really the players just care about the end result they just care that the game is fun to play so definitely go ahead and use every tool that your disposable to make the best game you can make so with that said let's browse the spring cell and I'll tell you which ones I highly recommend that can save you a ton of time right here from the main page now in terms of visuals it's obviously dependent on what style you're going for but if you like low poly personally I'm a huge fan of the cynthian low poly Style or for effects Gabriel has a ton of really awesome partical effects the assd inventory is definitely one excellent tool this one basically lets you easily search upon the thousands of assets that you may have to find very specific things it's especially useful if you like me also bought a bunch of asset packs on Humble Bundle you can import those into this tool and make them easily searchable if you want character customization in your game then I highly recommend this pack this is exactly the same pack that I used in my game dink Guardians and it's also the pack that I included when I made the character customization system you can download the project files for that one which was made exactly using this pack then you can also go watch all of my asset review videos pretty much every single one of these assets is excellent so I can definitely H recommend all of these then in terms of flashh deals I bought this pack ages ago and it has been extremely useful it's got all kinds of animations for all kinds of things I recommend you pick up a giant bundle with tons of assets whenever you need to do some kind of prototype so a pack like this one would be excellent if you want to make open world games and check out Gaia it's what I used last year when I made my open world game I've already mentioned field this is an excellent one for adding all kinds of Polish to your game and text animator which is another must you can very easily make your text come alive so whether you're a beginner or an advanced user I high recommend use the accur to plug your skill gaps do this instead of trying to build everything yourself the spring sale is live right now and this one contains some of the best sets on the store so definitely take advantage of this time if you need anything check the link description and like I said definitely keep a close eye on the flashh deals for those super deep discounts all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
