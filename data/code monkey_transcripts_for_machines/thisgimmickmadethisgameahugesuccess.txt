another interesting game that is finding quite a bit of viral success thanks to its interesting premise is called Rusty's retirement this is a game that you play at the very bottom of your desktop while you're doing other things this feels really like the perfect addition to the idle game genre instead of playing on a second monitor you can play literally at the bottom of your first monitor I think this idea sounds really genius and I'm definitely not alone the game currently has 6,500 followers which likely means over 70,000 wish list so whenever this one does come out it's bound to be a huge hit
