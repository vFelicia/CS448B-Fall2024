hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so recently on Twitter someone pointed me to an interesting post it's all about the notion of clean code and is that something that you need now I spent way too long writing a super big reply so let's see what I said since this is obviously a topic that I'm very passionate about clean code really is the reason why I can make complex games like my upcoming steam game dinky Guardians it has tons of interconnected systems tons of classes events interfaces all of them working seamlessly with one another I could not build this game without a focus on good clean code go ahead and add it to your steam wishlist so the original tweet this says early career people should take time to download and look at the elite Far Cry source code this is apparently something that just leaked someone just put the entire Far Cry source code onto the internet archive I believe so apparently early career people should look at that in order not to learn some new techno lessons but rather to disabuse themselves of the notion of clean code then it goes on to say that the player class is 7 000 lines of code that's definitely huge with a zillion hidden State machines and it did not prevent the game from spawning a build their own franchise and no this is a specific Game Dev I can assure you that almost every successful long surviving code base looks like that so it is definitely a very interesting topic and down here plenty of people are actually agreeing with the sentiment so one related not to programming rather to AAA 3D modeling is to try to rip some models and see how apparently the game topology isn't super great then someone's saying yep there is value in seeing what kind of junk actually ships games so I'm not saying that they reuse it for Far Cry 2 or start from scratch saying Angry Birds was 50 000 lines of code and so on so this one quite a bit of discussion and for me the main thing really is that this tweet makes it seem like link code is something that you shouldn't even worry about at least that's my interpretation of this Suite it kind of means how clean code is apparently unimportant because even without it technically you can make Far Cry which is a super successful game definitely multibuild down franchise and technically you can build that without focusing on clean code and here is my super long tweet basically I just find the original one to be a bit strange like I said my interpretation is that it's saying how you shouldn't worry about clean code because suddenly you can find success with very bad code and can you make a successful game with the ugliest code possible and the answer is of course you can technically you could eliminate all the new lines you could don't Far Cry in a single line of code you could intentionally obfuscate every single variable you could give it just random names you could write the entire thing in just a single class with an entire huge update Loop the compiler really doesn't care about any of it the compiler just takes a code and makes the final executable it does not care about any of this however if you try to do that if you completely ignore every single clean code principle chances are you won't just drown in a mountain of technical debt before ever finishing your game now for me I do get how some people can definitely be quite Zealot when it comes to clean code they follow the rules so rigidly that they completely forget the whole purpose behind those rules do I see it clean code isn't really actually about rules it's more just simple guidelines and the ultimate goal is simply to help you produce better game or software so I would definitely say definitely don't follow the rules so rigidly just focus on using them as guidelines so I can get how some people don't take that too far but then I think that going on on the completely opposite side that is also not very helpful completely devaluing all of those principles that seems insane to me and its core clean code really isn't Magic it won't just magically make your game better or more successful it's really just getting principles meant to help you as a developer meant to help you make your game if you ignore all of those principles that's fine the component doesn't care the code will run exactly the same exactly as you write it so the code won't compound but it will affect you as a developer and you will probably not actually finish your game so should you obsess with writing the most absolute perfect code possible to the point where you are not even making progress you're just focusing on writing good clean code then you don't even care about actually making the game at that point no of course not I think at that point you're kind of going against yourself but on the other hand should you completely disregard any you know clean code senders just because technically you can find success without worrying about it and personally no I don't think that's wise as with so many things common sense is really the main thing don't obsess over writing perfect code your code does not have to be perfect but at the same time don't completely ignore it and live in a terrible code base that will also not help you as a developer another example is actually sunless which sold millions of copies super highly successful game and that is another one where a few years ago the developer actually shared the movement code and that involves a massive 5000 line player class in only it's messy and mostly undocumented Glory so this is another thing that when they posted this people did indeed point out how this isn't the best or cleanest code in the world and once again some people who are a bit way too intense about this topic they took this as a way to say negative things about the game just because the code quality isn't supposedly perfect and definitely ignore the ultimate goal which is the game came out and it was massively successful so you have some positive comments this makes me feel better about my code I know it can be embarrassing but it's nice to see even the best devs can still write messy code and yep again that is true the ultimate goal is actually make your game actually finish your game try to keep your code quality as high as possible but the main goal is still just finishing the game and this thread was five years ago so there's a bunch of them deleted posts someone saying Jesus what an if else monster so yes unless is an interesting example where it shows you how you can write bad code and you can't find success so that seems to sort of prove the original post but thinking about it in that way makes me think of the maximum correlation is not causation so the fact that it's less on millions of copies that is now related to a massive 5000 lens of code method rather it found success because the developer is actually very skilled and managed to actually build the game despite having that much complexity so in the end your code absolutely does not need to be perfect so if you're just getting started and you're concerned about the quality of your code as long as you are making an effort to actually try to produce good code I would say you're doing very well the first goal is really it just has to work but at the same time the the year the code that you write the harder it is to get it to actually work so for me the number one goal is complete the game and a close second one is simply keep code quality as good as possible in order to actually make it easier on me to actually complete the game in the end basically my advice to you is focus on actually making your game that's the number one goal actually complete your game and clean code is simply a set of guidelines a set of principles to help you actually achieve that so don't obsess over making the absolute perfect cone but at the same time don't completely ignore it to the point where you might actually never end up finishing your game and if you want to learn more about clean code I highly recommend you follow my free complete course it's on making an interesting game and throughout it I'm constantly emphasizing the value of writing good clean code or if you're a more advanced user then check out my turnbased strategy course again the only way to build the game as complex is that one is to focus on writing high quality clean code just like I teach in that course alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
