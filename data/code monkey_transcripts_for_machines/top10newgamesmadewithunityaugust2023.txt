hello and welcome I'm your code monkey now before I start this video given everything that is going on I feel the need for a quick disclaimer whatever you think of unity as a company don't take it out on these devs making awesome games whatever the company behind does the tool itself is still excellent when put in the hands of self creators I've been making this series covering the top new games every month and I plan to continue doing it for as long as devs are building awesome things with the engine and here let's check out the top new games made with the UNT launch on August 23. this was another Banker month really tricky to pick just 10 games I guess a lot of Indies wanted to quickly launch in August before star film took up everyone's time in September this month the first game is a really great story of a small Indie Dev finding massive success and then the last game that one is another absolutely excellent game but suddenly also comes with some bad news the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out the test all of these games are unically impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also I'm currently working on my own Sim game Thinking Guardians it's a fun game with automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you can build a colony you can automate it and keep the tiny defense on Slinky safe from harm there's a freedom where you can try out the release date is happening just next month so go ahead add it to your wishlist and phone for that ones alright so starting off at number 10 with a really awesome game made by a fellow gamedev YouTuber Jonas Tyrone despite being so young he has already had such an interesting career first he made a huge hit with unity with the game Islanders then he switched the game maker for Willing snail and now he's back to Unity with throngfall the game is a minimalist tower defense game basically they took the genre to its Bare Bones Basics and made that really satisfying you build up your Colony build some Mills together gold build some houses for troops use the coins to build up your Castle build some defenses gather more resources and create your army then the Night Comes the enemies attack and you can defend either by yourself or with your army it's a very minimalist but very satisfying game and it's already a massive hit over 5 000 extremely positive reviews even though it it's only an early access that means it has probably sold already over 150 000 copies meaning already past 1 million dollars in Revenue I've picked the game myself both to support Jonas and because it actually looks right up my alley I can't wait to find time to play it and if you're wondering is the game ahead just because of his YouTube channel the answer is not exactly I mean the channel certainly helps his devlogs are excellent and they get tons of views but more importantly his game really blew up in the last team nextfest he literally got a hundred thousand wishlists thanks to an excellent demo so if you doubt the power of steam festivals and wishlists and this is Clear Proof of just how much it matters so really huge congrats to Jonas this is a welldeserved massive hit on an excellent game next for an interesting one here is I am future a cozy apocalypse survival nowadays it's really hard to come up with a good name for a game but for this one the name really says it all it hooks you right away cozy apocalypse survival that's certainly a very unique twist despite being an unboxing lips game it looks very jolly very inviting with some very English Greenery it is also set on top of a skyscraper so that's an another thing that makes it quite unique among the Sea of survival games you can do some cooking some resource Gathering do some crafting farming fishing and so on so all the usual stuff then you can also create some robots and have them do all the work when they relax so it also has some nice automation elements and then you can explore this world and uncover the mystery behind why the apocalypse happen this is definitely a great fresh take on a very saturated genre it is out now in Early Access with already over a thousand very positive reviews then for a very dark ingredient in the sequel here is Blasphemous too it's a difficult punishing dark and greedy to the metroidvania if you like gorgeous pixel art then you will definitely enjoy this one it's got some really gorgeous art and animations the game also has some great 2D size rolling action people refer to this one and the prequel as 2D Dark Souls you can customize and improve your skill set you can equip various weapons and Master on the attacks you explore this huge unique world and engage in intense Boss Battles the story continues from the first one so you should probably play that one first if you're into the story but if you're just into 2D science rolling zones like gameplay then you can probably just jump into this one it is actually surprisingly expensive for a 2d size rolling game it's 30 bucks but it also already has over 2500 very positive views so it seems like the price is very well Justified next for something full of color here is Bomb brush cyberfunk this one is somewhat of a spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio you can immediately see that just by looking at a screenshot that's actually one game that I as a kid I thought was really awesome and I really wanted to play it but I never had a Dreamcast so I couldn't in this one you can ride a skateboard a bike or rollerblades you complete awesome tricks get tons of sound points paint some graffiti do some break dancing and fight the military police honestly there's actually something that I would have guessed is very Niche but apparently not it's already a huge hit with over 5000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so if you're looking for something pretty unique then definitely give this one a shot then if you want some super fastpaced action check out turbo Overkill nowadays there are quite a lot of Boomer Shooters and this one seems like an absolutely excellent one it is extremely fast paced really nonstop moving and shooting you can do on Wheels SMGs you can pick up some powerful shotguns or some huge rockets and take out tons of enemies there's lots of bullets and blood flying all over the place the environments also seem extremely unique some look like hell so something straight out of Doom but others look like outer space and some look straight out of cyberpunk it can also drive a motorbike do some cool slides and shoot at the same time so if you're into this genre definitely go ahead and give this a try it already has over 3 000 overwhelmingly positive views so this one is a huge hit and people love it for some VR here is a curious one with a strange name it's called project third eye it's a VR physics interaction game with lots of player creativity so you've got regular shooting like normal but then you can also pick up some planks of wood and connect them together then you can pick up a circuit board you can attach it to the object and write some logic using some nice visual scripting it's certainly an interesting idea that has potential anytime you had code mixed with some objects it always makes for some interesting stuff although the reviews mention how it's a bit Bare Bones right now it's out in Early Access so perhaps keep an eye on this one over the coming months next if you're into nice airships and RPGs here is black scallions it's a topdown open world Airship management and combat game you fly around in your Airship and rescue friends or fight enemies you can pick from dozens of unique weapons choose from regular rifles or some special unique lighting weapons you also have different ships to choose from so will you pick something that is fast and Nimble or something slow and Powerful gather some resources and use them to upgrade your ship and your weapons explore a huge open world and liberate each island one by one while also encountering some unique missions and some unique NPCs visually it's got some really great gorgeous pixel art I especially love the explosions really bright very fiery personally I'm also always very interested to see in this second open world games so this is definitely appealing to me it has just graduated from Early Access and it's got over 1500 very positive reviews then for something that was already a huge hit and finally came to PC it's Marvel snap you've probably already heard of it it's one of the biggest mobile hits of the past few years personally I don't normally game on my phone but I've been interested in everything that I've heard about this game so I'm definitely happy to see it on PC the game itself is a card game with tons and tons of Marvel characters everything from the super popular ones is some very Niche very underground ones you collect all the heroes from the entirety of Marvel so that's really hundreds of unique superheroes and characters upgrade your cards head up your deck and do battle with other players as a Dev I would say you should probably play this game if not just to study the excellent polish every action in this game looks so extremely satisfying the cards are gorgeous very well built and every action is filled with excellent animations and effects it is free to play which for me is usually a bad thing but from what I've heard the monetization on this one seems pretty well done it is out now on seam and already has 17 000 very positive reviews then if you're into gorgeous adventure games here is a guidebook of Babel I really like the style on this one hand drawn in a really nice way you walk around and explore this world talk to NPCs and pick up quests to hunt them in their hour of need search for for Clues put together clues in your notebook and solve the mystery then go back in time and prevent the problem from ever happening however in doing so that will actually create a butterfly effect with lots of unintended consequences so the next time you go through the story things are going to be slightly different definitely seems like a very inventive mechanic for an adventure game it is out now with 300 reviews at 98 positive so if you're a fan of this genre then definitely this looks like a great new one and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is Shadow Gambit the curse crew this is by the same developer that made Shadow tactics Blades of the Shogun and the really excellent Desperados 3. I finally got the time to play that one last month and I absolutely loved it I love these games I don't love this developer if you're not familiar these are stealth Action games you control a group of unique characters each with unique abilities all the enemies have their Patron routes they have very strict view cones and a very strict set of rules basically it's a game of perfect information there's no Randomness you can assess the world make a plan and execute if you're good you won't succeed right away but at the same time if you fail that's all right failure is absolutely part of the game that is why the game has a super fast quick save and quick load system you are supposed to do a quick save then try out your plan and if it fails you can either try to continue or simply quick move personally I always get stressed when I play some self games because failure is usually very punishing so I do love this system it feels absolutely excellent to queue up some actions on multiple characters then press a button to execute them all at once and watch as your plan goes to Perfection this one is all about Pirates and lots of awkward elements it is not meant to be realistic like their previous games which really allows them to play with some more otherworldly elements and abilities it is out now with 1500 reviews at 95 positive so this is a huge hit and people love it although even though this game is excellent sadly it comes with some bad news the developer actually disbanded right after release it looks like it's owned well and in the final message they mentioned how they're actually paying a bonus to their workers based on the profits so suddenly it just seems like the reason is making a game of this quality is really difficult especially on such a niche genre even though the final result is excellent it does seem like it took quite a bit of tone on the developers personally as someone who doesn't really have worklife balance I can definitely sympathize with that I can admire their decision to Value the wellbeing of the team as opposed to starting on another massive project right away while at the same time I'm very sad that they shut down there's no one else making games in this excellent but very nice genre and they had completely mastered it so I really wish the best to the rest of the team who knows maybe some of these Sim members will take that bonus and start their own Studio to continue this Legacy alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with the Indian launch in August 23 I hope this list on DC how DMT engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just your own skills and Imagination check out my own gaming Guardians and edit your wishlist
