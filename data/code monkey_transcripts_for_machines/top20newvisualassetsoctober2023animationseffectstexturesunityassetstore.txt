colonize other planets gather more resources with the ultimate goal of colonizing every planet and automating everything so your dinkies can just relax it is out now on seam I really hope you like it and please make sure the WR review also the SSR is having a bunch of asset on sale for just 20 bucks you've got an AI beh Behavior tree there's a really nice Samurai animation pack a really gorgeous medieval UI kit there's a pack with a ton of cartoony VFX over here is a multiplayer drifting game template there's a climbing parkour system like assassin's screen and tons tons more stuff there's over 250 HS on sale so if there's anything on your wish list check to see if it's discounted all right so starting off with the latest cyti asset called Dark Fantasy right away I love this one I must say my favorite theme of pretty much anything is basically medieval fantasy so basically Lord of the Rings and yep for that this one is absolutely perfect it has got their signature excellent style this is one of those massive packs with over 600 unique prefabs there's lots of characters character attachments there's tons of props environment weapons and even some modular buildings naturally you can expand this even further with some of their similar packs like for example the also excellent Elven Realms pack then if that's a bit too dark and you want something a bit more Jolly here's a really nice dinosaur pack it's got some very cute cartoony creatures and if cute is what you need then these come in all shapes and sizes including from fully grown to Tiny adorable babies so right away looking at this makes me want to make some kind of zoo tycoon game where you can breed and grow dinosaurs one game I loved as a kid was called safari Tycoon I'd love to make something like that with a pack like this one it includes 64 dinosaurs all of them with 6 anation and all sharing just one texture next for some particle effects here's a really nice one with a bunch of them that are meant for characters they are made with the VFX W so they look absolutely excellent all the effects apply perfectly to the mesh so as the character moves and animates the effects follow along with it the fire effect looks absolutely excellent the smoke effect also looks great following the movement perfectly they all have tons of parameters so you can get them looking exactly as you need them then if you need a super high quality weapon check out this one it's technically just one weapon but in reality it's all modular so you can make it look like many different unique weapons the models are extremely detailed with some 4K high resolution texture all the parts are separated which also makes it animation ready so you can very easily animate any single part it also includes a variety of grips stocks magnifiers muzzles and more if you want you can look at my own weapon attachment system tutorial to see how you could add something like this to your game next for something a bit more fun here are some dance moves and yep it's exactly what you expect this could be a great addition if you have some sort of scene in your game that is inside a nightclub and you basically need some background characters to be doing something or perhaps this could also be useful if you're making some DDR or Just Dance inspired game definitely a unique pack but if you need some club dance moves then yep there it is then if you'd like to make some kind of factory game here is a nice bag to help you get starting it contains a whole bunch of machines and belts it's a pretty cheap Pack so it's a perfect starting point you've got six unique machines all of them look really nice all of them with some great animations they look really nice and Casual so nothing too serious and if you like this style then this dev has a ton more in a similar Style if you need some UI check out this wooden pixel art pack it's got lots of icons backgrounds frames buttons and Sliders all of them looking really wooden exactly as you expect so I could see this being great for some kind of forest tycoon game or perhaps simply something like an old school MMO those used to have some UI sort of like this one then from something pixel art to something a lot more futuristic here is a SciFi heavy station it's a really really high quality model it includes both the exterior and the interior you've got lots of rooms displays beds you've got a mes hle a command center and a bunch more so basically if you've been playing Starfield and you want to make something similar to it then this would be a great fit then for some more cozy Interiors here is a giant mega pack this one is definitely huge over 350 interior assets all of them look really nice and cozy you've got plenty of sofas a bunch of desks cupboards appliances and more so this would obviously be perfect for some kind of game inspired by The Sims now if that's a bit too calm for you you then check out this awesome fighter animation pack you've got some really great animations there are some regular realistic ones like some basic punches and then you've got some that go really crazy you could just take this add some particle effects and some flying enemies and you can make something really awesome with this one and again this Dev is also really prolific so if you like this pack then this dev has tons more next if your game has character customization then check out this one basically it's a modular character creator this pack is actually a bundle which includes several others so for a total of over 2,000 modular pieces that's pretty much a near infinite endless amount of variation being low poly also means you can easily recolor eyesee them for even more variation the characters can look either regular or very cyberpunk like it includes all the parts as well as some premade icons for all of them so that alone really saves you a bunch of time then for a single really high quality character check out this demon creature certainly looks very demonlike I could see this being taken straight from the most recent Doom it's a super high qual quity model basically if you have a game with demons then this would fit perfectly next for some more particles here is a pack with a ton of SZ explosions personally I always love SZ explosions they always look so good this one has 37 prefabs everything from some regular explosions a bunch of air explosions and even some really intense nukes so for example if you'd like to make a stylized Oppenheimer game then maybe this would be perfect for you this Dev Gabriel he has tons more VFX pack so if you like this style then check out his full page or perhaps you're into something a bit more pirate like if so check out this one it's a really nice pirate Village quite a large pack with hundreds of props dozens of characters and some really great looking ships this one looks great in both daytime and nighttime if you're working on a 2d side scroller check out these awesome cityscape backgrounds it's got lots of layers for a really nice Parallax effect I can see this one being perfect for some kind of beat them up game where you have a section where you fight on a car or really just could be a simple cut scene seen on a story heavy 2D game or maybe you need something in a steampunk style if so check out this one it's another huge pack with over a th000 objects obviously it's got lots of gears and some very all looking objects so this is one of those packs where with all of these parts you can build an entire huge world with just this one pack then if you need a spooky Dark Forest check out this one it's very high quality this is an hrp scene it's a Prem massive scene with some outside and some Interiors of some catacombs or a spooky church so I could see this one being great for some kind of game inspired by Elden ring next for a nice stylized character here is a great Anubis great looking cartoony character so this could be taken straight from the game Smite it includes a character and over two dozen animations so this could be either your player or maybe some enemy then if you're making something with some highend visuals themed in ancient Rome then check out this one it's a gorgeous looking very high in scene it's a temple SL city with a bunch of fire in construction basic it looks like something bad has just happened looking at this one it looks like this one could be taken straight from the gorgeous game rice and of Rome which personally I really enjoy that game but if you're more into scifi then check out this pack with a ton of gorgeous battleships it's got some realistic scifi visuals features 25 spaceships almost 30 turrets and a whole bunch of structures for making some nice space environments I can see this one being great for some kind of realistic space Sim maybe something like Elite dangerous or Star Citizen all right so those are my top 20 new visual assets on the unsur for October 23
