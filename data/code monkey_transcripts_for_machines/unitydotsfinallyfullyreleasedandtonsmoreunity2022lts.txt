hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and the time has finally arrived I've been waiting for this moment for years and now it's finally here Unity dots has been officially released so look at this awesome thing here I have Unity 22 LTS with dots and sound do you notice anything different the answer is on the top right corner the preview packages warning they used to be there is gone because of the dots packages they are now phone production ready it has been five years since dots was announced all the way back in 2018 after lots of work lots of iteration it's awesome that we have finally reached production ready I'd like to say congrats to everyone on the unity dots theme for getting this far this was a massive undertaking it's a completely different way of making games which will enable so many possible scenarios but while it is completely different it also integrates very well with the regular game object workflow so keep that in mind you don't have to go full dots or full game objects you can mix them both so that means keep using Game objects for regular stuff and then dive into dots for really performance intensive applications with 1.0 Out means that you can now safely start using it in your own projects and at the same time this is really just the beginning now that the core is nice and stable we will start to see dots be implemented into all kinds of backend tools for example the 2D ik package has already benefited from the burst compiler so even if you don't directly use entities you will still be benefiting from this deck so this is really awesome I'm definitely very excited for the future that to me is the biggest feature of unity 22lts which is out right now but there's tons more stuff this is their longterm support version which is the version you should be using most the time it has the most stability and the fact that dots is out now in this version means you can expect dots to be stable I did a really detailed tutorial a few months ago when version 1.0 was out in preview now I need to get back to it and research to see what has changed since then I've been waiting for years to really dive deep into dots I was waiting for 1.0 to be stable so I can start making tons of videos that won't be updated in a few weeks so I definitely want to do that perhaps a mini course on making a fun dots project but at the same time right now I'm actually currently super busy working on my steam game dinky Guardians go ahead and edit your wishlist so so it's kind of a bit tricky to find the time but I'll try my best to at least do a quick intro on dots 1.0 Beyond dots Unity sponsored this video to let you know about all of the awesome additions in version 22 onts which has just released there's also going to be a multihour live stream on the 22nd covering all about the 22 LTS version you can sign up with the link in the description so on this version also related to dots is the net code for entities package this is their networking Library based on entities you might know all about netcode for him objects I made a phone free course on making multiplayer games using that onset so NGO that one is primarily meant for small scale coop games whereas netcode for entities this one is meant to support really super fast paced super optimized games so things like fastpaced Shooters kind of like Apex Legends that's the kind of thing that netcode for entities is perfect for so super fast latency or really intense multiplayer games with tons of network objects all of them all over the place and of course this one is just a networking layer so on top of netcode for entities you can use all of the other Unity multiplayer tools just like you can use them in netcode for game objects so you can add Lobby you can add relay you can Implement Matchmaker or game server hosting all of that can work with that netcode for game objects or netcode for entities then Unity agrp continues to push visual Fidelity to the max now for me I normally just stick with urp but looking at these updates really makes me want to use a little bit of egrp you can now create some really awesome looking volumetric fog and volumetric materials making something volumetric always makes them look really excellent the new water system is also extremely impressive you can create oceans or rivers and make them look really stunning it features some realistic waves with Ripples and foam also has some really nice underwater caustics some reflection and refraction so tons and tons of features another awesome volumetric feature are the new Cloud layers they look extremely realistic they block the light just like you expect you can easily and smoothly transition from nice and sunny to dark and cloudy this is one feature that really helps set the mood for your game looking at all of these awesome tools really makes me wish urp had these features as well technically for an alternative to the water system you can pick up the water Shader from the boat attack demo that one also looks great and for volumetric fog they have it on their private board as under consideration so if you'd like it to have that then go on to that page and vote for it although personally on that page I'm much more interested in screen space Reflections I think this is something the engine would really benefit from but now let's take a look at what urp got in this latest version because it still did get lots of awesome stuff one big one is forward plus rendering which eliminates the enlightened limit so you can have as many lights as you want this is really useful especially for Big scenes where you want to use realtime lights and don't want to be limited to just a handphone my question on this is of course what kind of performance does this bring I really hope it's not a big hit another great but very invisible addition is LOD Crossfade if you've played any game then you've certainly seen some models change drastically which can really ruin the immersion only Crossfade makes that change almost invisible this allows you to have many more lods which in turn makes your game much more performant whilst not suffering from that janky visual stuttering like I said it's a very invisible addition but definitely a very important one then they have also added support for temporal antialiasing basically this uses the camera motion vectors to smooth out the changes over time this is especially noticeable in dark scenes with lights with other techniques you can sometimes see the lights flickering whereas when using TAA that really helps solve that by taking the previous frames into account which makes the end results look really nice and smooth another awesome highly requested feature is the count layers decals are a great way to add a lot more light to your levels by placing down some blood splatter or maybe some bullet holes or just Place coins everywhere in your level and now you can use decal layers to make sure the decals only apply to the objects you want so you no longer have issues with the character being hit by the decal another really awesome one that I've wanted to use for quite some time is the ShadowCraft full screen masternode previously in order to do full screen effects with shade graph it required some very weird hacks but now it's super easy you just change the master node and you can easily use the entire power of Shader graph to make some really awesome full screen effects so you can now easily make effects like wobbling the screen make the solve make a zoom paint it red really anything you could do with ShadowCraft like for example all the various tutorials that I covered in my playlist of that you can now do as a full screen effect which is really awesome then some more additions they added Shader variant prefiltering this one improves build times which is always great for improving iteration speed especially on consoles and mobile and the builtin converter also got some upgrades to make it easier to upgrade from a previous project another really awesome tool is the splines package now I looked at this one when it first came out and it was super basic but looking at it right now they have added a massive amount of features it's really impressive with so many use cases you can easily create and position splines you can add new points anywhere in the curve in any way you want the contextual tools make it really easy to modify any point in any way you want you can parent the splines you can create various branches and really do anything you can think of then using that spline shape you can add some components on top to do things like spawn a prefab along the spline or perhaps extrude the mesh to make some pipes or some roads or maybe animate an object along the spline so really tons of possible use cases and the API is also nice and exposed so you can build your own tools on top of this there's no need to build your own spline package honestly I'm really impressed with this one I hadn't looked at it since release and it's amazing how far it's come then another core pillar of unity is just how many platforms it supports whatever you build with unity you can make a build for whatever device exists in the world that can be mobile console desktop XR it's really amazing how Unity supports so many platforms you just build your game once and you can put it anywhere now for Windows and Xbox they have added improvements to dx12 this one of those things where it's always great to have an option to just flip a switch and immediately get free performance then they also added Ray tracing support for Xbox series X and S and PS5 so if your game is pushing visuals to its limits and this is definitely something you can now add the incremental player build process this one has also been really useful personally I've experienced this myself when I was making the multiplayer course which did require making tons of builds usually making a build would take some like 30 seconds to maybe a minute whereas now thanks to this one it was really awesome to be able to make a build and test in about 510 seconds again iteration speed is so important in Game Dev so this feature this one is really awesome for Android games there's now a package from arm to help you access some low level data for Samsung phones you can now use adaptive performance with support for visual scripting and something that I didn't even know was possible is webgl apparently now supports native C plus plus multithreading I I'm not too familiar with this area but this seems insane to me webgl always has performance issues so with this with multithreading I wonder just how big this is going to be and of course if you're into XR they made tons of improvements to their XR interaction token I have to say XR is a topic that I've been meaning to look at for a long time it's a very interesting space and it might be about to blow up if Apple does indeed announce their device soon so this one area that I really need to find the time to research and that's the general highlights for this Unity 21ts version again the onts is the most stable version so it's one you probably should be using in most cases even if you're making just a game Jam I would probably still use this version unless there's something specific you need that only exists on the next version of course this version is what I'm using for my steam game which I'm planning to launch in two months you want to always be using the LTS version for maximum stability when you release something this version is supported for two years and going back to the beginning with this release with dots with that one finally being production ready after so many years that means you can now expect it to be stable and you can start to use it in your own project with confidence as for me I definitely want to dive deep into dots I just need to find the time to research it while also continuing to work on my game let me know in the comments any specific dots content you'd like to see I'd like to look into making perhaps a Basics video just going over the Core Concepts then perhaps one exploring some Acer pathfinding with dots just like I did in a long time ago or perhaps convert some of my games to dots I've definitely got tons of ideas but you'll let me know what you would like to see now if you want to learn more about the 22 LTS version check the link in the description you can check out the roadmap they present at gdc23 and there's going to be a multihour live stream on the 22nd so definitely check that out for a deeper dive into all of these tools alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
