hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and it's finally here unity's official multiplayer networking solution is finally fully released netcode for gameobjects has been in development for a long time it's been in 1.0 preview for several months and now it's finally out of preview along with that there's also some exciting news regarding multiply which is dedicated servers as well as matchmaking and there's also a bunch of new awesome samples so in this video let's go through the news and see everything that just came out and i'm also currently working on a really indepth stepbystep tutorial to get started with multiplayer so stay tuned for that tutorial next week okay so multiplayer it's finally here the official name is netcode for game objects this is now unity's official networking solution it actually used to be called the ml api before unity bought them a few years ago so even though this is a new release this has already been in development for a really long time so it's already an extremely stable netcode stack in fact they actually spent the last 8 months just fixing up this 1.0 release just making sure that everything was perfect before fully releasing to everyone and now that time has finally come so you can go ahead into the unity netcode page to check out all of the documentation this is a midlevel networking library it is designed to give you a nice level of abstraction so you don't have to worry about things like packets sockets connections and whatnot you just focus on actually building your multiplayer game it easily lets you keep your game simulation synchronized with support for scene management animations physics and several tools to diagnose problems netcode for game objects is primarily designed to support relatively small scale coop games so think games along the lines of overcoat the mungus stardew valley animal crossing and so on it supports some of the latest lts version so version 2020 2021 and it works on all platforms so mobile pc consoles xr and so on the only exception is webgl since there's apparently some issues with accessing ip sockets but there's also a workaround if you absolutely need webgl along with netcode4gameobjects is unity transport which is the default underlying transport layer this is what actually manages the udp connections to send and receive packets so technically you could just use this you could just use the transport layer to handle some nongame connections yourself this is a really interesting topic that i very much would like to research just making some nongamelike applications with unity and handling some multiplayer connections that should be interesting or alternatively you can also use whatever transport layer you want really this whole thing netcode for game objects some of the ugs tools and so on all of it is built in a really nice modular way so you can mix and match and use whatever tools you want it's really awesome if you can't wait for my video next week to get started then go ahead and check out the official docs they are super detailed really easy to use so if you want go ahead and start learning for yourself along with the docs another excellent learning tool are the awesome samples these are complete fully featured games where you can download and inspect all of the source code to see how they all work there are two new samples that just came out and a massive update so they are a massive battleground game sample a 2d multiplayer sample and a 3d coop game the update is for the boss room sample which is the 3d coop game again they've also been working on this symbol for a real long time they're essentially dog fooding their own networking stack by testing it with this game it's a coop game with up to four players so you have multiple characters in a nice dungeon setting a bunch of enemy goblins are spawned and it's up to you and your friends to defeat them and the game also includes a pretty nice boss fight again the main purpose of this is as an educational tool so all the source code is available so if you want to know for example how the boss fight works in multiplayer you can go ahead and check the code if you want to learn how they spawn the goblins again go ahead and check the code this sample also shows you how to use lobbying relay to handle your multiplayer connections i've been using this sample myself to learn netcode for gameobjects and it's been really useful i might do a dedicated video just doing a deep dive on this project it really is quite interesting but that project has also been around for quite some time so if you're looking for something completely new you have the new galactic kitten sample this one is a 2d multiplayer game again it's using netcode for game objects and this project is actually quite a bit simpler which is great for learning so again you can just download the entire project and check out all the source code and being in 2d this one is an excellent reference if you want to learn how to synchronize sprite animations to the movement and so on finally there's another brand new 3d really awesome sample called br 200 this one is a fully working 200 player battleground game sample really massive now like i mentioned netcode for game objects is primarily meant for small scale games so this one is not using it instead it's using photon fusion for the networking but also makes use of multiplayer for the dedicated servers and matchmaker so again another great example of how you can use all of the various modular tools in unique ways this game is really fast paced you have several modes deathmatch elimination and battle it showcases the use of multiple weapon systems there's projectile weapons hitscan and throwballs of course it features a shrinking area unlike any battleground there are moving platforms item boxes there's also recoil patterns and recall compensation and it even has a jet pack again all of this all of these features were on working in multiplayer in a fastpaced game and again it's a camellia free downloadable project so you can download it to see how all of this works and netcode for game objects also easily integrates with all of the various unity gaming services tools if you don't know about ugs you can go watch my video on it there's tons of tools about 30 of them all of them do really useful things that can really help you out so again go watch that video for a quick overview of all those tools the important ones related to netcode is relay and lobby lobby is how you can create public and private lobbies for your players to find each other and relay is how you can connect your players together without having to worry about things like firewalls or not punch through i'm going to cover both of them and how to use them with netcode for game objects in the full tutorial next week the news today is that multiplayer and matchmaker two of the ugs tools they now have selfserve options meaning that previously you had to manually contact unity if you wanted to use those tools but now you can just sign up and start using them multiplayer is a dedicated server it's how you can run your dedicated servers on the cloud or anywhere else for example it's what apex legends uses so based on that if it can handle a massive game like apex it can certainly handle your game and matchmaker is lightning pi is all about matchmaking so you give it a bunch of parameters a bunch of players and matches players with one another also related to it is vvox which also has selfserve this is a voice and text communication tool so it allows you to chat with your players or speak with voice between them and again this one is also a tool that apex legends uses and finally also related to multiplayer is the code for entities or the dots ecs netcode as you might know entities or ecs is currently in development and there's also a netcode stack for handling just those entities but just like with ecs itself this one is still an experimental the entities package is scheduled to come out of preview by early next year the main goal with this netcode stack is that this one is being designed to handle massive games with a very large number of networked objects alright so the wait is finally over netcode4gameobject is here it's fully released and ready for you to use so if you've ever wanted to make a nice multiplayer game then now is the time for me i haven't done anything in multiplayer in many years so i'm definitely looking forward to this like i said i'm currently working on a really detailed stepbystep tutorial so stay tuned for that video next week and after that video i have also got tons of multiplayer ideas that i'd love to explore so let me know in the comments what sort of multiplayer topics you'd like to see me cover alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
