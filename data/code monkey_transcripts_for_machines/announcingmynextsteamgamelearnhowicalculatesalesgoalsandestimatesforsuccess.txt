hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and I have a pretty big announcement as you can see by the title on this video some of you might already know what it is since I did quite a bit of work during my live streams in this video let's check out what I've been working on how I decided upon this game idea what my plan is and also importantly my estimates hopes and goals for this project it's going to be really fun when the game is out to look back and see if my estimates were correct and I will also talk about how I calculate the costs to figure out what I need to do in order for the game to be successful but first here's the quick announcement trailer foreign all right so as you can see that is going to be my next team game it's called total warm Liberation it's a game with tons of systems it's open world survival crafting automation building and it's all turn based think something along the lines of XCOM but mainly on a persistent open world meaning there are no loading screens no instance missions so all of that coupled with some survival crafting building and automation mechanics and like I've mentioned so many times nowadays in order for your games to be successful you need to announce quickly and start Gathering wish lists so that's why I've been working on this for quite a while but only now officially announce it now that the steam page is available so go ahead and pause the video click the link in the description and add the game to your wish list also hit the follow button if you want to make sure that you don't miss out any devlogs wish lists are the main way that the steam algorithm helps you more wishlists always increase your chances of success So speaking to you as a Game Dev instructor I'm teaching you to announce quickly and encourage your players to add the game to their wish list and now speaking to you as a Game Dev myself I'm asking you to add my game to your wishlist as to how this idea came about in the beginning of the year I thought to myself that I'd love to start working on my next team game in the second half of this year my last game battle round Tycoon came out all the way in 2019 which was ages ago I really want to get back to working on a longer project and earlier this year I also spent five months building a complete turnbased strategy course so after the course was done I started thinking and quickly Came Upon the idea of why don't I take what I've built in the course and continue expanding upon it to make it a proper game I think this is also an excellent thing in terms of teaching so you can see how you can take the knowledge that you gain from a course and build something unique on top of it and of course I won't be posting regular devlogs as I build the game so it will hopefully be very educational and entertaining to follow this journey until the final game I will be talking about all of the systems that I build making Standalone tutorials on anything that I research for the game and perhaps the most important part of all talking about the marketing efforts one of the most important videos that I've made on this channel is the video where I talk about the most important thing in Game Dev definitely go watch that video If you haven't seen it basically the most important thing is marketing nowadays having a good game is not enough you definitely need to promote the game Steam won't do that job for you and in terms of marketing you can also make it easier or harder depending on the game idea that you choose so I spent in last few months thinking about what I could build based on the course game something that could do well in today's market in thinking about that thinking about how to find a unique hook for the game I thought about a bunch of ideas one video that I also encourage you to watch is by Ryan Clark on how to come up with good hooks basically to make a good hook you need some uniqueness but also enough familiarity it cannot be something completely unique but it also cannot be something that brings nothing new so first of all I started thinking something simple so just something like XCOM with some zombies just a wave defense game very basic idea nothing really unique no unique hook then I thought why don't I try making something with some automation elements making a turnbased factory automation game would certainly be a unique idea but I also wanted to keep some combat some zombies and then I also would very much like the idea of exploring how to make a huge open world with some building mechanics to allow the player to expand make outposts and so on so I was thinking about something like four different ideas and I was having trouble on how to add a specific hook to each of those until I suddenly thought well why don't I make the hook simply the idea of combining a ton of genres ton of systems so that's the example what I did right in the trailer and in the steam description I mentioned the huge mix of genres along with all of these systems and all the things you can do that is the main hook of the game lots of Interlocking Systems which I hope is interesting enough to grab some attention the game that I'm picturing in my head doesn't look pretty fun to play so I'm hoping I'll be able to build it all and make something really awesome again back to talking to you as a gamedev instructor with regards to marketing technically you can publish your steam page with just five screenshots you don't need a trailer but having a proper video does greatly increase your conversion rate so that is why I made sure to only publicly announce this project now that I have the tutorial done and the steam page ready and back to being transparent what you see in the trailer is essentially concept gameplay I already have quite a lot of these systems working but it's only using some very basic cubes and visuals there's no polish whatsoever so showcasing the game in its currency it would really not work very good despite the fact that mechanically it already plays quite well sometimes when I give people the advice to make a Racine page as fast as possible one reply I get is they say they don't have much to show yet that is indeed an issue but again remember the goal of the trailer especially an announcement trailer is to show the game idea so feel free to use lots of smoke and mirrors for example Elder Scroll 6 was announced something like five years ago which is a Content teaser now your game is probably not as hyped up as the next Elder Scrolls so you do need to show a bit more but the concept behind it is really the same you can show a mockup of what you intend to build rather than your actual prototype obviously don't mislead people with something completely different so don't make a trailer showcasing a game like GTA when you're building a turnbased strategy game so do make sure you use smoke and mirrors but do so based on the game design that you're trying to implement in my case I built a few scenes just for the trailer so pretty much just set up the characters and environment just some basic visuals and then made some basic scripting to get it to do what I want to show the going with the trailer is meant to sell the idea of what the game will be like when it's finally released so my advice to you is announced as quickly as possible with a nice concept or Alpha trailer in order to start Gathering wishlists also as to how I made the store Page the gifts the trailer and so on as you know I'm not an artist so I made heavy use of assets I'll probably make a dedicated video only seeing everything that I used but you can see that I use lots of cinti models some nice post processing effects including a really interesting Shader I use volumetric lights some zombie animations and a bunch more stuff most of the assets I already had picked up in previous sales so I really only had to spend about a hundred bucks on a few things then beyond that for the logo I contracted an artist from Fiverr asked them to make a logo and I'm really happy with the result I think it looks really great the total price for that was just about 120 bucks with all that together I think the same page came out quite well I guess we shall see if it is indeed good I'll definitely let you know the wishlist numbers on the next level now for the really fun part let's do some guesswork to come up with some estimates hopes and goals first one time initially I wanted this to be a relatively quick project launched around February or March but I'm also experienced enough to know that the first estimate is always wrong always overly optimistic and in terms of marketing nowadays it's super important to participate in a steam Festival there are usually three per year one around February one around June and one around October So the plan in terms of time is participating the June festival and launch the game enjoy that means nine months from now which is definitely a very solid amount of time especially since I already have so much working so I do believe it is a realistic estimate although of course this is not going to be fulltime game development I don't want to let this channel die so I'll be working on the game alongside making regular videos and I'm also still considering whether I can find the time to make a quick multiplayer course and obviously keep updating my other courses so it's not nine months of fulltime Game Dev but still I believe it should be a good amount of time to create the game that I can see in my head the second super important goal is in terms of financial results like I've mentioned in several videos one of my let's say super power in terms of making it as a so indie game developer is simply the fact that I live in Portugal which is a relatively low cost of living country that is really the main reason why I've managed to make a living with Indie Games for the past 10 years over here I can live a basic life with around 800 bucks a month but nowadays I'm also doing a bit better than usual I'm no longer a complete beginner Game Dev in the start of my career so nowadays my goal isn't the absolute minimum but rather a nice and comfortable 2000 per month meaning that if this game takes around 10 months in the phone then my target Financial goal is around twenty thousand dollars but again always remember the difference between gross and net revenue the target is obviously in net revenue I covered my sales numbers for my last steam game in another video and I also made a quick video explaining all the math involved in converting from growth to net revenue how much you keep after taking away chargebacks refunds steam cut and taxes using a very rough estimate let's say net revenue is about 40 percent of gross revenue so that means that in order to get 20 000 in net revenue the game needs to make 50 000 in gross revenue so now that I know what gross revenue I'd like to hit the next thing is how many copies does the game need to sell to get to that amount that's just some basic math but it does depend on the price for each copy usually the recommendation is that if you have a game that is well made then you probably shouldn't go under 10 and on the other hand unless you have a super high quality indie game you shouldn't go above 20 deciding on the price really depends on the final state of the game what I see in my head is awesome and I do hope that I get there if I do I can definitely see the game being worth twenty dollars but at the same time one of the main things that players used to decide if a game is worth the money is the visual presentation which is my weak point so if I don't use the assets correctly then the game might just look like it's worth just ten dollars either way I will only know which price I will decide on when I'm in the final stages of development so for now for this estimate let's go with number in the middle so 15 at that price in order to make 50 000 gross revenue means that I need to sell 333 copies so let's run down and say 3 000 copies sold okay so that's the target gross revenue and the Target sales numbers the next estimate is something that I mentioned time and time again and that's because it's an excellent predictor of sales which is of course wishlist so let me take this time again to ask you if you haven't wishlisted the game yet go ahead pause the video click the link and add to your wish list the more wishlist you have the more steam promotes your game even if the people on wishlisting don't necessarily pick up the game at launch more wishlist is usually always better but of course hopefully those wishlists will indeed convert into sales the general conversion math is around 20 on week one if you're wondering where this number comes from it's from two excellent game marketing sources that I covered in the marketing video the newsletter game discover Co and Chris Zukowski from how to Market your game so the math is usually around 20 conversion on week one and then usually sales for year one are about three to five times week one so putting all of that together let's say the goal is one thousand copies sold on week one which would mean three to five thousand copies sold on Year One with a 20 conversion rate it means I need five thousand wishlists that sounds like a preachievable goal although wishlists also have a sort of soft gold around 10 000 around that amount is when you can finally get into the new and training page so that's usually the amount that you should have and if I go with a higher price point like 15 or 20 dollars then the conversion will probably be lower than that 20 so in terms of wish lists let's aim for 10K wishlist if I hit that I should be able to get 1000 sales on week one okay so here are all the main goals launch the game in July of 2023 launch with 10 000 wishlists have those wish lists converted into one thousand week one copy sold and three thousand year one copy sold with that it should hit fifty thousand dollars in gross revenue and twenty thousand dollars in net revenue which would then equal around two thousand dollars per month development which would be a pretty decent amount then let's also split this into three scenarios so this one is a good scenario then half of all these amounts would be the bare minimum scenario so unless and this would be precatastrophic and hitting this amount would be pretty much the absolute bare minimum and double the good scenario would be the great scenario hitting this amount would be extremely good so I would be very happy if it gets to this point all right so those are the goals with all the numbers it's going to be really fun to look back one year from now and see if I managed to hit them if I can build the game that I can see inside my head then I think I won't be able to hit the good or perhaps even the great scenario of course I won't be doing lots of devlogs and I hope you'll join me on this journey taking a game from start to finish hopefully it won't be entertaining and very educational to follow this journey and hopefully the final game won't be awesome and a great success alright so once again go ahead add the game to your wish list thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time
