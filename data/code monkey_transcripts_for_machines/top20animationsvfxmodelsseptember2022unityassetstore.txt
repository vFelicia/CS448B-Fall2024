hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for September 22. this is the list of visual assets even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination I can minimally picture all of the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid ads and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and the best songs and systems as always there's links to the apps in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also the two excellent humble bundles are still active they were meant to have ended by now but they were both extended there's a tools bundle and a art model I cover them in detail in previous videos even use some of the art tools to make a very unique art style both have an extremely deep 98 discount so they're worth it if just one asset looks interesting alright so starting off with a pack of gorgeous Sky boxes now skyboxes are one of those time tiny things that can make a huge difference just changing the default Skybox with something proper will make your game feel so much better so definitely make sure you do that then for a really nice animation pack this one is all about wrestling animations there's lots of interesting moves you've got some kicks Jabs grabs a bunch of slams and even some moves against the ropes definitely great for spicing up your melee action game if you want something less human then check out these Elementals it includes 12 Elementals fire magma storm ice and more it's a pretty nice design would make for a great enemy or maybe some creature to populate your world next up if you need a medieval dungeon here's one it's got some very high quality assets everything is super detailed it looks really dark really gloomy great atmosphere there's tons of props and lots of modular pieces for you to build your own unique Dungeons and perhaps feed them to a procedural generator next up a really fun one a professional Stickman pack it's got some very stylized characters includes 15 unique ones and it's actually pretty cheap so if you're making some kind of Jolly Coop game then this would be perfect for it then if all you want is just a massive pack with tons of cars and look at this one in total there's over 100 unique models each with multiple colors features all kinds of cars from muscle cars GT rally some hyper cars and tons more for some effects look at these impacts and hits this would be perfect for adding a bunch more punchiness to your player actions there's lots of color variation that can represent whatever you want so quite a lot of variety then if you need a bunch of Rings look at this one perhaps these would be magical rings with some kind of special powers in your game The Lord of the Rings TV show is about to come out so if you have some interesting game ideas then this could be great if your game is set in Japan here is a great Tokyo Street I definitely would like to go to Japan someday and this looks just like every anime that I've ever seen it's a really nice Street very small and cozy there's tons of props everywhere and all the houses also include Interiors which is pretty nice then if you need the UI kit look at this one it's very dark very gloomy so this would be perfect for something just like Diablo there's lots of Sliders buttons and icons and also there's some bubbles again just like Diablo or Path of Exile and even some fancy bars up next a pretty unique one a female hair collection I don't think I've ever seen a hair pack but it definitely make makes sense changing the hair sound will make a huge difference on all of your characters so this looks like a great pack to add that extra customization to your game then if you'd like to make a city very much like New York look at this one it's very realistic you've got some very tone villainings and some very long streets all of it is very blocky so it would be easy to use this in a modular way to make your own custom City it has a huge simple scene of 500 by 800 meters maybe you're working on a pixel art game if so here's a gorgeous pack I really like the sound on this one it makes me think of into the breach there's lots of mechs buildings and vehicles all of it really nice then for just a single but very high res character here's a hunter Warrior this one is a very unique design I love the mask it has a humanoid ring so you can easily get this character up and running next if you need some drones look at this pack features six big drones five small ones and three extra weapons all of them are high poly models with some really interesting designs then for some particles here's a massive mega pack this one includes over 200 projectiles there's 200 hits and 200 puzzle flashes they are all really unique you've got some simple projectiles just like a bullet and some that are really very creative if you like effects then definitely check out Gabrielle's entire publisher page there's lots of awesome stuff there if you're making something in the vein of the Sims then check out this low poly house interior everything looks really nice and cozy you've got tons and tons of props over 2000 there's a fully setup scene as well as a scene with all the props if you want something a bit more industrial then check out this pack I'm looking at this one immediately makes me want to do some kind of Warehouse or factory automation management game the props look really nice you've got some current layer belts lots of pallets boxes Stone boxes and a bunch more then for something for outside scenes here's some super high quality Clips they've got quite an insane amount of detail and with rocks like these you can definitely build huge scenes just by reusing the same assets Road rotating and scaling them and for something quite unique here is a modular air of Palace this one could be excellent if you're making some kind of game set in the Middle East so perhaps something just like the next Assassin's Creed alright so those are my top 20 new assets on the NTS store for September 22. there's
