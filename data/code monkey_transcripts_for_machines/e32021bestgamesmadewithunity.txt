hello and welcome i'm your code monkey so e3 2021 has just happened tons of awesome games were announced and a bunch more received some exciting new updates i thought it would be fun to go and see which ones were made with yinty there's quite a lot of them and they're all very unique so it's always great to see what the engine can do so you know the only limits are really just your own imagination um one of the more gorgeous looking ones is replaced this was announced during the xbox showcase it's got this super high definition pixel art look some gorgeous lighting in a 3d world coupled with some great pixel art really makes this utterly gorgeous it's a sidescrolling steampunk action game so you've got guns you've got swords climbing platforming and so on i really want to play this just to spend some time analyzing exactly how they achieve this gorgeous look then not a new game but a new update escape from tarkov is getting a new map this game is probably the best example of just how good unity can look in a realistic setting the new update takes place in an urban environment lots of streets and apartments you can enter into in order to find some loot looks gorgeous during the day and then when the sun goes down the flashlights and gunfire really light up the room you've got tons of destruction tactics and highpowered firefights this really is one of the bestlooking realistic unity games for something a bit more jolly twopoint campus was announced during the summer game fest showcase this is from the same devs that made two point hospital that game was a great revival of the oldschool bonfire games and this new one is taking the same charm and applying it to a university campus so again lots of silly puns and things you can do for example you have a night school which yep it means actual nights in your school so it's all very silly all in great fun if you enjoy two point hospital you'll certainly enjoy this one another one announced during the xbox showcase somerville this is from the new studio of one of the cofounders of play dead they're the ones who made limbo and inside and you can definitely see the resemblance you've got a very spooky world and a bunch of scifi aliens this one appears to be more focused on having companions and family so a bit less lonely than those other two games my constant thought while watching this trailer was just please don't hurt the dog so let's see what happens with that one tag team i'm in endless dungeon got a new gameplay trailer this is from a very accomplished studio that already made tons of excellent games and all of them made with unity it's a roguelite tactical action game you can play somewhere or with some friends you plunge into an abandoned space station and protect your crystal against a neverending wave of monsters lots of gorgeous particle effects and tons of action then during the summer game fest show there was an entire publisher announced prime matter they showcased a bunch of games and they even made a trailer specifically to highlight which ones of their games were made with unity so they are iron harvest a classic rts game set in an alternate reality in the 1920s tons of huge mechs and lots of units encased which is a tactical scifi rpg create your character gain some experience and gather some loot crossfire legion which is a brand new rts being built by the same makers of homeworld 3. wasteland 3 which is a critically acclaimed postapocalyptic strategy rpg outward which is an open world survival game and finally phoenix point which is an xcom like made by one of the original axon developers where you fight an invasion in gorgeous and gory turnbased battles so a lot of variety made with unity all of it just from one publisher another announcement during the xbox showcase was slime ranger 2. it's the sequel to the excellent original game continued the adventure in a new land brimming with ancient mysteries and bursting with brand new slimes for you to play with i still haven't played the original but i've heard nothing but great things about it so more slime ranger sounds like great news by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks during the developer showcase we saw a wizard with a gun i love a good descriptive name you play as a wizard and you have a gun it's a multiplayer survival adventure game seems to be in the vein of something like don't starve use your guns to destroy enemies but also to build fortifications to keep you and your body safe features some great cartoony visuals with a nice mix of 2d and 3d another update is naraka bladepoint they announce a new weapon the chainsaw and it's having a full release later this august it's a melee based 60 player action battle round lots of mobility parkour and grappling hooks with a great cast of characters with powerful abilities they've been doing public and private betas which have been insanely successful so i'm sure there's a lot of people looking forward to this full release welcome back to shred again here's a new trick let's go for some sports we saw shredders during the xbox showcase it's a snowboarding game all about sliding down mountains and doing tons of tricks the snow looks great as it gets deformed and the animations are all incredibly smooth so if you're looking for a snowboard focused game then this one is perfect for you it's coming out on december 21. some more gorgeous pixel art in a 3d world with songs of conquest this one is shown during the pc gaming show it's very reminiscent of hero's might and magic play around in the world map build your village and recruit some heroes then take your heroes and jump into some turnbased battles to defeat your enemies it looks very good another one announced during the vulvar digital was death's door it's an isometric topdown action game really punished movement in combat it looks like the game feels great to play you've got tons of flashy effects and some cool moves so jump around use your grappling hook dodge all kinds of enemy attacks and take them out with your own alright so beyond that there were a bunch more unity games showcased there was a brief mention of humankind which is a forex game coming soon 12 minutes continues to be very mysterious party animals also showed up one of the most wish listed games on steam genji and impact also made with unity also received a brand new update and a bunch of others alright so this was a fun video to make it's always great to look at some awesome games and identify which ones were made with unity as you can see there's tons of variety so the engine can really build anything your mind can think of you can build something realistic like escape from tarkov or something jointly in cartoony like two point campus the only limit is really just your own imagination alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks
