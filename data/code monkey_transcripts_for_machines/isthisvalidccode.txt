so is this valid code so simple yes or no question we've got a string State we've got the health and we're checking if the health is above zero then we've got alive or dead so let's go everyone thinks that it's a let's see if it is a and Yep this one is indeed Val for some of you if you don't know this this format this syntax it might seem strange it might seem this is not valid but Yep this is indeed valid this is the if shorthand or technically known the tary conditional operator we have up here is perfectly valid code and it's literally exactly the same thing that we have down here so we Define a string State and if the is above zero then we set the state into alive if not we set the state into dead and this can be really useful in certain simple scenarios however it's usual don't abuse it I mean technically you can make a ton of these all over the place and at that point it becomes super compact but also super difficult to read so basically as always you should never ever sacrifice code readability for compactness you should always value making your code readable easy to understand do that first and then secondly you can try to make it compact if it is just as readable as without it
