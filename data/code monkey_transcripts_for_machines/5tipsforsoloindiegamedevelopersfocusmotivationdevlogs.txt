hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey here's an interesting video five tips for Indie solo game developers let's watch it and I'll share my thoughts based on my 10 years of experience making Indie Games before we begin just a quick mention the unity Humble Bundle is ending in about 2 days this one is a great deal with a ton of tools and a bunch of visual assets and the unity asset store is also having their new year sale pretty much all of the top sellers all of the best assets and tools all of those are discounted and there's even a coupon for an extra 10% off or specifically if you're looking for low poly assets then the C sale is also having their great holiday sale as usual it's their excellent style so if you're a fan of it definitely check it out hello and welcome to my humble little Channel I am the sole developer of an upcoming 2D Run and Gun platformer titled Citadel Stormer 2 I have spent the last two years singlehandedly working on this project right away my tip would be don't spend two years working on a project especially not your very first game this is one of those I would definitely call it a mistake that a lot of people fall through my advice to you is do not spend that long especially not dur your very first game you really gain a lot more experience by working on multiple games as opposed to just one single game where you spend tons of years my advice is make quick games at the beginning make games on the scale of some like Flappy Bird or sake so something really small that you can build in one to two weeks then as you grow perhaps start making games in 3 months perhaps one for six months I would only really encourage someone to build a game and spend two years working on a game if that's like your fifth or sixth game if you have quite a lot of experience and at that point spending that long might work I've handled the coding the art the music and the design of the levels enemies bosses and various ingame objects during this process I believe I have gained a few valuable insights on what it takes to create a game from scratch tip one stay focused don't get distracted by new ideas yeah absolutely great tip lots of people they've got an idea for the game but as soon as they work on it for about a month they suddenly get bored of that idea and they start wanting to add more things or work on something completely different being able to stay focused on actually focusing on your game and actually finish that one game before you move move on to the next thing that is one skill that you do gain with experience so that's the good news so if you have trouble with that if you're constantly jumping from Project to project that is something you can definitely work on you can definitely improve that and I'm talking about switching from game idea to game idea but the same thing can happen on the same project you're working on one mechanic and suddenly you jump into a completely different mechanic than another one and so on so being way too distracted that can definitely happen in both terms of games as well as individual mechanics and systems so yep definitely do keep that in mind and don't get distracted way too much remember to say Focus remember what is your initial goal with this game what is the original idea and only work on things that actually work towards getting that idea to completion once you have a general idea of what your game will be like Define your goals create a checklist of tasks and focus on completing them yep checklist that is something that I highly encourage you to do for me personally that is one of the best productivity tips that I can give you working from list for me I find that so much better read than just looking at an empty Unity project and thinking okay where do I even start if you have a to list you just take some time time in order to figure out what are the various items you're going to add on to the list and then when you're actually going to spend some time working on the game you can just work straight from that list so just look at one of those elements and pick okay I'm going to work on this one and that's it personally I make two list for just about anything so all my daily tasks I have todo lists my monthly goals I have todo lists for my game that I'm currently working on dinky Guardians for that I have a todo list of all the things that I need to do so yeah my advice to you definitely make tons of lists it's much much easier to keep working and stay focused if you're working from M list during the course of the project you will keep getting new ideas these new ideas can fall into two categories the first category includes ideas that can be integrated into your current project like a new weapon or enemy type these are good make a note of them and add them to your checklist yep whenever you get a new idea I definitely encourage you to essentially do a brain dump just take that idea take it from your brain actually write it down somewhere if you keep it inside your brain that is going to constantly keep you distracted so just write down keep a stack of paper of excellent ideas that you want to work either on your current game or whatever comes next the important thing is take it away from your brain put it on somewhere else where it does not distract you the second category consists of ideas for a completely different game these are bad however the freshness and Novelty of those ideas May tempt you to abandon your current project and start a fresh new one ideas for new games aren't necessarily bad again as long as you don't constantly jump from Project to project so if you have a game idea for something completely different that you would like to do I would encourage you just write that down the idea somewhere either write it down on paper or just open a simple text file on your computer personally I have tons of ideas all over the place I've got lots of papers with lots of random game ideas I've got notes on my phone I've got notes on my computer so once again whenever you have some idea for something little different the important thing is take it away from your brain and put it somewhere so it doesn't distract you you can do that then go back to being focused on you're working on your current game and when you finish that then you can revisit that list of ideas and figure out what to work on next based on the exciting New Concepts that have just popped into your mind but do not take the bait because doing so would completely negate all the time and effort you have already invested in your original goals and put you right back at the starting point of the game dep process furthermore even if you choose to pursue the new project there is no guarantee that you won't later abandon it to pursue a newer and fresher set of ideas yeah again that's a problem jumping from Project to project so definitely make sure you don't do that in the end you would have spent all that time and effort doing Game Dev but have nothing to show for it except a pile of Unfinished games tip two don't neglect The Not So enjoyable parts of the project like any other creative Endeavor Game Dev has both fun and nonf fun Parts yeah for me the nonf fun Parts those would be handling music and sound effects for some reason that is something that I absolutely hate to do I really hate cycling through dozens or hundreds of sound effects in order to find whatever matches whatever I'm working on I always hate working with music trying to figure out what music actually fits my game another thing that I really dislike is all of the artwork that is required in order to make something like a steam page in order to make screenshots that is always something that I really dislike doing but again it must be done if I want to release the game the game needs to have screenshots it needs to have a trailer which is another thing that I really don't like doing it needs to have music sound effects so yep definitely game Tav can be quite a lot of fun there are definitely a lot of things that I really enjoy I love making new systems I love writing tons of code but if you want to finish your game yep there are some not so fun parts that you will have to push through the fun parts are usually the easy and more enjoyable tasks examples of these would be making conceptual sketches writing lore generating new ideas and so on while these things are important in their own right as a solo developer be careful not to get too caught up in them it creates the illusion of being productive but at the end of the day you'll have nothing to show for it a notebook full of Concepts and game ideas is worthless if those ideas aren't implemented in a game project yeah again I mean you do have to go through the not so fun Parts you can't just procrastinate on them some things they must be done done no matter whether you like to do more or not a game has to be a complete package in order to actually be a complete final game so just remember that making games isn't always going to be super fun when you spend too much time on the fun Parts you usually end up neglecting the less glamorous yet vital tasks such as coding and debugging tasks that are essential to ensure that it and again it's really funny how personal preference he mentions coding and debugging as negatives personally that's the part that I love the most so yeah it's just funny how everyone has different tastes everyone has different things everyone has different definitions of what is the fun and not so fun parts of game development game functions as intended while the fun parts may be enticing neglecting the fundamental technical aspects can undermine the overall quality and functionality of the game it is important to strike a balance between enjoying the creative aspects and giving due attention to the critical backend work that brings the game to life approach the project holistically and divide your tasks appropriately allocate dedicated time for the dull and boring stuff even if it's not as enjoyable for you yeah again definitely remember you do have to do the not so fun parts so my advice is just add them to the list and at some point one day when you feel nice and strong go ahead and just tack on those just spend one day trying to get to as much of the nonf funds part as possible get through those and just remind yourself okay I'm doing the not so fun parts so I can actually finish the game which is the ultimate goal remember that the dry backend work is crucial to bring your artistic Vision to life and ensure you have a functional game in your hands yep remember what is the ultimate goal without those not so fun Parts you cannot release the game so just push through them learn to balance the fun and challenging aspects of development tip three don't start peripheral activities like video devlogs it's tempting to start a devlog or even a YouTube channel dedicated to showcasing progress on your game and video format yeah this is a tricky one on the one hand I understand the the advice which is basically don't get distracted it's basically the same advice and of course time is very limited so should you spend your time on things things outside of your game the answer is sort of sort of not I guess that depends on what are your goals with the game because if your goal is to actually find success like Financial monetary success if so then marketing is something you cannot neglect it is one of the most important things it is extremely difficult and making Dev Vlogs making YouTube channel making YouTube shorts Tik toks whatever making all those things is all part of marketing which is part of making a successful game now if you're just doing it as a hobby if you're just doing it for fun then sure you can ignore all of that you don't have to worry about marketing but if you want to make games as a profession if you want to make it a career then marketing is something you absolutely need to do and Dev Vlogs are one of the most straightforward ways to do it so yep it does take time it does take quite a lot of time away from game development I you know I mean balancing this channel making all these videos and working on my seam game that is definitely being quite challenging quite difficult but I know that if I don't do that then the game will simply not find an audience at all so yeah it is really difficult in order to balance it takes a ton of time time it takes a ton of work a ton of effort but in today's world the reality is simply you have to do that there's simply no way if you want to find success with your games and marketing is something you must do it sucks it takes a lot of time but it simply must be done seen many solo devs do it in the hopes it may draw attention to their game but the cold fact is that unless you already have a substantial following on YouTube maintaining a video devlog is an absolute waste of time and energy I I disagree with that I mean I agree that it is extremely difficult I mean YouTube is pretty much just as saturated as Steam is so it definitely is extremely difficult in order to stand out with devlog you've got to bring something really special really unique so I don't disagree with the fact that it's really difficult but like I said it is something it must be done I mean any kind of marketing must be done and devlogs are simply the sort of easiest way to do marketing or the most straightforward one at the same time that is really great feedback I mean if you're making devlogs about your game and nobody's watching them nobody's clicking on them perhaps that might mean that you simply have haven't yet learned all the skills required in order to be successful on YouTube or perhaps it might mean that your game idea perhaps isn't quite as appealing as you'd like so that can also be some very useful feedback in order to decide should you spend a lot more time on this game or not it goes back to what I mentioned in the beginning should you spend years working on a game I would say if you can't get traction on your devlogs then absolutely do not spend years or several months working on the game take that as feedback because if people are not interested in watching your Dev vogs that is a sign that they will not be interested in actually playing the final game let me explain first attracting viewers and growing your channel from scratch is an uphill task this is due to YouTube's algorithm favoring established creators uh that is not quite the case anymore over the past few years the past I don't know 5 seven years YouTube has definitely changed previously the amount of subscribers were a huge amount that was a huge impact if you had millions of subscribers you would guarantee millions of views whereas nowadays that is no longer the case nowadays with just a single video you can definitely pop off you can definitely go viral it is definitely difficult to grow on YouTube like I said it's pretty much as saturated as team is but thankfully nowadays if you come out of the gate with just one really excellent devlog and if your game ID is actually appealing and if you study the basics of YouTube the basics of how to make a good title a clickable thumbnail if you do that you can definitely find success it is really difficult but it is possible so it's quite likely that you'll be making videos that not many people will discover let alone watch if that's the case the question of growing your channel goes out the window lastly there is zero to little guarantee that all your endeavors in running a YouTube devlog would result in tangible benefits such as publicity fan acquisition or sales of the final product one really interesting thing that I've noticed since pretty much making this channel is that there's actually a big difference between a Game Dev audience and a gameplaying audience initially when I first started this channel one of the goals behind it was essentially basically I'm going to use the knowledge that I've gained over the past I don't even know 10 years making games use that in order to teach you how to make games and as a result the audience that will enjoy learning from those videos they will then pick up my games and that will help my games become more successful but what I have found since then is that yep there's a big difference between a Game Dev audience and a game playing audience so my audience on this channel is more towards the game da audience which means it doesn't really convert into game players as much as you would think whereas on the other hand there's a for example a channel like Danny that is pretty much on the entertainment side as opposed to game dep side so that one attracts much more game players as opposed to game developers and in that case it does convert very well considering these factors there is little justification to believe that a YouTube devlog warrants the expenditure of time and effort all that said a YouTube channel would be useful to store trailers and gameplay footage to share when needed but creating highly edited devlogs can be a significant drain on resources and if you must document your progress consider using a simpler platform such as Twitter which allows you to reach a wider audience oh now that is very bad advice I would say like I was saying a while ago difference between a game da audience and gameplaying audience from all the stats that I've seen Twitter is not a place to find a gameplaying audience if you go on Twitter and you post a bunch of gifts on things like screenshot Saturday or wish list Wednesday or whatever if you do that you will reach quite a few people but those will be once again those will be game developers and not game players Twitter is actually the absolute worst place you find players for a game in terms of marketing Twitter should be at the very bottom of your list and in terms of wasting Resources by making devlogs on the one hand yep that is true I mean if no one watches your devlogs then that's a little bit of a waste but at the same time like I said if you want to find success nowadays you need marketing and if you don't Market your game then essentially all the effort you put into your game will essentially be wasted tip four don't hyperfocus on one thing instead cover all things for any dedicated game developer it is natural to strive for presenting their game in the best possible manner however this Pursuit can sometimes turn into an endless cycle of Polish and refinement a developer May focus on perfecting and finetuning various aspects of their game often beyond what is necessary or practical yeah I would definitely say don't over focus on overp polishing just one particular aspect of your game remember in order for it to work it has to work as a whole so make sure the entirety of the game is on essentially the same level of quality the same level of complexity if you like make your Gunplay feel extremely polished but your enemies are essentially just prototype enemies that won't feel very strange very often footing so yeah do make sure you spend the same amount of effort on pretty much every part of your game or essentially based on how important that part is to your game and at the end definitely do make sure to Polish Polish is an extremely important thing and do make sure you polish pretty much every mechanic as much as possible while attention to detail and quality are crucial becoming fixated on incessant polishing can lead to delays and a lack of progress while dedicating lots of time to perfecting one particular aspect of a game for example the main character's design or a specific art asset can result in a pol outcome It ultimately becomes feudal if other crucial elements of the game are neglected in the grand scheme of things focusing excessively on one aspect of your game while neglecting others hinders progress yep definitely I mean it is very important to polish things but not to the detriment of everything else hyperfocusing on one task eats into your time and prevents you from completing the hundreds of other tasks that your game needs remember there's no point in perfecting one thing if the other things in the game do not get made a single task no matter how important should not take up all your time yep again remember the game is composed of a hole it is composed of a multitude of systems and mechanics all working together so you cannot for example just spend your entire Dev time just making the shooting feel great if there are no enemies to shoot at or no levels to explore then doesn't really matter if the shooting works because needs a hole in order to actually make a final complete game tip five don't rely on motivation cultivate discipline instead this is definitely a tip that I highly inally agree with something that I've mentioned many times yep do not rely on motivation motivation is something that is very ephemeral it comes and goes you have no control over it it is great when motivation comes and Things become super easy but the development of a game even if you make a short game even if you make something on like 3 to six months you will definitely not stay motivated for that whole time so my advice is definitely do not rely on motivation make sure you rely on discipline inste once again work from a list make sure you have a list of things that you need to do and just go ahead and do them one by one whether you feel like it or not the Journey of game development is a difficult one filled with hurdles that can easily wear you out demoralize you and cause you to abandon your goals motivation is essentially an emotion and can increase or decrease depending on external factors there will be times when motivation disappears altogether yep I mean game development is a long journey it is really difficult it involves a ton of work it involves a ton of systems a ton of different unique skills and motivation just comes and goes you can't really control it so yep do not rely on motivation if you want to finish your game then take that seriously and actually work on it actually finish it step by step day by day no matter how you feel about it in contrast being disciplined is a mindset it is a way of living or seeing things that pushes you to get things done it can be considered as an engine that propels you forward and sustains you throughout the entire Journey discipline is the source of other qualities like perseverance and dedication discipline is the secret to success in any field game development included when you feel worn out motivation disappears but the discipline that you have cultivated will drive you to continue working on your game project yep definitely when motivation disappears it's up to you to R out on selfdiscipline although at the same time I should say do not take it to the other extreme meaning to the point where you're focused so much on selfdiscipline to the point where you actually start to feel bad about yourself when you eventually fail we're all human no one is perfect so even if you rely on selfdiscipline there won't be times when no matter how much you try you simply cannot do it you simply cannot force yourself to do it and when that happens the answer is really just accept it just say Okay sadly this happened suddenly today I cannot push myself through it just do that and accept it as opposed to essentially just punishing yourself for not being able to do something if you do that will not help in any way that will just make you feel like crap which in turn hurts your development on the next day and so on so do rely on selfdiscipline but when you eventually fail to force yourself to work when that happens just accept it and move on do not punish yourself when something goes wrong I believe these tips will help your solo game Vel opers avoid fatigue stay organized and ensure that you reach your game development goals all right so yeah that was the video that was pretty interesting lots of interesting topics so yeah to the developer best of luck with set Theon
