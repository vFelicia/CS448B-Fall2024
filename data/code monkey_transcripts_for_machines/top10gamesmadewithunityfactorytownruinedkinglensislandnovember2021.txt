hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for november 2021 i thought this month wouldn't have many good releases because of black friday and the autumn sale but i was definitely wrong there's tons of really awesome games for you to play which is great but also tons of competition for you as a developer so you really need to bring your a game if you want to be a successful indie game developer you need to keep up to date with what's coming out i make these videos once a month so i can learn which games are finding success all of these games are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also there is a fill up links in the description for some of the games are you looking for unity jobs check out this video's patreon sponsor justunityjobs on twitter it lists hundreds of jobs needing unity skills every week jobs are either onsite or remote subscribe today for some job inspiration to land your first job in the industry or to find your next great unity role alright so starting off at number 10 with a pretty big release made with unity here is ruined king a league of legends story like the name implies this one is based on the league of legends universe it's a turnbased combat rpg that seems to be very heavy on the story you unite a party of league of legends champions and set sail to uncover this mystery the reviews are very positive so if you don't like league and you like turn based rpgs then this seems like an excellent one for me i stopped playing league about five years ago so i really don't recognize any of these characters in the trailer but if i did then i imagine that this game would be great fun to play and up next for something that just came out of early access and definitely appeals to me here is factory town you build automate and optimize a giant town using conveyor belts trains shoots and pipes it's all in full 3d so it features some really awesome vertical destruction to really make your designs come to life you gather raw materials turn them into something more valuable sell them to nearby villages and then use that profit to expand gather more materials and keep growing features a completely open sandbox mode and also some guided campaign maps with some unique goals it even has workshop support so you can download tons of items that the community already made personally i love automation games but most of them are constantly in early access so seeing this one come out in the full release really makes me want to play it just need to find the time if you're looking for something really chill and zen here is unpacking the concept is really very simple you just moved into a new place and all of your things are on boxes so it's up to you to take the objects from the boxes and place them in the right place it's part puzzle game and part home decoration it describes itself as a meditative game there's no timers no scores no fail state you explore the environment arrange bookshelves and listen to the soundtrack made by a bafta awardwinning composer there is also somewhat of a story in the game delivered in an interesting way through the objects you unpack essentially you'll learn more about this character that you never really meet so it's definitely a very unique game it's short and sweet so if that's what you're looking for then give it a shot up next here's an interesting one that i've been watching for quite a long time lens island i've been watching this one for over a year because they have an excellent youtube channel you can watch the development of this game all the way since the beginning three years ago when all it was was just a capsule and some basic use if you're interested in seeing a game take shape definitely go watch all those videos the game itself is an exploration farming crafting building survival game the building system is excellent and actually one of the inspirations for the building system that i made myself in a previous video it's really in depth you can really build the home of your dreams then you can obviously gather resources cut down trees go for fishing and even farm for food and of course if you're feeling adventurous grab sword and go down into the caves it's out now in early access and already has quite a nice amount of very positive reviews by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks then for some really cool vr here is crisis regate 2 it's a great name this one is a fast paced virtual reality shooter you play as a swat trooper either solo or with friends choose your own loadout and take out the bad guys visually it's very impressive a very good looking vr game very realistic visuals which is pretty unique a lot of vr games are very scifi so it's nice to see something purely realistic with some excellent visuals it's fast paced but also one of the features they mentioned on the store page is zero sickness so i'd love to test that out next up something pretty unique one cage it's a puzzle adventure game where each side of the cube works as a window to a unique world you sound like the objects in one scene then rotate the cube to interact with both worlds at once visually the effect is excellent makes me want to try making this system you could do it with a bunch of cameras and some render textures and some clever coordinated movement you collect all of the photos from all the worlds in order to uncover the story it also has one of the features that i love in puzzle games there's a hint system to help you when you get stuck personally i really suck at puzzle games so i always love this mechanic it has almost 2 000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so everyone seems to love it then here's another one that came out after a successful time in early access gunfire reborn it's a level based adventure game combining fps roguelike and rpg every level is random each run is unique you meet different heroes experience new weapons items and combat rhythms lots of varied environments with tons of unique characters also you can play either alone or in coop with four friends i must say that just by looking on the trailer i think it looks a bit generic but it does have over 50 000 very positive reviews so this must play great if you're a fan of side scrollers here's the legend of the ending it's very flashy great comic book style action it's a story about a legendary taiwanese phone hero so in terms of setting that's very unique you've got lots of ninja moves dash roll punch and kick your enemies features a pretty complex kung fu fighting system you can do all kinds of attacks grapple enemies with your sash or throw them in the air and hit them with an air combo there's even a card based minigame to take the break from all the action it certainly looks very unique so if you are looking for a different side scroller then check it out and up next here is the last stand aftermath pretty awesome looking top down shooter i believe this one is actually based on a flash game from a long time ago it's published by armor games for me since i started in flash games i'll always have a soft spot for seeing that name back then it was my dream to get sponsored by armor games this one has a really interesting concept it's a zombie apocalypse and you've already been bit so your time is running out which makes it perfect for a roguelike features the usual survival mechanics you can scavenge for food and resources craft weapons and explore this world but since you're already bit you have a time limit and when you finally die you pick up the game again as a new survivor with new perks and upgrades based on your last run visually the game looks really excellent great shooting great ragdolls the grass looks great and the lighting effects at night make them look really gorgeous i haven't played a survival game in quite a while so i'd love to give this one a try and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month if you're looking for something really wholesome here is to the rescue it's a very charming dog shelter simulator personally i love dogs so this one really hits me just the right way i've actually had the idea of making a game just like this but never got around to it so i'm really happy that someone else did it's a management game so you take dogs in you keep them fed and well taken care of and hopefully find a home for them you can run a fundraiser and expand your shelter so you can help even more dogs each dog is unique with their own needs and desires and it even has a petting mini game and on top of all that twenty percent of the death profits from this game go towards a pet charity so just by buying the game you can have some fun and you also help a really worthwhile cause alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with
