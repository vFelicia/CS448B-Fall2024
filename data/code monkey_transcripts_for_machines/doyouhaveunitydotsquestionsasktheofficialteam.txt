hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here's a super quick video just letting you know that int is doing yet another awesome definitely today this is a really cool initiative that they've been doing they've already done one all about UI one all about rendered pipelines one on multiplayer and now the next one is all about yinty dots if you don't know what is a devil it's basically it's one day where the antidevs from a certain team answer only your questions you can go ask whatever question you want and you won't get a reply straight from the official team you can go watch eforms for the other devilates to see what others have asked and the official answers from Unity dots is something that a lot of people are very interested in and have a lot of questions so this one will probably be the most popular one yet it's happening in a few days on December the 8th for that entire day you can go to the forums or the Discord or on Reddit and ask whatever that's questions you have and you won't get a response from the official team so definitely add that date to your calendar and even if you don't have any specific question you want to ask go ahead and just make your voice heard and tell Unity that you don't like these initiatives where they are more transparent and more can into Focus
