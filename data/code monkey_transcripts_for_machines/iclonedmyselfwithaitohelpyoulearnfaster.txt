hello and welcome I'm your codm and I just created something that I think might be a super useful tool to help you learn faster basically I've got my complete course on making my game kitchen chaos there's a free version here on YouTube and a paid version on my site and then what I did was I basically took the giant script for all the lectures everything from these 46 lectures then compound with tons of questions that I both asked and answered myself and then I trained a chat GPT assistant on all that data then with that I made a pre complex system that basically en listens to when some someone posts a comment then it asks the bot to generate a reply and post that reply directly on the comment so if someone posts a question after 1 to two minutes there is an automatic B rep now the main benefit of this is obviously Spen personally I always still answer all the question myself manually I've been doing that ever since the course launch and I continue doing it by now I've answered literally thousands of questions in both the free version and the paid version but of course I can only do that at most once or twice per day meaning that if someone has a question might take up to 24 hours for me to get a reply that time delay that can be quite annoying especially if you're trying to learn and you're actively in the middle of it when trying to learn it is very important to keep up the momentum to keep learning get answers to your question and keep it ring so you truly learn whereas with the spot the response is almost instense within 1 to two minutes so if you have a question you can simply post a comment so let's say for example I've heard the Singleton pattern is bad is that true and let's go ahead post a comment there's my comment I just posted now the bot is generating a reply and within 1 to two minutes I should have an answer since the bot was trained on the entire text for all of the course lectures as well as many of my own frequently asked questions that I both asked and answered myself because that the response should be pretty actur so let's see and up here it is the automatic AI reply it is saying how the Singleton pattern is not inherently bad it's a tool that can be used well or poorly pretty much like every other programming tool problems sent to rise when Singleton are overused leading to a web of interlock references that can make your code base difficult to manage and understand so yeah this is pretty much exactly what I would say and this is pretty much exactly what I teach in the course Singletons are a two tool and as with any tool they can be used or abused so this is an excellent reply if I was just learning then this would be an excellent way to get a really detailed very correct answer within just two minutes but of course the goal of this bot is not to replace me I will still be answering questions manually the goal for this bot is basally to give a really quick answer so you can continue learning pretty much instantly and then when I see it within the next 24 hours I will then reply to the bot and either confirm or provide some more extra clarification to whatever the bot said so if you own the optional paid version of the course go ahead test it out ask a question and let's see what the bot comes up with now some of you might be wondering why is this feature only enabled on the paid course and not on the free course that is here on YouTube and the answer to that is obviously pretty simple these AI Bots cost money to run and it's actually quite a lot more than a view is worth on YouTube in order to run this bot because it was Stained on so much data the entire course is about 10,000 lines long so because of all that data in order to answer a question in order to generate response it costs anywhere between 10 to 15 cents now that might not sound like a lot but over here on YouTube each view is literally worth just a fraction of a scent my my usual RPM is about $2 which means each view is worth literally 0.2 so the cost to run a bot is literally 50 times what an average view is worth technically if all of these 1.7 million views if all of these people ask a question then I would owe open AI about 200 Grand so as you can tell that is really not something that I can afford I'd love to enable this feature to help out everyone but it's really just not possible either way if you're following the course for free on YouTube I will still be answering all those question manually but if you have the optional paid version go ahead and ask a question the bot will respond almost immediately and then I will manually give an extra answer and if you're curious in the technical terms building this was actually quite an interesting challenge in technical terms it involves quite a lot of things all working together to make this work first it involves a teachable web hook this one is fired automatically whenever someone posts a comment then that web hook goes into my PHP web server which then listens to it and interacts with the opening eye API it asks it to generate a reply but that process that one is not instant it actually creates a run and goes into a queue that only generates a resp response afterwards so then I have to periodically query the API to see if the response has been generated when it does complete that process then I ask the open AI API to get the final message then with that message suddenly teachable does not actually have an API endpoint for automatically posting a comment so because of that I actually had to use some python I had to learn how to use the selenium package this one lets you automate interacting with websites in various ways so basically with that script it automatically goes onto the course website it pretty much writes the comment that the chat GP generated and simply manually post that comment this is definitely a fun challenge to get all of this working all these pieces this was quite tricky but I'm quite happy with the final result I'm not an expert in python or Linux or even PHP in general so building this actually required quite a lot of trial and error but it was a fun Challenge and the final system works very well all right so I hope you find this new feature useful if this is as helpful as I hope it will be then I plan to keep doing this for pretty much every course that I make I really think the speed in getting an automated reply that is hopefully very accurate I really think that will help people learn quite a lot faster quite a lot better all right so go ahead post a comment and try it out thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
