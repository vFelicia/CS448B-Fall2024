now health is pretty simple you can really just use any basic health system for this like for example the free one that I made quite a while ago it's a great system it's what I use in many of my games definitely go ahead and just download it for free and use it the health in this game is really just an INT number Super basic but then this game also has a very unique very interesting morale system now the biggest frustration with games like XCOM is the dreaded 98% chance to hit that actually misses that one never feels good that always feels messed up so in this game at least characters have something called morale and if your shot misses it won't deal any health damage but it will still deal morale damage if their morale goes under half then on the next turn they have fewer action points and less chance to hit and if their morale goes to zero they get broken and cannot take a turn personally I really think this is a great system a great mechanic a great addition to this genre it makes the game a lot less random and gives you more control over your own actions in technical terms the morale system is really the exact same thing as the health system it's really just a number that goes down slowly over time so you could use literally the exact same code you could use the exact same Health System just have a second health bar and have that one pretty much just always takes damage even if they shot misses
