hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights that were released in august 2021 this is the list of paydays and effects i've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and the best tools and systems go watch those if you haven't seen them let me know which ones of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order and by the way check out my own asks on the store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your game and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out alright so starting off with a really awesome animation pack the fighter pack very stylish animations they'll look really awesome it includes tons of very powerful punches and kicks do some uppercuts and some interesting skills this one is also made to work with the other animation pack by this same developer with the katana animations so if you pick up both them you can make a really nice combat game swapping between katana and melee next up if you want some bows and crossbows check out this pack now this one is actually an extended pack of another asset that i covered in the free assets video so you can start off by grabbing those ones and then see if they match your project and then if you need some more check out this one if you want some weird particle effects check out this shapes pack really very unique effects very weird it could fit with a scifi cyberpunk theme or maybe some fantasy i could see this being great for some sort of abstract powerups for your player or maybe use one of these as currency then if you want a nice level here is a really cool bunker contains over 160 meshes lots of bunker structures a bunch of items and props all of them really high quality textures up to 2k if you have a bunker game idea something like fallout shelter then just import this pack and start work or maybe you're working on some scifi idea if you need to make some spaceships then check out this spaceship creator it's all modular with 18 different sets includes 300 premade spaceship examples along with 10 colors for each of them so if you have a scifi idea then this pack is pretty much all you need to build off your spaceships does your game have some water if so then of course you need a water shader but also a underwater shader you don't want the underwater part to look exactly the same as above so for that check out this asset looks great makes the whole thing have a tint have some distortion some fog like you expect works with dynamic lighting the skybox and ambient color and it also includes a shader sub graph so you can add the effect onto your own custom shaders if you need some realistic characters check out this pack it's themed towards a survival game as usual it's all modular so you can make near infinite variations lots of clothing backpacks weapons both for male and female and it also includes more targets for various face expressions next up if you need some stylized textures check out this pack contains 70 textures in a really nice painted style you've got grass sand lava ice and so on it includes the base map but then also i'm inclusion height normal and roughness so the materials look really great then a really interesting asset this human anatomy model i guess this is more for education rather than using a game but it looks great it's a male model with a bunch of anatomically correct layers so it's got the skeleton then on top of it's got the nervous system circulation digestive respiratory muscles and the skin on top definitely very interesting very unique asset this developer also has a bunch of other anatomy assets so one with a pregnant woman a brain lungs and so on so if for some reason that's what you're looking for then check this one out on the other hand if you're working on a realistic apocalypse game then check out this great looking environment it's great if you're building something sort of in the vein of the last of us or maybe turn up the fog and make a really scary horror game something like silent hill it's set up to work with both urp and hdrp or maybe you need some low poly characters check out this fantasy humans pack very modular you can customize just about anything change the equipment but also the skin color hair eyes and eyebrows very customizable for an interesting effect here is a fat thin shader you take your models and expand or contract their mesh size while keeping the same body shape you can combine this with effect with some modular pack like the previous one to get even more variety so enable the players to customize the actual weight of your character or maybe just use this as kind of like that effect in the blade movie where the enemies simply expand until they pop if you don't like to make something like roller coasters tycoon then this pack is just for you features various amusement rides like a ferris wheel pirate ship and roller coaster all pieces are separate meshes so you can easily animate everything also includes tons of shops and buildings to populate your park and it even includes some base characters so if you have a roller coaster tycoon game idea then this is great for a darker theme check out this ui pack it's called horror but i could see this being used just for survival games as well features over 1500 phones tons of icons for just about anything lots of buttons sliders input fields chrome bars and so on personally i quite like this design if you need some more awesome animations then check out this rogue finisher anim set really awesome animations very impactful this one is all about being a rogue so it's based on some very fast dagger animations contains 30 animations with both the attacker and the victim so combine this pack with a normal dagger animation pack and add some awesome finishing moves onto your game maybe you need some icons here's a great pack includes everything you could possibly need for a survival game so it's got weapons tools food materials and tons more they are all in 512 by 512 so it's a pretty good size and up next here's some really nice cartoony props i really like the style on this one very comfortable very good morning objects features all kinds of weapons tools and even a bunch of props on the other hand if you want something hyper realistic check out this one lots of vehicles all of them very realistic very highend models you've got tanks planes helicopters apcs and even the hangar itself or maybe you're working on a pixel art game check out these characters includes four unique characters with a bunch of animations also has a color swap shader so you can make endless variations and for a different style here is a home living pack this one could be great for a sort of sims like game or some adventure game idea quite a lot of props almost 300 prefabs features four female and four male characters in an interesting style of them fully textured rigged and animated
