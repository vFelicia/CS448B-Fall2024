hello and welcome i'm your code monkey let's learn how to quickly get started with unity authentication this is how you can provide a unique identifier for your player to then interact with other unity services like for example cloud save so you know what save data belongs to that player the best part is it can be all completely done automatically and visible to the user by using an anonymous login to get started first go into the unity gaming services page and click on get started to sign up and enable ugs in your account this requires a valid account but don't worry authentication is currently free do that then go to your unity editor go to edit project settings and services and then here either link this project to an existing project or create a new one alternatively you can also create it in the unt dashboard with that done then install the authentication package from the package manager create a script and a game object to run it onstart initialize unt services note how it's an async function so don't forget the async in the function definition and the await in the function call register to the authentication events the code that i'm using here is taken straight from the dock so pause the video or check the docs make a function to sign in anonymously call it after the initialization and that's it run the game and the update player was logged in anonymously automatically with this id you can then interact with all the other unity gaming services like cloud save multiplayer iep and so on this is the absolute basics of unity authentication but you can build upon this you can handle multiple profiles identities delete accounts and so on and more importantly you can upgrade the anonymous account to a linked account you can link with various external id providers as the time this recording you have google app on facebook and seam check the docs for detailed instructions on all those sdks and that's unity authentication in 100 seconds get my ultimate unity overview course to learn more about 50 other unity tools that feature
