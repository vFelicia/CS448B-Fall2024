hello and welcome I'm your KMI and my C course is finally ready I've been working nonstop on this for months you might have noticed that I really haven't published many regular videos lately this is really why I'm very tired very stressed out but extremely happy with the final result I put all my knowledge all my 10 years of experience into this one course and I made some really interesting content to help you Tru and learn it has 56 stepbystep video lectures then there are 389 frequently asked questions to provide extra clarification on each lecture there's 358 multiple choice quizzes to put your knowledge of each lecture into the test and very importantly there are 83 interactive exercises these require you to put into practice the contents of each lecture so you can actually truly learn this last one is really special you only truly learn by doing as opposed to just watching a video and all of these exercises were handcraft By Me In order to help you truly learn the contents of each lecture this course has all this as well as some other really nice bonus that I'm going to mention in a little bit honestly I'm really happy with this course this is basally the course that I wish I had 10 years ago when I started learning C if I had this back then I would have gained my knowledge much much faster so I really truly hope this helps you a lot in your Learning Journey at the same time right now there are only the first two sections the beginner and the intermediate one building all of this was a ton of work and I don't want to delay the launch since these two sections are ready right now but the goal is for this course to be a complete C course from absolute beginner to very Advanced I want this to be the ultimate C Mastery course so for the next month I will be working on the advaned section and it will eventually be coming out as a free update now for the topic in the title of this video personally I'm a big believer in education I think it's really awesome how nowadays as long as you have an internet connection you have the ability to learn literally anything and also think it's very important that there is high quality education available for free I don't think there's anything wrong with charging money for it but still if someone has desire to learn I want them to be able to learn whether they have money or not basically I picture myself when I was a kid and I went to learn flash but back then I had zero dollars back in my day there wasn't anything like YouTube or even any paid courses so for me I had to learn mostly by doing a ton of trial and error by reading some really dry documentation and just finding random posts on the internet it was definitely not a very efficient way to learn but really that was all I had at the time it took me years to learn what you cannot learn in a few months nowadays thankfully it's much much easier to learn and I really want to contribute to that that's the main purpose behind the whole Channel that's why I've made tons of free video tutorials sharing the knowledge that I've gained in the 10 years that I've been making my own games a year ago I did a really interesting experiment I made my free kitchen chaos course this one is a really awesome 10hour course on making a complete game from scratch it is great for beginners and intermediate users then I also made the followup free multiplayer course both are really on the same level of quality as my paid courses and really the same level of quality as a code that I write in my own professional games and importantly I made those sces completely free with an optional paid version this was really an experiment and I had no idea what the result would be so would the video be a complete flop would I perhaps lose a ton of time and money or would it perhaps go viral and would there be enough people buying the optional paid version to at least let me recoup the costs thankfully I'm happy to report that things did turn out quite well there were indeed a handful of generous people who bought the optional paid version or gave some nice super thanks in the video or became YouTube or patreon members so because of all those people the course did manage to break even and make a little bit of money so really thanks to all of you who did that there were about 400 sales on the optional paid version and also thanks to the people watching and liking the video the video actually went pretty viral and got over 2 million views honestly if I could guarantee this level of success and I think I could make a bunch more free course without worrying about the result but I really don't think I can reliably expect the same results this video has 2 million views whereas most of my videos only get about 10 to 15,000 and even just looking at difference in views between part one and part two clearly the first one had some massive outside success there was a certain Lu factor that I really don't think I can replicate so that's really the Dilemma that I've been thinking about for the past few months I'm really happy with the c course and I would love everyone to be able to learn from it but at the same time I also have to pay my own rent and one day I would love to have a more balanced work schedule something where I don't have to work nonstop 7 days a week so I can't really justify making it them for free but also really don't want to put it all behind the pay wall so here's the plan that I come up something that is kind of in between to both make it free and make it sustainable without relying on the luck of the YouTube algorithm next week I will publish the first free video here on YouTube with the complete beginner section so all 23 of those video lectures then hopefully the course will sell 100 copies of the premium version and one month after the first video if it's above that threshold I will publish the intermediate section for free and then hopefully sell 100 copies more and finally one month after that I will publish the advance section for free here on YouTube basally I'm betting that there are at least 200 people in the audience of this channel who have some good high paying jobs and can't afford to buy the premium version in doing so those people will get some really nice bonuses for the premium version while also allowing others to watch a video lecture for free since the kitchen cow course hold about 400 copies I'm hoping this one can sell about 200 without the video having to go viral if this plan works and I think that's the best scenario for everyone people who can afford it can buy the premium version and watch all the lectures right now with all of the extra awesome bonuses and people who can't afford it they can watch a beginner video lecture for free next week and hopefully all the other free sections in the coming months and I myself can make enough money without having to put everything behind the pay wall like most courses if the plan doesn't work out then this course really just ends up like many other course that exists where there's just a small free sample and most of it behind a pay wall but I really hope it does work in doing my research for this course I did find a bunch of free course on YouTube although they really only ever cover the basics if you have no money and you want to learn more intermediate or advanced topics and you really have no option so kind of like myself when I was a kid that is why I came up with this plan to hopefully get a free course that anyone can learn that covers beginner intermediate and advanced topics now the reason why I'm being very upfront about my plan is so you can make your own informed decision if you're the kind of person who would buy the premium version and then be annoyed when some sections are made free in the future if so then really please don't buy it only buy it if you can afford it and if you're okay with the video lectures being free in the future and if you want all the bonuses for the premium version So speaking of that here are the bonuses for the premium version I came up with some that I think are really awesome and definitely worth it if you can't afford them well at the same time not putting any knowledge behind the pay wall so even people who can't afford it they can still learn from the pre lectures they really just need to do a little bit of extra work themselves the premium version is really just selling convenience making it really easy for you to truly gain the knowledge the premium version comes with a companion project this is a Unity project that contains a bunch of extra content basically the video lectures while being preas of themselves they're still really only half the course the other half of it is inside of this project it has a bunch of custom editor Windows to guide you through each lecture and each lecture has a section on frequently asked questions these are common questions that have some really detailed answers that provide even more details on what is covered in the lecture then there are some quizzes these are multiple choice questions again all with very detailed answers it's really not just correct or incorrect if you pay close attention to each lecture you should be able to get most of these right but whether you do or don't by reading the extra explanation that will help you truly learn that topic then the interactive exercises I'm really happy with this this feature I think this will really help you learn learning by doing is always much better and these exercises encourage you to put what you learned into practice instead of just blindly watching the video lectures I designed a ton of handcraft exercises for all the lectures to help you put into practice and truly learn the contents of each lecture there are all kinds of exercises some are about spotting and fixing errors others are about asking you to Define some function or class or Implement some kind of logic there are some where you just write code and some where you write code and then play the code in unity in order to complete the exercise then each exercise also contains a hint just in case you get stuck or a solution in case you get really stuck as well as a video walk through of me going through that exercise and completing it while explaining everything in detail so if you're the kind of person who gets stuck in tutorial hell then I truly believe that this will really help you escape it in order to learn need to actually do things and this exercise encourage you to do that they encourage you to do it as opposed to just blindly watching the video lectures then the companion project also has a companion window basically this window is also listening to a bunch of errors and if it finds one it will help guide you in the right direction I manually wrote a ton of texts for when to text lots of errors all of them based on common errors that I see people ask about in comments in my own videos so this should help prevent you from getting stuck in your Learning Journey and allow you to get helped instantly then the course also has an AI to help you answer questions this one was trained on the contents of the course and my own knowledge so it should be very accurate and helpful but more than that it's simply the fact that it is extremely fast you post a question in the course comments and within a few minutes the will respond with probably a very good answer although of course I myself will also still be answering all the questions manually the goal with this AI is really speed so you get a response almost instantly and then within the next few hours I will manually insert myself then a simple bonus is how the premium version has the course split into lectures as opposed to Here on YouTube where it will be one giant video it has to be that way due to how the YouTube algorithm works this is a small thing but it can be helpful especially if you take your time to slowly go through the course just like you should do remember that the only goal is really that you are actually learning yourself it does not matter how quickly you go through it so so separate lectures help with that so that you can pause and actually try out your knowledge before going further and you don't have to memorize specific time stamps and over here on YouTube the videos have the normal YouTube ads as usual whereas the premium version has no ads so there's nothing to interrupt you while you're learning another really nice bonus of the premium version is something that I'm going to try out for the first time which is a live study group basically once or twice per week I will go live and post a link to the live stream so people can join in there I will watch the lectures alongside of you then we're all going to read the frequently asked questions together do all the quizzes and go through all the exercises naturally I won't be reading the chat so I won't be able to answer any specific questions you have I've really never done anything like this so I'm really curious to hear what you all think some people like to learn more as part of a group so hopefully this should be quite fun the first live study group is happening next Saturday March 9th and if you can't attend live then as always they won't be recorded so you can watch the recordings later and final bonus is really just by knowing that by buying the premium version you won't be helping hit the goal to make the free video version available for everyone so you will be helping helping to make knowledge available to anyone who wants to learn so these are the nice bonuses that I came up with that I think are really nice and really awesome while not taking away anything or putting any knowledge behind the pay wall if you can afford then I highly recommend the premium version these bonuses will help you truly learn and learn much much faster than the 10 years that it took me but if you can't afford it that's okay like I said there's no hidden knowledge hidden behind the paywall you really just need to put more effort in yourself in order to actually apply knowledge that you gain the free beginner video won be out next week and if you want you can go ahead and pick up the pre version right now there's a link description I added a nice launch discount so you can get it before the first live study group next Saturday so whether you get the premium version or watch you free lectures I really hope you'll learn a lot this has been a ton of work but I'm really proud of the final result I really did put in as much of my knowledge as I could in this course this is basically the course that I wish I had when I got started basically what took me a decade to learn you can now learn much much faster all right so check the link in the description to get the course right now or stay tuned next week thanks so much for watching and I'll see you next time
