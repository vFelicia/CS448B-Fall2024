hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for January 23. this one is only set of paid systems and tools in the last video I'm already covered the best renew assets and the next one I will cover top visions and effects as always there's only see us in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now Unity has a mega bundle running there's three tiers up to 94 off there's quite a lot of awesome stuff even over here on the first year you've got a great modular tour Constructor this would be perfect for any kind of tar defense game or maybe over here you've got some really nice bright Shader effects then there's also some high quality worms a real nice looking scifi space base there's two one to export from unreal to Unity just in case you need that also a whole bunch of collectible items look really nice and on the final tier there's a bunch of tools there's this one grab it which helps you position objects in your scene naturally there's this Mega bundle pack with all kinds of animations for all kinds of worry types I have a crafting animations pack from this developer and it's really nice then there's still want to position objects one for making all kinds of tool tips you can convert your 3D characters into pixelated Sprites and there's a bunch more so check it out with the link in the description also by the way I'm still hard at work on my upcoming free course I've already recorded over 35 lectures it's coming along really nicely I'm still planning to launch you just before the end this month so stay tuned alright so starting off with a navigation package that importantly is built using dots I'm always happy to see new DOT space tools coming out there's more and more every single month this one helps you handle all kinds of navigation you have navmesh 3D pathfinding avoidance in both 2D and 3D you can set up Behavior separation and collision so it looks really nice and importantly is what it says on description which is that while this is built with unity dots it also works very well with regular game objects so this is an excellent example of what I see as a feature of unity packages that do one thing super fast using dots and they work very well when combined with regular games built with regular game objects next here is an interesting one called Fast script reload basically it helps you compound faster I think the trick to this is that it only compiles changes and not the entire assembly I think that's why it manages to be so much faster and with that it also enables hard reload meaning you can write new code and changes that are compound even while the game is running this can be useful especially if you make mobile games and you want to test some new code directly on the target device with hot reload you don't have to make a brand new build just make the changes and test them it does have some limitations like for example it doesn't work with generics or new methods so definitely make sure you read the asset page then here's a very interesting tool that I'm surprised I've never seen before it lets you take player pref snapshots meaning that you can play your game to get to some sort of game State then save those player prefs onto a dedicated file you can save as many snapshots as you want and then easily unload them so for example if you store game data in the player prefs and this can help you keep a list of testing scenarios for me I normally do this while making my own games but since I don't save game that in player prefs I just use multiple save files but if you do use player prefs maybe on some quick prototypes and this can be quite useful although do keep in mind this is not a safe system this is for editor only next for a sort of tool and also sort of visual here is dynamic portals basically it helps you easily create any kind of portal believe me this is a very tricky thing to create it sounds simple it's just a portal just a camera but if you actually try doing it you won't quickly realize just how making it is so different making the visual part is already quite difficult and it's even more tricky when handling objects passing through all the portals this formula keeps physics so just like in the game portal you can jump into one and keep momentum on the exit or you can also throw an object into one and it fires out from the other side so if you have some kind of portal based idea then this one's like a great way to quickly get a prototype up and running then for a simple tool that does the example what you expect here is herp to urp downgrader it does exactly that this soon goes through your entire project it finds everything using egrp shaders and swaps them out for urp now for me I usually stick with just urp so I don't really have this problem but if you have some projects where you'd like to try out hdrp then a tone like this one can help you if you decide you want to go back next for a level editor here is Intel map Pro it has quite a lot of features this is a very well Built tool you can easily generate complex and large levels with a single click it works both during edit time but also in runtime so this could really help in making some kind of roguelike game where you can generate a brand new map every single time it also includes some AI tools so you can get some AI generated towel sets and you can also mix and match both static things and generate things meaning it has a feature where you can place down some important parts in your world like for example maybe some main quest markers that you always want to exist and then you can use it to automatically generate the entire rest of the world really interesting then if you're into voxels and you want to experiment with making something like teardown look at this one you can load directly from Magic of voxel files it uses a smart algorithm to create all of the meshes in a nice performed manner it's also used in the job system to make that mesh variation work in multiple threads so it makes it even more performant then for the destruction modes you can decide to just destroy a voxel or you can replace it with a physics Cube or you can just break it into pieces so if you'd like to make a game kinda like this with some voxel destruction then this could be a great starting point next for some something pretty Niche here you have a game launcher Patcher and updater I'm saying Niche because by default Steam and pretty much every other platform already handles updating for you although this one is not just updates you have launchers you can add some kind of news feed maybe mentioning your other games you can add multiple languages and customize the visual and of course if you do distribute your games offseam like for example on itch which I don't believe has an update system that in that case this can definitely be very useful and by the way if you want to just make a launcher I actually made a dedicated video tutorial on that topic then if you're having performance issues here is a game Optimizer what it does is a bunch of simple optimizations with just one click for example disable physics and rendering on objects that are far away that way only objects near the player are active and actually using CPU resources so it looks like a pretty simple tool but can be quite effective or maybe for another optimization tool here you have the skin mesh combiner this one is quite useful if you have tons of skin meshes like for example if your characters are composed of multiple skin meshes maybe one for the face another for the body another for the weapon and so on updating all of those separate skin meshes is really intensive especially since each of them has a different material that can definitely lead to quite a lot of dracons so this tool takes all of those of those skin meshes and materials and combines them into just one depending on your game this can really help with performance or allow you to have even more NPCs or characters in your entire game alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the NTS store for January 23. there's links on the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also check out my own free and paint assets on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
