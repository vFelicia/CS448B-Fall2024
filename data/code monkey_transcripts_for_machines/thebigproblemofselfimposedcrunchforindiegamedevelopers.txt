hello and welcome I'm your codm here's an interesting article titled diving into the Nuance of selfin Pros crunch now crunch is definitely a big problem in the industry if you don't know what it means that means when you basically have to work way too much so a regular job is meant to be something like 40 hours a week and crunch would be anything that goes above that so it could be 60 hours could be 80 could be all the way up to 100 it is definitely a big problem in the industry because most games right before release there's so much work that needs doing that usually due to either a bad management or way too much scope it ends up with developers having to work 100 hour days in order to hit the release date so it is a big problem in the industry both in AAA but also like it says here something postc crunch for me personally this is definitely something that I've experienced in literally every single game that I've made I would like to say that's not the case but sadly that has been my experience like says on subtitle according to our state of the game industry 23 reports surveying game developers nearly 34s of devs working more than 40 hour weeks said they felt self pressure to do so so yes this is a big problem that definitely needs to be managed if you crunch on toop at some point you won't burn out and you can't do literally anything so this is the something that even though I sort of fail I sort of end up crunching all the time I actively try to work against it so let's see if this article has some tips on how to make sure it doesn't happen just before that a quick message there's an excellent hble bu right now with a mountain ofets on for just 25 bucks if you don't yet have a mega pack like this one then I highly recommend you pick this up anytime you have an idea for a game it is really useful to have a bunch of assets you can easily pick up and use with all these assets you can make tons of really interesting games and if you want to stay up to date with the latest news on Game Dev Tech and gaming then sign up for my gamedev report newsletter if you've seen my videos on that format then the newsletter is really the same idea just text based which lets me do it much more regularly than these big videos so check out both links in the description according to our state of the game industry 23 report about 34s of game developers not that it's self pressure as the reason they work more than 40 hours per week it's by Far and Away the most common answer to the survey question what were the major factors that cause you to work more than 40 hours per week with 36% of deaths noting they don't consider their 40 hour plus weeks excessive 40% mentioned feeling direct pressure from management and 11% from their peers everyone else was working those hours yeah I can imagine that is a big problem when working on a regular company where you're working alongside other people even if you yourself want to make sure that you don't crunch want to keep yourself nice and healthy if everyone else is working 80 hours then you can definitely feel quite a bit of pressure even without anyone saying so in order to work those hours many workplaces in the game industry are out andfor terrible practices and inhibit employees from having anything resembling a healthy work life balance which is obviously not okay and those places should be called out those folks in the 40% who said management pressured them and the 11% who noted peer pressure for the hours over 40 deserve better from their hups it's on management to keep peer pressure from money as well yeah work life balance is definitely a very important thing especially if you want to do this for the long term this is something that I pretty much struggle with every time I'm actively trying to work on it but it is quite difficult and it's obviously even more difficult if management is pressuring you directly to do so and also very difficult if just pure pressure no one wants to be seen as the person who isn't essentially carrying their own weight so yep it is definitely up to management in order to make sure everyone just follows the rules just follows the hours that they should be so those are definitely the very problematic part when management or either peer pressure forces you to work but we need to talk about the 74% phenomena I feel this myself as a person with a couple parttime jobs and my own creative practice the need to hustle is real fueled by a complex blend of anxiety if I'm not the best I'll be letting people down and or I'll be fired and put out on the street American Puritan value mythology about hard work Millennial guilt my parents had it much harder than me I need to work for this and somewhere in there I think a genuine desire to make amazing things personally for me my big problem just comes from selfimposed ambition there are so many things that I would love to do and I want to do them as quickly as possible so the idea of taking it slow taking my time and being like okay I'm okay with achieving my goals in 2 years instead of 6 months personally that is my big problem that is where I really fall so for me it is really just based on a general desire to make amazing things and try to make them as quickly as possible that is my problem all these things and more for many of us combine and make some folks feel like no matter how hard we work it's never enough and will never be enough and that attitude is well bad for anyone heal yep I agree if you're at the point where nothing is ever enough that is definitely very unhealthy Behavior if you're crunching nonstop all the time then it's pretty much just a matter of time until you finally burn out and then you can't do anything so you should definitely work hard to avoid that as much as possible there's a side of this that isn't inherently bad at all the desire to make something amazing if you believe strongly in your project your game specifically then what's wrong with putting some extra hours into it what's wrong with letting that passion feel you what's wrong with losing some sleep or straining your relationships in order to make your game the best it can be yeah so this is definitely the part that I can more relate to I've got many things that I would love to do and I want to do them as quickly as possible so yeah I do end up putting extra hours I do let my passion for the things that I want to do I do let that fuel me however one thing I absolutely do not do ever is losing sleep that never works that is a horrible horrible thing for me I always work way too much but I have never really suffered from burnout and I think part of the reason is partly because this I never ever sacrific sleep every single day no matter how many projects I have no matter what deadlines I have I always make sure to sleep at least 8 hours so that is one thing that I will not sacrifice and I do believe that is one of the main reasons why I haven't suffered from burnout that and taking care of my physical fitness so for me I love working out I go to the gym every single day that combined with not sacrificing sleep I do think it is the main reason why I've never suffered from barov certainly this is going towards the extreme end and I don't mean to imply that anyone who works say 42 hours in a given week has immediately descend into a dissociative damaged psychotic state from overwork it's not a bad thing to push yourself but it is a bad thing to push yourself too hard for too long and many folks end up learning that the hard way so yep it goes back to that everyone can work let's say 100 hour weeks for one to two weeks but if you do it for months on end yep eventually you won't burn out and then you can't do anything so it is perfectly okay to push yourself too hard to hit a particular deadline if you really want if you really believe in that project and you really want it to be the best it can be but make sure you don't turn it into the just the regular normal way of working like anything else in life balance is necessary for some of us it's Elusive and very easy to slide onto the side of doing too much at the expense of other areas in life I'd be willing to bet that many folks who have been in this industry or probably nearly any industry for more than 10 years have wrecked up their share of horror stories from firsthand experience or from beloved friends and colleagues burnout is real and sometimes selfinflicting yeah like I said this is defin a big problem in the industry I don't think there are any stats specifically about solo inie game developers but I'm pretty sure that I'm not an outlier when I say that I've crunch in pretty much every single one of my games so yeah both in either AAA or just working on a company or working by yourself selfimposed Crunch and burnout are definitely problems that you have to be very aware of it's not easy to recognize at any time in human history let alone for folks working in the throws of late capitalism in the middle of a pandemic that is still very much raging on I certainly can't offer any Brilliant Solutions beyond the usual call for universal healthcare that's inclusive of robust Mental Health Services the availability of healthy Hobbies outside of work and the community building that includes networks of support and Care yeah I agree this is very important taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical health being able to analyze yourself and figure out okay when am I getting way too stressed at the point that it's unhealthy it is really important to have that selfanalysis having healthy Hobbies outside of work like I said for me personally I love the gym so that is my main hobby which really helps it really helps counteract all the time that I spend sitting here and just looking at a screen and community building that includes networks of support and care now for me I'm not much of a social person but if you are then you definitely having a nice support structure having people around you that you can talk to about any issues that can definitely always help there's certainly some hope in the statistics here that only 14% of Dev surveyed mentioned management mandated extra hours and the 11% figure for peer pressure yeah I guess it is good that out of all these people only 30% were essentially being forced to overwork together 70% were doing it to themselves I guess that sort of a silver lining here some of the very real discussion and work that advocates for healthy workplaces is making its way through work culture generally and in our industry we see notes on this in other parts of the survey as well in the great resonation section which shows that 16% developers have left a work environment largely for better work life balance or better benefits so I guess it is good that in the industry there is generally a lack of developers pretty much all the studios they are constantly hiring so technically hopefully that means that all these bad practices all those 30% of people that were forced to work hopefully if there is a shortage of developers the conditions actually improve like I said I work by myself I've never worked in a studio but hopefully this is good for the people actually working in studios of those who said they've changed companies or thought about it the leading factors for a potential switch were salary compensation and Company culture followed by being able to work on a specific project franchise work life balance and having remote workf friendly policies yeah these are all definitely great reasons to look for something different and for solo devs like myself it is also very important to keep track of all of these possible things like for me remote remote work is definitely absolutely essential I don't think I could ever work on a company that does not have remote work the idea of being forced to go through traffic every single day just to reach the office that sounds insane to me but thankfully I don't have to do that work life balance like I said is one of my main challenges I'm constantly trying to work on it and constantly kind of failing but my hopes is that in the long term I will eventually figure out a way to make it work working on a specific project franchise again being a soul windy Dev with a gen love for games thankfully this has never been a problem every game that I've worked on has always been something that I was interested in company culture I'm just by myself so this really isn't applicable to my case and salary compensation I'm obviously always trying to get better always trying to make better games that find more success so yep all these factors yep they are applicable to either working on a company or working by yourself so yeah it's an interesting article and selfimpose crunch is definitely a problem both for working in company and working as a solo Indie Dev my best advice to you is what I've said many times which is make sure you don't neglect your physical health if you're a solo indev it can be super easy to just stay sitting on your office and work on your game for 20 hours a day but definitely make sure you don't do that I would highly advise you to not give up on sleep never sacrifice that it never works I would also highly advise you to do anything physical take breaks if you work a 100 hours a week every single week for the rest of life you will eventually burn out and when you do burn out it is really difficult to get back so my advice to you is make sure you don't fall into that trap learn how to analyze yourself learn how to figure out when you need to take a little break and when you do even if there's some wor than he's doing just make sure you take a break whatever you do just avoid going into burnout all right so I hope you found it interesting to hear hear my thoughts on this topic thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
