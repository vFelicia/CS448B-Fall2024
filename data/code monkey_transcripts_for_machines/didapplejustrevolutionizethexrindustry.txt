hello and welcome I'm your code monkey alright so Apple has finally unveiled their mixed reality device this has been rumored for years and years by this point it's a software going the mixed reality headset I don't know anything about what you're talking about for the past few weeks my Twitter feed has been filmed with tons of messages saying that when this happens it's going to change everything so here let's watch the announcement then I'll give you my thoughts introducing Apple Vision Pro the era of spatial computing is here that's a really interesting line the area of spatial Computing is here so apparently they're doing the exact same thing that I was seeing on my Twitter feed as soon as Apple launches something now AR is actually a thing as always he showcase you always gotta take away the marketing from the reality so special Computing has obviously been the thing for quite some time there's been magic leap there was hololens there was the metaquest pro tilt 5 all kinds of things I don't really work with augmented reality but still let's keep watching when you put on Apple Vision Pro you see your world and everything in it your favorite apps live right in front of you so as soon as I watch this my first question is obviously about the external resolution of the color pass through it is great that the capacitor is in color and it is supposedly very high resolution but obviously over here we are seeing a render so this is not the actual reality so that to me is one of the big questions which is just how much Fidelity does this master actually have when you take it off and put it on do you actually notice a significant difference or not in theory I believe the headset actually has quite a lot of pixels so hopefully that should be good I assume the cameras are going to be pretty good considering the price so let's see this is Vision OS Apple's first ever spatial operating system it's familiar yet groundbreaking you navigate with your eyes now this is the part that is really cool being able to use the eyes essentially as a cursor that one is really awesome that does have a drawback which I'm going to mention a little bit about the controllers but at least in terms of concept being able to control things just by looking at it that is really cool that's definitely something that I hope will become more and more common in mixed reality virtual reality and so on as these new headsets all start to have cameras pointing at the eyes simply tap to select flick to scroll and use your voice to dictate okay so tap to select flick to scroll and use voice to actually write things on the one hand those all definitely sound like very intuitive input devices but on the other hand my one big concern with this is so suddenly we have a new entry in this space that is using a completely different input method from all the others so my question especially talking as a developer okay so what is going to happen with all of the interaction toolkits for example in unity's xnri toolkit I haven't used that one yet myself but I assume that one has a bunch of abstraction layers in order to abstract away what specific controlling you're using I assume that has to be done in order to make it work with all the various devices that exist so now that we have one they use a completely different input method I wonder how that's going to be sadly I assume that's going to actually break everything that exists and you're pretty much going to be forced to make one version that works for pretty much every single headset and another version that works is only for Apple so the input does seem externally intuitive but the concerns it as a developer those seem quite bad and of course when it comes to writing texting voice for me personally I never liked that I find that all of these two also converted speech into text so it's pretty much only work if you're using perfect English so for me in my case with my strange accent it usually does not pick up exactly what I want to say so in theory using voice to type that is good but in reality I'm not very confident about it it's like magic I do agree that it's definitely like magic being able to just look with your eyes flick your fingers to do things that does sound really awesome sounds like a really great input method so just speaking specifically about just this one device yep that seems great hey foundational to Apple Vision Pro is that you're not isolated from other people when someone else is in the room you can see them and they can see you okay so when I saw this part in the original announcement you could actually see the eyes but right now maybe I'm blind or there's an issue with this video but I'm not seeing the eyes but anyways so that that feature does seem quite useful or at least that's one of the main concerns about VR is people say that you don't work way too stupid so I wonder does adding eyes help or not personally I feel like simply taking off the headset that would be much much easier but I guess some people might like this one honestly when it comes to the external display for me the main thing is being able to actually mod it that's the one thing that I do find quite interesting so that I thought about and actually post on Twitter was the character wrench from Watch Dogs 2 that character is constantly holding a headset that plays all kinds of interesting Sprites so maybe this is actually going to be the future so maybe in the future people will have all kinds of headsets like this and they'll be able to do all kinds of Sprites to make them look unique something so I could see that as a pretty decent use case but again just as a toy so in reality I don't think it changes way too much Apple Vision Pro is Apple's first ever 3D camera now this is one part that a lot of people were making fun on Twitter but honestly I don't really get it I mean I I do get that it looks quite silly having something staring at your kids it does seem a bit strange but on the other hand I really don't think it's any different from holding a small rectangle like a mobile phone holding a camera I really don't see how it's much different from that so I do agree that it does sound silly very strange but in reality I don't think that's much of a negative really I guess if you were constantly using it it wouldn't look quite a little bit dystopian but I'm envisioning you put it on you record a nice video of your kids you take it out and you go do normal stuff so it sounds silly but personally I don't think it's much to worry about Apple Vision Pro brings the scale and wonder of a movie theater to whatever space you're in you can make the screen as big as you want yeah so playing videos yeah that sounds great but again something that already exists on pretty much every headset it's definitely an interesting use case for the tech but the one big drawback is if you have a big TV in front of you then multiple people can watch it whereas if you're using this device and pretty much every single person needs to have one which at the current cost that is actually quite expensive Vision Pro is a wonderful way to play your favorite games Curry against smart just connect your controller so it's interesting that they're using a PS5 controller usually on things other than pretty much Sony ads usually the Xbox controller is the one that is used so that's definitely an interesting choice and play on a massive screen with Incredible audio and the other obvious thing to note is okay so this is playing flat games it is a mixed reality device so it does both AR and VR however they don't really talk about VR Gaming that much I wonder if that's actually a conscious decision to do that or if that's simply the fact that meta pretty much brought out every single VR studio so they don't really have all kinds of VR content for example beat saber is pretty much the best VR game of all time but it's owned by meta so it will definitely not be on this device Vision Pro you can create the perfect workspace no matter where you are your favorite apps from Apple and the App Store are there you can arrange them however you like and works seamlessly across them being able to actually set up a virtual desktop I do think that is an interesting use case for this deck again especially before the price but would you actually use this as your primary device I can see this being super useful if you're someone who is constantly traveling around so you never have a fixed desktop to play with but if you're always at home would this ever become a primary device this is one of those things where it sounds interesting in theory but in reality I think just having multiple monitors that is so much easier so personally I'm not too sold on this Vision except of course if I were to fly a lot if I was constantly on the road then yep I could see this being very useful and even connect your Mac simply by looking at it turning a 13 inch screen again yet another similar thing and this is quite interesting once again super useful if you're constantly out on the road and you only have a small 15inch laptop if so I could see this being quite useful to have a much bigger screen but once again my one question that always comes up with anything related to Apple is okay so this is work on other things for me I work on Windows I don't have any Macs so with this actually work paired with a Windows device that's a good question like on a plane yeah so on the plane I do see this being quite useful once again if I follow out this would be very great high performance battery reduces weight to a minimum and slips easily into your pocket so the battery is another really interesting thing previously they mentioned how you could use this to watch movies but the battery only lasts for about two hours and as far as I know nowadays most movies are over two hours so that's another example of how it seems like division is a bit ahead of the tech convincingly Place content in your space took thousands of groundbreaking Innovations and custom Technologies since your eyes see the world with Incredible resolution we built a micro OLED display system that fits 64 pixels in the same amount of space as a single iPhone pixel the resolution does seem quite impressive from some numbers that I saw I believe it's supposed to be in like 3 400 by 3400 so that is quite a lot of pixels So in theory the screen should be really good it's more than a 4K TV for each eye giving you jaw dropping lifelike clarity power a spatial computer like apple Vision Pro required an Innovative dual chip design now that's a really interesting thing I don't think any other even the metaquest pro I don't think it's using multiple chips so I wonder if this is responsible for the super huge price tag having to build two chips instead of just one the results do seem impressive but is it worth the cost I'm not sure M2 provides phenomenal performance and a brand new chip R1 processes sensor data at incredible speed virtually eliminating lag the era of spatial Computing is here this is Apple Vision Pro now that's interesting so on the official trailer that they separated from the keynote on this one there is no mention of price or anything so I don't know I think that's fun basically costs 3 500 bucks which is quite a lot the tech does seem extremely impressive but the cost is definitely high up there so based on this I would say those people said apple is going to pretty much blow XR and everything is going to change based on that price point I don't think so but in terms of tech it does seem externally good it does seem like a push attack to the absolute limits regardless of price and I guess we shall see if that strategy is going to work or not and yeah it'll be really fun to try out and experience it the first time can't imagine I'd buy one and use it a lot though yeah I would say that's pretty much the exact same thing for me the tech looks really exciting really interesting so based on Tech I definitely would love to try it out but at that cost 3500 bucks that is quite a lot of money so even if I could technically justify it as a business expense if I were to make a video on it even with that that is still way too much that I am willing to spend either way it's only coming out next year so no point in worrying about that right now basically to answer the question title so that Apple change everything related to XR I don't think so simply because the price point people were saying this is going to be the moment where XR is going to become mainstream but obviously at this price point you can't possibly do that so really exciting Tech definitely targets for more developers to build all kinds of apps and who knows perhaps the next iteration will really hit it big either way definitely exciting to see how much the attack is progressing alright I hope you found it interesting to hear my thoughts on this topic let me know if you'd like to see some more videos like this thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
