guess how many lines of code I wrote in the past few weeks in order to make this demo for my game so how many do you think I wrote in total how many per day honestly with all of this I even impressed myself the amount of mechanics and systems that I built in these two weeks is really insane I have the power system a research stream I also made some dinky orders multiple unique machines tons of UI work and tons of ux improvements and of course I can only add multiplayer which was a pretty big task so compared to what the game was before this printer difference really is night and day so did you take your guess well here's the answer it is sixteen thousand two hundred and seventy nine that's a huge amount that equals about a thousand lines of code per day like I said I'm impressed that I managed to do so much so quickly if you want to try it out you can go play the free demon team right now to see what I've done
