hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here I'm going to check out the top new games made with the interior lunch in November 22. the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all of these games are uniquely impressive so don't listen in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way I'm currently working on my own Sim game called total war on Liberation it's a game with tons of systems open world survival and crafting automation strategy check out the same page edit your wishlist and follow for devlogs alright so starting off at number 10 with one of the more unique interesting releases this month here is pentment this one is made by obsidian so that's the same Studio that made Fallout New Vegas pillars of Eternity the other ones and a bunch more it's great to see such a big wellestablished Studio go for Unity for one of their more smaller scale projects the game itself has a very unique look everything looks like it's taken from some kind of medieval parchment the game is a story focused Adventure game so there are lots of choices to make Mysteries to uncover and a very interesting world to explore this one looks like a great game to play in order to research this very unique sound that they have built next up here we have another entry in the highly popular vampire survivors like genre you control a hero against hundreds or thousands of enemies there are tons of particles flying all over the place lots of attacks to a Dodge lots of enemies to study you can choose from 14 characters and build it from a huge selection of over 150 skills there are plenty of bosses to encounter and lots of Randomness to make every run unique there's tons of games like this one nowadays but this one does seem to be one of the better ones also some of you may notice the assets I don't think they are necessarily from cinti but I do think they are from an ass attack and once again note how that did not stop the game from being massively successful it already has over 6 000 very positive reviews and the game costs 10 bucks so this is a huge hit next up here is against the storm this one is an interesting City Builder that mixes elements from something like Civilization within a large hex world and also combines it with some roguelite elements it looks like a very unique very strange mix there are giant lizards and beavers so it's very much a fantasy setting you can build your city explore the world and survive the elements then you will notice City next door connect both of them and keep them both alive the genre mix looks really interesting on this one I'd love to give it a try to see how they mixed all of these mechanics and despite launching in Early Access it has already gathered over 3000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so this looks like a great game up next here is a game that looks really awesome but sadly does not appear to be finding much success it is called beneath aressa it's a fighting roguelike deck builder that's a nice mix and Visually the game looks excellent It's got lots of thick outlines some great animations and effects I really like the visual style the game has tons of cards for doing all kinds of actions you go through a random path and try to get to the end so it looks to be very well made with some nice compelling gameplay sadly it only has 180 reviews despite having excellent production value hopefully this is the kind of game that will have a huge tail and sound well over time it definitely looks like a high quality game that should be doing much better than this up next here's one that's kind of a personal pick it's Doraemon story of Seasons Friends of the great Kingdom for me I grew up watching Doraemon I absolutely loved it I dreamed of having a magic pouch where I could grab all kinds of awesome gadgets I used to watch the Spanish dub and watching this is how I actually learn all of the Spanish that I know so this is a bit of a Nostalgia pick for me but the game itself doesn't look pretty interesting it's a farming Village Life Sim game so you grow a bunch of crops you raise some animals then you use a bunch of diamond secret gadgets to help complete a bunch of Quests for some friends visually it looks really great it has some very infinite colors everything looks calming and relaxing and it perfectly matches the source material it even has an interesting twoplayer mode so if you want to just a chill relaxing time then this looks like some great fun next up for something a lot more intense here is Among Us VR this game is perfect for VR one of the main mechanics in the original game is line of sight so putting it in first person in VR makes so much sense I'm guessing you already know about Among Us one person is an imposter who must kill all of the other crewmates and those crewmates must avoid getting killed while doing all kinds of tasks you can call an emergency meeting and you have proximity voice to talk to those around you so basically if you enjoy Among Us and you have a VR headset then this looks like lots of fun I'd be curious to try it out to see how they implement the tasks in VR up next here's one with a really nice style and some interesting gameplay it's Ship of Fools it's a seafaring cooperative roguelike play with a friend and a bark on a journey explore a randomized world with tons of dangers walking around on every corner you can choose where to go land on some mysterious islands and grab some loot the boat itself is your health bar so make sure you don't let it sink man the Cannons and defend it at all costs so this looks like another great fun Coop game then for something with some extremely unique gameplay here is the past within it's a twoplayer Coop game where one player plays in the past and another one in the future it takes advantage of unity super broad platform support So this game runs on anything so for example you can play on your PC and your partner can play on a phone or a steam deck the game itself is a mystery puzzle Adventure game although the trailer also has some kind of creepy horror Vibes it has 5000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so if you want something unique then this looks great next up here is a fun sandbox game called roboco I'm always a fan of games where you can build things in this one you can build all kinds of robots from tons of different parts and the goal is to build a robot that can achieve the current objective so things like deliver some food to a customer cut some logs break open a pinata and so on it even has programming automation support with python so you can write some actual code and watch a robot go I also really like how all of the characters react to the robot they're all very cartoony with some exaggerated facial expressions also really awesome thing coming in a future update is VR support building robots in VR does sound really awesome and over here at number one for my personal pick of the month here is Lords and villains for some reason villains is written with an e and not an a it's a bit strange but alright it's a colony Sim game set the name of different world you can build houses set up crafting with some complex resource chains collect taxes and deliver them to the crown the villagers themselves manage these warfronts so the prices fluctuate based on supply and demand the unique hook of the game is the concept of dynasties so you don't directly micromanage every villager instead you handle their entire family and all of their descendants you give each family a point of land and manage how much you tax them I like how it seems a bit more chilled than most city builders there's no massive enemy attacks or giant disasters so if you want to manage a colony with a complex economy and some UniQue Ideas then check this out all right so that's 10 awesome new games made with TNT launch in November 22. I hope this list helped you see how the NT engine is capable of building anything the only limits are really just your own skills and your own imagination let me know in the comments if you play these or if there's any interesting systems in the games you've been playing check out my own steam game total warm Liberation and add it to your wishlist alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
