definitely help your game stand out and up next we have the in latest cinti pack there are actually three new packs they are all about making environments there's a forest a jungle and a swamp all of them in their signature sound so if you have a enlarged worm with some low poly assets you can use these to make the worm film quite a bit more alive speaking of that as you might know I'm currently working on my own same game called turnover Liberation one key feature about the game is that it's in large open world and I'm already using cinti assets so I'll definitely be using these packs to bring that large world to life if you need some Shield effects for a game then check out this pack you've got some circular Shields some barriers some auras the effects also include events so you can trigger the start hit and end effects and of course you can easily change the colors or the size of any of these effects next if you need some cute desert monsters look at this one all of them have faces so this would be perfect for a cute Pokemon like and if you like this style then this dev has a bunch more if you need some handgun animations it's a huge pack it features tons and tons of animations all of them focused on holding a pistol so this is the kind of pack that would be absolutely perfect for a character action game kind of like Devil May Cry if all you need is a single super high quality Mech model check out this one it's a great looking scifi model features 4K textures with the Albedo metallic maps and more it's all rigged and animated with 17 nice animations then here we have some nice city ruins in a cartoony sound lots of greenery so it looks suitable for a postapocalypse but a very Serene one buildings are modular so you can mix and match to get tons of variation next up this one is more of a tool than really a visual asset it lets you create any type of Road features some really impressive customization you can add all kinds of dashes lines colors and arrows see if your game has roads then Justice back won't let you build an entire country if your game has swords then this pack will help you make them special you can add all kinds of orders to

detailed demon check out this one it's got a really impressive amount of detail 4K textures and it comes with five unique skins then if your game features a dystopia check out this one the models definitely look very dystopian kind of like Metro but a little bit more scifi it's a really interesting Style features Two Soldiers a pallet and a huge Mech then for something more Jolly here's a nice steampunk Mac really nice style pretty cute round robot comes with some animations and four skins up next here's a really nice looking car this one is stylized definitely looks a little bit squished which I think actually makes it look pretty cute it has no Interiors or separate doors but it does have some very well modern brake calipers headlights wheels and engine and of course it comes with multiple color variations then if your game has character portraits or some kind of cards you can make them look really fancy with his frame spec they have various levels from very simple to extremely
