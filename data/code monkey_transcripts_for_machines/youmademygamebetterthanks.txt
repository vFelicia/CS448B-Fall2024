hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's just a quick video just to say thank you all for all of your excellent feedback on my game demo I've read so many awesome comments and made so many great changes I've been constantly updating the demo thanks to all of your comments sometimes even pushing two updates per day everything from simple things that I forgot like adding a visual for the version or pausing the game while on the menu as well as plenty of excellent suggested improvements like putting the buildings back into capsules to enable moving them I added a visual indicator to show the contents of the online crate containers I made the Buildings autostarty Construction action and other repeat the research action I had a simple visual to easily see which link is there idle I made the mines jump off before chasing the Target in order to prevent them getting stuck I added some flashing icons to make the tutorial a bit more straightforward I also added lots of tool tips and all kinds of buttons to make things more clear and tons more improvements all of these awesome additions make the game much better and they all came from your feedback so thanks again I also managed to fix tons of bugs thanks to your reports there was one that completely broke everything if the dinky died on be held it never happened to me during development so I never noticed it this is a nice practical example of why testing with actual people is so important everyone plays games in different ways another example is all of the various roles for the buildings since I made them I know the rules myself but a new player won't necessarily know that for example the purple crystals those need a fracking machine in order to spawn the resource nodes together so my advice to you is definitely make sure you get other people to play your games not just yourself that's super important and also speaking to you as an instructor I would highly recommend you add Cloud diagnosis your game this is an excellent Unity tool that has been very useful to essentially prevent and fix bugs without even getting bug reports with this you can go see what went wrong and you can go see the stack trays for every error so you can either fix the bug or add some safety checks it's also been awesome to hear that people play the game in multiplayer with their friends and apparently most of it went well I only got one strange report of invisible dinkies on the client so thankfully the multiplayer part seems to have gone surprisingly smooth my todo list is truly massive thanks to all of your feedback I'm trying to get through it all all in continuing to push out constant updates until the end of Festival if you play the demo right when it came out on Monday then go ahead and give it another play thanks to all this awesome feedback it has already been massively improved since then I'm really happy with the state of the game right now and I'm really excited for the future there's definitely a ton of work left to do but I think the game is shaping up to be really great for the final release I think I managed to read all of the feedback that I could find so if you post a message somewhere and I miss it then please let me know now I've got to quickly finish recording and edit this video so I can get back to work so go ahead go play the latest build and let me know what you think alright so once again thank you all so much for your feedback thank you for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
