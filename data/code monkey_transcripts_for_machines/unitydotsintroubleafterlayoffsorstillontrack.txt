hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's a super quick video just in case some of you are concerned recently Unity had some layoffs which always sucks over 600 people were let go or about eight percent of their Workforce in response to that some people were questioning what this means for various things in development I tried to ask Unity which specific teams were affected but out of respect for those people and they kept that information private and some big news is Mike hecton who was a very important person on the tech side was apparently either included in the layoffs or at least left around the same time for those of you who don't know Mike was one of the big data oriented guys that was brought in several years ago to really posit dots so with them suddenly leaving people were concerned what this means for Dots is there some trouble on that team or are things still going according to plan and I'm guessing in response to those concerns the dots team made a real nice threat in the forums talking about the current set of dots and just having tons of people that are working on the team introduce themselves it's fun to see the background of all these people it's also varied everything from Indie or Tripoli console devs there's even some microchip engineers and astrophysicists basically lots of people working on lot so it's still very much in development it's a real nice thread many comments from both unity and other developers some questions and a bunch of answers up top here is Lauren who is the main product manager in charge of dots then here is Joe which is the director on dots and here is a post related to Mike Laura here says that Mike moved on to other projects about 10 months ago so Joe has been leading the dots engineering effort since then so it appears the layoffs might not have affected the dots team for some specific questions here is one on the dots animation package this one has apparently been the works for quite a while and is hopefully approaching completion this is a pretty big thing so it's rare to see this going to be the next major deliverable I believe this means after 1.0 then a question regarding project tiny this was a fun project which was a way to take advantage of a data oriented design to make super tiny games like literally just kilobytes that project is apparently on pause until the DOT score is done and more things are added on top of it another question on dots visual scripting this was a tool that existed for quite a while way back in the beginning but since then it was paused or stopped the answer is pretty much the same thing so the focus on the same analyzing the ECS Foundation before moving on to more things another question with regards to webgl and dots apparently right now there are some issues with those which are currently being worked on and in terms of timeline here is the first post panel run he says the plan is still to launch dots 1.0 the final version of ECS with netcodes graphics and physics and the plan is to launch that alongside 22 LTS usually the LTS version comes out around April or May so I'm guessing it's really close and I'm assuming that version will indeed have a big dots 1.0 Banner personally I haven't looked into it myself since I made my big tutorial after the 1.0 preview so I'm definitely looking forward to doing some research and seeing how much of that tutorial is still up to date when the final 1.0 is out another excellent post on this red is this one by Andrew Parsons who is the marketing side of dots in ECS here are a ton of resources all about dots and these first two are really great one of them is on the game heroish and the other one on V Rising now what's great about DCU is these are examples of real games using dots on Reddit production meaning that even though 1.0 isn't fully out yet it's already stable enough to work with and ship for a complete Dance Project here is a nice QR tutorial made by turbomix games he also made another video recently talking about what has changed since this video then the GDC roadmap tone quarterly talk a bit more about the main plan for dots and how the goal is to get the core stable and release and then afterwards build upon it next here is one that I've been meaning to look at it's a free course I need to learn with dots best practices I definitely want to make sure that I go through this one before I make my nice tutorial then if you have Discord multiplayer Discord the forums and the web pages so even though dots isn't out yet there's already tons of info around so go ahead and check out this red if you're curious to see the people working behind dots if you have any specific questions you can post them in this rather than get answers from the team themselves from my part I'm looking forward to that's 1.0 and I can't wait to see all of the unique games that this technology will enable so this was just a quick video to let you know about this nice thread and that dots is still on track also stay tuned for tomorrow's video which is going to be super interesting and I'm gonna stop working for a bit and go play a bit of Zelda alright thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
