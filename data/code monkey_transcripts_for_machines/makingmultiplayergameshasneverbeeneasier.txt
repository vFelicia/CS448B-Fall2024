hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey here's a ton of tools that can help you make multiplayer games really easily basically with the help of these tools you can build a really nice multiplayer platform like CAD or build an awesome open world multiplayer game like V Rising you can build an epic Coop Adventure crafting RPG just like valheim or maybe an intense online firstperson shooter like escape from tarov you can build a really awesome experience that takes over to the world like Among Us or some fun chaos with your friends like in overcooked by the way all of these games these are all made with unity and thanks to all these awesome tools you two can build multiplayer games just like these as well now if you just started making games recently then you have no idea how difficult things used to be I've been making games for over 10 years I started making Flash games all the way back in 2008 and back then I did the same mistake as pretty much everyone else for my third Flash game I suddenly had the brilliant idea of why don't I try making a massive open world MMO I worked on that idea for several months and obviously ended up quitting it one big reason why was because I had to do all of the multiplayer from scratch meaning I had to work with some basic sockets and send individual bites for every single action in the game same thing for when I added multiplayer to my first team game made D so it was a nightmare things were really difficult back then but thankfully nowadays you don't have to suffer like I did I just recently released my latest game ding Guardians which does have multiplayer support and the whole reason why I decided to make a multiplayer game after suffering so much from the past was simp because of how easy it is nowadays thanks to all these awesome tools and it's not just easy the tools that I'm going to mention are either completely free like for example Neco fre objects or even the ones like relay have some very generous free tiers I launched my game this month and I still did not go past the free limits so here's the list of all the awesome multiplayer related tools that can help make your multiplayer games a reality you sponsor this video for me to go over each one of these tools one by one to see what they do and how they can help you there's also a link the description where you can get started with Y gaming services and I also have my free multiplayer course which uses several of the tools that we're going to talk about to make a really nice multiplayer game also one very important thing is how all these tools are modular you don't have to use them all you can use all the ones that you need and mix them to fit your particular use case Okay so from this list let's start with netco for game objects this is the main multiplayer tool meaning it's how you actually send data to syn things in your game things like player position when a player scores a point or gain some exp or anything for example in my game I'm using net code for game object to synchronize the player position as well as all the other objects I can synchronize when a building is placed which w't load when a player or a machine picks up something and so on with netod for game objects you can just use Simple components like the network transform which will automatically sync the object transform component so there's no need for you to deal with low Lev bytes or anything like that it's all nicely abstracted away into simple components and functions that make it really easy to use in order to synchronize a player you just create a network manager you set up the transport add a network transform to your player and that's it just with that you have a connection and a transform being synchronized across the network so you can literally have a multiplayer unity game fully working in under 60 seconds this is what I mean when I say that it's so easy nowadays then of course you have tons of ways to synchronize your data using the builtin components is the simplest way but then you also have Network variables you have rpcs Network animators you can play around with client versus servero and so on if you want to learn about it in detail then check out my really indepth tutorial where I go over pretty much everything you need to know about netor for game objects now this tool this one is primarily meant for small scale coop games meaning games like overcooked or Ship of Fools so games more for fun and with a few players but for competitive Games with super fast gameplay for that you have net code for enties like implies this is the networking library that is made with Y dots if you need hundreds of players and super fast twitch action then this is the networking tool you want to use it is extremely fast and extremely capable this one is server authoritative by default which helps prevent cheaters it also includes client side prediction which is an absolute must in some really intense games since it's using dots it is actually insanely performance and everything is separated in a really nice way all of the server logic runs in a separate dots world this is extremely useful during development there's no need to make a separate build you can run both the player world and the do server World both them at the same time this tool naturally requires some knowledge of dots but in terms of capabilities it is definitely unmatched also one quick note remember how when it comes to dots you don't need to go full dots or fullone game objects you can actually mix them both so you can have a game where most of the analogic and rendering most of that is done using regular game objects so pretty much the same way you've always built your games and basically the only thing that is using dots is the highspeed networking connection so always remember you have those options you don't have to go full dots you can download and try out the dots Mega City sample this one is a fully working game with over 64 players tons of objects and actions all of it working seamlessly with super fast connections then regardless of which one of those networking tools you want to use once you have your game with multiplayer logic working then you need some way to connect your players and for that that there are two Unity tools to help you to host your servers you can use either dedicated servers or you can have the players host themselves the best option really depends on your use case usually for super fastpaced competitive games for that kind of game you really want to use a dedicated server but for coop games like for example my own game having the players host themselves works fine so for these two use cases Unity has two tools if you want the players to host the servers themselves you can try to just connect the players directly but chances are you will like encounter tons of issues related to firewalls and natet and the connection simply will not get through so to help solve that you have relay this is a tool that makes connection super simple by helping you avoid all the issues that come with firewalls in that the relay basically is just a server on the internet which acts as a metal man between your various players the relay is easily accessible by any player so it has no issues with connections and the players are the ones that initiate the connection with the relay so even if a player is behind a super strict firewall they can still connect to the the game and of course relay is very well integrated with net for game object so it's really literally just one line of code to set it up I made a dedicated video on it if you want to learn more and I'm also using really in my own game then the other alternative like I said is to use dedicated servers this one is a bit more tricky because you have to individually start and stop servers you have to keep monitoring how many players you have to make sure you have enough servers basically you never want to be in a situation where your game suddenly blows up and you can't handle all that traffic and again Unity has a great tool to help solve this it's called Game Server hosting and it does exactly that it helps you manage your server infrastructure and automatically scales up or down depending on the band by the way this is actually the exact same tool that Apex Legends uses for their servers so if it can handle a massive game like Apex then it can certainly handle your game I also have a dedicated tutorial on how to set up this tool basically you make a server build you upload it to the N dashboard then Define some settings and it will automatically create and dispose of Serv depending on how many players you have if you want to try out game server hosting for yourself then un has a partnership with Google Cloud who is the officient cloud provider right now you can get started with $800 worth of free credit that's a great deal to help you try it out and see just how it performs for your game check out the link in the description for more details and get your free credit for game server hosting this tool is also very well integrated with this next one Matchmaker this is unity's matchmaking system it's how you can match players with one another to get some really nice satisfying and very fair matches for everyone involved you define a bunch of rules for how your player should be matched together you can make it based on location make it based on skill experience or really anything you want you define various matchmaking pools and when a player wants to play a game they simply get added to a pool then the system automatically use the rules you define to match players with one another and when enough players are matched together then the Matchmaker system automatically talks to the game server hosting tool and automatically starts a new server for those players then in terms of adding players to that matchmaking pool you can either add them individually or you can also integrate that with this next tool which is Lobby this tool helps you create and manage player lobbies so you can create a Lobby you can Define all kinds of data for it like for example the max number of players what is the current game mode current map and so on each player can also have its own custom data so things like what character they have selected what is their role player name skill points and really anything you want you can have lots of lobbies either public or private players can join lobbies they can search browse and so on it's really a very useful tool for grouping your players together also this tool works by itself or with either dedicated servers or player host servers meaning it can work without a game server hosting or relay for example in my own game I am using relay to connect the players and I'm also using Lobby to group them together the players join together in a Lobby then they press on ready and the connection is established through relay and then the net code for game MERS connection that connection is actually started but of course like I said all of these tools are modular so you could also join your players together in lobby then create a matchmaking ticket for all of those players set up a dedicated server with game server hosting and hel the networking with net code for game objects again remember that all these tools are modular it's up to you to decide which ones best fit your game then in a lot of multiplayer games communication is key and for that you have vvox this is a tool that helps simplify adding both text and voice chat to your games again this is yet another battle tested tool it's already been used by Rainbow Six Siege and valun to handle their voice chatting so it's already extremely capable very robust tool you have voice chat like in various team games meaning you can have separate channels where your players can talk to one another alternatively you can also use it for 3D positional audio meaning players can only talk and hear players that are nearby this one is super useful for games like MMOs or simply some large open world multiplayer games where you really only want your players to be able to hear nearby players it also supports text chat super easy to let your players chat with one another it has all the features you expect effect like push to talk volume management muting and so on and it also works crossplatform meaning you can voice chat between a player on a PC and a player on mobile related to that is another Super useful tool that is currently in beta called safe voice this one lets you analyze voice chat in your game to identify and deal with toxicity this is one of those problems that can very easily destroy an entire Community just a couple of Bad actors is going to be enough to destroy your game so this tool helps solve that it uses AI to identify potentially disruptive behavior which you can then deal with now when it comes to all of these multiplayer tools you need some way to authenticate your player so you know who is who for that you can use Unity authentication this one supports a ton of login methods you can use any of these that you want like Google or steam you can use any open ID connect protocol and of course on consoles it also supports their specific Xbox or Playstation logins that tool helps you assign a unique ID for each player and then something that use authentication for a great use is this next to which is Friends it helps you keep track of all of your players and create some friend lists again one of the main benefits of this tool is how it's multiplatform so you can have some players play on PC and then add an Xbox player to their friend list with a friend list you can then easily create friend invites to let friends easily join your multiplayer matches another great and simple tool is leaderboards this one does exactly what it says it helps you very easily set up leaderboards for your games you can add scores you can remove them you can see scores for all of your friends create multiple leaderboards for different game modes different Maps and so on all super easy to use with the builtin package and one tool that is not limited to just multiplayer but extremely useful in really any game is analytics this is how you can track and analyze literally anything in your game it's up to you as a developer to decide what data would be useful to help you make the game the best it can be so for example in my own game I used analytics to track the tutorial completion rate using this data from the demo build it helped me see where players were getting stuck So based on that I added a bunch of improvements which made the game much better for the funnel version you can track all kinds of events add any metadata that you want you can create funnels analyze the data in a million ways you can view player retention average playtime and stuns more sets this is really one of those tools where you can go really deep if you want but if you just take a few minutes to implement the absolute Basics just that will help you make your game much better so with all of these tools making multiplayer games has really never been easier check out the link in the description to get started making multiplayer games make sure you grab the free credit for game server hosting try it out and if you want a stepbystep guide then check out my free multiplayer course in there I use net code for game objects coupled with Lobby and relay to make a really nice multiplayer game that game itself was actually the base upon which I built my steam game dinky Gardens I hope that with all of these tools you to can make your multiplayer dreams of reality so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
