hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with TNT launching July 23. this month was really difficult to pick just 10 there were at the very least 30 Unity games that looked extremely interesting this month I didn't even include a VR game just to have one more slot as usual that's great news for players lots of awesome stuff to play but really tricky for the developers tons of really tough competition with everyone vying for the Player's time and this month also has a nice amount of Indie sequels which are always an interesting topic since it is very rarely do sequence the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts that to the test all these games are uniquely impressive so don't listen in no personal order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also I'm currently working on my own steam game the Guardians it's a fun game with some automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you can build a colony automated it and keep the tiny defenseless thingy safe from her there's a freedom where you can play go ahead edit your wish this info for devops just a quick mention the SSR is doing a best off sale for just a few more days most of the assets that I use in making my open world game are currently discounted so if you missed that first thing look at it quickly I don't know when this repeat one is ending and if you need thousands of assets or sound effects at almost 99 off check out the links in the description alright so starting off at number 10 with a highly anticipated puzzle game that just came out it's viewfinder this is one of those heavily cerebral puzzle games with one extremely unique mechanic in this case the mechanic is you hold the camera which can take pictures then you can take those pictures and intentionally add them to the world so if there's a huge gap in the world you can take a picture of a bridge then place that bridge in the world and just move through it it's a very interesting mechanic and to me the most amazing thing is wondering how all of this works in technical terms basically when you take a picture it needs to somehow store all that mesh natter whilst taking perspective into account then when doing reverse when placing the picture back in the world you got to do the same thing grab that mesh data and somehow apply it based on where the camera is looking and cut and slice all the objects in the world so in technical terms this is really impressive and it's definitely one of the more inventive puzzle games come on in the past few years and it seems like it's really not just a gimmick but rather a well proper made puzzle game it's already got over 1500 very positive reviews so if you enjoy unique puzzle mechanics then definitely give this one a look next for a nice Indie sequel here we have oxen free 2. this one is actually published by Netflix which is quite interesting it's a story heavy game just like the first one in this one you have all kinds of options you talk to various people and try to solve the mysteries of this town use your radio and set it to various frequencies and listen you also have a wonky donkey which you can use to talk with anyone from anywhere it's heavy on choices heavy on relationships and heavy on mystery they mention how it works both as a direct sequel but also Standalone if you haven't played the original it seems to be doing pretty well with over 700 very positive reviews then for another Indie sequel many many years in the banking here is xenonauts too the original one came out all the way back in 2014 and now finally we have a sequel this one is an XCOM mic but it's more like the original XCOM rather than the 2012 remake so it's really indepth really detailed on all kinds of actions you can take very complex strategic layer as well as static on combat the premise is the same aliens are attacking everywhere in the world and you must defend there's a massive variety of enemies each with their own weaknesses and strengths every engagement has a nice wrist versus Ward when you blow the enemies with exposes from distance or get opposing personal to try to capture them alive to learn some more you can construct buildings in the stretching layer to Aid you on your fight you can research all kinds of vehicles aircraft armor and weapons train your soldiers and send them into action where you can command them in a grid taking actions one turn at a time it is out now in Early Access and reviews are mostly positive it seems mostly complaints is that it simply doesn't add too much on top of the original and some of the new mechanics do feel a bit unbalanced personally I've had the original one on my two playlist for many years now I wonder if I should try that one or just jump into this one then every month continues to have vampire survival likes this month a really interesting one is called yet another Zombie Survivors this one manages to Stand Out by being more realistic most of the survival likes they have lots of fantasy elements and this one does have some zombies but beyond that it's pretty grounded you've got regular characters and regular weapons you control a team leader that won't lead your other survivors you can upgrade survivors in various ways he can grab new items and choose powerups the gameplay is just like you expect so it's not a topdown shooter but rather it's an auto shooter you just move around slaying hordes of zombies pick up some upgrades die then do it all over again it's actually a bit more expensive than the usual survival likes it's 10 bucks but that has not stopped people from picking it up it's already got 2500 very positive reviews even though it's only in Early Access so this one is definitely already a huge hit then here's one that has both flat and VR modes it's the breakin in this one you break into various buildings and pretty much steal anything that isn't bolted down you get in through a window see on the TV and throw it to your buddy outside to place in the getaway vein you also have some tools at your disposal you can throw a grappling hook for a quick getaway or just bring it back to store any jewelry although do make sure you don't make any noise that might wake up the resonance each mission is randomized so you need a new plan every time that also includes any NPCs or security cameras so keys in the place is very important part of the plan it works in single player or four player online coop also some players can be in VR and some in flat suits then for some fighting management here is punch love too this one is the sequel to the game from 2016. I played the original quite a long time ago and I remember that I really enjoyed it this one is set in the future it's an RPG management game all about fighting you train your character do pushups to gain strength run for some stamina and unlock all kinds of kicks and special moves when you go to fight it's all automated you just pick the skills in the character fights but it's not just fighting stats you also need to live so you need to work some Minion jobs to get some cash which you can then use to buy food or get into a gym if you're into Easter eggs and this game is perfect for you every game has some gorgeous pixel art filled with references to things like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles there's the gender from Scrubs Precast from Minority Report and tons more of it looks really interesting there's lots of side quests and quirky characters to meet I really enjoyed the original so I can't wait to try this one it's out now with 1000 very positive reviews up next here is a fun Simulator game called gunsmith simulator like name implies this one is all about handling all kinds of guns you've got tons of tiny parts that make up the home gun personally I know nothing about guns but this seems very detailed very realistic you accept some orders fix what's broken renovate what is old and customize the weapon you can put together all kinds of guns from AK47s to a bunch of Pistons uses shotguns or bolt action rifles take out each part individually clean it paint it and put it on back together again and of course when everything is back together you can go to the gun range to try them out the simulator games live or die based on the concept and a Gun simulator is certainly an interesting concept some of these similar games also usually have a ton of change but this one does seem quite solid it is out now in Early Access with 500 very positive reviews next for yet another sequel here is Ultimate epic battle simulator 2. I remember when the original game came out it blew up like crazy every YouTuber was making videos on all kinds of insane scenarios like 100 Modern soldiers versus 10 000 Spartans personally I even attempted a similar game myself I made hypernice battles which was a fun experiment but definitely very janky in this one you create battles using all kinds of unique and strange characters things like zombies Spartan soldiers there's even some special ones like Willy Wallace in the KoolAid men this one seems to feature the same gameplay but on a much larger scale there's an insane amount of units on screen and some really huge worlds again this is all made with UNT I don't even think they are using dots so I wonder how they got this much stuff working probably required a massive amount of engineering effort pushing multithread code to its limits it's even got some impressive physics simulations with some giant explosions and tsunamis it's quite hard to top the scale of the original but this one seems like they didn't honestly nowadays I wouldn't think this type of game is popular but apparently it still is they've already got over 3 000 very positive reviews so clearly people still love this Nissan then if you're into some roguelike action check out Amber Knights it's top down fastpaced action there's tons of bullets flying around so there's some bullet Helm mechanics as well everything is super fast paced you must Dash hack and slash there are six distinct weapons which sounds like a small Mount but they can be combined with modifications skills and Relics for near infinite customization you challenge Defcon passes try out different builds and don't be afraid of that visually it looks great there's lots of colors and flashy effects the game works in both single player and Coop either online or split screen this one was an early access for quite some time and just hit 1.0 in all that time it gathered 2500 very positive reviews so this one is a huge hit if you're a fan of this genre then definitely check it out and at number one for my personal pick month here is an excellent first person Factory automation game named tectonica it is set beneath the surface of an alien planet so that's how it differs from some like satisfactory you start by gathering resource notes manually then you make the machines together them for you take those resources and craft some more complex items gather more advanced resources build more and so on and on the caves are gorgeous with some great looking bioluminescent 4 even though the entire game is underground it is actually quite colorful it supports creating some truly massive factories looks like the game is very well optimized there are also some nice rails that you can use to transport both yourself and your resources across vast distances divining looks to be quite interesting you've got a black hole machine that digs into the terrain in a very satisfying way the whole game works in both single player and Coop multiplayer it is out now in Early Access and they seem to have a very robust very clear road map on the page they mentioned how the plan is to be in early access 43 years and they've also been running an alpha alongside a community since last year so this is only extra is already quite published it's currently got 500 very positive reviews so if I can find the time I'd really love to give this one a try alright so that send out some new games made with Indian lunch in July 23 I hope this list helps you see how DMT engine is capable of building anything the only limits are really just your own Stills and Imagination check out my own game dinky Guardians and end your wishlist all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
