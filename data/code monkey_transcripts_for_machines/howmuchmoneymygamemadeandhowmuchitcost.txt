hello and welcome I'm your KMI so last month I launched my latest Team game it's called dinky Guardians it's a fun game with some automation Colony building in defense mechanics it has now been a month since the game has launched 7 months ago in March I published the announcement video where I talked about the game and what were my goals with it in order to analyze all of these goals and see if I hit them I'm going to share the sales numbers for this game I'm also going to go over what were all the costs involved in making this game so how much I spent on artists musicians translators and so on also of course what assets and tools that I use to make this game and then also in the end I will also talk about one very important cost that you should definitely consider as well as my general takeaway for this project the game is out on seam and it's actually on sale this week also put out a really nice update yesterday polishing tons of things and adding tons of quality of life improvements so go play it again or pick it up for the first time now right away the thing that most people want to know these sales numbers I won't click bait you and keep you waiting so if you want the numbers here they are right away these are the numbers for the first month now these are the raw numbers but by itself these numbers don't really say much they don't really say if the game is a hit or if it's a flop so let's analyze these numbers to see if they are good or bad and one great thing about having this channel is simply for documenting my own journey I made a video sharing my goals for this game right when I announced it so let's hear what I said in the video 7 months ago with all the math done here are all of the main goals launch a game in July of 23 launch with 10,000 wish lists have those wish list convert into 1,000 week one copy sold and 3,000 year one copy sold do that in order to hit $20,000 in gross revenue and $8,000 in net revenue which would equal around $2,000 per month development which would be a decent amount now let's split this into three scenarios so this one is the good scenario half of these amounts would be the bare minimum scenario and double would be the great scenario these are my goals with this game so yep these are the goals that I defined now some of these I hit and some I didn't the first obvious one is right away the release date the original plan was in July of 23 which I obviously missed by quite a bit now now this is also one of those scenarios where honestly I have no idea what I was thinking even in the original scope of the game which was quite a bit more limited than the final version even that would have been really tricky to get done in this short time frame I'm pretty efficient but 4 months to make a complete steam game that is quite an insane amount quite fast so I guess this is a good takeaway for all of you if you make overly ambitious plans that eventually blow up on your face then don't be too harsh on yourself as you can see even with my 10 years of experience making games I still get it wrong by quite a bit making games is always extremely difficult G so it will always take you quite a bit longer in the end I started working on this game all the way back in March I actually made the original prototype on the plane flying over to GDC and now I've released the game in October so in total 7 months of development but more importantly looking at these goals my main goal for this year in general was to publish another game so even though I got the date wrong I definitely did not launch it by July I still managed to hit my important annual go so I definitely consider this success but because I got the development time wrong I need to basically adapt these numbers to get them more accurate picture my definition of success is still pretty much 2,000 per month over here in Portugal I can live a pretty good life with this amount that's above the national average so with 7 months of Dev time the net revenue over here this one should be 14 and the gross revenue this one should be 35k now in terms of number of copy sold these numbers are actually still correct that is because under the original plan I was going to price the game at $7 but in the end I end up going with 15 so y these amounts 1,000 and 3,000 these are correct and looking at these yep I did manage to hit 1,000 copy sold on the first week which based on my estimate should inde translate to about 3 to 5,000 in the first year so that's correct and based on that I estimated that it should be able to hit 50,000 in gross revenue which should indeed lead to more than 14,000 in net revenue which should indeed make for a Target monthly goal above 2,000 so yep in the end it should end up hitting all of my revised targets even though the timeline was off by quite a bit even with that it looks like everything is on track to be a pretty nice success the only thing I definitely did not hit was over here the wish list the game launched with 43 00 wish list so quite a bit less than my minimum Target of 5K but the goal of wish list is of course to turn into sales so if I hit the sales Target then I'm still happy with my wishless amount so looking at this original plan I would say things have gone quite well the game is certainly not a mega hit by any means but it is going to hit my very nice good goal however these goals these sales numbers this is really just the revenue part it is obviously very important to also remember that everything has costs in fact in my case the cost is probably the most important part the main reason why I've been making a living from my games for over 10 years now the main reason is really because my costs are so low I've never had a mega hit I'm simply extremely productive extremely efficient and I live in a low cost country so for cting cost the m one is obviously time like I said took me 7 months to build this game my expenses are about 1,000 to, 1500 per month so if we do, 1500 * 7 that equals 10k.in logo you might have noticed that the game actually has had two logos the first one look quite a bit bit more casual but as the development progressed I leaned quite a bit more into the automation mechanics so by the end I felt it need like a bit more of an automation type logo so I got a second logo just before the final game release the cost for both logos was 50 plus 100 then I also hired the musician to compose some original music actually hired the same one that did the music for kitchen chaos I was really happy with the result for that one so I contacted the same person for this one I got three really nice custom tracks for 360 bucks then another thing that I paid for was localization like I mentioned the video talking about how the seam algorithm Works localization is extremely important and using today's tools actually pretty simple to implement so it is definitely something you should add I made sure to localize both the game as well as the store Page I localized it in English plus seven other languages I hired a translator for each of those languages for a total of 740 bucks then the reason why this was my first 3D game was because I finally learned how to use assets the reason why my previous games those were all made in 2D that was was simply because I could not model any 3D things at all but nowadays I know how to use assets to help me find the visuals that I need however at the same time tracking the cost for this actually quite a bit tricky that's because I really don't remember how much I paid for them I probably bought most of the assets on sale either a 50% sale like the ones that are constantly happening on the asset store or some of them I probably bought in a hum bundle for like 95% off and some of them I was given for free and on top of that of course assets are not really just a onetime thing I've used a bunch of these Assets in plenty of projects and I will continue using them in many projects in the future so that makes it quite a bit tricky to Cate a accurate cost for all the assets that I used to make the game but still here is a list of all the nice assets that I used I got a nice pack for all my characters with all the customization for the zomies and the dinkies then for the cartoony visual I got a nice Shader for helping me polish things I use feel for animating the text I use text animator then for finding assets in all the tons of packs that already own known for that I use the ENT inventory super useful for building it in terms of visuals the main things that I used was the polygon scifi Worlds speack the particle effects the SciFi space and the icons back I've always been a fan of the cinti studio style and finally I got a chance to use it in a proper game then for the animations I've used this pack which I've used in tons and tons of videos this one has been one of the most useful things that I've ever bought for tweaking some animations I use umotion Pro for the UI I grab this UI pack for a really nice screen space effect I grab this one it add some really nice shadow and all the nooks and crannies it looks really good for the construction effects I use the disolve effects and of course while working multiplayer like I covered in my free multiplayer course for that one it really helps to be able to have a console that you can access in easy ways and for that I use the quantum console just like I used previously so these are pretty much all the assets although I did pick some things some sound effects from other random packs but I'm not sure exactly which one so I didn't include it here either way if I add up all the math on all of these if I add up the math on all of the undiscounted price for all of these if I add all of those then the total price is supposedly $1,300 but in reality like I said I bought most of these either half off or in a Humble Bundle for like 95% off and like I said these assets are usable in multiple projects so for the math let's use half of this amount so let's say 600 bucks then the other cost that I had was actually an experiment basically I tried out paid advertising now this is something that usually the general consisten is don't do it paid ads are nearly impossible to get a return unless you have a Prett expensive game game so this really only usable for AAA and triaa Indie but in my case my experiment the strategy that I went for wasn't necessarily try to get sales but rather try to get wish list before release and the extremely important part about my strategy was that I pretty much put it on the lowest cost possible and just let them run for several months so basally the ads only ran when nothing else was available that way I paid as little as possible while trying to reach as many people as possible I used Google ads and here as you can see I spent a total of 1.4k that got me 13,000 clicks for an average cost per click of 11 cents and then I also tried out Rd ads and over here I also spent pretty much the same amount so 1.4k got a total of 19,000 clicks for a total of 7 cents per click so the total cost on these ads was about 2.6 now sadly steam doesn't really have any tracking tools for this kind of stuff for tracking where the wish list came from so honestly I really have no idea if this experiment was a success or not I have no idea if this was great or if it was a complete waste of money no idea how many wish lists and sales it eventually generated if any although I already knew that which is why I went into this experiment with very low expectations that is why I didn't really spend too much and considering how the cost is so low and reached so many people I have to assume it had at least some kind of impact but again I really have no idea to verify it so putting everything together the total cost to develop this game the total direct cost was about €4,000 plus it costed my own time about 10,000 put all that together makes for a total cost of about 14k now if I put all these costs against the revenue after 1 month with gross revenue of 19,000 which equals 13.7 th000 in gross revenue then of course steam takes their 30% cut so the total amount that I'm actually going to receive is about 9.6 If I subtract the cost then technically right now I'm actually in the red by about 5,000 but if I manage to hit my estimate for the first year if so then the game might actually end up turning a profit out of about 5,000 so again I'm pretty happy with this result however there's actually another a potentially huge cost that we probably should calculate although I should say this one is more kind of like for fun it's a theoretical cost but still one you should include in your cations what I'm talking about is the opportunity cost meaning what else could I have done with my time other than making this game usually the topic of opportunity cost usually that comes when deciding to do something for money rather than for fun like for example if you want to make games you might join a AAA developer and make something like 70k but if you got a job outside the games industry if you got something like Google or Facebook you could probably get around 200k so that's the opportunity cost you could have made 200k but you chose to make 70k technically that would be a negative cost of 70k but there are definitely things more valuable than money that is why I say that this cost is really mostly for fun just because you make way less money in Game Dev that does not mean it is the wrong choice so for example in my case if I compare to a regular job that I could get here in Portugal I've never had a real job so I have no personal experience but I did some research and apparently software devs here get about 1,000 per month compared to that my go monthly amount is already above it so objectively speaking for me making a game is more profitable than anything else I could do over here but of course I also have the option of all the other things that I could have done instead of a game for example I could have done nothing but YouTube for all this time although that would also not compare very well to making a game YouTube ads actually pay pretty badly especially in the Game Dev Niche there's not much money to go around on this channel if I get about a million views per month that equ will see a bit under $2,000 if I was doing nothing but YouTube I think the channel would grow a bit but definitely not something like 10x so comparing making a game with just fulltime YouTube making a game is still the better option in my case the better comparison simply comes from Paid courses considering how much time I spent working on this game for seven months not stop I think in that time if I was focused on making course I could have made two maybe three courses and from experience I think those course could make about 40K each so in total by making course I could have maybe made something like 120k that does compare quite higher relative to making a game so in theory if my goal was to make money and nothing else if so then the best option would have definitely been make some paid courses and just do that but again like I said money is just one aspect that's why I say that cating this is really mainly for fun I intentionally wanted to make a game that was my main goal for this year the secondary goal was simply to make it profitable and looking at the numbers I did achieve that goal so as long as I can achieve my goals of keep making games and keep making a living then honestly personally I'm pretty happy I definitely don't feel the need to maximize profit at all cost if I can make a living doing what I want to do then I'm very happy and if you yourself decide to take a pay cut in order to work on games that may very well be worth it it all depends on what you want and what kind of life you want to live but like I said cting the opportunity cost this is really just for fun the real numbers are these ones how much money the game made and how much it cost and of course the game is more than just numbers all in all personally I'm really happy with this project my main goal was publishing another game this year and I did that so I'm very happy with having achieved my main goal as the year is coming to a close I really hope you also achieve your goals for this year now this is actually the part where I wanted to do a postmart and talk about what went right and what went wrong with the making of this game but I still need to write and record that part of the video so this one is really just focused on the hard numbers and the future one I will talk about what went right and what went wrong with this project but in general yep I'm happy with the numbers and how the game came out I really hope you've enjoyed following this journey over these past months starting with the first announcement all the way back in March until now the first month's results I really hope that this inspires you and gives you motivation on your own game d Journey all right so check out the game on seam if you haven't already thank you for watching and see you next time
