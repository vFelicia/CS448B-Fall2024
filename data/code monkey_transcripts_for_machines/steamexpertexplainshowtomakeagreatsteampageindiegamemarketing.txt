now one thing I am going to talk about is see this this is good way to go yev I've heard you say that the Indie tag is something that you should avoid so can you say why that is what is the most unique thing about this game and how long do I have to spend on the steam page before I figure it out cuz what I did was I study I I got about a dozen people and I watched them shop for steam Pages for an hour at a time is it worth it trying to update and optimize a team page after release there's so much junk out there you have to prove in your screenshots we are like the highest quality game cuz that's what steam Shoppers are looking for cozy games folks are really hot that's how people watch trailers they're just skipping ahead looking for gameplay I'm just going to break to to give you Hugo some credit the list that you sent me if this is from your community you have a great Community great games are in are in the selection so really high quality stuff be confident just like yeah this game's freaking awesome you're a freaking bear hello and welcome I'm your kmy this is the second special video that I'm making with guest Chris Sakowski Chris is a steam marketing expert a lot of my own personal knowledge about marketing a lot of it I learned it from him I've been reading his newsletter for years it's basically how I keep up with the seam algorithms changes and it's also how I learn what are the best practices currently by using all of that knowledge in a practical way is how I've been able to find success with my games now in the previous video Chris already gave a great crash course on C marketing and I asked him a bunch of common questions definitely go watch that video If you haven't seen it yet now here on this one we are going to do something very interesting I met a post as asking you all if you had games on Steam so thank you all so much for posting all of your games I actually got a ton of submissions I was expecting maybe a couple dozen but I got literally hundreds there's way too many to cover in just one video I tried my best to pick a nice variety lots of genres lots of different budgets some pages already look great While others have some room for improvement so thank you for some Min your games and even if I didn't pick your specific game you can still learn from all of these to see what makes a great seam page I'm going to ask chis about the seam pages and what they're doing right and what could be improved a great SE page can definitely be a massive help in getting you more wish lists and more sales and speaking of wish lists afterwards if you want to keep on learning all about marketing Chris is currently running a sale on his courses if you want to get a ton of marketing knowledge in a really condensed form then I H recommend you pick up his wish list and visibility Master Class it teaches you how the seam algorithm Works how to create a great seam page what makes a great demo how to contact the press and so on and how to do all of this without paying thousands to some PR Company so check it out to the link description down below the sale ends really soon so definitely go ahead and get it quickly okay so let's see my conversation with Chris and analyze what makes a great steam Pate all right so Chris welcome back thanks for being here again uh so I mean most people have already seen the previous vide so they probably already know who you are but just in case give a quick intro of who you are and what you do hi my name is Chris sukowski I'm a marketing Guru that people say I don't like that term I just study steam a lot that's what I do I just study steam um and what I do is I analyze how the market Works what works what doesn't I interview devs who have had successes and some who have almost had success uh so I really study the marketplace and then help Indies uh get their game out there get it doing the best it possibly can uh so thanks so much for having me back Hugo I really appreciate it okay awesome yeah I can't wait to learn more about how to create a great steam page so that's the goal with with this little video so let's see if all of us can learn how to get a better steam page which does matter quite a lot since a great seam page is the difference between getting thousands of wish list or Z so this definitely something very important that everyone should learn so yeah I picked a bunch of games I I asked the community got a ton of submissions way too many to go through so let's go through a bunch of them and try to learn what makes a great scam page fantastic and actually for the first one let's start off with a special one so basically let's start off with my own game dinky Gardians this is something that I published last year and actually uh this is a game that I mean like I've said I've been reading uh Chris's newsletter for many many years so basically I applied my own marketing knowledge that I've learned over the many years into making this page so hopefully the page is good I mean at least in terms of results the game was quite successful I did manage to hit my goal so that was awesome so yeah I I put in all the knowledge it worked so but yeah I'm always interested in learning how I could improve so yeah Chris go ahead all right thank you so much so just to set some context yes the game is the most important thing that's what determines your success the steam page can just support what you've already got and one of the things that I always say is your steam page um needs to accurately uh represent your game in as fast as possible so um overall very good steam page now what I always try and do is figure out like without without looking at it can I figure out the genre and kind of What the hook is without going too deep like because most people just spend 30 seconds looking at a steam page to see if they like it and so uh you know when I was looking at the short description here that's kind of where people start um I saw lot of things but I think with the thing that you're that really took took that grabbed me was oh right down here go repopulate the entire galaxy with dinkies keep them safe fully automated everything that is a good description of I think what this game is and I think what you need to do is kind of ramp up how much you explain that because I thought this was a great statement it just didn't go everywhere so I really in other words I wasn't as present as I could see it on some of these pages and when I was going to the steam Pages yes I see the dinky here but when I go through it's a lot harder to see the dinkies I see the the the main character I see some crafting menus some automation like a tower defense aspects of the game which are all great and it looks good it's just I don't see enough I mean there's one little dinky right here um and then the guy no dinkies but this guy is here so basically what I was thinking is um yes right there okay so there's this screenshot and I really think that um right up front I always say the first four screenshots are most important because that's what shows up when you hover over the mouse I really think there needs to be more dinkies in the uh in the the screenshots uh it remember the first four like I said is what most people see and there's this but what visually just from a graphic design standpoint this is what stands out this my what my eye goes to is this giant Rocket taking off it wasn't until later I was like oh wait look at that little guy back there so I would put more uh dinkies in if they're the if they're the purpose for the game um you you breed them you automate them you try and get them to the other planets I think that's a great one two three of what you're trying to do I would try and build a level even if it's totally impractical totally covered in dinkies so you get the point like within the first couple screenshots oh my God I gotta make these guys um that was the main thing and I think it's an interesting hook I just think you need to bring it to the Forefront so that everybody can see it okay that's a yeah that's a really interesting point it's uh yeah because the game is basically you start off by dinkies start off telling the dinkies what to do keep them safe keep them fed and so on and then eventually you upgrade into machines so that eventually dinkis don't have to do anything but yeah it is a very good point I haven't considered about it I definitely did focus more on showing more like late game because I figured okay that is going to be a bit more visually interesting but yeah you are absolutely right definitely should show a bit more of the I guess the core concept of the game in the screenshots nice yeah and what happened was what that means when when I see it I was like oh well it's another automation Builder Tower Defense T type game but you have an interesting hook so by um by showing the late game you you you didn't show the hook which are these cute little pink guys so yeah double double triple down on the pink guys you even if it's not the full late game yes show some of that later on some of the the more advanced machines but your first three screenshots should just be covered in pink guys let's do it bring out the pink guys okay all right uh one other little thing that I think is um I really I I I like that statement that we rolled down to below where it just said hey uh repopulate the Galaxy with dinkies I kind of like um that instead of this short description this short description is very complicated and I kind of tuned out about the second sentence because there was so much information coming at me I like the Emojis I would just take this I think this is good this is still good but it deserves to be in the about this section which is further down I like that previous one down here I would just swap these two I think this does a better summation of what you're trying to do this sentence right here the goal I like this I would just make this the short description and bring that one with the Emojis down to here all right so so you think the short description should be a bit more simpler as opposed to trying to cram in as many as many mechanics as you can because that was basically what I was trying to do trying to explain everything that the game has you think it's better to go a bit more simpler I think that's I think that's a wiser choice if people are sold by that short description they'll go down to investigate more and that's where you hit them with all all the complexity okay all right so yeah that was great feedback thanks so much and now for the second one let's also do a bit of a special one let's do one that I personally I think it's a great example of a great steam page so let's see if Chris agrees so we can basically see what makes a great steam patch so that we can then learn and see differences between our own pages in this one and see what we can do to improve so go ahead okay well this is Manor Lords a mega seller this game sold very well now I'll just be honest again it's the game it's not the steam page like the steam page is good but even if you made this the most perfect steam page like manner Lords you're not going to sell a million copies unless your game is as good as Manor Lords uh Manor Lords the reason I did so well is it's the perfect genre for steam it's dark it's medieval it's about building a village that is that is straight down the pipes for what steam wants so just for folks at home like well I made all the changes Chris said about manl Lords I did it to mine and I not a million dollar seller it's because Mana Lords is an amazing game so anyway let's take a look at manner Lords so I think one what the steam page is doing is just setting the tone for what this game is so that nobody is unclear what you do in the game and they're impressed with how good it looks okay so those are the big two things that this steam page is doing okay so let's look at the short description Mana Lords is a medieval strategy game I like that because it sets the genre right up front doesn't hide it in lore or something is like you are lord balur of the great lands and the race of the contans no it's just like hey look Mana Lords medieval strategy game boom genre I love it that's so good indepth city building large scale tactical battles and complex economic and social simulation boom that's so good I love how they just describe that it's just like here's the basics this is the gameplay Loop they put in there rule your lands as a medieval Lord uh the season pass the weather changes and the cities rise and fall kind of a little flourish at the end I'm fine with it so um again the good things that this does is it just sets up the genre it's not too flowery it's just like boom here's the genre this is what you do this is the stakes you know it's like you're a Manor Lord and you've got to do it through the seasons you got to l through the seasons so that's where it's starting um another important thing is this capsule beautiful capsule very well Illustrated this looks like the cover of a board game or something like a European board game um and it's got the classic thing your main character sitting on a hill and the land that you control is in the distance just like this it's very classic very good okay the other thing that I really like is um screenshots are good variety now one thing and if anybody knows me I always say put UI in the screenshots manl Lords didn't do it the game is mostly um not much there but there's a lot of like clicking on menus and you see little options I've played Mana Lords I love the game you click it you make some choices you build stuff there's none of that building in here it's just like straight up screenshots not an ounce of UI I know I know I I would put UI not every page can be perfect even for Mana Lords so I would have put UI like you it's all about drawing roads and dropping stuff in but what the here's what the good thing about these screenshots do is they show quality and what you're trying to do is most steam Shoppers there's 177,000 games released this year there will be my that's my prediction 17,000 there's so much junk out there you have to prove in your screenshots we are like the highest quality game because that's what steam Shoppers are looking for is this going to be some janky piece of garbage is it so you have to erase any garbage okay it's got to be seamless in your screenshots and I'm I'm going to be showing some other in some of the future Pages things where we can hide things kind of like sweep it under the carpet so it looks pristine and this is what these screenshots are doing is like this is a city Builder what kind of City Builder has round roads look at that they're all rounded they're snaking through that is very very hard to do codewise and make it look good and this game looks amazing so what they're saying is you can make beautiful non like grid based cities and they look amazing like look at this this looks like a picture but you build this this is what you build and that's what Mana Lords is establishing in their screenshots they're saying we're a city Builder but we're not like one of those grid based everything looks square no no no it's organic that's one of their key marketing messages and you'll see it below so they're just doing that um and so they've just established what it is this this game is like you live in the city you are building this this manor house it's beautiful it looks organic it's not all gritted out like most of them so that's what they're establishing there so that's a key thing that they have said can I just just one question on the on the trailers I noticed that the this game has multiple trailers is that something you recommend or just focus on one really good trailer um if you've got the time and the money you can do multiple trailers the main thing is you want to put your uh Gameplay trailer in spot number one specifically this spot should always be the Gameplay trailer no cinematics because valve pulls the first trailer and they use that for um like if you hover over the capsule they show clips of your trailer um too many people put their cinematic in that first spot and you'll get like these black pages with white text on it says like in a world of Dungeons and Magic you know and that looks awful when you're just hovering over it and you see the video so don't put these cinematic trailers with in a world text with the seven keys of mler don't do that text don't ever do that in your trailer for the first slot because it looks awful when you hover over it okay now um one other thing and this isn't quite your steam page I just like this bundles Indie should be doing more bundles if you've made multiple games bundle them it's smart it's just it's free money you're living on the table if you don't bundle bundle with other devs Who are the the same kind of genre same typee of game as you it's just more people should be bundling so definitely do that um and updates you got to be doing the updates it just makes your page look good if you've got updates in there it means you're you're working on a live Cross Pro we'll talk about these some cross promos are always good and I'll show some pages who have done a great job doing this you'll see that these gifts this is the about this section teach you what the game is okay and they're better than trailers cuz they're faster people don't really like to watch trailers this is a side thing I've I I studied the steam Marketplace I watched people shop a steam page few people really like to watch the trailers they more like to just skim it and Gifts like this and these descriptions really help them skim and this is a great thing to explain hey this is an organic City Builder that you just see rise from from the ground up that's essentially what these gifts are saying and they just reinforce that message of look at how beautiful this game you are in this city okay so that's really what they're trying to message here okay all right yeah that sounds great all right so up next let's check out hidden tactics which looks like a really interesting strategy game so Chris go ahead great great okay so um part of what we have to do when we're making a steam page is we really need to go with a bang really start out when you launch your steam page go with a bang um I often say get your steam page up as soon as possible but as possible means have a trailer and so I don't see a trailer here so I'm a little I'm a little concerned about this especially um I I like pixel art games but pixel art games can um often come off as like oh there's nothing here or they just don't they're not as exciting as like a 3D world that has explosions and stuff and so we have a harder Lift Us pixel art you know simple graphic makers and so if this is your first screenshot it's not setting that first message forward now one thing that I really like about this game is it's really complex well actually this is the first screenshot one of these back here this is the first screenshot I one thing I do like is it's really big battles like this looks cool this is really big battles but I want to see this in motion so really this you should always have a trailer and the other reason you do a trailer is when you announce your game you want a trailer when you post your steam page you want to do a marketing beat behind that you want to say this is game's announcing and so you make a trailer and you title the trailer announce trailer you know hidden uh what's it called hidden tactics um um what's it yeah hidden tactics um announce trailer Hidden tactics and then the press is more likely to cover it IGN's more likely to cover it you post this YouTube video you try and get people to cover your YouTube video and you do this all at the same time so you really should launch the trailer and it's not it's not like the algorithm hates you it's just you just missed a beat that you can do now you can still do it here's a trick is if nobody noticed that you launched your steam page you can say announcing my steam page and then there's nobody who saw that you didn't announce it so they're all like oh okay wow he just announced it uh so just make a trailer call it the announce trailer and send it around to the press and trying to get get out there but pixel art games and these big strategic games like this always benefit by seeing it in motion because it looks better in motion again I'm an old school guy I love pixel art I make pixel art games but by screenshot they just don't have the same oomph as like Mana Lords that has like this beautiful 3D environment so you usually have to overcome that with motion and graphics and so I highly highly recommend you do the trailer by the way speaking speaking of trailers do you have any general guidelines like should a trailer be uh 30 seconds 60 seconds 10 minutes uh should it show gameplay should it show UI not what are the general guidelines for a great trailer yeah so 30 to 40 seconds is fine for your first trailer just putting it in there uh you know for uh steam right here so I say about 45 seconds at the most um and go straight into gameplay I always say first five seconds should be gameplay most people do this thing where it's like again black text Black Page White text like in a world get ready for the magical journey of your life and then and it's like come on come on what is it what is it what is it and then it's like a picture of a soldier it's like no no no no just go straight to the gameplay your first screenshot should be like arrows flying guys battling death and then slow it down you you hit them first second with what the game is because you need to establish gameplay so always go game playay first right off the bat and show just a variety you can show UI but the most important thing is you need to show how to play the game like how is the game played and I don't mean like you're doing a tutorial I just mean like oh I'm controlling these guys I just click the thing and then I click over here and they attack that's what you're showing like what is the basic gameplay Loop that's what you need to show in the trailer all right now I'm going to go into one other thing here um uh watch these tags okay so tags are what tells steam where to put your game okay steam doesn't know what your game is just by looking at screenshots because it's all algorithmic and so what they do is they look at these tags and they look at players and they say who plays this tag a lot oh they play this tag lot we're g to give you that game we're g to show them that game um and that's how it works okay it's it's a recommendation system and it and what they do is they list games next to each other so it builds this I'll show you in a second but one of the key things is it's 20 tags you get 20 tags this game does not have enough tags you see how there's this blank space down here this tells me there's not enough tags go through the tagging Wizard and I recommend people do this like once a month maybe once a quarter just go through and tag your game and look at how to do it now I have tutorial it's kind of tricky how tomarket a game.com sfree or oh actually scratch that the actual one is uh how to make a steam page.com I go through all this stuff okay like how to pick these tags how to do it I give you a little spreadsheet for it to help you out how to make a steam page.com perfect blad is to start with this um but you gotta you got to do the tags so that steam knows how to recommend you now what happens is tags help determine this and what I typically look at is and we're going to look at this for several other games are these matching what I think the game is like tactical strategy type of games and overall pretty close but I'm seeing a lot of freeo playay games free to play did you tag your game as free let me see I don't know why you yeah you didn't tag as free it just thinks it thinks your game's free for some reason I see a lot of like free games here typically what happens is if steam doesn't know what type of game you have it's like you don't have enough tags and the tags are all over the place seems like I don't know just throw these profitable games at them they'll figure it out this indicates that maybe the tags aren't correct and what I always recommend is pick the game that is most similar to you and just copy their tags without like picking a tag that doesn't exist in your game like if the tag is multiplayer and your game's not multiplayer don't include that tag you're not lying but what you want to do is the way Steam Works is they recommend if somebody plays a lot of this game they're like if you play a lot of this game this game by tags is very similar you should probably like this game we're going to recommend this game that's similar so it sounds weird but you actually don't want to stand out you want to say I'm very similar to this very popular game that's actually the way that you want to play this game and so you are basically I call it like hitching yourself to another game so I don't know exactly what your game is but there's a lot of games like War Grove it seems like might be similar to yours a lot of tactical pixel art strategy games build that list of games that you think you're similar to and then just see what tags are similar again how to make a steam page.com I go through how to do that and just copy those tags and then you just match directly and then you get that cross TR from them it's a little bit more complicated by that but that's really what the strategy you're trying to pull and speaking of tags I I've heard you say that the Indie tag is something that you should avoid so can you say why that is yeah okay so um in general you want to make your game as similar to another game as possible and when you throw in the Indie tag it's just like a waste of space it's like if the police said hey did you see that bad guy what what did he look like and you're like ah he had a shirt it's like no duh everybody this whole neighborhood is wearing a shirt who give me give me something more specific you're like pants he had pants and you're like that doesn't help describe who this guy is at all so saying the Indie tag is like saying the guy was wearing a shirt great it doesn't help there's so many indie games out there and all indie games are so different if you just say I'm an indie game then then they're like what the heck like what that doesn't describe your game remember tags are trying to separate you from everybody else and saying I'm more similar to this game and not these and if you use the Indie tag you're just clouding up your your games uh you're just murking up with the algorithm sees and it's like I don't know it says the Indie tag I don't know what that means there's so many indie games so you need to um differentiate yourself with different tags so don't use the Indie tag for the most part okay great unless now here's one thing you know I said hey match your tags to that because that's how the algorithm works sometimes indies's haven't gotten the m message even if there's like the number one game in this genre and you are so similar to it and they put the Indie tag in there copy the Indie tag again it's it's sort of like I don't know how the algorithm specifically works but I think the more similar your tags are the more likely steam's going to recommend these games next to each other so that's the one excuse where I would say like okay you got the Indie tag you can do it it's okay okay good to know and just one more note on this game uh I noticed that the the uh capsule looks quite different from the gameplay so the gam play has something like a pixel art look but the capsule is like a beautiful illustration so is it something that you recommend doing something a capsule that is very different but perhaps more appealing than it would be using just general game assets yeah I I totally recommend doing this um this is perfect and it's good capsule it really shows what's going on tactics G playing with and org um um here's the thing is one people like well it seems like you're lying if you do pixel art and then this well since the beginning of time we we've been uh like here let me pull this up like there's my old Nintendo cartridge look at that look that's Mario Kart I don't know if you can see that that's Mario Kart the Mario Kart on the SNES did not look like this so uh fans of pixel art and old school games have for beginning of time known that hey uh this game is Illustrated on the cover but the actual game itself is pixel art so you're not tricking anybody we've been indoctrinated to how that works since the beginning of time since the beginning of video games um two you just have to cuz one thing you one thing I I say a lot is remember there's 177,000 games and a lot of them are crap and what you're trying to do is show I'm not crap I am a serious game this is not one of those my first games I'm just a kid my first game you are saying I am making quality software here and one of the ways you do that is saying like I paid $500 to have this capsule done which is what kind of what it costs um it's worth the investment I know that's expensive but the other reason you do this and this is a side effect is um streamers do not want bad thumbnails for when they're like on YouTube YouTube thumbnails are the live and die I think I mentioned this in the last call Hugo um you need a good capsule so that a a YouTuber when they play this game and give you all this traffic like this thumbnail so they can use it for their thumbnail on YouTube so that's why we need a good capsule so that a streamer is like oh that's a good capsule I'm going to use that I'm going to play this game because I can use this artwork to boost my clickthrough rate that's all YouTubers care about right the clickthrough rate so that's what you got to do so I highly recommend paying an artist don't make it yourself and uh getting a good capsule it just it's like wearing a suit at a job interview you don't look like that every day but the hiring manager is going to be like that lady put on a suit she's quality she works hard for this thing you know what I mean so you got to put your best face forward and get some good capsule art good all right so yeah capsule art is very important okay all right so let's look at one that is nice and cozy and it's called weird LS so Chris go ahead I love the name word lits weird lits I get it I it's not until you said it Hugo that I got it but I think that's cute I think it's good um so yes weird lits um again kind of like um with your game Hugo it was like not until so one thing I always try and do is like what is the most unique thing about this game and how long do I have to spend on the steam page before I figure it out really ideally in the best case the weirdest weirdest uh thing about your game should be like right up front like this is the cool thing this is what's unique about this game and one of the things I noticed when I was going through um I was like yeah yeah idler make a room cute wholesome yeah yeah yeah yep and then I saw this one screenshot I was like what is that my what this guy is on on my desk this right here I haven't seen this now there was a game called Rusty's retirement where they took the idler and they you pushed it on the bottom of the screen and the the Ider was playing on the bottom I haven't seen this yet this reminds me of like the old uh there used to be these like desktop you used to install the sheep that was like walking around your Windows 95 desktop I had that installed and you can like pick up the sheep and stuff this looks a lot like that this is awesome this should be your first screenshot this should be first or second screenshot instead it's number seven it's halfway through there no no no no half your screenshot should be this like different things maybe he's on Google Maps or something this is awesome you got a little creature on there this is so cool this this should be it again whatever's unique about your game put it up front say this is what's unique about it I don't have the time to go through as a a steam Shopper and and go through all this stuff this is cool this is cool more of these this should be like screenshot number two okay um and then you got it here too but then you put two of those like desktop screenshots right next to each other no no no spread it out spread it out sprad it out um like and a lot of these okay we've got two where you're dressing the person we don't need two cut it down just do one screenshot of dressing the little little creature that's fine decorate the room that's great I like this one better because it tells you oh look you can see the um what it is this is a little bit harder to see what you're doing but again I think the screenshot sele should just be um uh improved a little bit to to get there now one thing that I also want to point out and I think this is great so Spirit City well there's a there's a hot Trend right now where it's kind of like idler games in the background while you're working it keeps track of stuff and then you can use those points to upgrade their room it's like a building cozy idler it's a hot that's a hot genre right now um Spirit city did that very similar game the steam algorithm so this means your tags are working I played Spirit City I wrote a Blog about it check check it out how Market game.com just search for Spirit city um steam knows that I've played this game and it knows this game similar that means your tags are good good job but you also did good stuff down here let's expand this look what you did this is this is super easy to do this widget all you do is put the URL of a game in your uh like about this in a text box on their steam page and it automatically converts it into this Steam does that um this is great you should be making friends just like my what your mother always told you like make friends go make friends and then when you make video game friends you put their game in there and they put your game in there and you just cross collaborate and that's excellent people who like this game are going to like theirs hopefully Spirit city is linking to your game but this is called collaborative networking it's good this is good this is so powerful stuff so great job okay so so related to that one just next to that is a Discord link so is Discord something that you recommend that indes do is that a good way to get a community to get more visibility to your game wish list players and so on I like newsletters better I think the kids spend too much time on Discord these days I don't love Discord but I know the cool kids all like Discord I I'd rather see like hey join our newsletter because newsletters have a higher conversion rate you don't have to worry about keeping your community constantly rolling and you don't have to worry about trolls in a newsletter cuz if somebody's just mean to you people aren't mean on email they're just business oriented where if people get jerks they post spam and nudity weird stuff on your Discord why would you want that newsletters don't have that newsletters are cool kids but I know the kids they love the Discord so we got to put Discord so if you got to do it I like it I like the link but newsletters are still better they work kids trust me they work so uh that's my thought on on Discord do it but newsletters are better just one more thing on this game which is the name itself which on the one hand I like it's a very original very interesting name but at the same time if I had a friend come up to me and say oh you got to play this game called weird LS I would have no idea how to spell that so do you think there's potential issues with going way too original on a game making it too unique for the name or should something more generic be sometimes a bit better I don't think it's bad I don't know I would have put an i instead of a y I think it's funny maybe somebody maybe somebody already has weird lits let's look it up let's look it up weird let's no nobody has I kind of like weird litz with an eye but I I understand I get it just do it keep it as it is um the one that's really bad the one that I don't like is where it's like SE goth the Uncharted you know and it's like some really weird like scifi or fantasy name that's like got some some apostrophes it's like just a nonsense word that's when I think it's really bad and I would recommend against that but for the most part I think this is fine I think it's cute um yeah I I don't I don't have a problem with the name okay great all right so next up let's look at smash bear it looks like an interesting concept interesting name so let's see if the scam page is also interesting go ahead yeah so uh again the unique uh selling proposition is you are a bear um so uh the short description is pretty good SL and smash I like the alliteration there human settlements and unleash whoops I don't know why I went there um and unleash um The Rage of a smash bear in this action rogu like so uh cool I I'm pretty sure people are going to understand that you are the bear see here's the here's the one thing that's risky about a strategy where you're like you're actually the villain and I've seen this a lot with steam pages is you know that you play as the bad guy or something uh I know Bears aren't always bad they're just doing what they they do but in other words like you're playing the typical villain role um a lot of people forget to mention that in their steam pages when they're building their steam page I always think you should say like you are the Baddie I know it sounds obvious but I there's almost it it's almost left un said you are the bear like you should almost say that I know it sounds pedantic but people don't always know and so like when you look at a screenshot like this like okay I see there's a laser tur it so you could totally interpret this screenshot as oh I have to set up a tower defense to protect my my community from this bear and these wolves so I am fighting them see when you're playing the counter where you're playing the bad guy you have to go extra to say who you are and that you are the bad guy um see all these things I'm not clear like oh here's the game I have to stop this bear from destroying me see you could totally interpret every screenshot like that so if there's a screenshot where you are showing you are the bear like the bear just like a and it's like this is not I'm not saying literally this is you but it's where it's like upgrade and you show the bear and he's got like Claws and he's like upgrading his claws or something that helps I mean that think of ways to do that but you really need to to nail at home that you are the bear um now free tip I don't know if this would work I've always wanted to do this no no client has said Chris you get the green light on this but what if this is you can toally steal this idea if you like it if not or could totally destroy everything what if you just did the whole steam page in the voice of the bear like me roar roar eat fish go Smash and like the whole steam page like if you go down here uh like the whole thing is written like more smash more eat more fish destroy human settlements and then it's just like Roars for like a page where it's just like Roar and then it's like time to hibernate and that's how the you end the steam page or something that would be I mean it's ballsy it's ballsy I don't know if it's worth it but might be fun I've never really seen it and it just it doesn't have the typical steam structure because it's like yeah I mean this it's a game you know typical but if you did the whole thing in a be voice people like this is funny and then people would share your steam page okay so yeah that is a very interesting idea but yeah it does sound like a highrisk high thing either it it's really interesting because stands out or it's really confusing because doesn't explain enough about the game so yeah that's a that's an interesting line to go between interesting and unique versus not explaining enough and if you're not getting much visibility on your steam page and nothing's clicking through well it's what else you got you know so maybe try it for two months do a marketing push around your steam page where it's written in the voice of the bear see if it takes off uh it it might be a higher Baseline than what you got now just from people going like look that's funny thing now I'm going to transition to this thing I see this sometimes where it's like I'm just a small death please don't hurt me I'm sorry don't do I don't like this okay I know I understand putting yourself out there creatively is hard but you're not I know your game's short and you're worried about it this isn't going to get you any sales it's not going to get you any pity points like nobody's gonna like oh I shouldn't be hard I mean steam's gonna be mean to you no matter what I say take this out this just makes you look like firsttime Dev hobbyist Dev it's basically the warning saying hey this is a small game I'm not very good yet I'm working on this just take this stuff out I don't like this um we'll see it in a couple other screenshot just be confident just like yeah this game's freaking awesome you're a freaking Bear all right just do it let's go for it take the stuff out don't do this stuff come on you're a real Game Dev don't do it all right good okay yeah that that is awesome yeah interesting concept I like it all right I'm about to uh review Urban Jungle it's gonna be a great one uh I just want to take a quick 10second break to say that um part of what I do is um I I teach people how to make Steam Pages how to make a steam page.com but I also uh make other marketing classes on like how to Market your full game from beginning to end and it's on sale this week all the way until July 1 the sale ends but I'm partnering with Hugo here um if you use his coupon code and it's linked down below you can get a great deal on it it supports Hugo we're teaming up to get you guys this because these are great games like yall are you all know it it's just sometimes you need a little extra help and that's what my marketing courses do I only do the sale twice a year this is the summer one it ends July 1st so be sure to click these links use Hugo's coupon code it benefits Hugo helps me helps you learn how to do a steam page um and how to do all the marketing because it's confusing I get it so let's get to it let's talk about Urban Jungle here by digging in here now this classic wholesome cozy game this is really these are hot right now room decorators if you haven't heard about these folks make a room decorator I really think these are cool so the the hook of the game is you get to kind of Tidy it up and add plants and I think it's really cute really holesome it's got the wholesome color palette if you want to make a wholesome game your game has to be this color palette beautiful this tells people that it's wholesome and you do a wholesome activity which is just grow some little plants and put them around your office now um in general this looks so good um the only thing that again uh whatever your hook is I try to figure out how I determine it this could be misinterpreted as you do a full room decoration and I don't think that's quite it there's a little bit where you hide some junk and you like tuck it under the bed and stuff that's fine I'm just afraid that people might interpret oh I get to pick the couch I get to pick the chair and all that kind of stuff so I'd make that a little front and center um see where it says turn your your home into a Green Haven in Urban Jungle find the best place for each plant in your tiny apartment and enjoy gardening without the worries and don't forget to pet the cat I think that's a great short description um I think you should maybe maybe you could phrase it like take your boring room add plants or something you know something along those line not literally that but kind of establish that you don't decorate the room you don't put the furniture in somehow if you can do that because I'm I'm a little worried that people might misinterpret that yeah on this one I do know that cozy games are very successful it's a genre that has been increasing on scam by quite a lot but yeah I do I have noticed that a lot of them do seem quite similar so yeah it is a genre that has potential to sell a lot but yeah selling what makes your game different from the dozens of other cozy games that does seem to be quite a challenge it is I I don't envy it but um wholesome fans are very very uh omnivorous they love those uh they love omnivorous not just because it's plants they just love trying all these different games so cozy games folks are really hot um the only other thing that I see here is when I was kind of digging in it said like in the trailer or somewhere down here that there might be a bit of a narrative and that's one of the things like with some of these games like unpacking unpacking really kicked this genre off unpacking had a little bit of a narrative element to it and you might want to sprinkle that in because I know wholesome fans like the narrative stuff and I know I say cut out all the narrative just get straight to the action but you tease the narrative you don't tell what the narrative is you just say with a little and you might learn a little bit about somebody or something like that you just sprinkle a little bit so they know that it's not just oh I just decorate the room in there there's some narrative stuff going on here so um I'd put that the other couple things I would do is when I look at the screenshots I always like a good variety and you'll look at the first two look at them see that's it's the same place you just zoomed in a little bit see how these two are so similar I would pick this one the zoomed out because it just shows a little bit more but again you want your screenshots to be super unique you don't want too many similar screenshots because it makes people think well why are they so into showing the same thing over and over again see again see these two notebooks are so similar I'd pick one I kind of like this one because it shows you all the plants shows you like oh I unlock plants see you're you're teaching people how the game plays with this stuff so that's what I would I would kind of pay attention to um and then one last thing is in these videos I would show when I watched the trailer I really liked how your trailer shows placing plants you can see the plants kind of like they plop down they do this cute animation where they kind of like spring back it's it looks good and it shows people like you are placing plants cuz screenshots it's not it's hard to tell like did I just show up here and all the plants look like this or what did I do like what did I place but when you show the video it shows you like you get to pick where the plants go and you plop them down they grow um it's good I would show that in video form I mean I this rotating plants is kind of cute but I don't think it does anything for you it shows yeah they're in 3D I think it's more important to show here's the rim before and then show like just an animation of you adding a bunch of plants really fast and then them coming to life that I think is the core Loop of the game and it really should be done in the steam page so I'm not seeing that in there this pan of the room is cute but I don't think we've already know that there's rooms so I don't think these gifts are doing you any favors I would focus more on the work the other thing I saw with the trailer is like you take a box and you put it under the bed or under the shelf so you're doing a little tidying up those are the gifts tidy up planting plants and then maybe a hint to that narrative element one thing to note is I always say you're about this section is your gameplay Loop so pick the three parts of your gameplay and show them each one in a gift form so um picking plants tidying up your room and then learning about the mystery behind here I hope it's not a murder mystery of course it's a cozy game so it's not a murder mystery it's probably that you're going to college or something so um yeah I think that's it hug go do you have any other thoughts yeah just over there directly on the page on the right side there's the section that seam has for the awards I was wondering so is that something that you should put like for example let's say that you go into a like a a convention or some event that is something really small so it's not like IG it's not it's not like GDC or B award something like that it's just something that is very small is that still something that you should put on there or should you only it before just I don't know recognize Bo wordss it it doesn't it doesn't matter anyway um really the igf and all those kind of most people don't care um the one thing I think it does is it just kind of fills up the page there's a you know sometimes I see pages from devs who are firsttime devs and their Pages look very empty and I can't put my finger on like what is missing here and it's usually what's missing is um they haven't been doing updates see these little Graphics really fill in so they've done a great job here they don't have any of these bundles or more from our friends type of thing they don't do that um so they because they don't do that stuff again good job on having friends and and cross promoting them this is good so I find a lot of people don't their pag look empty and Barren and doing this stuff just kind of fills out your page but it's not like uh steam Shoppers and not this I know this because I watch steam Shoppers do it and I actually asked them I said what do you think about these and they're like what and I was like those things right there they didn't even notice them these little Awards um that people add but I think it just kind of fills it out just fills the space it's like putting drapes next to a window why do we hang fabric next to Windows I don't know but if you don't do it it just makes your room look empty so it's the same thing these are kind of the drapes of your cozy game you're just like oh we have drapes and people are like something's missing oh we have drapes good it feels more like a lived in space so this is more of just a fill out the space make it look graphically interesting but it's not going to be like you add this for every one of these you add you increase your wish list rate by 10% no it doesn't happen all right yeah that's awesome man this game is definitely looking great I think I remember seeing a post on Reddit about this specific game and how apparently developers start learning from one of my videos so that's always really awesome to see and it's really great to see such a great game and seems to be doing quite well okay I'm just going to break to to give you Hugo some credit the list that you sent me if this is from your community you have a great Community great games are in are in the selection so really high quality stuff and they got 40,000 wish list according to this thing so good job on that so doing great there Urban Jungle yeah I agree the the games that were submitted on that post are all really awesome so yeah congratulations to all of you making such really awesome games okay so next up let's look at evil incorporation so it's a horror game and it seems to be very well made so let's see the scam page all right great no oh um I always say um you should every Indie should be required to make a horror film or a horror game I should say um horror games are so hot um people love sharing horror games they do very well they're pretty easy to make so somewhat um easier than making like a 4X or an RPG or something for sure um so I think every Indie should be required make one horror game before you can call yourself an indie um so um evil Corporation is a horror game um and classic capsule you you put the red text and then something bad now typically now artistic rules can be broken but typically and this goes back to I think my comment on one of the previous games of the Bear game what are you are you the baddy are you the goodie or what who are you when I look at these screenshots who am I um and typically in horror games you put the monster in the capsule you just put the monster here and then the text look at choo choo Charles lunch lady Huggy wuggy or whatever uh bathtub friends or what bathtub friends I don't know what it's called whatever it is you always put the uh I don't think bathtub friends is is a game but hey free horror game bathtub friends um all you do is uh yeah you just do scary text and scary font that looks scratched out and bleeding and then just put the monsters so when I see this they're a little hard to see and I think they're the baddies like you're fighting against them and that's the thing I don't fully understand evil Corporation is a coop horror exploration game travel through Eerie levels while avoiding creatures and other D dangers trying to get even with the corporation so this is where it's like trying to get even with the corporation are we part of the corporation who am I I one of the things that you have to do with a horror game is set up what is what are the risks and what's bad and I think I think you could tighten this up a little bit to say more like the evil corporations coming to get you and they are going to send the evil things to you in this Coop I do like that you said the genre Coop horror game that's good I just think you need to explain what the stakes are um again I don't know what this Badd is like when you see Choo Cho Charles you see this train with spider legs you're like obviously that's the bad guy I need to avoid the spider leg train okay and I think CH Charles is like the spider train's coming to get you or something like that is a perfect um short description for a horror game I don't quite know what the risks are am I just like shooting spiders in the sewers like I I just you got to set the fantasy of horror to me like tell me what to be scared of I'm not getting scared from the short description and it kind also comes back to I don't know what I am like again I see this and I can't quite tell like the Fig figes are like there's a bad guy like what is that is that what is this thing is this like this should be in your capsule and you should explain like hey don't no face man towel face man's coming to get you oh that sounds scary like oh who's to tace man I just made him up you can call him tace or something um but I don't I don't know that's what that's the thing is I don't quite understand what's going on here and and I think that's what we need to to kind of work on just one interesting note here which is as you're going through the seam page you're looking mostly at the screenshots and not so much the trailer is that based on how you've seen how how seam shoers interact with seam page do they usually skip the trailer and just look at screenshots or just briefly look at the trailer what is it yeah sometimes because what I did was I study I I got about a dozen people and I watched them shop for steam Pages for an hour at a time and nobody watches trailers on Steam on Steam now trailers are important on YouTube and stuff like that but this is how let me show you how they watch a trailer I'll show you I'm going to start this trailer they watch it like this no no no where's gameplay gameplay okay here's gameplay game play game play game play okay okay oh good okay yeah there we go okay that was tace guy chasing you he's got to be in the capsule so um again that's how people watch trailers they're just skipping ahead looking for game playay because they just don't um because it takes too long and you're they're usually checking it at work and stuff and so nobody's going to sit and watch a trailer at work um and then when I look at the short description like this I mean I know it's it's funny but this is funny but I don't know it's not quite the horor thing like I know this is funny this is this silly it's you and your Bros hanging out again now this makes me think oh these are the good guys and so again the the the horror convention is you put the bad guy in The Capsule and these are the good guys but the good guys kind of look like bad guys too so and they're they look like they're corporate because like the back rooms thing you're part of the corporation that's like in investigating so these are the GU good guys but are they evil are you working for the evil Corporation so I I'm like wait am I am I being evil role playing as evil Corporation but the evil Corporation is coming to get me and then there's tace guy it's just like it's I don't know I and horror works at the uh the the core level of the basil spinal cord here I need to know who's chasing me and what is it and then then I fill in the gaps with the horror and I tell my Bros so I just feel like I'm I'm not able to capture exactly where where's the horror what what's going on here so that'd be my recommendation is focus in on what are the bad guys who are the good guys what am I doing yeah for me I also thought that last gift was quite interesting because on the one hand it is horror and that gif is definitely very silly but on the other hand there's also been a growing trend of uh games that are essentially horror but horror with a funny thing to it so is that something that can some sometimes be a little mismatch on how people see the game or it's funny you say um Jordan or um um Peele from uh you know like um the get out and stuff he said the difference between comedy and horror is music think about that kids if if you just play scary music a comedy turns into horror and vice versa a horror turns into comedy I get it but I would be okay with this gift if after this game became a hit then you put this GIF in here I it's just the problem is I can't ident I'm having a hard time with this game identifying who are the bad guys who are the good guys who's the evil Corporation there's like three parts involved and it's just too confusing maybe add this gift later I think it's funny I know it says Coop and this is you and your Bros hanging out I just I don't know I just I don't get it I but we'll see I just think that there's there's too much too many moving pieces horror games are very simple bad guy chases you okay yeah that's awesome and the game does seem to be very well made so I guess we will see how this one releases okay so up next let's look at paper clay this is a game with a really interesting style really interesting great Visual and it's actually one that I've seen many times on Twitter so I hope that this one launches very well so let's see so what does the steam Page look like great yeah so um I this is a classic 3D platformer um I'll read it real quick a classic 3D platformer see i' I'm kidding I read it before um with a tactile twist open unfold and rotate your way through a stunning open world with a varied move set of double jumps dashes and Glides explore solve puzzles and make friends uh as you try to find every last egg okay now one of the things again when I come back to what is the unique hook you put it in the capsule this is actually a really good capsule um you got the little buddy and I didn't notice the bu the little buddy it's kind of a Banjo Kazooie situation I think or Ratchet and Clank um which is classic that's classic and I didn't see it until I got down to here like this buddy Duo chicken nugget get it chicken nugget that's so cute put this one first like so Platformers 3D Platformers and Platformers in general rely on you know characters like silly characters there so establish that up front because one of the things when I was looking through the screenshots I really didn't see the little nugget like when I went through here like I'd expect to see it you know there's nugget but it's blurry like the little I can see the little yellow head it's blurry so it just looked like when I saw it I was like typical platformer yeah I'm going to jump on stuff through the snow biome through this biome I just don't see the little nugget and I what what is the mechanic is it like a banjo kazou like comes out and he attacks or I throw him and then he pulls me up what is the mechanical implication of that and then the other thing was uh the fold and the twist mechanic I don't quite see it in the screenshots it looks very traditional like Mario like oh bounce up to the thing so I know there's the twist mechanic with the paper that's a unique twist um but I'm just not seeing it in the screenshots like I I just don't I feel like there's we're missing the hook now that said this page is beautiful one of the things that you know I say you need to tell people that you are not like a typical my first game this is obviously not this developer's first game and one of the ways you show this quality is look at all this like deckled Edge edging on the on the gift this this takes time and effort and it shows I know my Graphics I know how to do this you're in good hands folks buy this game because I'm good at Graphics this is good you should always do something like see how the title is just a little bit of extra text here all that kind of stuff very good now one of the things that I also want to do oh the other thing I saw that I thought was cool again the screenshot like this sock puppet you talk to a sock puppet this tells me like you said tactile very Yoshi's yarn story or whatever that game was called I don't see that little in the screenshots like I feel like the screenshots again screenshots are very important I think they were like the last thing you you know people thought about I I would like to see the sock puet this looks everything that I'm seeing is very very basic platforming that I would see from like a Mario game from like Mario Galaxy like the last decade or so of gameplay show that sock puppet that looks cool put that in one of the screenshots really I think the screenshots need to really show more variety cuz every screenshot here just looks like typical Mario levels you know nothing too unique but the stuff that I see in the GIF and in the trailer that looks pretty unique so put that stuff up in the screenshots again more people look through screenshots because they're judging really fast whether they should invest and if they like what they see then they maybe they watch the trailer I think when I did the observations they' read the short description look at the tags look at the screenshots look at the about this section and if all that started looking good then they went up and watched the trailer that's the order that they do stuff so don't rely on the trailer like oh we explain it in the trailer uh uhuh that's not going to do it not going to do it yeah that is a really great takeaway of how screenshots are super important because yeah I would say that most people probably see the screenshot as something they do at the very end I know for myself as a developer that's usually how I how I think about them and I definitely try to counter that so yeah basically the takeaway screenshots are extremely important definitely make sure you show your hooks what's unique about your game directly on the screenshots and here's the thing is and and this most people are probably browsing steam at work they they don't they're just like idly kind of doing it not they should be working but they're not and so they just like click at their screenshots they don't want to do anything loud they're just kind of quickly taking some some looks blah blah they they're not they're not like sitting in a dark room focusing 100% on your game like it's E3 or something no they're just like man looks okay next next next next you know they're that's how they're going through Steam pages so they they you can't rely on the trailer it's just not it's just not how most people watch even if they do Watch trailer they just kind of skip through until you find Gameplay that's how they watch and observe your game on Steam nextfest now one thing I am going to talk about is see this this is good way to go yav what you do is you click your name and this is uh called a Creator page and it takes a little bit to set up you you specify the back uh the the the header and all this stuff down here but all this stuff is what um really build your studio because what happens is see this follower link they can follow you as a studio and every game you release even if they didn't even wish list it they will get a notification when that game releases so it's good it's it takes a long time to do this to build this up and it's not like make a break but you should always try and get people to follow your studio and get to know you and the other thing that happens is watch when I search yev look who shows up here there's y Kev when I search his name when I search kev's name look who shows up right there when you create that Creator page and Link it to your steam page you get to show up in the search box so somebody's looking for your studio name they'll see it in there if you don't do that can't find you they can't find you so we'll look at a couple Pages they did not do that and I'm going to cry okay okay yeah that was definitely a great Point uh of how the Creator pages also important especially if assuming the goal is to make multiple games not just one game and done then definitely having a studio page that you can then grow over time that is indeed something that is quite important and a bunch of people don't do it so yeah if that's one of you definitely go ahead create your studio page right now all right so up next let's check out demon sport this a game that has a really interesting visuals it's got some interesting mechanics so yeah right away this uh looks very interesting to me so let's see what does the steam Page look like yeah I saw this game first on Twitter I think or somewhere sharing so way to get the message out there really interesting concept I like it uh I don't to be honest I don't have a lot for this steam page um the only thing is um and this kind of goes back to who are you when I first when my you know when I first saw this I like who are you where are you like where are you really it's it's just the nature of this game and I know when you play the game it's easy to tell like you could see the movement um uh and stuff and be able to identify because the camera's panting around but on some still screenshots maybe uh show pick screenshots where you're a little bit zoomed in and show the guy especially shooting like that it's easy to tell because there's a giant red line pointing out of the guy so that's great and this one's also good because of the lighting effects but overall very very great game very great concept um I really don't have a lot of notes I I will show a little trailer because I did think this trailer was good because look you start right with gameplay this is so good folks you tell the the the the hook right there you show this boiling bubbling monster and this poor scientist trying to stop it this is a great trailer a great trailer and the logo normally I say don't show the logo but I like how they did this where they showed the logo because you're not Nintendo I mean we Indie devs aren't Nintendo so the logo doesn't really matter but I like how they showed gameplay and then they trickled the logo over it if you absolutely have to show your logo this is the way to do it so I'd really recommend it this way not a black screen there it's like in a world and then it do this thing so in general this T this um is great I love this I love this thing it looks so good um I really don't have many notes um you know one thing I did say was show UI and I noticed that a lot of screenshots don't have UI but these gifts do and you could there's one where you could see the bullets how many bullets the guy had under them and it was ticking down but I didn't see that in the screenshots I always like to show you why because it tells you what the game is like you you might see some UI of like oh What weapons does he have oh he got a rocket launcher that's cool there's a grenade launcher that's even better I want to buy this game because there's a grenade launcher um so I always say put UI in there try that um I did notice that this gift looks a little different the the level select movement looks a little different than up above it maybe out of date graphically maybe updated the graphics up there but not down here just make sure you keep that update I like the one that looked up in the trailer so just consider that um but other than that I really let's see I didn't see much everything let's check this let's check this thing let's see did you do your name dino boss yes oh no you did not okay so a publisher yeah I I hate when Publishers do this I don't know if it's on purpose or it's just somebody who doesn't know any better even if you're getting published tell them you want to link to your name when you click your name you want to go to yours so grab it from the publisher and say hey this is my page this is my game you're just my publisher so don't let them do this they always do this all right create your creator page email your publisher and say Hey I want to link to my name when I click my game so fight back all right but in in general great page good job so just on the page uh up top there was the uh broadcasting the steam live stream sort of thing is that something that has much value I know that you can put it like a essentially have a video that is constantly repeating so is that something that you would recommend yeah so nobody likes it I hate it too I always close it every time I see it but it's an algorithmic thing so uh looks like he's being featured right now in a game festival and so if you're getting featured in a festival you get sometimes a lot of views and what happens is this will increase your visibility on the algorithm on the front page if you get enough people on your steam page you can end up on the front page from your streaming it's not a huge thing but you just do it you just do it again it's one of those things where it just fills up the page just makes your page look more lively it doesn't actually help nobody's like oh they're streaming I want to wish list this game now that's not how it works I hate it but it just works so do it okay sounds good all right so next up let's look at the last L Master it does look like an interesting game something like an action RPG so yep let's see that store Page all right so um I I think this game looks beautiful looks great graphics I love the effects all that stuff uh really cool stuff um one thing that I I don't as much I'm a fan of is a lore heavy short description um in my experience people don't buy games based off a lore on the steam page um they enjoy lore after the fact once they enjoy your game but you have to get really basic on your steam page and I know it's it's it's boring and it's not fun and it's not why you got into games but this is your steam page this is not your game your game you can go lower crazy you can put low in every inch but um here like harness the power of the six cardinal elements in the last of the Lord Master like I don't know what the L the elements are I don't know what a lord Master is so I would just I would just take that stuff out I I just I don't really like Lord dumps you know play as jahir a powerful Elemental Lord Master combating the encroaching unraveling as you seamlessly freeze the freeze burn Crush eradicate your foes is good but the who this character is and the The Last of The Who and the Seven Keys of am tler it just it's hard to read when it's lower heavy and it's just it's like I'm just trying to figure out what this game is and so with these kind of RPGs what I I say I know it sounds like you're reducing your game to nothing but focus on mechanics what is unique about it yes freeze burn crush and electrocut your foes but yes that's good but like every every game has Elemental spells like that's the classic thing what is unique like am I upgrading my spells like I really focus on the unique things about it and what always say is if you can take I want you take out the lore what is left and could I swap in another similar game for that you know like so many other games have elemental spells like could you you know balers gate they got Elemental spells you got to focus on if you were to swap in the word balers gate would they be able to tell any difference no like so you got to find out what's really unique about your game and and what goes on there so just watch out for that um I just watch out um the next thing is tags again not many tags you should add a full 20 make sure you do that steam uh wizard again if you need that help how to make a steam page.com um and it'll kind of help you out there um get get the right tags and then the the way I figure it out is I look down at these now you got some Dungeon Crawlers so your Dungeon Crawler tag is doing a lot of lifting but are these the same when I see a lot of AAA games in these like especially like Minecraft and stuff typically this means steam doesn't know exactly what you are so they put the bestselling games which are AAA games so anytime you see a lot of AAA games in the short description they're just like oh it's an RPG so let's give them AAA RPGs you know in this um more like this section so watch out I don't think it's quite there tagwise I don't quite know what type of game it is action RPGs have a wide variety of subg genres so really nail that sub genre and make sure that people understand what it is okay um let me check one more thing and then the other one was this road map um it's cool love road maps good graphics on there the one problem with the um with the road map um is your game's not out yet I usually say put the road map afterwards because people don't quite know it the road map they're just like oh you're still working on it or what I would just hide the road map it's too much information I'd focus on getting that gameplay Loop down and you can really explain the gameplay Loop here in this about this game section so again you got the combos I do think your gifts are pretty good so um the one thing is um and this kind of goes back to like what type of sub genre it is this game and I know it's not kind of the camera angles and the way it's playing looks almost like one of those action Rog like vampire Survivor likees type of things um and so people might dismiss it as that so just saying elemental powers that could be an elemental power Rogue action Rog like like dark or uh like vampire survivors so I think you need to show some screenshots that show the the RPG of it like you walking through a town talking to merchants or something I I'm having a hard time placing exactly where this lies on the RPG Continuum there's so many subg genres within RPGs you really need to nail that part so uh that's my general advice on this one okay so on this one I also did notice the road map and one thing that I found interesting is so they have a road map that is extremely detailed and goes for very long but at the same time the game is not marked as Early Access which I found interesting I mean with a road map like that I would kind of expect Early Access so I guess maybe one question is have you noticed any uh difference in the number of wish lists that a game can get if it is Mart as Early Access versus not is that something that can have a potential negative impact or not no I don't think it does usually that the impact is once you release um that's when Early Access kind of rears its nasty head okay so yeah so in terms of wish list during that time basically if you're playing to go into Early Access just fill in the Early Access forms yeah and one thing I'm just going to stop right here one thing with your steam page I want to set expectations when you update your steam page it's not like for the most part if your page is really bad and then you go to a decent steam page it's not like all of a sudden you just see this ramp up of wish lists the way the steam algorithm works and this is what I talk about in my class uh you know if you click the link down below Hugo gets a a piece of it you know in other words like we teamed up together on this one um I explained this in my class class wish L come when you do outside promotion so what you're trying to do and this is what my course is all about is how do you get this promotion when you do a big expensive like um trailer reveal or it doesn't have to be expensive I just kind of threw that in for dramatic effect or if you get in a festival or you get a streamer to cover you that's a huge influx of traffic to your steam page that is what increases your wish list it is not some people get a little too crazy with the clickthrough rate they get into the math and they're like well when I added the word um legendary I increased my clickthrough rate by 1% I think this is something no you're just you're just reading and interpreting static noise that is not worth your time the the thing that's going to increase your L like first yes get the steam page looking good so it doesn't look like an asset Flip or something bad once it's decent you can then go out and get these big promotional events that is what will increase your wish list it's not going to be like oh if if I make the the character wear a red shirt I noticed that I increase wish list by 10% that is not the way this works you get a good steam page and then the outside promotion is what brings wish list so I just want to set everybody's expectations before you you get too deep into the numbers here yeah that is a great Point definitely I mean the store Page is definitely important but equally as important or more important is getting the traffic onto the store page so yeah that is a great mention okay so let's check out Castle on clouds it's a game that looks very well made so let's see if the team page is also very well made so go ahead Chris yeah um yeah I think it's good made uh a beautiful game looks good um very clear to tell what it is Tower Defense good short description Rog like Tower Defense um one of the things that I you know that I talk about is you have to make it look like your game is done like professionally made ready to go the capsule I can tell that it's like it took a pretty good screenshot of the action and then put in this title in general I don't like that because I think fans can see Shoppers can see like oh I just took a screenshot that means he didn't invest in this game you want like a nice Illustrated screenshot and I know they're expensive and it's hard to do but it's worth it uh a good capsule is is worth it so um look at other Tower Defense games to see what they did but as usually a character and you have an explosion in the background and all the characters are coming and then there's like all these mobs overhead just look at a bunch of uh Tower Defense games and then hire a capsule artist to do them don't use AI it always looks kind of just a little off and people are kind of allergic to it it's worth the money you're doing this professionally you're hoping to earn a lot of money it's worth it's a worthy investment so I would get a capsule don't just take a screenshot um again there's another thing that I saw where it's like not enough tags I don't know why they used to really strictly un for like you couldn't get fewer than 20 tags and I'm not seeing enough tags so again how to Market a game.com and you can watch how to do the tagging and when I scroll down here there's a broken image see that broken image so something's gone broken and again people are looking for any excuse to dismiss your game if they're like why is this image broken oh my God this this game's kind of broken they don't have a a professionally Illustrated capsule I don't know this seems like somebody's first game I'm not ready to to invest in this yet so you have to be very very careful with this and then there's a couple things to where I was just looking at the screenshots and like how some of the the text kind of bleeds onto the bottom of the card usually I mean uh it's like there's little hints that it's like it just needs another pass of like tightening up because here's the thing games have to be Flawless they have to be perfect no little little things and when I look up here it says like demo Builder or something hide that when you take your screenshots again what's it say um seed this release version hide this stuff I know I said use UI but this UI shows ingame development this UI is great good job on the this UI good to show that but you don't want this like in development stuff you want to make your game look Flawless like it's ready to go and all these little things just start to stand out you know and it's like you got to be really careful with the screenshots you pick um um cuz yeah it just looks weird it's like the card the text is running off the card a little bit just be careful on these things really look ask a friend to look at and see if you see anything weird a friend who's like really judgmental pick them because they're good at finding these little things so um in general yeah just look out for I'm just seeing a lot of little things that make me think oh this developer is not it's it because if it looks like there's all these little things that means oh the code in the gameplay is going to be a little janky so but it might not but that's the impression that you're giving to people when they shopping your steam page again this is like when you go for a job interview you have to look clean comb your hair get a nice shave in wear a suit look good and then but if you're like your shirt's untucked and it's like uh like you got like tomato sauce because you had a big plate of spaghetti before the interview it's like you got to kind of you got to clean yourself up before the job interview and your steam page is your interview so that's my general thought and let me see if I let's do one last thing TJ let me click your name oh this is the default thing so if you don't set up your creator page it looks like this this is not cool they can't follow you and if they search TJ they're not going to find you so really get that Creator page set up this is what it looks like when you don't set up your creator page so again there's just a lot of little things you need to tighten up and then uh then your game can shine but that's all I saw for uh castles on clouds yeah I really like what you said about how the steam audience is basically looking for these tiny little things to essentially dismiss a game I mean that's kind of the the problem with there being so many games on Steam so many awesome games that competition is really really Fierce really insane so yeah I guess the steam Choppers are definitely looking for all kinds of things to just as miss the game move on to the next thing and so on so yeah I guess it shows how polish is extremely important not just on the game itself the game needs to be super polished but also the steam page needs to be super polished cannot have like a missing image something like that so yeah that is definitely something that needs to be uh paid attention to because it is indeed very important Okay so next up let's look at Hell espresso and this is actually a pretty fun one because uh viewers on the channel might be able to recognize a little bit of the mechanics and visual on the game that's because I believe this is a game that the developer started by watching my kitchen chaos course and from there they built upon it they made this I I love it I love seeing when people do that when they take some knowledge that they gain from my channel and then build a a fully finished game on top of it so that is really awesome so right away I'm a fan of the game I hope it finds a lot of success so yeah let's see if the uh steam page is is also ready to find success so yeah Chris go ahead great job good that's so neat to see like when somebody takes that I see that sometimes in my community when somebody's like oh yeah I listen to your thing and there so it's like and now I'm doing it it's like so inspiring so congrats to the hpro team okay um in general um I love the capsule love it this is great you did a great job great artist um so good job um now I know it's hell it's hell espresso but this first screenshot in hell just kind of like it kind of has a cute Whimsical ghost look to it and this first one's like in Hell it just seemed a little out of place I don't know I know it's hell espresso but all the rest of them were in a kitchen that looked pretty cute so um watch that um one other thing that I saw I was flicking between these because it's like the same screenshot just at different times a day I don't really like that I I always like so many so much a variety screenshots because it just shows people like this game's packed with content I can't even show you how much is in this game but when you have two screenshots that are very similar people are like maybe this game doesn't have that much content because steam Shoppers really do like content and the final one is you have the main title screen I don't like this at all I know I say do UI but putting the main menu screen um that just for some reason you know a lot of like asset flip and first time Dez put that in there and so you want to stay as way as far away from doing that as possible so take out the main menu screen nobody really buys a game based on the main menu screen so um yeah I would get it out just make sure you look a little bit more professional in your steam page um same thing that the other ones have I I I don't know maybe steam's got something weird going but not enough tags I feel like you need more tags because you've got 20 you should have 20 and uh when I scroll down speaking of more like this I see a lot of uh games that aren't like like there's cooking games like um playup and what's that big cooking game that was very famous but I don't see many cooking games in here I would expect you know Coop C cooking games to show up like all over the overcooked that's what I was thinking I would think overcooked would be like the first one so what I would do is go to overcooked sounds like your game's basically like an overcooked click on overcooked just copy their tags that apply I'm pretty sure your overlap is very good on that so I would check those that's kind of my gut feel based on um on this hpro okay yeah that sounds good and I hope the developer takes these tips makes a great scene page and I hope the game finds a lot of success okay so next up let's look at watch out for goblins which seems like an interesting physics sandbox maybe streamer type of game I don't know so let's see the storm page so Chris go ahead yeah um so a lot of the rules that I always say like oh you got to look really professional keep it keep it clean don't use uh right artwork some of these rules don't apply to different games and these kind of like wacky physics simulators like goat simulator that sort of thing um like a game like Gary's Mod they can get be a little sillier um the sandbox games and so yeah this this one's I know you're like Chris you just said the the capsule has to be Illustrated sometimes the illustration makes it look too professional in this game needs to look not professional because it's like a silly part of the fun is how janky and broken it looks that's part of the fun I know it's like it seems like well Chris what's all these rules I know it's it's about theme so try it I think it's okay the C the um part of the thing that's helping you is I think also the logo looks very good so it's a good Illustrated logo people underappreciate logos you you did a great job on the logo so even if this is does kind of look like a screenshot was taken of the engine in your case I think it's okay because it's a special type of game um uh you're more like this I thought was very good and what this or or I I mean sorry um these right here you've got Goat Simulator so I think that's good you got this wobbly life engineer is another these are all classic of the wacky physics playing together type of games so I think you did great there I think those are are great that means your tags are doing pretty good some of these I'm not sure but I don't know why Beam andng Drive is there but the other ones look good um overall I mean I think I love your you see see how they kind of tilted the text they put the gift within this like frame that just shows quality see because your game is hilariously janky and I don't mean that pejoratively I mean just mean part of the fun is how broken everything looks and how wacky it looks you have to work extra hard to make your graphics look like you mean it to look bad and you did a good job by doing these like graphical flourishes you're showing like I know how to do art I'm good at it but my game just is on purposely looking B that's how a game like this can get away with it so I don't really see too much let's see if you did your your name tag thing let's see if you did it no you did not create your creater page and Link it to your steam page and it'll be better so do that that's my only critique really so good luck I think it's good yeah okay this one does seem interesting does seem one targeted towards physics Mayhem towards streamers so yeah I'm always curious to see how many of these games find success because it does seem like if a streamer picks it up it can lead to quite a lot of chaos quite a lot of fun quite a lot of sales so yeah this one is looking quite interesting okay so up next let's look at the void project a game that looks very stylish very interesting so yeah let's see if standing out is uh a good thing so yeah Chris go ahead what do you think about this game yeah I love the graphic style I think it's really cool it's like a unique um kind of low poly handdrawn all this kind of just cool looking just looks cool let's look at the short description here in this game you're thrown into a virtual simulation to train for real life threats fight your way through beat the timer fight your way through beat the timer and top the leaderboard okay um this is a game very similar demon what do they call it it was like demon Spore or something demon skulls there was a an arena shooter where you kind of shoot these U waves of enemies and there that one had its its place so these are this is a great like first title um the one thing I don't understand is I don't know if this is a joke where it's like in this game you're thrown into virtual simulation to train for real life threats and then there's like a giant spider coming at you and like flaming balls and it's like I think you're making a joke I don't know I think you're saying like haha a real life throat like giant spider I just don't I don't know if it's if it landed I'll just be totally honest I think I think you should go for just say that this is like a dark like people on Steam love deep dark games and I think your graphics are the right style um a couple things also this is the the thing is like okay so when I saw this um um you know when I was looking at the kind of short description stuff um I don't know it it kind of felt like hey um I'm kind of working on my first game a little bit or something like that well this was the big one that when I said this is what it was so it says early development screenshot just take that out don't put that in there just just remove this text this this is very similar to that warning text that I said that you should remove when you see these things this makes people think oh this is the first developer this is developer's first game they're not confident about it they're looking for any reason not to like your game and these sort of things I know you're trying to say like it's not finished yet the I know the graphics you don't like the graphics you're still working on them well if you're not ready to show it then don't show it um so take this stuff out it just it just creates a bad impression I understand what you're feeling but don't do it um and so now I'm looking at the lines of like well this this game's not ready this game's not good and then when you look at the screenshots they're all very similar um same color and so like see how this it's just like um you know it's I see the same three enemies there's spider there's flaming and then there's this guy here I think that's the third guy so when I see the same enemies repeated over and over in the screenshots and all the guns are the same like I understand that it's like a wave based shooter kind of arcade style but I would expect you know guns to be different maybe you get a grenade launcher these things when I see all the same gun all the same colors all the same um kind of enemies that makes me think I don't know if there's enough here so what I'd recommend is I thought maybe when you had the shaders here oh these are different environments I don't understand this this panel but even if you did a couple levels in this style a couple levels in this blue Style and a couple there that would show variety and you you should change the texture of the ground the gun should change a little bit there should be different monsters different types of monsters I know this is maybe like a small project that you as maybe first time Dev is working on but I just feel like it just makes it it's giving off Vibes of like oh first project not there and then the other thing that I see is um like this spider image that you have here is the exact thing same thing for your it's the exact I could tell you just cut this out and put that in your cap don't do that remember you want the capsule to Showcase like I think it's a cool capsule I actually think it's okay I know it's a screenshot of of an engine I actually think it's okay I think it looks cool but then don't go ahead and show that guy in your screenshots take that out because they didn't it it gives that impression like oh well the guy didn't pay for capsule artist he just took a screenshot of his game and put it in there he's probably not investing much effort into this game that's the impression I'm not saying that that's truth but that's the thing that you're trying to prevent that Vibe giving off okay so really really do everything in your power to eliminate that that feeling that people might get so um that's the big thing that I saw for that okay one thing that I noticed is on the description this one has no gifts which right away I would say makes me feel like this is a game from 10 years ago back when steam did not have gifts so would you say gifts is definitely something you should add yeah and especially like you've got a low poly kind of low style and that's okay I love that style but you have to overcome it with making it look fluid and animated and have all these extra particle effects and make it just feel and look good and if you don't have those gifts you can't do it like screenshots just don't look as good as as those gifts do so I really recommend getting those gifts in there I think it's it'll you're you're really trying to show how much art you've invested in this game and if you don't see enough art you're like ah I don't think there's developers investing as much in this game okay so sounds good okay so next for something a little bit different let's look at one called Taka Taka this one actually already came out it launched with about 500 wish lists and it seems to have a decent stor page so I wonder if this was the case of the developer didn't do too much marketing beforehand because to me the steam page does look interesting but again if no one knows about your game doesn't really matter how good the steam page is so yeah Chris let's see uh what does this steam Page look like yeah so first off beautiful artart looks great I I mean I really got that like Okami sty remember that game Okami from a while ago really beautiful art and so I think that was really great um a couple things um that I see uh just like short description stuff and this kind of goes back to the lore like it's an interesting concept um rhythm game feudal Japan type of era um when I see some of these short descriptions like play as tenu and Oni an unlikely pair attempting to survive the world of Yoo Kai uh I that's that kind of lore stuff like that's not going to attract people so I always say take those names out I always say take out nouns add verbs so what am I doing in the game not who am I who's Yoki where's the land of Yoki um that stuff it just it it it slows people down they're like what is this important I don't know I just want to find out what type of game it is so I think that's an important thing um I did originally think that this was a board game just looking at screen shots but then once I looked at the videos and the gifts I could tell oh it's a rhythm game where the the monsters come I think I think that's the the main thing that I kind of took away from it again the art is beautiful but um yeah I think it's it's just the rhythm aspect of it is is important to Showcase so I saw that um tags are good you've got some good Rhythm Games showing up like beat saer in there I don't know why Hades is showing up but double check them I always say run the run them a few times so run the the tagging wizard once every once in a while just make sure your tags are up to date um but that's the main thing that I saw yeah so on this one considering how this one is already released I guess my question is is it worth it trying to update and optimize a team page after release or not no I think it's so what happens and and then I talk about this in my course just to to check in again so we're this course is on sale until July um uh one of the things I teach in the course is like it's really once your game goes on sale steam makes a lot of judgments on it um they look at how much money you've earned and if you don't earn enough steam's like well thanks for playing good luck next time and they they you basically get no visibility after that launch and so it's very hard like and steam will say Hey you can always surprise us you can always pull in among us but it is very very very very hard to come out of that hole because there's so many other things built up as to why a game did not succeed um so after the game has done has released and if it's if the sales were a little softer than you wanted I say put out one update just to show you're good Dev you care about it you know fix some bugs and stuff show that you're a good Dev and you care about the game but then move on um you can't optimize your steam page out of a a softer launch than you thought uh I'll just be totally honest okay yeah that's great to know okay so yeah that was awesome thanks so much Chris I hope everyone learned quite a lot but if people want to keep learning working to go go ahead yeah so I I'm teaming up with Hugo here we're we're working on a a special Cross promo deal um I put these courses on sale and and Hugo um uh if you buy it through Hugo's site you click one of these links um you support Hugo you support me and I teach you how to Market these games you know I set a big part yes you could make the steam page you could fix it you could improve the short description but the big thing is that really improves the numbers really gets you better wish list and eventually more sales is you have have to go through and find out that external marketing bring people to your page and then the steam algorithm kind of picks it up and and takes it from there and so really I've built a course like uh wishlist invisibility master class that tells you how to get that outside person to kind of come in and and feature your game like a streamer or a festival and then really bring real traffic to your page like I've been uh doing this for two or three years and we've had some real big successes like tiny Glade is one of the games that took the class really like liked it and they just crossed a million wish lists and I'm not making that that up not not saying like million as a just made up number like they literally have a million wish lists so the big fans of the the course it really works it's been tried and tested for two to three years so and I've put this on sale this time of year and in November that's it I don't discount this all the time so now is the time to grab it um if you want to do the whole bundle so I've got this pitching class uh down below if you're looking to get a a publisher that pitching class is great uh I worked with one of the best uh people in the industry about how to get a publisher how to reach out to them how to get that money to fund your game um so I worked with them and then I took both of those courses and I bundled them together and then I threw in all these other courses so it's a big package deal it's the best deal like if you get two courses super deep discount by doing that but bundling and again I'm teaming up with Hugo so um you're supporting Hugo when you pick up these courses and you're just teaching yourself how to Market a game so um really uh really glad to be part of this and uh you've got a great Community Hugo so thank you so much for uh sharing these great steam pages with me all right that's awesome yeah and thanks for sharing all your knowledge with all of us all right thanks Chris talk to you later
