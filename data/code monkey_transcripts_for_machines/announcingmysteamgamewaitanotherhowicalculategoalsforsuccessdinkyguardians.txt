hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here is my next team game called dinky Guardians it's a fun Coop multiplayer game where you play as a guardian in a world where there are some tiny defenseless creatures called dinkies here is the quick 40 second trailer and afterwards I'm going to answer the question that you're probably thinking about and talk about my goals with this game ways foreign foreign game you must explore the world together some food and resources to keep the dinkies alive build a colony set up machines see other resources and feed them although there are also some zombies and all they want to do is eat some dinky so you need to keep them safe build your defenses automate resource Gathering and survive do all of that while either playing Solo or with some friends check out the steam page Link in the description and add it to your wishlist now let me address the elephant in the room if you are a regular viewer on this channel then you might know that I have already announced another steam game several months ago that one Liberation so it might seem strange why I'm now announcing another steam game before finishing that one first of all the answer is sudden World Liberation is not canceled I'm still very excited about that game and definitely want to complete it I think the final game will be really awesome but while it is not canceled it is definitely on a short Hiatus let me tell you my reasons and my new plan hopefully it won't be interesting to you as an indie game developer and this video is also a nice practical example of how volatile in the game development is and how you must always be ready to adapt even when you already have quite a lot of experience just like I do basically going with tunnel run Liberation was launched it in the summer of this year but as you might also know recently I spent three months working on two free complete courses I love making those and I'm really happy the response has been really positive everyone seems to really enjoy how much they learn from them however naturally as I was working on those three courses I did not have the time to work on turnover Liberation that game is really complex it has tons of interesting interconnected systems so it's not something that I think that I can build in just two or three months so because of that I have to delay my original launch date possibly to the end of this year or maybe even Beyond although I really really want to publish a steam game this year my lesson was in 2019 so it's been way too long also one very important thing about how to find success on Steam is you need to make sure you participate in a steam Festival these are excellent events that happen several times a year where players can play tons of free demos they are great for finding new players and Gathering wish lists to make sure you have a successful launch you can only participate in one scene Festival so you should choose the one just before release related to that the next team festival is in June and the way that scene works is you need to sign up and register for the festival in advance in this case the registration deadline for the June Festival was in midmarch so basically by midmarch I had to decide if I was going to launch Star Wars Liberation around July August or not and with delay caused by the free courses I don't think that I can hit that date after that the next team festival is in October if I were to participate in that one I could then launch a game in a small window in November basically you don't want to launch when there's a steam sale so I would have to avoid the Halloween sale and the end of the year sales which means there's a very short window around that time so most likely if I did attend the October Festival I would probably only be able to launch a game in January or February and like I said I really really want to launch a Sim game this year so I was not happy with that plan as I was looking at my options I was thinking what could I possibly do again I had to decide all of this very quickly before the scene first registration date in midmarch and at that same time while I was working on the free multiplayer course I really enjoyed working with the tool set and thinking about multiplayer so the solution that I came up with was why don't I make a short and simple multiplayer game something that I can launch this year and have more time for developing total learn Liberation and that's exactly what I did I very quickly got to work on coming up with an interesting design I wanted something multiplayer Coop casual fun but I didn't want to make something super generic so I added some Colony building some Automation and some defense elements I think design will be pretty fun to play the game that I can picture in my head is pretty interesting and again the goal is make the game short and sweet make it quickly to launch this year so I very quickly set up the scene page it needed to be public in order to register for the June scene Festival I wrote description created the new ENT project thankfully I did manage to do all of that on time even though I was super busy finishing up the multiplayer course I published the page and did manage to register for the festival so just like I did when I Liberation here my goals for this project even though this is a shorter project I still wanted to be successful so I have the same Target monthly income goal of around two thousand dollars if I launch a game in July that means four months of development so a goal of eight thousand dollars net revenue this is net not gross revenue I covered the math behind that difference in another video assuming net revenue is about 40 percent of gross revenue that means I need a total of twenty thousand dollars gross based on this I can come up with a price to see how many copies I need to hit price point is actually really tricky one very difficult thing about making multiplayer games is you need players to actually play them so for this it really helps to sell more copies at the same time the general recommendation is you really shouldn't price your games under ten dollars the game will have a single player component but still I want to make sure there's enough people playing that someone can play with strangers so honestly right now I'm not internally sure on the price point perhaps I'll put it at just five dollars maybe 10 I'm really not sure for this estimate let's pick a number in the middle so let's say seven dollars that means in order to hit the goal it needs to sell about 3000 copies now that we know this number we can go to the next step which is wishlist they are an excellent predictor of sales if you're making a game that you want to be successful you must spend time and effort together as many wishlists as you can before launch so let me take this time to ask you to click the link in the description and add the game to your wish list the more wishlist you have the more steam promotes your game even if the people on wish listing aren't really interested in picking up the game at launch even without that more wish lists is always better but of course hopefully those wishlists won't convert into some sales the general conversion math is around 20 on week one if you're wondering where this number comes from it's from the two excellent game marketing sources that I covered in my marketing video the newsletter game discover Co and Chris Zukowski from how to Market your game so the math is usually around 20 conversion on week one and usually sales for year one are three to five times week one so putting all of that together let's say the goal is 1 000 copies sold on week one which would mean three to five thousand copies sold on year one with a 20 conversion rate it means 5000 wishlist needed that sounds like a relatively achievable goals although wishlists also have a sort of soft goal around 10 000 that's usually the amount that you should have so let's aim for a 10K wishlist if I hit that I should be able to get 1000 sales on week one funnily enough these are actually the exact same goals that I set for tournament Liberation simply because this game will have a lower price point but also a shorter death cycle it will have less time to get those wishlists since release is meant to be just four months from now so it will be very tricky to hit 10K but hopefully the demo is great and the festival really helps with all the math on here are all of the main goals once you game in July of 23 launch with 10 000 wishlists have those wish lists converted into 1 000 week one copy sold and 3 000 year one copy sold do that in order to hit twenty thousand dollars in gross revenue and eight thousand dollars in net revenue which would equal around two thousand dollars per month development which would be a decent amount now let's split this into three scenarios so this one is the good scenario half of these amount would be the bare minimum scenario and that one would be the great scenario these are my goals with this game and this is my current plan make this small short and sweet game and watch it this year then leave the more complex game for the next year just for fun you can go watch a video announcing total one Liberation to see how these goals compare with those spelling alert they are basically exactly the same another reason for making this small scope project for Tone Room Liberation I really want that game to be very successful I want the final game to come out really awesome I think the game ID really does have a lot of potential if I can execute it correctly in order to ensure that I really want to make sure I remember everything required for a successful scene launch so that's another reason for making this game I would like to completely in lower 6 project in order to be better prepared for a much bigger project I'll win some bonus info for those of you still watching the video an update on the Eternal World Liberation wishlist they are currently a bit above the 5K Mark you can also see the phone remote they are currently at about 700 which makes for a phone work tuitionless radio of about eight usually it's around 10 or more I guess since I have this channel there's more people interested in following the game than usual so that's just some fun stats and all of this is my new plan I hope that by being transparent about my plans and how they change over time I hope this gives you a better view of what it's like to be an indie game developer and how you need to adapt whatever happens probably most of you don't have a YouTube channel that takes time away from your game but you probably do have a regular job that does pretty much the exact same thing so hopefully this video helped you see an example for how while things might not go exactly the way you want them to you can always adapt alright so now I got to get to work on this game four months isn't a lot of time and I have a lot to do stay tuned for some interesting devlogs and since this is a multiplayer game I'll also be doing some play tests so stay tuned for that again please check the link in the description and add the game to your wish list thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
