in this video I'm going to go over the progress on my Steam game along with an overview of how each ailment works trading cards scenarios performance improvements and more by the way next month there's going to be unite Copenhagen which is a unity conference with lots of interesting talks about all kinds of unity features as well as looking into what's coming in the future I've been invited by unity to attend and if you're planning on going you can use this coupon code to get 20% off the ticket price all right what so a lot of great progress these past few weeks the game is really coming along nicely there's still a lot to be done but I've gotten to the point where sometimes I go in for a quick test and end up playing for 20 minutes so that's usually a good sign all the various systems are starting to come together into a cohesive experience with nice progress if you want you can pick up the game right now on early access or just add it to your wish list and you'll be notified for the phone release on September 2nd and if you do get the game please make sure to write a review since those Humpty game get more visibility as well as providing valve on feedback all right then let's all get some elements I've been working on here's the first of these team features and one of the most important ones the trading cards trading cards are always stressful for me to make since I'm not an artist but I think I managed to make some great ones the cards are based on each of the game modes in the game and I think them look quite nice so there are six trading cards to collect with the usual five badges postoil 10 emoticons and three profound backgrounds that's the first of the same features done now next week I still have to work on adding achievements cloud workshop and others so a lot of work is not to be done in terms of progress on the game itself I finally managed to get almost everything set up for multiple different scenarios each of them has a slightly different visual and build area along with different guest preferences research and so on the scenarios are how the game handles progression so on the first scenario the player won't go through the tutorial and deal with some very simple guests essentially they will enjoy pretty much every building then on the next scenario the guests become more picky about exactly what they like so what specific arena type with a specific layout size and so on so there are a lot of elements that make each scenario unique with increasing difficulty also one new addition is the visual expansion of the build area now until right now the map never changed so originally it was tough to actually see where you could build but right now the visuals on the outside perfectly matched the valid building area so here I can easily see how far I can build and then I can do some research research the expanding build area and when I do there you go it expanded and here on the second scenario it expands what time so now there it is the visual matches the actual built area now I spend the end and II visual expands and I spend the third time and the vision will expend some more it's now it's very easy to see where I can build how the scenarios are completed is through the objectives so over here the scenario objectives now each scenario has a set of objectives like you must reach a certain park rating or have a certain amount of guests in the park and so on when the player completes all the objectives then he can move on to the next scenario so it's at a nice goal that differs per each different scenario now one of the things that I still want to implement is some sort of degree of completion so if you complete the basic objectives you can move to the next scenario if you want or you can also stick around in the same scenario continue playing your current game and try to achieve bonus objectives that would give the player more flexibility for how they want to fight one very important change I've made in the last update was modifying the amount of time to be longer so here the clock goes up much slower even on super fast speed the reason for this decision was due to how so many of the sets from the game are sorted in terms of month so for example here on the overlays for the revenue it shows the total and then for each particular month the more complex buildings actually take quite a while to complete the entire behavior so in here it takes quite a while for them to all set up on the ESCO in all they fight and so on so previously they were going just once per month the result of that is that the per month data was very inconsistent so the longer month allows for each monthly value to be more smooth which helps understand if things are going well or badly now if you're interested in how the code works here it is here is the clock class as you can see it's pretty simple it is based on the time.take system in order to keep track of time I've covered this system in another video so check that out how it works and how it can be useful so the time.take system won't take on every time tick and here I just have a bunch of functions to convert a specific time tick into various days months and years so in here in order to make the month longer only did was modify this concept so it used to be a thousand takes per month and now it 1,700 takes per month so that's all I need to change in order to make each month longer and then the static event works the same as always so everything else works falsi related to the new month is the new month stats window so let's wait for the amount to complete and after October is done and here we go and yep there it is our new nice month stats window so this shows some basic stats related to the previous month so you can easily see the changes to see if you're doing better or worse so here for example 16% improvement on the revenue 11% down on the guests entertained and won increased on the park rating it also shows the most positive and most negative thought so you can easily identify what your guests are complaining about so you can fix and improve and over here the assistant tip which is something that I really want to add in Tekken games one of the game design problems is that it's always difficult to teach the player absolutely everything since there are so many systems at work in order for the tutorial to be short and brief I have to focus on only teaching the absolute essentials so this nice little tip every month really helps the player to give more tips on how to improve and explain how each system works there is also a new guests window it shows a bunch of stats for guests like how many are in the park how many I visited total the average happiness and so on so that's nice but more importantly is here on the right these are the guest preferences for the guests on this particular scenario so every guest that gets spawn has these particular preferences so for example there won't be no guest spawned where their favorite building is eat don't show them so using this information you can decide how best to build your Park so in this case make an arena of any type other than team deathmatch and make sure that it's a size small now the guests still go to all arenas and buildings but they prioritize the ones that best match up with their preferences and if all the preferences match they love the arena and are willing to pay more another new window is over here the new research window this one is much better much more clear compared to the old version so the buttons are bigger the icon are more easily seen and you can easily see which ones have already been unlocking which ones need to be unlocked the tooltips also help clarify the reason why for example all this research is locked which is not available in this scenario so this one is already locked this one can be a lot and these are not available so you can see that the research progression is tied to the scenario progression now down here you can see the new addition the advertising system I'm still working on it but the goal is to provide a use for the laboratory when all the research of a particular scenario has been done so after you research all of the available research you can get your work is busy doing advertising the result is an increase in the number of guests obviously each of them becomes more expensive and it has a higher effect here is the advertising class as you can see the various types Flyers newspaper and TV the cost for each of them how many workers are needed in order to start doing that advertising it's for example in order to do adverts on TV you need to have six workers working on the in laboratory and over here is the guest bonus per each type the guest bonus is used over here on the guest spawn or class as you can see each scenario has a maximum guest spawn amount and how many guests are spawned is dependent on the park rating multiplied by that maximum so over here on level one if you have a park with a hundred rating then you won't have 300 guests going into your park on a level three 100 rating won't equal five on a guest so that's the base for the maximum guest spot amount and then you add the advertising guest bonus which again also multiplied by the park grade so here on the es bonus you can see the TV has a bonus of 200 so in theory if you were on level three with a perfect park rating and TV advertising working you would get five hundred plus 200 so seven hundred maximum guests on your part so this is a great new feature new tool to keep things engaging in the awake game now once again I have improved ground performance so previously the game would hang whenever you place the ground so as I place here the game with essentially hanging for 500 milliseconds and right now as you can see there's pretty much no hang whatsoever because the thing is being done in just 20 milliseconds so that's a massive improvement the way I achieve this performance boost was due to how the ground tiles are displayed over here in the editor you can see that the gram tile is a dynamic mesh filled up with dozens of quads so with the wireframe enabled you can see each of them is a different quad so previously the issue with the system was I was adding each one to the mesh and updating it one by one so essentially it would add this quad update mesh at this one update at this one update and so on and so on now as you might know it's very slow to actually update the mash and send the data to the GPU so what I did is first just work with simple arrays and fill them up with the necessary data so over here on the upgrade ground visuals function I first set up my mesh race so the vertices U visa and triangles then I cycle through all the ground objects and here previously I was adding it to the mesh for every single one whereas right now I'm simply adding it to the mesh erect so on this cycle goes through every single ground mesh and fills out these arrays and then at the end when all of them have been filled up with the correct data I finally update the mesh on the GB so the end result is a pre massive performance improvement and the game should no longer hang when adding more ground towns as you can see everything is smooth and works great one small thing I've added is that the arena's now support all sizes so previously my idea was to limit the sizes so for example a duel arena could not be large and a pattern where all arena could not be small this was an interesting idea but just end up with adding unnecessary confusion so with the addition of the yes preferences it was better just let all arenas have all sizes so this is another example of those tiny game design problems that can only be solved through iteration in the previous video I covered how I made the transporters carrying multiple weapons which really helps keep the game going and reduces overall weight time now another great improvement I've added was merging of various arena states so previously the arena's would wait to fully complete each state so the guests would go in they start fighting they finish the battle then they would go to leave when some of them left they the workers would finally go in and start doing the cleanup and once the cleanup was done then they would the set up and everything starts over now the change is that all of those three tasks now happened at the same time so as soon as the arena is done so there it is the bump is going to be the fuse and as you can see now they won't all start to leave at the same time as they are leaving the workers are cleaning up the arena and at the same time as they are cleaning up they are also setting up grabbing the new items and placing them on the same position so all of those tasks are now happening at once which makes everything go much smoother with much less waiting time so that coupled with the longer month really helps to keep all of the stats more smooth over time so that's what I've been working on lightly some of these features are already live on the current version and others I'm so working on oh no I'm quite pleased with how the game is turning out it's looking quite nice and everything works great so I'm really looking forward to having the final release if you want you can pick up the game right now on early access or just add it to your wish list and you'll be notified for the full release on September 2nd and if you do get the game please make sure you write a review since those help the game get more visibility as
