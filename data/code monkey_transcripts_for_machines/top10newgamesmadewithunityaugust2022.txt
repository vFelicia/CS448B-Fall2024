hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity launching August 22. the reason why I make these videos is show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all of these games are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick them up also right now the two excellent humble bundles are still active the tools bundle was supposed to end but it got extended if you haven't seen these bundles I highly recommend you unlock them it's a massive 98 discount so it's worth it if just a single asset looks interesting alright so starting off at number 10 with the biggest hit this month count of the lamp it's a very unique game the subject matter sounds pretty ominous and serious running account but it's combined with some very cute lamp characters and it seems that people really like this combo already has over 20 000 very positive reviews and already sold over 1 million copies in just one week the game itself isn't action brokelike you run a count which means you go out on adventures you fight off enemies and grow your flock by Saving new followers you can then give them a name change their form and what makes them unique then you preach some daily sermons to your file content to them you'll need them feed them and build your small community and of course there are always those nonbelievers so it's up to you to decide how to handle them the game definitely uses a very unique style so that's probably the main reason why it's been so successful and behind that style is also an excellent very well made game and up next we have a nice Indie sequel Hardware S2 it's a really gorgeous game I love the visuals on this one great assets with some very thick Shadows giving it a really nice comic book look the game is a turnbased strategy game so something along the lines of XCOM but Western and with some fantasy on that elements as you might know I spent the last five months working on my turnbased strategy course so this genre is definitely one that I very much enjoy you have some very unique abilities and you use your revolver to bounce bullets and hit your tires from cover that makes for some very interesting tactic scenarios and of course in a western you are only as good as your Posse so recruit and equip them with punchier guns explosives and trinkets for all kinds of effects take out all the enemies and keep your squad alive in these sequence are pretty rare and this one seems to improve upon the original in every way so if you're looking for some nice turnbased tactics then check this out then if you want to experience some Mayhem with Friends check out plate up this is a coop roguelite management game definitely a unique mix the obvious comparison would be with overcooked which is also an excellent game but this one stands out by adding that management layer so you need to both manage the kitchen as well as a restaurant so you place down some tables and chairs upgrade your equipment so you can cook faster when player Cooks well the other one is out serving food then you also select from a bunch of cards what exactly you want your restaurant to be like so we only go for some Gourmet dining or maybe something more like fast food the choice is yours it features some local as well as some online multiplayer it already has overwhelmingly positive reviews so if you have a group of friends and want to have a good time then this looks excellent for some really nice management here we have farthest Frontier features very gorgeous and very realistic visuals looks really nice it looks set in kind of the 1800s so you have horses and carriages lots of small buildings and some Churches being a management surround game means that you need to go out you need to gather resources hunt fish and farm to survive then take those raw materials and craft something use that to trade consume and equip your villagers to fight for their survival the description says that it features one of the most detailed farming systems ever I'm definitely curious to see what that means there's also a very Advanced Village simulation so the villagers have their lives and they manually transport Goods so things don't just magically disappear from one place and appear another and being said in the 1800s means you have to deal with all of the oldtimey diseases like scurvy dysentery and color despite looking like a relatively Niche game it already has over 5000 very positive reviews so if you're into city builders then this looks like an excellent new one and up next for something really stylish and really awesome here is rollerdrome it's an extremely unique game I've heard it described as Tony Hawk meets Max Bane so that definitely has me intrigued basically you have a bunch of roller skates then you can go into slow motion and shoot some bad guys you have several weapons at your disposal and the way that you reload is by doing some tricks so you're constantly on the Run jumping and doing all kinds of tricks to shoot the bad guys and get a high score the game has a generous aim assist system so your focus is really on looking cool rather than on Pixel Perfect aim visually it also definitely stands out with a very unique style some very thick outlines on everything coupled with some really nice sound shading so all in all it's a very unique stylish game I love both Tony Hawk and Max Payne so this combo definitely interests me for some VR here we have a really interesting one Airport ground handling Simulator the really interesting part about this one is that it's not exactly a game it's literally a training simulator with that you can expect some excellent realism and insane levels of accuracy and detail so if you've ever wanted to inspect a plane up close open some cargo doors fill up with gas and so on if that's a desire you have then this looks excellent it's an early access which means it launched with just one of the planned 5 scenarios personally I think that VR is an excellent platform for this kind of training simulator and I'm really looking forward to some things like this becoming more and more common maybe one day there won't be a realistic car admission Factory game or something managing a warehouse or maybe a Space Center so the future looks really interesting for this kind of VR training simulators and I'm definitely curious to see more than if you're a fan of rts's here's a very realistic one called regiments it is set during the height of the Cold War the focus really is on accuracy realism and combined arms rather than sending hundreds of soldiers you send artillery to soften your target then break through the enemy line engage in some tactical Retreats stage defenses and some counter attacks you fight on massive maps and need to win multiple small engagements in order to win the war features lots of real world units some tanks helicopters airplanes all of them with tons of stats and some really authentic models the game features a smooth learning curve and a nice campaign that tells a complex story of warfare around the inner German border from multiple perspectives certainly is a very unique game in the RTS genres since there are no infantry just lots of mechanized combat then for a game with a very unique mechanic called backpack hero it's an inventory management roguelike again definitely a very unique combo this is basically if you took my Tetris inventory system that I covered in a previous video and basically made a fun game based on that idea it looks really awesome you have tons of items as you explore this dungeon then every item has a certain shape and it's up to you to put it in your backpack in the best place possible the placement of the items has a huge impact you can play certain items next to others for some huge bonuses there are hundreds of rare items each with their own unique effect and the inventory isn't really a neat rectangular shape you expand it as you explore the Dungeon and get some really interesting shapes so if you want to see how to take an interestingly connect and make an entire game around that then this game is an excellent use case that you can study then for something that just came out of Early Access across the Obelisk it's a deck building roguelite RPG where you choose Your Heroes unlock items and cards craft your deck and face powerful enemies in deep tactical combat There are 16 unique characters who unlocked your party and over 500 cards and items for you to choose craft and upgrade being a roguelite means that it has procedural world making everyone unique and highly refleable and one very unique thing is how it features four player online coop so when playing in multiplayer each player controls one unique hero which means you all have to work together to decide what is best for the group as usual with every game that launched out of Early Access you can definitely expect to have tons of content already has over 3000 very positive reviews so if you don't like this genre definitely give it a look and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month here we have the second game in the two point franchise two point campus just in case you don't know this is a team that was formed by former bone frog veterans that was a studio that made theme park Hospital For Me theme hospital was a huge part of my childhood I absolutely loved that game so when the scene was formed and they came out with their previous game two point hospital I played right away really awesome this time they are taking their signature style and applying it to a University campus so it's filmed with the usual and silly humor that you would expect for example you have night school where you guessed it you train some Medieval Nights you built your University hired some staff and encourage students to enroll in your courses the whole thing looks very silly and a very fun time all the building tools are really easy to use placing buildings roads props all of that is super simple and it all looks really nice and jolly the game already has a thousand very positive reviews so it seems like it's yet another great hit I'm really looking forward to playing this one and seeing what other genres they won't tackle in the future I can't wait until 10 years from now when there's a whole bunch of awesome fun twopoint games alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity and launch in August 22.
