hello and welcome I'm your codemy here's a super useful video that I've wanted to do for a real long time it's all about the tons of Visual Studio shortcuts that I use all the time which helped me be extremely productive using all of these is definitely one big part of the reason why I managed to make my last game dinky Gardians in just 7 months and I managed to do that despite being a very complex automation management game with hundreds of classes and tens of thousands of Lins of code the more efficient you are at using your tools the faster you can iterate upon your ideas so speed is definitely a very valuable thing and in terms of game development the faster you can make your game the cheaper it will be making it much easier to make profitable games now this video is actually a lecture taken from my upcoming C complete course where you can learn everything from the absolute basics for beginners to more complex topics for advanced users the course has some really nice bonuses with a ton of frequently asked questions there's some fun quizzes and some really interesting interactive exercises to help you truly learn I'm still hard at work on it still have to record a bunch more lectures still have to write a bunch more quizzes and build tons of interactive exercises hope hopefully I will be able to get it all done before the end of February you can sign up with the link description I'll let you know when it's out and if you want to learn specifically about y then check out my ultimate unity overview course covering 70 tools and features the engine has or for a guid path check out my two free course making a game step by step and then making it multiplier okay so let's learn about a ton of super useful shortcuts to help you massively increase your productivity hello and welcome I'm your codm in this lecture we're going to learn about a bunch of really useful Visual Studio shortcuts okay so as we get to the intermediate stage it is it's really important to be good at using your tools and as a programmer your main tool is going to be your ID so you should be very comfortable with shortcuts and moving around your codebase but also this is something that you pick up with experience so this lecture this one is really not meant to be a stepbystep lecture but rather I just want to show you a bunch of shortcuts that I use myself just so you are aware they exist and over time you won't pick them up and they won become more and more natural okay so the most basic but honestly most useful one is simply moving the cursor normally beginners they use the mouse to move around so they scroll down and click wherever they want to write and then sometimes beginners use the arrow keys and they press it like a million times in order to get wherever they want to go technically this works but it's obviously not very efficient there are many ways to speed this up and importantly many ways to navigate your code base without your fingers ever leaving the keyboard for example when moving left to right technically you can indeed just press the right arrow key and eventually you won't get there but as you can see going left to right like this takes quite a while I got to press like something like 50 times in order to get to the beginning or the end so one of the best super simple shortcuts is simply to hold down the control key and now as you move left right yep instead of going letter by letter it goes word by word so that way now I can get to the beginning or the end of this line in just about four or five presses instead of being like literally 50 so it is literally 10 times faster then of course you also have the home and end keys I use these all the time especially when combined with shift for quickly selecting something so for example if I want to move this line above the Southern Line if so then usually what I do is press n to go to the end of this line then hold shift and press up to select and now press end again in order to select just that one then I press CR X to cut I move up press contrl V and yep like that so if you do it pretty quickly it goes quite fast very easy to do all this and again I did all of that without ever my fingers leaving the keyboard if I were to use the mouse I would have to select like this crl x go like this like this so in this case not much of a speed difference but just the fact that your fingers never have to leave the keyboard that alone is a huge bonus and again on all these shortcuts we're going to see how differen is usually pretty small like saving like a second 5 seconds or fractions of a second so that does sound like a super tiny amount but considering how you're probably going to be programming for many years and you're going to write millions of lines of code throughout your entire life when you look at it like that those tiny amounts of time they really add up so that's main thing just moving left and right holding control to go between each word or using end and Home in order to go back to the beginning and the end and combining all of that with shift in order to really move around super quickly so that's the first step and then for something that is sadly not default is moving the cursor up and down so by default if you do that it obviously only moves one line at a time so again the same thing in order to move down 20 or 30 lines it actually takes quite a lot of pressing in order to move and by default the alternative is using page up or page down although personally I'm not a big fan of this I find that these move the cursor way too much so every time I press page down it takes me quite a while to realize where the cursor is and how much actually moved so I don't like how this moves way too much so in my code I added something so that I can move the cursor up and down vertically by just five lines that way I can very easily go down and Contin scrolling down and I'm never lost because the screen never changes a massive amount I'm always moving down moving up select this line of do something move down write something so on now sadly this behavior isn't available by default in Visual Studio at least not that I know of so for this I install this extension called visual Commander this one lets you basically apply some hotkeys to literally anything you can do in visual studio and then with that install just go up here into extensions and here is the V command and on this one here are some commands that I made so here is the window so I've got move up and move down so I can edit in order to see what this is doing and yep it is executing the command line up so literally just moves the line up and the other one this one does the same thing but line down so I've got these two commands here if I have the cursor somewhere and I go into that extension and I use the move up command yep it does move up by six lines so then as you can see I just assigned some keyboard shortcuts to those so control up and control down then I just went into tools options and over here go down into the keyboard shortcuts and then find VSS command and up here command one command two those are two ones that I made and as you can see I've have assign them to control up arrow and control down arrow so all that if I press control up or control down as you can see the cursor moves quite a lot faster so I find this to be much better than just pressing one just moves one line or pressing page up which always causes me to lose and get lost so we just these steps you can see how I can move in the code really fast without ever touching the mouse like let's say I want to go down I want to find for example the awake I want to select the awake I want to cut it and paste it down here and there you go just like this and remove these lines format and so on so as you can see just using these control in order to move between the words using this shortcut in order to move vertically really fast and combined with home and end and with shift and and all that put all those together and yep you can move through the cursor you can move in your code base really quickly without ever leaving the keyboard then of course if you're working on some kind of Big File like for example this is the player class from my steam game dinky Gardens so this is a Prem massive class for this one if I want to get to the bottom and if I go even with this short this is going to take quite a while so for that one if you want to move a massive amount you can use control home or control end order to go to the beginning or the end the file so this is yet another way to very quickly move around and another very useful one for moving around is simply put the cursor on top of some kind of symbol like for example let's say this one this event on player picked up the experience and then if you press control shift and either up or down this will move the cursor to the next or previous reference of that symbol so for example over here you can see how it's really useful how in this huge line of code this script has almost a thousand lines of code but I can very easily see exactly where this one is being referenced I just move up and down yep here is the definition and here is where I'm using it so whenever you want to see all the various places in which you are using some kind of symbol that can be a function can be an event can be variable can be literally anything just hold down control shift and then up and down and you can see all the places in which that symbol is being used then another extremely useful shortcut that I use all the time is control and comma this one pops out this window and now here you can search for any class you just type a name and find it like for example I want to open up the dinky class so I'm going to type in dinky and now just one thing is this shows actually every symbol so in this case in this game since it's all about dinkies I've got tons of references to dinkies so you can see all of these in lower case I usually write my Ables in lowercase so I know that's not the one I know the one that I want in order to open the file is the actual file itself so I can type in dy. CS and yep that does show the file press enter and Y Here I Am the dinky file and again press control home to get the beginning yep here's the dinky definition and I can see all this code just like this so if I want to move to like the tutorial manager so I just write tutorial manager just write a little bit yep I can already see this one so this is the class we can also see the icon over there so that one means a field that one means a class this one means an event and so on so I can see this one press press enter and yep here I am in this one and again move up move down everything works again note how throughout all of this my fingers never leave the keyboard I never touch a mouse so personally whenever I'm making my games and I want to open another class I never go into unity and manually double click on that file I always do it over here press control comma search for anything press enter and it opens or alternatively for example that one that I mentioned when you got tons of references something like over here tons of references to a dinky so I can just go into this one and then I can put the cursor on top of the type itself and I press on F12 and Y this one takes me to the class definition F12 is a shortcut but if you want to use the mouse you can also just right click on it and over here we can see yep F12 is indeed a shortcut to go to definition now since we're here with the mouse one really useful one is over here the find all references when you click on this this going to show all of the references to that type so this can work with whatever is under the cursor so in this case I select the dinky class so this is going to show me all the places in my entire code base where the dinking class is being used or alternatively you can put it just on a field and yep now this one is going to show all the places and you can click in order to automatically go to that line and of course it also works with functions so for example over here this function I'm pressing control shift up and down in order to see all the references within this file but this function is not called from within this file so in order to find where on Earth am I calling this again right click go to references and if I can see okay so it's being called from this script right here inside dinking manager it's calling this function another really useful use case for that particular one is when working with interface so let's say I want to see all the class that implement this interface again right click find all references and if I can see all of these look at these these are all implementing the I interactable interface then something that I use all the time is control RR that is the shortcut for renaming the current symbol so I just place the cursor for example over here on top of the is moving field press control RR and now let's say I want this to be a little bit more descriptive so is player moving so I change that and note how again the other shortcut control shift and up and down note how this one did rename every single reference of this symbol so all of those I don't need to change them just just modify them once use the rename feature and automatically renames all of them and if I find out that the previous one works better again just edit go ahead remove this press enter and yep there you go all of those have now been renamed remember that refactoring isn't extremely important and importantly it's a perfectly normal part of the process in fact the next lecture is entirely dedicated to the topic of refactoring if there is something that you wrote some name but then later on you think it should have a better name just take some time in order to rename it simp place the cursor over it press control RR write the new name and it will automatically rename every instance of that symbol this works on everything everything from simple variables to even entire classes and it even renames every single reference in your entire codebase so for example here I am on the dinky class which is used throughout the entirety of this code base I can press control RR and I can modify this whole thing and say something and Y like it says here rename will update 297 references in 58 files so this rename feature is really awesome really useful it automatically handles modifying everything and everything is handled automatically for you then when you have multiple windows open for moving between them you can use control tab if you just use one it goes back and forth between the last open tab so this is something that I use all the time whenever I'm working between two files and I want to quickly move between them but instead of doing just that and letting go you can hold down control and tab and as long as you hold down control you can see this window and over here you can move up or down in order to move between all the various windows that you will have open so for example let's say I want to go into dinky off world yep there you go now I'm looking at this class and if I quickly control tab I go back into the previous class and this tab over here this one only works for the windows that are open so again the same thing if you want to open up a new window just press control comma open the window let's say for example I want to find the carry vehicle so I just type in the carry vehicle yep it's right here control enter and this one opens up the carry vehicle class now control Tab and off I want I go back into the dink key and move between them like that then here's a really simple one you can raise an entire line by just having the cursor anywhere on that line pressing contr X that one cuts the entire line that one acts as a cut meaning if you press contrl + V you get the line back alternatively for duplicating you can press contr D although honestly I rarely ever use this one because I can never remember whether it's going to duplicate on the line above or below it so usually if I want to duplicate something I just do the shortcuts that I mentioned a while ago so end above end cut move cut and so on now speaking of copy paste if you press control shift and V if you do that you get an list of your clipboard history so for example a while ago I showed cutting the awake class and yep it is still saved in here so if I press on enter yep it paste that one EXA like that so remember that your clipboard has history it is not just the last thing that you copied you can access the entire history another useful tiny time saer is actually when using the mouse when using that if you want to select some kind of word some kind of symbol obviously you can do the basic thing which is just click and hold and drag throughout to select it so obviously that works but it's a little bit fiddly if you move up or down can be quite tricky so the similar shortcut for that whenever you want to select some kind of word you can just double click and it selected or alternatively hold down control and click in order to select the entire thing this can be quite useful for example when you have some copy pasted code and you want to change some kind of name but for some reason the rename function doesn't work like for example let's say I want to duplicate this code over here so right now I cannot use the rename because this one is going to conflict with that one so instead let's say the active dinky list so I press I select this one control click and there you go like that and if I want like that so control click in order to do control V and so on this one can be quite useful sometimes then something that I only very rarely use is shift and ALT hold those and then move upward down and this one basically lets you select multiple lines of code and edit them at the same time like I said I rarely use this but sometimes can be useful for example for quickly appending or removing some kind of prefix like for example on this enum I've got these values I want to write all them and say tier one tier two and so on so I can select all lines and write tier and writes on all of them or alternatively if this one did have it now I want to remove them just select them all and I can remove them so basally you can write code on multiple lines at the same time and if you want to quit this just press escape and yep back back into a single cursor another Super useful one is when working with events like for example the on any dinky started starving so I can just write the event name then plus equals and then here Visual Studio automatically has a shortcut so you can press tab to insert then if you want you can rename it but usually I keep the exact same name that it suggests so just press enter and Y there you go I've got a new event now I can come here and again use a shortcut contr X to get rid of that go above go to the end press enter go to new line then write some new code so really useful and if you afterwards you decide that you want a better name for this event again remember just say quick control RR in order to rename then if you want to find something of course you have crlf for example finding when I'm invoking some kind of vent so just write invoke and if it finds it obviously normal then the shortcut for going to the next element that one is pressing on F3 and it goes to the next one so it finds that one that one that one and so on in order to go to the previous one you use shift F3 and it goes backwards also by the way this works whether the control F window is open over there but if I press ones in order to close down that window and with this if I press on F3 three yep it still remembers the last thing that I searched then for quickly commenting or uncommenting something you can do control KC and yep it automatically comments that entire line and if you have multiple lines selected contrl KC yep automatically comments and the opposite to uncomment is contrl Ku and yep automatically uncommons St although personally I never really use this one myself again it goes back to how I'm so proficient at just moving the cursor so if I just want to comment all of these I just do the common star go down there common star there you go just like this another useful shortcut is extract method so you can select a whole bunch of code then press control R and M and this one creates a new method with that code so let's say setup and if there you go pretty much took that code and placed it in its own method so this can sometimes be useful although again this is another one that I don't really use myself because again I'm pretty fast at just moving the cursor so if I want to do this kind of thing I really just go into the code that I want I just go I use I move the cursor move up move down then do private void my setup do some kind of function then write it just like this and everything works if you want to go to a certain line you can press control and G this one lets you input some kind of line number so let's say let's see what is at line 500 so I just type in 500 and Y there you go here we are on line 500 now for this one normally I don't really use it when writing code but I do use this one quite a lot when writing the text script for my courses since normally I write my course in a simple text file sometimes it has tens of thousands of lines so for that usually I like to move around by using the line number although in the code I never really have such massive files so I don't normally tend to use it but it's only nice thing to know then of course one that you already know if you make some kind of mistake contrl Zed in order to undo and one you might not know is control shift Zed in order to redo then for moving between visual student Unity just a simple all tab so just once and moves or if you have multiple files just keep pressing Tab and perhaps the simplest and most useful one is simply autocomplete I really advise you to get comfortable with how autocomplete Works learn how to just type a few lectures and then I to press enter or dot or semicolon in order to quickly autocomplete honestly I don't remember the last time there were something like for example try get component I just try a little bit and write like that for example dinky just like this then out Dinky Dinky just like this super simple so just get used with how little you have to write in order to press enter in order to automatically write everything else this works with Fields but obviously it also works with things like functions it works with classes it works with literally anything okay so that was a lot of shortcuts personally I use a lot of these all the time but again I've been writing code for over 25 years if you're not used to using shortcuts then I really don't expect you to suddenly use all of these right away all at once like I said this lecture this one is really not meant to be a stepbystep lecture for the most part right now I just want you to memorize the first ones that I mentioned about how to move through the cursor quickly just memorize those and simply remember that the other ones exist then periodically come back to this lecture every once in a while and watch it again if you do that several times over the next few months then soon enough all of these shortcuts that I mentioned all these will be natural to you just like they are to me all right so that was a lecture taken from my upcoming C course I really hope you found it useful you can sign up to be notified when the course is out with the link in the description it will teach you everything about C starting from the absolute Basics to some more advanced topics so regardless of your skill level I am certain you will learn something new all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
