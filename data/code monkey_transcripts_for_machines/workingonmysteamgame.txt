all right hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here this was quite a bit faster I mean I just went to to eat something then I come back and there already 80 people so yeah thanks for being here on this random stream once again I got a bit of work and I figured I might as well do a live stream I mean I was actually recording a video just a while ago recording tomorrow's video so since I've got the lights and the whole green screen setup I figured I might as well do this so yeah hey everyone nice thanks for being here all right let me just remember how everything works uh all right let me just get rid of the background and yeah should be good okay all right nice so basically I'm going to work on my game I've been working on a nice little update adding tons of quality of life improvements and all kinds of things so I'm going to be continuing to do work on this let me just check my todo list to see all the various things that I've got to do okay that should be should be doable so let's see and see how long this goes hey Super Chat thank you online games you inspire men of us good work wow that's awesome I'm I'm glad that I inspire people I mean it's always kind of funny to to hear that because I'm not really doing anything special meaning I'm really just making games learning about things so I'm doing the things that I want to do and it's really awesome that it also has a positive effect on all of you so thank you all so much for being here this is always it's always wonderful uh okay so I really got to remember how everything works so that I can do this and go through my test list and basically as I go and do things I'm going to be trying to pay attention to chat and try to answer any question do you have anything like that so yep okay all right so the first thing I want to do is actually quite simple it's just the waste icon that looks quite a bit strange let me figure that out let me find the visuals yeah it's the issue with the with the characters over there why not dark mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's that's really it I try looking at dark mode and once I look at it for more than a few seconds all of a sudden my eyes start to pretty much bleed so that's always really tricky how long do you plan to update this game I'm not sure I mean I I'm not planning to update like nonstop Like An Early Access game but definitely I've got plenty of ideas plenty of things that I want to do so so the answer is I'm planning for a long time but very slowly over time that's that's kind of that's kind of the thing that I'm going to do okay so I got my super basic waste icon let me really just cuz basically the problem is that the waist icon is a little bit too visible oh there's a Super Chat cute all right light games thank you so much I'm glad the videos inspire you I wish you the best of luck with your games that's mainly it and Super Chat cute that hey hey how's it going coffee thank you so much yeah I definitely would like a coffee honestly coffee is an interesting thing I know a lot of people talk quite a lot about coffee about how programming requires intense coffee and for me coffee's always been quite of a a strange thing in that it doesn't really give me it doesn't give me much much of a boost but at the same time it really impacts my sleep so for me coffee I pretty much I can only drink it right in the morning because if I drink it like right now I don't even know what time it is like 6 p.m. if I drink it right now then it's going to mess up my sleep in about 3 or 4 hours so yeah coffee is always I quite enjoy it but I can only take it in the morning which is interesting because for a lot of people apparently they they take coffee all the time and apparently that does not affect their sleep so I'm really quite quite envious of that I guess uh what was I doing oh right I was just talking about what is the problem that I'm trying to solve which is basically the waste icon it's supposed to be like a waste bag with a little thingy on top and basically it is way too invisible like that so I really just want to make it a little bit more gray uh okay wow lots of lots of stuff in chat it's quite quite difficult to keep track of it uh how do people have those characters if you just t you get a character and also if you want you can customize your character where's my I always always forget the link there you go There's the link so if you like you can customize your character to get it looking just go into the website log in and you can customize or you can even use a custom texture as you can see down here my character is somewhere down here there it is with a like nice little custom character and there have been some people who have done custom characters so it's a fun thing and since this channel is all about tutorials teaching things if you want to know how I made this you can follow all of these links so how how did I made this transparent entt window how did I handle the mesh Bas animations how am I doing an HTTP request to contact the YouTube API and how did I set up all these characters with all the modular Parts all right okay can you see a Lobby matchmaking tutorial I did Cover both of those I mean the only difference is really you just go into the matchmaking tutorial and before you make a a ticket you actually you first build a Lobby on the lobby you gather all the things and the lobby leader pretty much sets up a matchmaking ticket and the matchmaking ticket will include all those people that's pretty much how you would put both of them together okay now let me do a bit of work and then I'll reat in a little bit all right uh what was I doing CH all right so let me go into the ways and I really just want to make it a little bit more visible so how do I actually brighten this uh let me go into color overlay put it in white just a little bit gray just so it's not completely almost invisible so now if I go back into Unity is down a little bit yeah yeah it's quite a bit more visible all right good that's uh that was my first task super simple very easy to do but yeah the waist icon is now more visible and also where do I got some waste here uh there you go right there so yeah the waist icon now it's a little bit more visible so that's nice that is cool nice haircut that's funny cuz I never know what to do with my hair so I always think it's either too long or too short so so yeah thanks I guess but yeah for me getting a haircut is always quite a bit tricky quite a bit admin uh right okay so that was an easy first task now i' would like to make a character creator cancel or fix the rocket interacting I thought I fixed that one already light mode for your ID yep well it's more like my poor eyes on on dark mode so yeah looking at this does not cause me any issues I can look at this for 20 hours straight in fact just yesterday I was actually fixing a really annoying bug really really strange issue and I was writing code pretty much nonstop for about 10 hours so yeah which on light mode I can do that but if I turn this to dark mode then within 10 seconds my is really cannot handle it so yeah I know that's that's different from most people but yep that's just that's just how my brain how my eyes work pretty much like that uh okay so that was the all right so when I interact rocket already fully built uh but I don't even know if I want to do anything with this message because if I go into the oh crap this thing is it's on the other window the rocket base if I go inside the rocket base on my can interact uh it's not enough resources what do I got some commented code here probably shouldn't um yeah basically if it'sit F built okay I think previously it was testing some like that so yeah many hours do you think you spent on making D Gardens uh in terms of hours I really have no idea in total it was 7 months the video that I'm working on the video that that I was just recording right now the video for tomorrow that is actually going to talk about all of the the first month Revenue as well as well as all the costs and basic basally what assets I use what did I spend on Logo art things so all the revenue all the cost to see how the game is and yeah pretty much the main cost is obviously my own time and for that was 7 months of development so yeah no idea how much that is in terms of uh in terms of hours but yeah pretty much 7 hours making the game and trying to run this YouTube channel at the same time which was quite a big challenge yeah definitely definitely much more challenging than I initially anticipated okay so for the rocket I actually don't think this message is really problematic I mean rocket already fully built I think previously I had a different message and that is why I wanted to change that so yep okay let me see the uh the uh feed dinkies my feed dinkies dinky Behavior because I think I forgot to add a timer on one of these Yeah the code is actually pretty C most things are actually pretty nice although there are some dirty things like the the thing that I was spending a ton of time yesterday trying to fix that was really insane really annoying it really drove me crazy and it was partly because the code on certain parts it is not as good as I would like it to be like for example can I trigger that bug again I'm not sure if I can where did I have that oh right was here but yeah I don't I don't think I can but basically can I maybe I can let me let me see if I can recreate the bug that I had yesterday or if I just fixed it already yeah that is probably fix basically the issue was that how the how the crate containers how these actually identify which crate is on top of it and the way that it does is honestly through not a very good thing which is based on position and basically what was happening was as soon as it spawned some of these objects some of these crates they were just flying away which in turn meant that this guy was no longer linking into that crate crate which in turn meant a object duplication because then this guy would load and to say okay I should have a crate here I can fight a crate so let's create a crate so a bunch of things a bunch of messed up stuff it was all really tricky but okay I'm sorry if that wasn't very very informative I'm talking about how the game works which I imagine is a bit complex but yeah so for the most part the code for for the game is actually quite clean it's actually quite nice I'm quite happy with it yeah definitely has quite a bit of things show prototype of this game uh I still probably have that at some point but I did where did I show that I think it was on the well I guess I can see the it was in the announcement where was the video there was a video where I oh man that's a problem way too many videos so I can't remember where was the video in which I I did the was it on the Polish video let me just make sure to mute it yeah cuz I had a video where I talked about all the differences basically how the basic prototype or actually did I on the announcement maybe well I mean the announcement does show the the thing yeah okay so this was the alpha ver not the Alpha version this was more like the beta version when I announced it so yeah on the original prototype it had none of this art so yeah that was quite a bit tricky yeah but yeah so basically the game has changed quite a bit from the original thing quite a lot of mechanics quite a lot of things basically all of this that I had in the announcement trailer all of this was really just trailer logic meaning it was just visuals moving around walking around everywhere so a lot of this there wasn't that much logic actually involved so I had to actually build on logic so yeah that was it was quite funny yeah quite okay so let me just uh I just want to add a simple timer the UN looking for Hungry dinky timer CU I don't think that this one has any timer no it does not and if you want a nice simple uh a nice and simple performance tip it is very simply just do things less often that that sounds strange but that really is one of the best performance tips that I can give you which is really just whenever you got something that is really complicated do you really need to make it on every single update ERS probably not like for example here does it really need to look for a hungry dinky on every update the answer is not really I mean if a d if no dinky is hungry right now what are the what are the chances that on the very next frame there's one already hungry chances are pretty low so putting this on much less than on every single frame that is a super simple way to try to fix this and I can just add a simple dinky timer so so let me just do this someone asked something that I miss it where do you get the sound effects for your game uh for that really just from tons of asset packs I don't even know uh which ones I mean there I've got so many uh sound packs that I picked up on various humble bundles so yeah every time I need a sound effect I really just go pick up grab something new and yep that's pretty much it can you explain how your function timer works I actually did an entire video on that one and that is one of the most useful classes that I have in my in my utilities so this video was quite a long time ago but I still use this exact class I mean it is right here in my project if I search for function timer there it is the same class that I have in my utilities and basically just triggers an action after some time so that is really pretty simple which language this is C say for a function timer I use function timer I use this one on tons and tons of places if I look for references look at all these references in my game so yeah this class is one of the most useful things that I use like anytime that I need to make any kind of timing logic I really just use this it is super simple let's see on the autobot what is the autobot doing based on timer testing if it's out of power so basically if it's out of power okay I think this was something related to the order and the execution on the power consumers and yeah so basically just use the function timer in order to delay this execution by any bit super simple and yep it is super useful uh did I modify this okay I just did that only need code in convention for organizing code I mean not necessarily I just try to in terms of the project structure I've got a random uh textures folder then I've got a scenes folder I've got one with all of my script Mo objects so I've got all of my list script Mo objects all the text script object these are all of the unlockables one with all the sound all the resource not types all the music the crafting recipes and then the carry objects so these are all of the individual objects and yep once again thanks for J and yep over here the carry object as you can see it has a name it has a description a reference to a prefab Sprite and so on so yeah script all objects are really insanely useful as you can see I'm using tons of them to make my game to organize all of my data all the data for all the machines all the objects all the things and then I've got the prefabs I've got a preh huge list for all the building objects all the carry objects so tons of stuff and of course I've got my script folder which this one is probably not as well organized as it could be for the most part I really just got a ton of scripts over here on the regular scripts folder and then I've got a folder for the UI stuff uh for the sounds yeah just a bunch of sound stuff I've got all of my script object definitions and then the thank you behaviors and the autobot these are the more complex parts so yeah so in terms of organizing in terms of fure I actually don't do all that much honestly when I when I want to find something I really just use visual studio so just press control comma and it shows up this one and over here I can type anything like let's say the add power dinky behavior and yep there you go this is how I can find the ad power L behavior and here's the script so this is one of the most useful shortcuts just control comma and you can type in anything and find any type in your code base super useful project from all unused assets uh the answer is I don't pretty much uh but yeah you're talking about my project is huge when deployed if your assets are not being used anywhere then they should not be included in build so if they are that means you have some reference somewhere but yeah pretty much the issue with assets is really just in terms of backing up the entire project becomes quite a bit but as you can see over here I've got a ton of asset packs and a bunch of these I don't think I end up using like dungeon Realms I don't think I use this pack or the ancient empire so a bunch of of these but again if they're not used then they don't show up in the final build so that's not an issue uh okay so let me just do just a little bit of work and then I'll answer a bit more chat so uh what was I doing I was doing the looking for Hungry danky timer I'm just you a private float just a basic ah crap uh private float for the looking for a hungry thany timer and let me do timer Max and put it at uh let's say 2f or 5f something like that okay so let me go oh crap I'm writing on the wrong place it is not on the at power but on the feed dinkies okay so over here when I'm looking for a hungry dinky if it isn't carrying food if this one is hungry then prioritize it sure yeah I select it then afterwards instead of searching all the time let me count down this one by time do all the time and then if this one is under zerf if so then I'm going to set this one equals z Max uh that's pretty much it so if that one is under zero then I'm basically going to do on the logic if not then I won't just Auto do that and yeah okay so that should help just a nice tiny performance Improvement so basically it's only going to look for Hungry dinkies did I not put it yep every 2 seconds so let's see oh there was a custom character over there somewhere but it's hidden uh okay so let me just see if the this one is the dinky Behavior right so let me see if the dinkies are still feeding other dinkies if everything is still working correctly so let me go into the other world is this live or prerecorded well I'm right here right now so yep this is live uh okay let me put one of these you go feed dinkies around this area and on the crate container where do I got food right there all right where's your theme for visual studio I mean I didn't touch it so I assume it's just the the uh basic theme okay I just have to stop this guy otherwise this guy is going to feed all dinkies and I want that one to feed them but apparently all my dinkies died wow really I just have two okay yeah apparently this was attacked Super Chat thank you any tips on how tutorials should be structured do you mean tutorials for games or are you making like video tutorials I assume you mean tutorials for games uh I mean in terms of structure I can show you how my tutorial manager and basically I do it in a super simple way because the game really doesn't have too many complex tutorials which is really just an enum so I just got an enum for the tutal stage and then the enum is really just the type and then for each one of those then I've got an accompaning where did I where did I put it over here so basically I just got a function that activates a certain tutorial stage and for this one I really just do a switch on the tutoral stage and over here just do a bunch of things so on this one clone dinky I'm basically using events in order to figure out to trigger the next tutorial or to keep on the same one so basically over here when I go I check the for this tutorial is clone the first thingy so if the player has already done that because that's always important when you're making tutorials you want to make sure did my camera move oh yeah my camera moved quite a bit I didn't even notice yeah that's issue with this table uh yeah so basically for tutorials you've got to always keep in mind that the player might be able to achieve the things before you actually reach that tutoral stage so you always got to add some logic in order to make sure that the tutorial completes automatically if the player did it before the tutorial and then over here basically I'm using a ton of events so I'm hooking on to the dinky on any spawned event so when that event happens which is when the player spawns a dinky when it happens it is going to listen to this local event which is going to complete stage which then goes on to the next one which by the way for going on to the next one go to next tutorial just in case you don't know a nice tip you can convert an enum which over here my tutorial stage this one is an enum you can convert an enum into an INT and then you can basically just increase it then cast it back into your enom and that way you can basically get the value of the enum so that is why using enum for tutoral stages this way they are all organized so it goes from this one to this one this one and so on and yeah that's really pretty much it how I how I organize how I structure my tutorials it's really super simple really just a let me see the spaceship manager oh crap I got the pop up on top spaceship manager so I get my spaceship manager class which also has pretty much the same thing so I pretty much got an enum for for all these stages and then this one has quite a bit more messages so for this one once again I got the same logic so I trigger The Cinematic which I'm using through a basic game object uh then this one I got the issues with handling for the uh client and the other things and where did I put the oh right I put the messages on localization I was trying to find out where that I yeah so here's another tip uh if you want to link a bunch of pieces of data together you can make a class or struct and make it serializable and then inside you can put whatever you want so you can put for example stage and then over here I put a title in the text and I did the same thing on the tutorial so the tutorial manager and if I look over here in my find the Hier key find my tutorial manager and here is my tutorial manager and over there you can see how this little thing shows up so I created this class in order to group the tutorial stage alongside a string for the tunnel in the text and then I simply exposed a list of this and that list is what you can see over here uh this one are the chief messages this one is the tutorial so basically you got the tutorial stage which is that Eno and then I've got the title so this basically using the localization package in order to localize all the messages and yeah so pretty much is how I link up a certain tutorial stage which is NM and Link it up with a certain title and text which then again like I showed pretty much goes like that so yeah I that was quite a big answer quite a lot of stuff so I hope that was informative for figuring out how to make tutorials but the main thing is tutorials are going to be quite unique on a per game basis so yeah this is really just the that's actually something that I would like to cover in a tutorial in a yeah in a video tutorial try make a video tutorial on how to make game tutorials that's one of the topics that I would like to cover because yeah check the character requests okay so let me try to figure out let me open that one up which actually takes a little bit but yeah uh so yeah I hope that was helpful thank you another Super Chat personal really appreciate everything you do oh that's nice awesome learn a lot from your videos do you prefer visual student set of V code if so why uh the answer is mainly just because what I've always used that's really pretty much it I mean that's a a bit of an obvious answer but yeah that really is it I did use vs code when I made the turnbas strategy course I did that one in collaboration with game the TV and for them for their process they use vs code so I didn't learn to use vs code for that one and I mean uh an idea is really just getting used to it so that's really it the only reason why the only reason why I went back to visual studio for my own projects it's just because I already know all the shortcuts inside visual studio so having to relearn them for vs code doesn't really make too much sense so yeah but in the end when it comes to an ID just pick whatever you want just get familiar with it learn all the shortcuts so over here I can very easily move up and down on the code I can write I can do private float something and so on so really just whatever tool you use as long as you I don't want to modify this as long as you get comfortable with your tool then any any ID can work uh right let me see the characters I really got to update the okay so there's a bunch of characters but there's like one in nothing but white so that's a bit odd and by the way if you modify a character you also need to link up your uh YouTube account so that the overlay over here knows which character belongs to which uh all right okay so what was I doing uh oh right I was just yeah I get a bit a bit uh distracted trying to answer all the questions all the things all right so let me see I basically just want to see if one of these dinkies becomes hungry if that one still manages you f okay this one this guy is still looking do not look for hungry dinkies all you want that one dinky looking for hungry dinkies and now I'm being attacked and I really wouldn't want them to eat my dinkies so let me just quickly try to do that ah crap they're all going to die no ah they're going to mess up my my test Please Don't destroy my dinkies oh crap and now they're outside of the range oh crap oh crap and I can't find him there behind us yeah it doesn't actually help all right so yeah the dinky that I was doing that one died yeah I didn't even see the the air message just showed up and vanish right away so yeah helps a bit don't have a clear all enemies and stop respawns uh not really cuz usually I just I just set up a safe file it just so happens that on this one I didn't so let me just use the debug menu in order to spawn some ammo so that way everything should be good okay so uh but yeah that was uh quite annoying yeah I only got two dinkies so most of them died that's that's a bit that's a bit annoying yeah where are your dogs are they sleeping Yep they're sleeping all the way over there all nice and calm what time is it it's almost 600 so they should be waking up in a little bit and wanting dinner so okay let me put this one on feed dinkies I really just want to Val validate that the code works that I didn't break anything and there you go he picked it up and immediately went found a hungry dinky and he went so yep everything still works perfectly he finds dinkies except now it's a tiny bit more performant because it's no longer doing quite a bit more we are pushing the next update uh I've been working on this one for quite a while and I'm hoping I can put out an update today and then another one tomorrow maybe uh just in case you don't know I'm actually going to uh unite on Tuesday so if any of you are also going and you see me walking around remant trying to see the talks then come say hi so yeah basically I'm flying out on Tuesday so I need to prepare uh uh basically prepare the update before then so that is why trying to push out an update today and then tomorrow um another Super Chat thank you boss Alex 123 wait was this the previous one where did you put it again okay now I'm confused now I don't know if something got bugged on my okay now I'm a bit confused um kitchen chaos C build it for Android nice but why does it like for some device and not for others well that depends on the device I mean that course I mean I made it primarily for PC so I didn't really worry too much about performance but yeah if you're making for for profile for uh for Android uh and running it on low devices then you definitely need to I mean you need to go into over here into analysis profiler and you need to enable the profiler and figure out how much time everything is taking because yeah if you're targeting lowend devices then yeah Reed says oh on YouTube oh sorry yeah my my brain isn't working working too well right now sorry uh creating tutorials on YouTube for un I mean uh that's a question with a lot of answers so in terms of technical terms it is really just learn how to do something then write the script for how you would present that thing then prepare the demo scene to show that thing then you basically got to record it edited and so on so any tips really just the more you know about the subject the easier it is that's that would be the main tip so really just before you actually record something make sure you fully understand it it's actually making tutorials is one of the best ways to actually learn something for yourself because in order to teach it to someone else first you have to learn it and you have to learn really well so honestly the way that I the way that I have this job making this channel making tutorials that has been insanely useful for my own personal Learning Journey because I have learned so many things that I wouldn't have learned if I was just making games by myself so this has been really awesome and being able having to actually teach the things that I learned means that I have to learn them even more intensely even more so yeah it's a it's a really awesome thing and yeah tips for creating the best one is really just make sure you fully know everything that you're trying to do and if you mean tips in terms of how to grow on YouTube that is honestly quite a bit more of a a tricky answer because of how YouTube is really complex and specifically uh Game Dev YouTube is extremely difficult and tutorials don't really get many views so if you want to go without that approach I would say mix tutorials with other types of videos like more talking videos more Challenge videos more funny videos like for example you can see Danny how insanely successful he is uh if you go on to YouTube that more entertainment side can definitely find quite a bit more success although personally I really like making tutorials I really like learning and teaching things so yeah but yeah doing Tut in terms of videos it is quite a bit tricky so just be aware of that um all right so yeah thanks for the Super Chat and I hope I hope that answer helped uh right I'm getting a bit distracted trying to rehat so I'm not really doing doing too much work but it's okay I mean trying to interact with chat is fun another Super Chat thank you nice toal War Liberation any updates uh no really not not so far I mean I'm still I still want to update quite a bit more things on this game there are still so many ideas that I have and so many tiny quality of life improvements that I want to improve I mean I've been working on some really insanely complex things lately things that help with the the many issue which is having all these crates all over the place so hopefully on this new update that should fix quite a lot of that so yeah basically still got quite a lot of things that I would like to polish fix improve and things to add onto this game like for example I would love to add kind of like a chaotic mass multiplayer game uh mass multiplayer mode I think that would be fun just to be able to see net code for game objects really push it to its limit and really see how far it can go and basically the way that I'm thinking is I would make that I would make a sort of ba beta build then I would make a live stream and invite all of you to come play with me and come test out and see if we can put some like 50 players all on the same server I think that would be really fun so yeah taking this game as a base I've got tons of ideas that I want to do but at the same time Total War Liberation I really I really love the concept for that game I mean I love XCOM likes so that game the idea for that game which is basically doing an XCOM with zombies on a persistent world I really love that idea with some automation mechanics some crafting mechanics so on so putting all that together really awesome something that I definitely want to do but yeah it's really one of those things where I really wish I had infinite time in order to be able to achieve all the ideas that I have but sadly time is limited so really got to focus so the big answer is updates on that maybe around January February I'm not sure we'll see all right okay let me try doing just one more thing okay so on the on the character creator I want to add a simple go behind button so let me try to do that I have to go hey bye finish your plan please don't forget to make a video for first person shooter yep I definitely would like to do that I mean one of the things that I would like to do in a plan that I'm going to try to execute in the following months is pretty much ass suing tons of sort of mini courses on as many genres as I can make so one on making a third Mery shooter one on a first mer shooter one on making what am I looking for one on making like an RTS like a platform or something like that so pretty much just making many courses like two three hours on making the bare bones of the most basic basic things that's that would be my goal but again finding time for that is real tricking uh have you ever yet tired of coding nope not really I mean I've been I started writing code start writing M scripts when I was 10 years old and nope so here I am 15 no 20 25 25 yeah if I started at 10 now I'm 35 yeah 25 wow that sounds quite uh yeah so basically yeah I've been writing code for apparently 25 years now and yep I still love it so nope I don't think I will ever get tired uh back button and Sly put back button button made to a stream hey thanks for being here thank you for all tutorials that's nice what setup do you have uh in terms of specs I honestly I have no idea cuz it's been quite a while since I built this PC so I'm not entirely sure uh okay so let me do I have a back uh I do on the main okay great so let me just try let me just put it on zero and let me me move it just put it over there the back button and then for the save character button just make it a tiny bit smaller oh crap and push it more to the side ah I didn't want the back to be way too big so let make this one a little bit smaller actually that's a good question how big is the word back in various languages can I find uh translate.google.com yes I accept if I put back in Spanish trash put in what language do I got in Dutch okay it's pretty small Finnish it's pretty small in French pretty small okay good so basically the word back is always pretty small so I don't think I need much space okay that's good that's nice so over here that should be good to handle all the languages even though I am using textmesh Pro so it won't be scaled down if need be but let me just position it a little bit like that okay so let me go into the code for my character creator and basically I'm going to need another button for the back button and then what am I going to do on back I think I just go back and yeah uh yeah really just you load without right yeah that's correct okay now I'm a bit confused I know cuz I went into the new on character save load into that okay so yeah so yeah I'm pretty sure that I just go back into the main many scene and just that should do it question is back go back or the body back no it is go back cuz basically uh cuz basically you can only save character so initially I only had that one because I figured okay you always want to save your character but not necessarily sometimes you might have a character save that you really like but then you might want to play around things but now I want to save it again so there needs to be a way to go back without saving everything again and of course I got an error because I forgot to drag the reference that happens all the time so let me just drag it and try it again how set up character customization uh I'm currently working on a detailed tutorial on it so stay tuned uh but yeah basically the way that I set up I talked a bit a while ago on how let me try to find uh on how I handle all of the where did I put see now I don't it's been a while since I built this so I don't remember where did I put all the data oh crap now I really don't remember where did I put it oh there it is it was just collapsed never mind uh yeah so basically um basically the way this one is works is actually super simple it's basically all the body parts are just different mesh types so when I change into one of these like for example change the color all that is really doing is just modifying that mesh to next mesh on this array so just goes by 111 and just swaps it out so this one so I got an array for all the color meshes all the hair meshes the Hat meshes and so on so yeah the way this one works is actually super simple super basic it's actually pretty nice M TV yes you are nice little TV actually I haven't looked at the stat so how many people are watching this TV 160 viewers wow that's that's quite a lot I don't think I know 160 people in real life so thank you all so much for being here it's always it's always strange to think of the numbers looking at numbers online versus numbers in real life it is only such a a strange thing usually make some sort of uml diagram before creating a game uh not really I do some uh yeah I can't really find uh all my notes right now but yeah basically just do super basic do I got anything interesting here not really uh basically I just write a tons of stuff where's my camera can't see my camera so like this one is my basic uh Design This is for the trailer for total World Liberation and what else do I got here I got a bunch of stuff hey there you go another another trailer another bunch of stuff and yeah but basically for me design I really just write down on paper I write all kinds of things or I just write a simple text file with all the ideas so yeah in terms of doing strict things like uml diagrams no I don't really I don't really do that I just I just write a massive text file write all the ideas WR all the things that I would like to do and that's pretty much how I handle it but when it comes to organization that is really something that is very personal so if you yourself if you don't like using uml diagrams I definitely encourage you to use them just personally I don't use them but some people do find it quite useful so yep uh use Unity timeline this project nope and that is actually something that I've never looked into I've always wanted to look into but never quite looked into it so that is one of those Unity tools that I've never touched and I would like to I mean this game doesn't really have super complex uh cutcenes the cut scenes that I've got that are actually super basic like can I actually uh if I go on to yep save it uh if I go on to the game scene and here I've got my various cut scenes like the rocket launch cut scene and this one is really just an an oh oh baby you a lot tou yeah it's almost I didn't even notice but seems my microphone is clipping that's annoying all right uh so yeah basically for cut scenes way I handle them is actually super basic I really just have a virtual camera and then I run some sort of animation on that virtual camera that is really it so I just use super basic and yeah that is interesting but I just use a code routine instead I mean yeah it depends if you want to make really complex cut scene stuff then definitely using timeline would definitely be be useful definitely be good but if you're making things that are relatively simple like my game doesn't really have too many super complex cut scenes so for me really just a basic animation or just some code based animation that works really well and thanks again okay all right happy with sales numbers for Dy and are you only selling it on Steam yep I'm happy with the numbers and right now it is only on Steam although I am uh exploring uh putting it on consoles I just signed the Xbox NDA just like last week so I'm going to go through that process although suddenly consoles those are very much behind NDA so so that's kind of the issue so on the one hand I would love to make a video tutorial talking about my experience going through a console and how that process is but I have no idea how how much I'm how much I can talk about that so but either way yep I am definitely going to try to put the game on Console since the game is very playable with a controller I think it would be perfect on Console so yep I'm defin going to try that out new video out oh yeah at 6 p.m. so yeah there there is a a video out right now which actually funn enough which actually funnily enough this video I've had this video recording for about a year it was lost within my video files and I only found it about one or two months ago so yeah it's a it's a really nice video on how to change postprocessing through code which is actually a a pretty interesting thing interesting specifically to learn how the postprocessing stack works and how they actually made it work which is actually a really interesting way I mean the way it works is basically based on script B objects which get added kind of like as components it's a really interesting system and working with the with the source code in order to figure out how it actually works and how to modify things that was quite an interesting area to explore so yeah I definitely I definitely encourage you to go watch the video learning how to do that is actually quite useful do you like cats I've never had cats but I do like cats sure I mean I I never know how to interact with cats that's kind of my issue I mean dogs they're always very nice they always come to you but cats are extremely independent which uh yeah it's a it's a great thing I mean that's exactly how cats are but yeah it definitely makes them a little bit tricky to interact with so yeah uh okay so yeah basically anyways my go all right so yeah I got to got to go in a little bit but time is it it's past 6 so yeah let me just see all right so for that one I do that okay let me just on the options menu can I add something uh on the main menu scene let me find the canvas find the options eyi go inside the prefab and what do I got on this one yeah it's the options that I still need to add a ton of options and I've got the various sliders just duplicate it I got gizmos I do time flies it does fly quite a bit yeah so let me just unpack this game object preag let me unpack this one uh I want the cheats toggle and for the toggle now the issue is I don't actually a crap it's it's hard to see it underneath all the people so mask border no I don't really uh okay I'm basally trying to see cuz I don't know what kind of Imes I have in order to make a togg on button but yeah what did I make what was the mask like just I need all right so I just used a oh no but I used that one so that actually works so on the mask let's get rid of the Mask put it on something like this and then put inside a cross Sprite let me find it uh just something like this put it on like 40x 40 and yeah I think you should add World bending effect into the game uh that would be interesting but actually achieving those effects is actually surprisingly difficult uh meaning that that usually either messes up the rendering or that one is a little bit off either it messes up the rendering or it uh or it messes up the logic so I do agree that would be a fun effect but adding it isn't really something that you add super easily so yeah it would be fun but yeah okay maybe in Black looks a little bit better although I do think that don't they have an yeah I haven't used the um yeah there is already a toggle although it's a bit strange so I think I'll just make my own toggle I don't know let me see how how this one works cuz I can just get rid of the label and for the background put this one down the center put down 50 by 50 0 Z and 50 that's way too much so 40 by 40 and okay that's the background that's a toggle ex I haven't really how do you make you y for your games uh just a lot of iteration that is that is pretty much it just anything you do it is going to requ constant iteration so yeah I mean the UI that I have has gone through so many things so many iterations it has been quite tricky and how do you handle UI uh just I'll show the UI in a little bit let me just cheats toggle I got to figure out cuz I haven't worked with this toggle component in quite a while so I don't actually remember how this one is supposed to work uh yeah let me just save this and I'll show how I handle my UI on than let me save and where are my my scenes my game scene so you can see how I organize my UI here's my scene View and look at that these are all of the UI elements so basically this is how I handled them I built little windows and in the editor I separate them around so I can easily access so I can find this little UI element this little one and so on so basically these are all separate windows and I like for example this one there you go that's a window that's a window that's another one and so on so these are all separate windows and they all have this super simple script reset position on the UI so basically on awake it just sets the anchored position and the size Delta in order to 0 0 so basically this is super helpful so that during edit mode I can place them all over the place and they're not all on top of one person and instead as soon as the game starts they basally all get crunched down here and they all appear on the same place so that is the that's the best UI tip that I can give you just set separate all of your windows so they are super easy to work with and then on a wake simply put them all in one person if I ask question did you reply I try to but there's a lot of questions so it's quite hard to keep track of everything all right thank you for your book suggestion reading code complete n is great oh that's awesome nice oh that's cool I mean that book really helped me so I really hope it helps you that is really awesome it it's a really uh a thick book it definitely takes quite a lot to to get through it but yeah definitely take your time and if you focus on learning it oh boy it just it really is one of the one of the best things that uh raised my my own programming skills by about tfold so that is one book that I've recommended many times and I will continue recommending and for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about oh here it is where's my camera yep code complete to if you want to improve your skills as a programmer I highly highly recommend this book it is super thick it is super full of super awesome information lots of stuff so yeah this is something that I highly highly recommend you get I'm basically constantly reading and rereading this constantly going through it over and over again it is super useful so if you want to improve as a programmer I can hi highly recommend that book uh okay so let me just I got to figure out how do how does this thing actually work let me go where's my options UI let me open it up uh and for the okay so I got the toggle but actually it's on the on value change so is that how that works let me go into the cheats toggle do on yeah I see that's it so I add a listener uh and basically but does this one yeah it takes a b b new value right yeah I assume that's the case so on cheats toggle what is the new value okay let me add okay so let me just quickly see if this is how it works which should be it's pretty simple do cover every mono Behavior function more are you asking about the book if so the answer is nope that is not a Unity book it is a programming book but the concepts inside it those are not specific to Unity or any engine or even any programming language I mean most of the most of the um code written in that book the code is I think it's in Java yeah I think so but the the important thing are really all the concepts that you learn from the book not the actual syntax of everything so that is really applicable to literally everything okay so yeah that one does work and yep it is that simple really just click toggle click and toggle okay so that one is actually quite simple can I modify the visual I haven't worked with this component in quite some time where's my check mark okay it is right down there so let me put it in oh can I put my a little border thingy and get back to stunning all right go ahead I hope you learn quite a bit uh so for the check mark let me just copy my cross uh for oh I think I can put the border on the same place put it on z z but I just need to play around with the background but yeah the background needs to have the same as this Source image no not that one that one uh yeah why thises that look oh cuz did I put it okay I'm not sure why is this one did I not copy the same thing oh cuz I put a sliced on 2.14 that's why all right okay just want to put it kind of like this and on the check mark put it in white or black I'm not sure it's going to like this and 40 40 that's way too big 303 and for the Border can I make it a little bit thinner ah but that makes it a little bit messed up in there okay but yeah just a super basic toggle let me get rid of the other on so the cross the mask and so on okay so I got a basic except this is not supposed to say music is supposed to say something else we see black outline is beautiful black outline is ugly is it honestly I always really like uh uh outlines so yeah but yeah that is obviously a very uh a very personal thing so yeah personally I quite like outlines on pretty much everything I always think they look good but yeah I can definitely see that it's a stylistic choice um okay now the only thing is I don't remember how do I I don't remember I mean I haven't worked with this in quite a bit do I have an update here no let me do a PR void on update and on update let's just do a quick test and on test let me get into cheat stle I just got to see how do I set this on without notify okay I think that I think that's what I want so if I do this it should be able to change it although why do I want without notify that seems a bit odd but let's see if that does work just a quick test figure out how it works how you handle UI between multiple scenes I'm not sure I mean I don't normally use multiple scenes so I don't normally handle UI so I don't know if you're asking how to you handle UI between multiple scenes meaning have a scene with all your UI and then additively load the game scene that changes I don't know if that's what you mean or if you just mean how do you handle transferring data through various scenes if it's transferring data then the easiest way is using some static classes like for example I've got my save system which is honestly one part that is a little bit not very good code but but basically this is how I load files in the main menu and transfer which file do I want to load onto the game scene so basically I just have the load file info so this one is set up in the main menu then I load the game scene and the game scene accesses this this field this field is the static field so this does not get does not get uh reset or unseen change so yeah the way to handle data the eest way to handle data between various scenes is simply to do that okay what was I doing so cheats either enable or enable and yep okay so that does work although you know I don't even remember when did I save did I save just on close uh on the options you okay so that one changed so how do I do it with notification that's actually a good question I don't know I don't actually no I mean wait actually I'm a bit confused so if I can understand code but can't code should I go with vision scripting that's a bit of an odd question how do you understand code but cannot code if you understand it then you should be able to write the text I mean code is really just text if you understand it it's just text but but yeah I mean either way uh both are valid options I mean visual scripting is a super useful tool so yeah if you like that definitely go ahead and use it okay let me just go into my options over here just a b 40 cheats and actually cuz I don't remember those player preps does it cuz it Doesn't right nope it does not have a set Bol well that's annoying uh but yeah so let me go into the load options so that one equals let's go into the player prefs get an INT in for the cheats and the default value is zero um equals one right yeah exactly uh and then down here going to do a set int cheats and I'm going to set it based on the cheats B if it is then put a one if not then put a zero uh okay so that should be pretty easy in order to find the cheats uh bu static bull is cheats enabled then return cheats okay so then I need a public static void set chat enabl P chats and just do options. cheats equals cheats and then save what did I call it save options so let's save these options oh right that's why I need to notify that one I didn't even know the thing okay so basically uh whenever I click let me go into options. set the cheats enabled onto the new value so I set it onto that one and update visual I don't have to because this one updates automatically so that's nice and easy sorry I'm trying to do a bit of code so I haven't looked at chat a little bit I can draw and can afford to hire artists what could I do for art I mean the answer is learn to draw I know that sounds a bit annoying but yeah I would say focus on Minimalist things so like for example Thomas Was Alone I mean this is probably not a very good example because even though it is very simple it is clearly made by someone who understands art but yeah basically if you can't do art then the best bet is really just go for super minimalistic things because I mean everyone can draw a rectangle so if you really can't uh if you really can't draw anything just go for as minimalist as possible oh hey nice the qua a nice a nice little custom character that's cool nice thanks uh but alternatively of course oh crap yeah cuz I'm I'm used to writing just ass and it writes asset store so yeah that was oh crap is that one yeah uh but yeah what what what I was going to say is if you go onto the ssur there is tons of free stuff so you can just search for 2D and 3D and then over here on pricing just go to free assets look at that you got 4,294 so yep if you if you can't draw anything you've got tons and tons of look at this a free car so if you want to make a carbased game there you go you have it if you want to populate war with trees there it is if you need some basic animations there not if you want to make a platform of game you've got that and you've got all kinds of stuff hey the robot cow that's cool they change the image that's nice uh so yeah basically either learn to draw or do something minimalistic or use all of the tons and tons of free acids like seriously all of these are it's really quite incredible look at that that's a cool character look at that scifi modular pack that was cool that's nice you could build an entire level with that oh yeah and the polygon star pad their prototype pack I really love this pack or the other one the Prototype one but yeah just in this over here look at all these props you could make a million games with just that so yep you can definitely do that all right uh what was I doing all right just checking to make sure that the cheats menu works so this should be able to save the cheats and now the problem is I don't remember where did I put the cheats button okay there it is so basically I just want to either enable or disable this so the game UI I've got my cheats button right here and basically let's set this one to either visible or invisible so let me check this one. game object. set active and active if the options options that is cheats enabled if so then you enable that button if not then you don't that's pretty much it although actually I do need to update it if the so actually it's quite interesting how I don't have an event on here so on options changed yeah just a generic one when any options changes cuz I only save it so yep I can just go here just invoke this event oh yeah right cuz that one doesn't have there's no this so I'm put just null did I add something I did add something okay uh say on options change so over here on this one I can go into the options dot on options change and when the options changes if so let me refresh the cheats button all right good I just need to make sure uh trying to remember yeah right cuz this one I did not do something so I need to make sure to unsubscribe to this one do I have an onesty I do have an on Destroy so options let me actually find where did I write it right here so basically I need to sub and unsub so UND destroy let me just unsub to this one okay good so that should should have that cheats button working that should be nice let seeing how fluid you are in your code s collagen slow improving that's nice yeah yeah I mean all this comes with experience being able to there is one video uh that I'm one video that I've wanted to do for the longest time is all about keyboard shortcuts because yeah being able to easily move around things being able to do things find all the shortcuts to rename things being able to know how to do how to use all of the all of the code automatic writing things yeah being able to master your tool that is really something that is insanely insanely good insanely positive and yeah definitely something that I highly encourage you to get good at but at the same time that is something that you get good with experience so yeah definitely just just keep making things and you will become more and more efficient about writing code about using your tools all kinds of things okay so that's a bit odd why was that one enabled but that one did not cuz now it did show up was it just oh no it wasn't it wasn't so like here cheats are enabl that one does show and if I close and I open again that one should are you taking t mean testosterone no that is definitely one thing that I will not do is mess up with my hormones so nope maybe when I'm 50 years old and my body no longer works maybe back then I will do some basic trt but no I will definitely not not take any strange things that Fitness influencers take that is definitely not worth it in terms of being able to have a life for the longest time so yeah uh Jo your kitchen chaos cars nice use rigid body instead of a Capal collider yep that also works there's always tons of ways to handle players and collisions and interactions and all sort of things taking uh okay so basally let me just fix this problem and new Super Chat thank you SL you YouTube nice work to all respect you oh nice thank you I'm learn C Unity graphics and more thank you for the free com keep it on oh nice thanks so much for the Super Chat I mean I'm glad the videos help you can we see your doggo well it seems like you read your message cuz he he just showed up so yeah uh yeah are you teaching match math and programming at a school online I mean this video this is kind of the school where I teach things but yeah teach normal no really uh how your animat looks pretty messy or clean uh the game actually doesn't have too many animations so the animator is actually quite clean so if I go if I find all my prefabs and where's my player there's my player and my player Visual and player visual has my animator and if you look at it the animator is actually super simple because the game really doesn't have too much so really just idle and run so this one is based on a simle parameter so these are all the parameters that I have is running Gathering hammering or attacking so as you can see the animator for this game is really super basic I mean the game really doesn't have doesn't have too much so yep it's actually pretty basic and yeah in terms of layers did I add oh right I added the upper body just so that it fixes the arms as the players are uh carrying any kind of object but yeah beyond that on the base layer super basic super simple so yeah terms of animation this game is pretty simple so yeah thankfully doesn't doesn't need much okay let me just fix this and then I gotta go oh um okay so basically what I need is just over here on the options on start yeah it's only on start right yeah that's it so basically all right so let me just quickly finish oh crap uh all right so basically I just need to go into the options so is cheats enabled if so then I'm going to toggle it if not then I'm going to un toggle it okay so that should fix it and that should be it uh yeah cuz they need to eat I need to eat so everybody needs to eat I guess uh right let me just make sure and see if that one now saves correctly so now that one I believe should be un toled so let's see if it is untoggle and I go into the option and there you go the cheats menu is indeed untoggle and if I now continue so let me just maximize this and if I go into continue any yep cheats are not enabled and if I go into options and now I enable the cheats menu and yep there you go there's a button shows up right away all right awesome okay so I think that's going to be it they're waiting for me and so on use the fast reload script yep that is actually one script that one script one two on one asset that I've been meaning to look into because it is it doesn't even look quite interesting honestly there are a ton of assets that I would love to look into but I've been so busy working on the game and working on a bunch of videos that I really haven't haven't seen much notice you almost never use Lambda expressions did you I mean I guess it kind of depends are you talking about kitchen chaos cuz see in there I don't think I use much but as you can see over here when it comes to buttons I use them all the time when it comes to my function timer class which I showed quite a while ago when it comes to this one I also use it all the time so just look at all these references all of these lambdas so yeah I'm definitely quite a big fan of lambdas but yeah maybe on the on the course I didn't use I'm not too sure so yeah and not super Chad thank you so much all right spaghettio won't get the chance to play dink Gardens and I still want to show some love for all the help you've given me over the years ah nice once again watch and thank you for doing what to do oh thank you so much thanks so much for being here I'm glad the videos have helped you I mean it's uh like I said in the in the beginning it's really quite amazing how I I love doing this I love researching things and making tutorials so the fact that it also helps all of you that is an excellent bonus So yeah thank you all so much for being here and for watching the videos I mean videos work this is a a twoway street I love making things but of course the channel only exists because all of you watch the videos and find Value from the videos so yeah thank you all so much for being here this is always really nice okay so now my dogs are looking at me giving me like the side eye they really want to go eat so that's going to be it let me just repair I did manage to do quite a few things so this was a decently productive live stream so that was nice but yeah now I got to go eat I got to give them food and I got to go rest my voice a little bit and get ready uh and yeah like I said I'm actually going on on Tuesday I'm going to Amsterdam for the unite conference so if you're also coming along and if you see me randomly walking around from T to talk come and say hi that should be fun that should be interesting and if you're not going then just stay tuned and I will be making videos covering all the announcements all the news and so on so it should be a fun conference should be a fun time so this next week should be quite interesting all right okay so let me just put this and yeah that's going to be it cuz yeah my voice is even messed up dogs are hungry so yeah it's going to be it all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here thank you all so much for coming to this random live stream I hope you found interesting I hope it was useful and I hope the videos continue being useful to all of you so yep all right so yeah thank you all so much and I'll see you next time bye everyone thanks bye
