hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to view a summary of the governor AI series let's begin so the goal in this series is to make a gather unit with the AI to gather resources of various types and drop them off at a storage the gatherer can be player controlled but he also thinks for himself and looks for resources together then in the end we will take everything and make a nice simple ecosystem where we gather resources to construct a tower which in turn spawns a new gatherer that can gather more resources and so on so first we're going to start with just one gatherer a gold node and a storage we're going to make together to go towards the node play a mining animation go towards the storage and repeat together we'll have a simple state machine to handle the logic of moving to a node gathering resources and moving back to storage then we're going to take our code and a persistent resource tracking so when the character drops going into the storage the amount won't be tracked the game resources class will be very simple and clean with easy ways to add and remove any gold amount after now we're going to create a resource node class to hang our objects instead of having our code based on transforms this again will be a very simple class that keeps track of the resources in each node and provides a way to the cap on our logic from the visual implementation the node won't change its visual if its internal resource amount is depleted then we're going to add player control to be able to command our Agana we're going to add the ability to capture clicks on the gold notes and tell together to mind that particular node using the player control for a single gatherer we're going to apply it to multiple gatherers we're going to make it so we click on together to select them which one visually show that he's the one selected then we're going to click on node and the selected gatherer will head and mind that node after that we're going to add multiple resource types so in addition to a god node that can be mined for gold we're going to add a tree that can be cut down for wood DM resources and resource node classes won't be set up in such a way that they can support any number of different resource types then we're going to set up resource regeneration instead of the node being depleted forever we're going to set up two different regeneration methods the node will regenerate a single amount after some time or fully regenerate after being completely depleted and finally when all that is done we're going to put it all together into a nice complete ecosystem we're going to set up tower construction which takes some time to construct in order to start construction we first need to gather a certain amount of golden wood then the tower is constructed and when it's completed it will spawn a brandnew gatherer that we can control like any other we won't give that new gather the order to gather more resources use those resources to construct another tower which was spawned all together and so on so that's a plan for the gather a iSeries it features some interesting logic and some nice clean code it won't start off pretty simple and ramped up in complexity until we have a nice complete minigame so go watch the playlist and begin learning as always you can download the project files in utilities for each video in the series from EMT code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
