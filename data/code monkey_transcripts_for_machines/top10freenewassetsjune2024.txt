any of these and what you intend to do with them do you want to get more wish lists and more sales if so then you need to learn all about marketing it's absolutely essential nowadays you need to learn the best practices and how to stand out one place where I've learned a lot myself has been from Chris zakowski I've been reading the newsletter for many years now learning marketing is definitely one of the most valuable skills you can get the difference between not knowing marketing and putting this knowledge into practice is pretty much going to be difference between selling just a dozen copies versus selling thousands so marketing is definitely a super valuable skill that you should spend either some time or some money in order to learn and right now Chris is running a sale on his courses this is really awesome for condensing a ton of information in a single course the links to the course include a special discount and they are affiliate links which means you get an awesome deal and some super valuable knowledge while I get a nice commission this is a special sale that only happens twice a year so definitely get it quickly it's ending next week so check it out with a link in the description oh and the cint store is also having a sale right now if you need any of their awesome low poly assets definitely check it out all in their gorgeous low poly style up to 70% off all right so on to the top 10 list starting off with a really nice visual effect this one takes your game and rends it in aski it makes for a really interesting visual effect you can customize the characters or the color palan to get a unique look exactly what you're going for this certainly makes your game stand out you can customize it in many ways and even interpolate between various effects like I said looks very unique if you apply an effect like this onto your game or just parts of your game it can certainly help it stand out then if you need some volumetric fog here is a nice free package volumetric in case you don't know means that the fog has an external shape so you can see the fog peeking through all the objects in your scene this is one of those effects that really helps even just a basic scene look much better you can customize the intensity or the various parameters for the ray marching algorithm the results really look really nice so perhaps try it out for your next prototype then if you need a simple voxal character with a gun check out this one it's pretty generic it's exactly what you expect it comes fully rigged so it works with any mechanim animations or if you don't need a character you can pick this up and just use a really nice voxel AK47 then if you're tired of your duplicate objects having a strange format check out this symbol tool it helps you rename a list of Game objects with whatever suffix or prefix you want it's a pre symol tool that can be quite useful if you duplicate objects all the time and you don't like the default naming scheme which by the way actually in recent Unity versions you can modify that inside of unity itself you can tell it to use the number in parentheses or after the underscore and so on although this tool does have some extra options and you can also rename objects after being created next every game needs to have some kind of settings menu so if you want to tool to help you easily create a settings menu then look at this one in just a few minutes you can create a fully functioning settings menu with all the settings you want and whatever visual you want it includes support for menu navigation with either keyboard or game pad so all the arrows all directions those are already set up by default it supports both the old input manager or the input system and it even works in both un UI and UI tokit all in all this is a really nice impressive very capable tool this is a free version and there's also a paid version with even more features then if you want to quickly make a nice RTS game check out this modern vehicle pack you've got planes helicopters and apcs they come with some realistic textures but you could also make them styliz for example you could get a red texture for one faction and a blue texture for another one so you could definitely use this as a starting point to make a classic RTS you can just pick up this pack and quickly get started and by the way I'm actually in the process of making a complete RTS course so if you're interested check it out with the link in the description also if you like this pack then this have has a paid pack with even more units next if you do pick up those RTS assets here is a tool to help you setup formations it helps you generate various formation positions with any number of units and various settings so you can make a line Circle rectangle or a cone this one is a free version and there's also a paid version of this asset or maybe you just need a simple surveillance camera object so here's one pretty simple it's just a model exactly as you expect it's pretty high quality high quality mesh high quality textures this one could be just a simple visual prompt or since you can actually rotate Parts individually you could even have the player control the camera in some kind of CCTV game next here's another super nice simple tool that does just one thing and does it very well when you make a new build it automatically increments the build version number so if you make lots of builds like for example if you're constantly testing out some kind of multiplayer game if so then this can help you save quite a bit of time if you visually show it on screen you can very very easily telling for running the latest version or not and of course all automatic so you don't have to manually remember to increase number by one or maybe you just need a really nice rock mountain terrain kind of like this one it's a pretty nice looking scene you've got the terrain and a bunch of rocks and trees so this could be a great start for making some kind of Adventure game or just use it exam like this in some kind of fun diarama game all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the UR for June 24 there's a link in the
