hello and welcome i'm your code monkey in this channel i normally cover tutorials on how you can build your own games in unity but in this video instead of doing it ourselves let's take some time to look at some great games that showcase the power and versatility of the unity engine this is actually the third video so if your favorites aren't on here then maybe they're in the previous one let's begin with a really awesome city builder named city skylines you manage a city design roadways define where housing and workplace exist keep track of all the power lines and everything in between everything is simulated with tons of options at your disposal you can make some excellently designed organic cities and keep everything running smoothly it's been out for a couple of years and it's got a very good modding scene with tons of unique mods as well as lots of dlc over the years adding things like concerts snowfall mass transit disasters and so on this is made by a relatively small indie studio or at least it was initially and it is widely considered to be one of the best modern city builders unlike another game with a very famous name so where a triple a studio failed this indie studio came in using unity and made an excellent game next up we have hearthstone as you may know this one is made by blizzard which is a massive triple a studio famous for world of warcraft diablo overwatch and many more they normally build their own engines but for this project they went with unity it's a card game where you get down to your hand with various creatures and abilities and you must defeat your opponent who can be either an ai or another player it features tons of cards it's had lots of expansion since it first came out and it's one of the most well polished games ever made if you want to study how to add polish onto your own games then you should definitely study hearthstone when it came out this was a huge hit and it made the car genre a lot more popular without heart zone we might never have gotten games like slay the spire also i believe it was one of the first hugely popular games to be both playable on a desktop as well as mobile playing the exact same game before that games were either mobile or desktop never really both but thanks to how good unity is at taking the exact same code base and making mobile and desktop builds this has become more and more common before we see the rest of this list this video is sponsored by skillshare skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of classes on just about any topic explore new skills

combined with a roguelike dungeon crawler it's a very unique combo so you can loot shoot dodge roll and table flip your way towards the ultimate treasure select your hero or team up in coop and battle your way surviving a challenging and involving series of lures filmed with dangerous enemies and fearsome bosses it's been very successful thanks to its interesting theme and excellent gunplay if you want to learn how to mix weird genres together then you should study this game there's also a funny spinoff named exit the dungeon which takes a similar concept and flips it on its head it was a great marketing gimmick even if the game was underwhelming compared to the excellent original by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks then if you want to have fun with friends or maybe just destroy some friendships here is overcooked it's an excellent coop game about managing a kitchen and cooking the right dishes for your customers you have various stations and ingredients and every action needs to be done on a specific station and takes a certain amount of time so the only way to succeed is to work with your partners and ensure each person does their own tasks so the kitchen remains at peak efficiency it features tons of unique levels where all kinds of events happen for example you're cooking on a boat then the boat moves and the whole kitchen changes shape keeping some people stuck on one side and someone another it really is a game that is 100 focused on coop gameplay and ensures all the mechanics are designed for either maximum cooperation or maximum failure then for a game that resurrected the isometric tactics genre here is shadow tactics blades of the shogun for me i spent a good chunk of my childhood playing and replaying the commandos and desperados games so when i saw this game announced i was immediately hooked you control a bunch of unique characters each with their own stats and skills and you must complete various objectives on all kinds of interesting levels the guards all have their view cones visible so it's up to you to move all of your characters to the exact positions in order to execute your plans flawlessly use your skills to distract guards from their position then maybe take them down silently or use a high powered rifle that makes a ton of noise how you complete the missions is really up to you you can go guns blazing or slither through the shadows and take down all of the enemies quietly if you're a fan of strategy games and this is a must buy it's an excellent game that will definitely put your skills to the test next up if you're into giant heavy mechs here is battletech it's a turnbased strategy game where you take command of your mercenary outfit of mex and the mechwarriors that pound them deploy over 30 battlemechs in a wide variety of combinations use terrain positioning weapon selection and special abilities to outmaneuver and outplay your opponents games with giant max are pretty rare and this one certainly makes them look super cool they are giant and have a real sense of weight managing your crew and mercenary company is also very important recruit and customize your mech warriors take on missions and manage your reputation with a variety of no ball houses and local infections also features pvp and skirmish modes so if you're into games with lots of stats and thinking carefully before each action then this one is for you next here's a game that got a ton of awards otherwise it's a very mysterious unique game you are trapped in an endless time loop and it's up to you to figure out what is going on you're on this solar system and you have your spaceship with the ability to move between each planet and explore what's unique about them time is constantly looping with the same events repeating every time it's up to you to explore the various planets and find the mystery that hides within use a variety of unique gadgets to probe your surroundings track down mysterious signals decipher ancient alien writing and roast the perfect marshmallow it's got overwhelmingly positive reviews and it even won a bafta so this is the case of a very unique game being perfectly executed in terms of unity being used to make massive mmo games here is temtem it's a massive creature collection adventure game so think pokemon being made by an indie studio it definitely wears its inspiration on its sleeve but it used that as a jumping off point to expand upon that concept features a unique campaign and a fully online world where you can play with other players and go on adventures together buy your own house and decorate it just the way you like it pick your attention and fight in exciting turnbased battles as of this recording it is still in early access and constantly getting new content new missions events and new ways to play if misery and minimalism is what you're looking for then check out inside it's made by play dad the same makers of limbo it's a narrative driven platformer combining intense action with some very challenging puzzles you play as a little boy who finds himself in the center of a dark project features a very moody art style ambient soundtrack and unsettling atmosphere if you want to study the use of lighting shapes and clear level design then study this game even the store page description doesn't really say much it's a very mysterious game and also pretty short allowing you to complete it quickly and have a very enjoyable good time next up one of the best vr games this is boneworks it describes itself as an experimental physics vr adventure use found physics weapons tools and objects to fight across dangerous playscapes and a mysterious architecture the physicality of the world is really the main selling point it simulates all kinds of interaction systems as perfectly as possible for example use a crowbar to hook onto a ledge and climb up or use magnetic handles to climb your way through the map the characters all have accurate phone body ik systems to make every limb movement as realistic as possible and of course tons and tons of weapons that feel very satisfying to shoot you have standard guns but also all kinds of melee weapons energy weapons physics weapons and so on it's a game that really takes advantage of vr to make a completely new type of experience works on pretty much all vr headsets so if you have one definitely give this a shot then for a rare in the sequel that found massive success here is risk of rain 2. the original was not made with unity but for the sequel they went for a full 3d game and they choose unity as their engine it's a roguelike in every sense of the world features fast playthroughs randomized worlds randomized loot and toughasnails difficulty play solo or with friends so you'll land on this alien planet and do your best to survive using over 100 items that make every run unique indie sequence are very tough to make many games cannot replicate their success with the second game but here they made it and beyond that the original game is in 2d and this one they jumped to 3d doing that change correctly is even more difficult but again the reviews are overwhelmingly positive so they definitely succeeded and one of the best indie studios around clay entertainment they normally use their own engine but decide to go with unity for this game oxygen not included it's a space colony simulation game you start off with a handful of colonists inside an underground alien space rock your crew will need to overcome all sorts of challenges encounter new life forms master science and research all kinds of space tech in order to survive it's a systems heavy game that demonstrates how complex you can go with unity it simulates oxygen levels on every position also features liquids which do flow from top to bottom it's got germ simulation gases building gathering mining power and tons more features lots of overlays so you can see all those systems in action your colonists have needs you need to keep them fed and happy and of course they need to have enough oxygen to survive it's a really detailed game and very random so every run is unique and again clay is one of the biggest most successful indie studios so the fact that they chose to go with unity after using their own custom engine for such a long time really proves just how good unt is alright there you have it 12 more super awesome games that showcase the power of the unity engine you can really build anything you can think of you can make excellent single player games like city scaling or massive multiplayer open worlds like temtem you can make complex systems like oxygen not included or simple minimalist games like inside you can make super physically accurate experiences like boneworks or some wacky good fun like overcoat so i hope these games serve to inspire you in your own
