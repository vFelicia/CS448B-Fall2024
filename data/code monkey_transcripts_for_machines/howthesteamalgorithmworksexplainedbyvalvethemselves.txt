hello and welcome I'm your KMI a while ago Val published a video titled seam visibility how games get serviced to players this is an absolutely excellent video that provides a great insight into how Sim actually works as explained by Sim themselves so Straight From the Source it covers what parts are algorithmic and what parts are manually curated so this is all some extremely excellent info if you want to find success as an indie Dev yourself then knowing about Steam and how it works is absolutely essential so you should definitely learn about it as much as possible this is really the kind of video that every single developer should watch it's kind of odd how it actually has so few views the whole video is really great so I highly encourage you to watch it after this one however the main part that I want to focus on this video is a part where they talk about the myths with the CM algorithm and how it actually works so basically what is a factor in getting visibility and what is not a factor I think this part is really interesting because some of the things they actually say kind of go somewhat contrary to what myself and several C marketing experts have said although the slide does contain some huge s risks so let's go through it Point by point to really see what is reality and what is myth so what things affect your visibility and what things don't honestly if you're looking for a super quick tldr then I'm pretty sure I can sum up the entire steam algorithm in just one word and that is simply money that's really pretty much it the goal of the entire algorithm is simply to get players to spend money that's how seam makes money and it's how developers make money basically the more money you make on seam the more seam promotes you and helps you make more money if the algorithm thinks that a game won't sell or more accurately if they actually have some proof that the game won't sell or has already sold then they won't promote that game however on the other hand if the algorithm does not think that a certain game will sell or if simply there's no evidence that it might do well or any significant interest in that game if so then seam will simply not promote that game now that sounds way too obvious but it really is that simple basically the more money that you make for seam the more seam will help you make more money although of course simple does not mean easy getting people to buy your games is extremely difficult so here let's go through this list one by one of each individual factor and see in detail just how much they actually affect and how much energy you s spend on trying to improve each one of these points starting off with store Page traffic so basically the number of people that visit your seam page and like you says does stor page traffic affect visibility on Steam the answer is no so this does not affect your visibility on Steam although like we won see with pretty much every single one of these factors there's always a h risk involved and this one is also no different from that so technically store Page traffic does not influence your visibility meaning if you get 10,000 people to buy your game and a thousand of those buy it and then for another game if it gets a million people to that page and a thousand buy it if so then in terms of the same algorithm both of them won't receive the exact same visibility again when a doubt just ignore all the numbers except for money but of course the huge Sisk is simply if more people visit your store Page then chances are you are very likely to sell more copies than someone with fewer visits either sell more copies or simply get more wishless and those two signals those do impact visibility quite a lot so technically store Page traffic does not directly affect visibility on seam so for for example don't think you can set up some ad and buy some super cheap views get millions of Impressions and somehow hope that that won't trigger the SE algorithm that will not happen that will not work but just getting more traffic genuine traffic that will inter turn lead to more sales and wish list which do indeed impact visibility then for a really important one review score so does it impact visibility or not let's hear what they say next is review score does review score have an effect on your visibility on Steam well the answer is it's not a factor and the answer the video is that it's not a factor with pretty much the only ass RIS that he mentions being under 40% score under that the game is mostly negative and that apparently has an impact in terms of seam visibility but as long as you are above that limit then technically it's not a factor and again not let me expand upon this myself and add some more asterisks once again we go back to the only thing that matters to the seam algorithm which is money so as long as your game sells then yes that is correct that the review score does not matter that is how for example you can see the fifas and the NBA 2K Games these games almost every single year they always have overwhelmingly negative reviews and yet they've got thousands which means they've sold millions of copies these are indeed heavily promoted on Steam by steam themselves and the reason for that is simply because there are tons of people who buy those games every single year regardless of review they just buy it automatically so the SE algorithm simply sees okay this game is selling well so let's promote it a bunch more however I would highly caution you against this type of thinking basically this strategy only works if you have a multimillion dollar marketing budget if you do then yep you can pretty much Brute Force the algorithm to giving you more visibility because you can pretty much force a certain number of sales regardless of reviews but if you're just a regular Indie then while technically review scores don't impact your visibility directly since you don't have that massive marketing budget you are much more dependent on General player field and players are much less likely to buy a game with mixed review score than a positive one so technically yes the review score is not a factor as long as you can keep convincing people to buy your game but again like I said if you don't have a multimillion dollar budget then having something under the positive review score under that that will actually impact your sales which which will indeed be a very important factor then with regards to review scores there's always the issue with the first 10 reviews if you don't even get 10 reviews then you don't even get a score so below that your game is pretty much invisible to the team algorithm you can browse the new releases page and see just how many games don't even have a score meaning they have under 10 reviews so you can see how many of them there are basically for all of these games these are completely invisible to the same algorithm that is why my advice to you is ask your players to leave reviews for your games you need to desperately get above that 10 review score just get a base bare minimum amount of visibility from seam now something that myself and various other seam marketing experts have mentioned are the various review buckets so like I said you've got the one below 10 reviews then you got from 10 to 50 50 to 500 and above 500 now these buckets do exist you can see difference based on the actual titles behind the reviews for example if you've got under 50 reviews you cannot see very positive and if you have under 500 you cannot see overwhelmingly positive so those buckets do exist but when it comes to visibility that part is a bit more questionable for some games they seem to get a nice boost once they go past 50 and for others it doesn't really change as long as they go past the 10 so these two are a bit more questionable but still my advice is try to get 50 reviews as much as possible just in case it has some sort of impact hitting 500 is extremely difficult but hting 50 reviews hopefully that should be duable so speaking of reviews let me just say thank you to everyone who picked up my game and wrote the review I did thankfully managed to get quickly past the 10 Mark and thanks to all of you I did manage to get past the 50 Mark so thank you all so much okay to the next point and this is the big one wish list so how much do they impact your visibility and you might be a bit surprised to hear their official answer next is wish lists do they have an impact on your visibility on Steam the answer is not a factor with a big asterisk so technically not a factor but like he says the big Aster risk is they are a factor before release and that is exactly what myself and C marketing experts say wish lists are extremely important before release they are an excellent predictor of sales but after the game is out they at that point wish lists don't really matter then he mentions how apparently it's a myth where you need certain number of wish lists to be invited to join a daily deal or some special featuring and again this is another one where it's true but once again comes with an N risk simply speaking games that have more sales they get more visibility and more visibility leads to more wish list so technically no wish list numbers do not impact your odds of being invited towards a daily deal the number that I've heard and I don't know if it's 100% accurate is that you need at least 200,000 in Revenue so once again that's a number that matters the actual money if you sell over $200,000 in Revenue at that point you might be invited you might receive an email from see themselves asking you if you'd like to be on a daily deal but in general yep just a amount of wish list after the game is out that does not matter also like he says wish lists are extremely important because people will get notifications so it happens when the game launches and when you discount your game more than 20% when that happens the people who have wish list your game they will get an email notification so again technically not a direct Factor wish list by themselves will not impact your visibility but of course the more wish list you have even after release the more people will get that email which might turn into more sales which again impacts the visibility so if you just look at this slide and you see not a factor you might be confused as to why pretty much every developer asks you to weather game to your wish list and the answer is simply because while technically there is no direct impact there is very much an indirect impact more wish list means more people getting notified when your game is out which in turn hopefully leads to more sales on release which leads to more visibility leads to more reviews more sales more visibility and so on so on this my advice is really the same that I've only said try to gather as many wish lists as you can before release so that hopefully you can have a successful launch which hopefully starts the ball rolling so you can get more and more visibility and sell more and more copies you need to at least have a strong enough launch so that you separate yourself from those hundreds or really thousands of games that have zero reviews next up we have Early Access and for this one it is not a factor the one big asked risk is how early access games don't appear on the new and trending list regardless of how well it sells so it is not effor but again remember the only thing that matters seam is exal sales and there is a very large portion of players on seam who simply do not buy Early Access games no matter what so if you launch into Early Access then chances are you won't sell less than a full release which in turn will affect your visibility although when it comes to this when it comes to Early Access honestly your choice should be entirely based on the game and not based on visibility at all if your game is unfinished and you have a nice road map to completion then perhaps consider Early Access but if your game is done and you don't have a dedicated road map then don't go into Early Access hoping for something special some people think that early access technically means that you have two launches The Early Access launch and the 1. launch and that is somewhat true but really only true for very successful Early Access games if your game finds massive success in Early Access then chances are that will translate into extra sales for the full launch which again will positively impact your visibility but if not if your Early Access launch does not sell a ton then you are pretty much guaranteed to not get any extra visibility when the game launches a full release next up we have localization and Y this is the one that they do point out how it's very very clearly a factor and yep it does make sense especially when you go into the seam sets and you scroll down here and you go under language and you can see how English is just 30% of the actual languages on Steam so whil that is obviously a huge amount 30% of something like 200 million players that's a huge amount but still that is only 30% meaning there are twothirds of the audience on seam that do not speak English so if your game is only in English then it will never show up to all those people who only play games in their own language so for this point my advice is definitely super simple definitely make make sure to include localization in your game I can definitely recommend the unity localization package it's what I use to localize my game and it works pretty great it's super simple to use and supports pretty much any language you want as for getting translators there are tons of places to find them for me I got translators from my game I found them on Fiverr just sent them the English text for the store Page and all the text that I use in the game they converted and then of course the big question is Which languages do you translate to now for that I would say the answer really starts by looking over here on the seats so I would say you abely need to support of course English and simplified Chinese after that it kind of depends on the audence kind of depends on what game you're making for example if you've got a tycoon or a simulation game then usually German the German audience really likes those types of games polish also seems to do well in those types of games then if your game is Anime then of course include Japanese so basically pick the ones that make the most sense for your game and then just go through the list and pick which ones are the most popular so in my case for my game here are the ones that I picked basically I just included English and Chinese by default then I also picked German and polish because those tend to like management automation games and then I just picked some more popular ones I picked French Japanese Portuguese since I can kind of do it myself and I had also picked Spanish but I had some issues with the translator for that so that one is still upcoming but yep like he says localization is definitely a factor for getting more visibility on Steam so definitely make sure you do it if you use the localization package then it's super simple to add so there's no reason not to do it although like he says you can always do it later so if you're way too busy at lunch and maybe add it afterwards in some some kind of big update somewhat related to that is also controller support again same thing if you don't have controller support then your game will not be promoted to any players who pretty much just play games with a controller and nowadays with the seam deck the controller becomes even more important there are tons of people playing games on deck and those people will definitely like your game and they will only play it if it has controller support and once again this is another thing that is super easy to implement as long as you're using the input system if you don't know about it go ahead and watch my tutorial on it it's pretty simple to use and make it super easy to support any game pad steam deck anything you want now of course that is also depend on what kind of game you're making if you're making a game where you control a character kind of like my own game then it's super simple and makes perfect sense to have that but if you're making some kind of complex RTS and maybe controller support might be quite tricky but if you can't do it then definitely go ahead and do it and in the end he mentions pretty much exactly what I said in my tldr basically steam can help you snowball to success but it's up to you to get the ball rolling meaning that it's all up to you to give it that initial push if you just launch a game on Steam with no marketing nothing then nothing will happen no one will know the game exists and no one will buy any copies nowadays launching a game soundly on seam that does not yield any results another great tip he mentions is creating big events around the launch major updates or a healthy discount the algorithm does react to sales velocity meaning if you sell a th000 copies in just 1 hour that is much more important to the algorithm as opposed to if you sell 1,000 copies over the course of an entire month so definitely keep that in mind if you're planning a big update or a big event on your game if you have a big boost in sales in a short period of time that won't help the algorithm give you more visibility which gives you more sales so in general technically all of these things are supposedly not a factor but in reality they are actual factors the asteris over here are actually pretty big basically went and out just saying the only thing that matters to see is money the only thing that drives the algorithm is money so technically all of these are not factors because they directly do not lead to actual sales but they indirectly do lead to sales so in that case these are pretty much always going to be some kind of factor in terms of store Page traffic I would say don't worry about that you might think to experiment with some paid advertising but I would say definitely limit those experiments from everything that I've seen that rarely Works unless you have an expensive indie game something above $30 in terms of review scores my advice is to get those 10 reviews as quickly as possible and hopefully of course your game is good so that that score stays above 70% which STS it positive and then try to get 50 reviews although again whether that has an impact or not that is still debatable then in terms of wish list they are a great predictor of sales and that matters quite a bit for the algorithm so do make sure you get as many wish lists as possible before release if your goal is financial success than before release you should probably have at the very least 5,000 hopefully more than 10,000 but then after release at that point don't worry about wish list anymore you can pretty much just completely ignore that number after release in terms of Early Access this is a question related to development of your game it is not a visibility question so don't decide on doing or not doing Early Access simply based on visibility in terms of localization do make sure to add at least English and simplified Chinese after that add as many languages as you can and as many as make sense for your particular genre like I said with today's SE with the unity's localization package is pretty simple to implement so there's really no reason not to do it also related to that is simply gam pad support once again with the input system that is super easy to add so if that works for your game for your genre definitely make sure to do it like I mentioned in the beginning this whole video is absolutely excellent so I highly encourage you to go watch it I hope that both that video and this one I hope they both help you get a better understanding of how the SE algorithm Works which in turn I really hope helps increase your odds of success
