hey everyone later today starts off the mixing game jam organized by andre from the channel mixing jam i haven't participated in a game jam in quite a while my last one was the one where i made the legend of slaser game that was over one year ago gems are always an interesting event but i never really have the time but now since i've just finished my last week project making the course now is the perfect time to do something quick like a quick and fun game jam it starts off today and the theme won't be announced in a few hours it's a standard 48 hour jam so you have the whole weekend to get something interesting done remember that game jams are all about making a game in a very tight schedule so keeping your scope nice and tight is extremely important as always remember that everyone has a tendency of over scoping so if you participate when you come up with an idea cut it in half it's better to have something small in finished than something super large and unfinished the main rule is that all of the code must be written during the game jam so that kind of goes against what i usually say about reusing as much code as possible but it will be an interesting challenge to see how much code i can write from scratch in such a short period of time although you can also use premade assets so i might look into all the packages that i've bought from the asset store recently i've got tons of assets that i picked up in various sales and bundles so i might find some use for some of them also tomorrow i'm planning to do a quick live stream as i work on the game it will be a good first test to try out how live streaming works so i can then do some more live streams this will be my very first one so it's very much just an experiment no idea whether it won't go very well or disaster so don't expect too much but if you have the time come ahead and say hi alright so go ahead sign up for the game jam on itch set a reminder for the theme video and i'll see you tomorrow
