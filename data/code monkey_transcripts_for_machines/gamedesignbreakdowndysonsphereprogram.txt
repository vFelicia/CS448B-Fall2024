hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this is my game dev review of dyson sphere program a game made with unity it's developed by youth cat studio which is a small five person studio so it's very impressive when you see the scale of the game here i will do a brief review of the game and then give you my thoughts from my point of view as a game developer as well as give you some tips for how you can improve your own games by the way this is my second game dev review and i've made a playlist and a steam curator page to group them all my goal is to continue making these to give you some great game design tips using these games as an example check out all the reviews in the steam curator page or on the playlist so dyson sphere program is a scifi factory automation game you control your mecha and start off manually mining basic resources then you do some research and start building some machines to do the mining for you you take those base materials and turn them into more and more complex items then eventually when you start needing some more space to build or some more exotic resources you will leave your home and begin colonizing other planets and just like the name of the game implies eventually you start needing more and more energy so you build a dyson sphere to harvest energy directly from the sun the game has an excellent sense of progression you're never stopped there's always something to do some new research to unlock a new item to craft or some optimization to be done visually the game looks great it's got this nice cartooning look with high saturation all the planets are nicely round with some great terrain and some great atmospheric effects the stars also look visually very impressive everything from neutron stars to red dwarfs to black holes they all look great the look of the game is really very inviting and relaxing which works well with all the automation happening in the background it is a complex game but also a somewhat relaxing game because there's no combat so there's really not many penalties to not making things 100 efficient and on the other hand it's really satisfying to build the perfect production line and just watch all of the machines working perfectly and the scale of the game is obviously massive the game is randomly generated so the first thing you do is generate a random universe you can make it really massive or relatively small each of these stars has multiple planets orbiting around them so even the smallest universe is already pretty massive as i said there's all kinds of stars from neutron stars to white dwarfs to black holes so if you're into astronomy then the game is just fun to be around in everything is accurately simulated all the planets have their orbits along with their moons visually these stars and black holes look great some planets are tidally locked and so on then on this story the game actually has a bit of story at least relative to a simulation management game i mean you don't see much of it but the core concept behind it is actually quite interesting the idea is that humanity now spends more time in virtual reality as opposed to the real world but with more and more people naturally they need more and more energy to run that virtual reality so it's a simple concept but works great for giving the game a reason to explore the cosmos and gather more and more energy and resources if you enjoy factory automation games like factorio production line or satisfactory then you'll certainly enjoy this one they had a successful kickstarter last year where they raised fifteen thousand dollars and now in just the first week they already sold over three hundred and fifty thousand copies this is a very inspiring story of a small studio finding massive monumental success with an excellent game so if you're a fan of this type of game then this is an absolute must play now here's my thoughts from my point of view as a game developer as well as some takeaways for you to improve your own games i will go through each point highlighting what i think the game does well and what lessons you can learn from it the game is out in early access but it's already extremely stable and feature rich i've played it for over 30 hours and i haven't encountered any bugs this is definitely one of those games where you can easily get a ton of enjoyment right now and then play it again in a few years after the phone release even performance has not been an issue in late game with tons and tons of machines and thousands of items moving around the game still runs extremely smooth so as a developer if you decide to go with early access then this is something that you need to be careful with gone are the days of players looking at early access games and accepting tons of bugs or no content if you launch into our only access then this is your competition an extremely well made game with already tons and tons of content now the good news is that if you do do it right then you won't be massively rewarded just like this game thanks to the success of this very first week these developers already have more than enough funds to fully build their complete vision over the next few years also i'm quite impressed with how the game is built with unity i remember a long time ago when i first played factorio i remember researching and coming to the conclusion that in order to support such a huge amount of objects it really needed a custom engine but fast forward to now a few years later and this is possible as you might know unity has been pushing hard for performance these past few years the dot stack has the potential for extreme performance and i wonder if this game is using any part of it or maybe some custom ecs solution either way the massive scale combined with excellent performance is a very inspiring feat of engineering i want to get back into that soon and when i do i will definitely be experimenting with making a mini game on this scale just to be able to see how far we can push it one tiny excellent thing about the game is how the inventory splitting works you right click and then move the mouse left or right to select what amount you want to split it is a much better and much more intuitive system than what games usually do which is pop up a window where then you input an amount or spam the increase or decrease buttons that's an example of a tiny tiny thing that greatly improves the feel of the game i just wish this same system was also added to the replicator using a slider would be much better than spamming the plus or minus buttons or at least had the ability to hold down the button and by the way if you find the video helpful consider subscribing and hitting the like button it really helps out the channel another thing that the game does great is like i said the entire star system is simulated as you're playing so right in the beginning when you're in the very first planet you actually see the star making daytime and nighttime depending on its position on the sky adding a day night cycle is usually relatively easy doesn't have to be 100 accurate like this game and by adding it you will make your game feel a lot more believable you can queue up actions and one very good decision about it is how it locks the camera as you hold down shift if the camera did keep following the player then it would be very tricky to click exactly where you want it so when you add actions and abilities to your games make sure the player can use them without unnecessary frustration another tiny but very useful thing is what you can see on the upper right corner you see the version as well as the theme name of the account playing this can be very useful especially for early access games if you see a video on youtube showcasing some sort of bug you can verify the version and then know if you've already fixed that bug or not like i said this is very useful especially for early access games or games that are in constant development feel free to put any debug data in the corner so you can essentially get bug reports just by watching people play your game on youtube when you open the inventory you see the commands for how to interact with it it's always helpful to give the player a reminder of all the mechanics you have in your game rather than just showing them once in the tutorial and never mentioning it again for example i know that i forgot the commands instantly and looked at the tutorial many many times over my playthrough this is also visible when you're doing other actions like for example placing down conveyor belts so if possible give the player reminders of all the actions they can take just make sure you don't do it in an annoying way after the first time just show them at the corner of the screen and not always as some flashy thing on top one of the things i do wish the game had was a smaller view of the replicator in the beginning of the game you will be doing a lot of the crafting manually and in order to see the progress you can only see it with the replicator window open this window is pretty big so it's quite annoying to keep it open at all times it would be great if it just had a small widget showcasing the replicator queue so you could easily see it at a glance or maybe the developers made that an intentional choice to discourage manual crafting if so then personally i don't think this decision achieves the desired effect other than annoying the player in the very beginning of the game remember that most players don't play games to completion in fact very few actually complete games so make sure the start of your game is the best it can be otherwise people will never see all the cool stuff that you place at the end always keep in mind what the player will spend most of their time doing if the player is spending most of the time looking at an annoying window then that's a problem the simple solution here is a smaller window just showing the current progress without occupying tons of space that wouldn't let the player quickly see it at a glance without also removing the option for the phone window another thing that i wish the game had was some sort of indication as to whether or not the player is in range this is not a god game you are indeed moving a individual character and if you are too far then you cannot inspect a building you have to move closer to see it but there is no indication to the player if the distance is enough so either it works or doesn't whenever possible you should always make sure that the player actions have some sort of feedback or some sort of response the player should always be aware of the fact that the game received or did not receive a certain input in this case adding a warning every time it failed would be way too annoying but adding a slight visual indicator like for example just changing the visual bounding box from white to green that would go a long way to making the game feel just a tiny bit more responsive another great design decision is how dismantling objects is free usually you actually want your demolish to have a certain cost in order to encourage the player to think carefully the first time they build something but in games like this one where the primary focus is on optimizing your supply routes and increasing efficiency in this case you really want the player to not be punished for reworking and rebuilding how their production lines work so if you want to encourage careful thinking make demolish have a cost on the other hand if you want to encourage experimentation make demolish be free however there is one somewhat negative thing when you're dismantling objects there's no confirmation whatsoever if you click it gets dismantled if it is a building with items inside you get the items placed in your inventory but if you have no space then they are simply lost forever another thing that compounds this issue is that when you enter the build mode it does a slight zoom out which contributes to clicking on the wrong thing i mentioned previously how the camera stops moving when you queue up actions which lets you click where you want and here we see the problem with not doing that it greatly increases the chances of a misclick on the one hand i get why there's no confirmation you want dismantling to be as seamless as possible but on the other hand accidentally removing a building is always annoying and losing items is always terrible my solution here would be to remove the automatic zoom out when entering build mode in order to prevent misclicks and to add a tiny confirmation box on top of the mouse position if the number of items was large or complex that way you could easily remove conveyor belts without issues but removing a building with expensive items inside would require confirmation whenever you have actions that can lead to somewhat serious permanent consequences like for example losing a bunch of items you should always ask the player for confirmation another excellent tiny thing when you're playing the correct way to rotate the camera is by holding down the middle mouse button however you might forget that and actually try rotating by holding the right mouse button if you do this then the game notices that and if you try doing it for a few seconds it shows a popup telling you the correct way to rotate the camera this is an excellent way to teach the player if while doing your own play testing you find that your testers intuitively do an action different than the intended you can either change the action or do this and listen to the incorrect action to make a popup to remind the player of the correct action right now the game doesn't feature any combat but they're planning to add it in a future update i've played the game for over 30 hours and i didn't feel the lack of combat at all there's more than enough to do with building a huge factory and setting up all the supply chains on the whole universe so that brings a very important game design question when making your own games you have to remember that more mechanics and features is not necessarily better sometimes adding more mechanics really just downloads your design and makes the game worse in this example right now the game is excellent if you add a subpar combat system on top then that won't possibly take the player away from the good part of building the factories and make the game actually worse but of course it is also impossible that they implement it in such a way that complements the building and doesn't distract from it so the lesson to you is more mechanics aren't necessarily better and if you do add some new feature make sure it actually improves the game as usual prototyping is always your friend so i look forward to playing this game again in the full release to see how they ended up implementing combat alright so those are my thoughts on dyson sphere program a game made with yinty i definitely love playing this one it's really my kind of game if you're a fan of factory automation management games then this is a must play as a unity developer it is excellent to have this game as an example for the kind of scale that is possible to achieve with the engine by the way this is my second game dev review and i've made a playlist and a steam creator
