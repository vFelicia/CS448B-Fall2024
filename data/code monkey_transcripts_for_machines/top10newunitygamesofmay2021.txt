hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for may of 2021 my goal with these videos is to highlight what can be done with the engine so you know the only limit is really just your own imagination all of these games are uniquely impressive and showcase the power of the engine in tons of different scenarios so the lace is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month there's links in the description for some of the games those are affiliate links so if you use them it's the same for icu and you'll also be supporting the channel alright so let's go starting off at number 10 over here is patchquest i know this one because i've seen some devlogs of it on youtube on the channel named patchquest they are great videos so check them out if you want to see the game being built it calls itself a roguelike metroidvania fusion where you can mountain ride every monster so you grab your lasso throw it and capture a monster depending on what monster you're writing you have different skills it's a pretty unique concept and it seems to work great with tons of unique monsters for you to try out there's a large world to explore and tons of wildlife to collect visually i think it looks great nice and cartoony it's very inviting also supports two player local coop so it's a very interesting game check out the home youtube channel to learn more about it and possibly one of the more anticipated releases of this month is subnautica below zero i still haven't played the original but i've heard great things about it this one takes the original game and plays in the arctic region so this time it's almost frozen you start off with a little more than your wits and some survival equipment construct habitats and vehicles and use them to explore and discover uncharted biomes research some alien life forms to see what lives in this world but always keep your guard up not all creatures in this strange world are friendly like the name implies the weather is cold so make sure you survive the unknown temperatures if you've played and enjoyed the original you'll certainly enjoy this one and if you didn't play the original then you can still jump into this one and still enjoy the world the devs have created next up here is an interesting one it's a paranormal stealth action tactics game named one hon the beginning you play as a young korean girl who was killed in military conflict and returned from the dead you turn into a ghost and possess living creatures in order to exact your revenge stay out of sight dash through walls possess enemies and use their weapons on themselves visually it looks relatively simple but mechanically very interesting then get to work with farm manager 2021 i've briefly played farming simulator a long time ago but i've never tried this series it focuses on logistics plan your field work according to the seasons look after the animals take care of the machines and the staff while reacting to the changing weather there's tons of plants pieces to grow observe them and automate the harvesting procedure with your employees and all of your machines purchase all kinds of agricultural machines make your farm a lot more efficient take good care of your animals everything from cows to bees sheep goats chickens and even fish survive the harsh winters and ensure your crops are prepared do it all right and your farm won't grow by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks then if you're like me and you find cleaning things to be very satisfying then check out power wash simulator there's just something about starting with something completely dirty and making it perfectly clean that's just so appealing fire up your power washer and blast away every speck of dirt and grime you can find the soothing sounds of the water make this a very relaxing experience build up your business in career mode although there's no time pressure just chill out and do the job it's a simple gimmick but it's a fun gimmick and based on the over 500 very positive reviews it seems the devs have created a very relaxing experience if you want some dark and gritty action here is tainted grail conquest it's an infinitely replayable story driven deck building roguelike you build your hero from 9 unique classes to choose from build your deck with hundreds of unique cards and abilities every time you fall you rise again complete quests save npcs and build your village for some retro fps action here is visserafest it's a scifi singleplayer area fps lots of unique enemies to defeat and of course lots of unique weapons as well navigate handcrafted levels stuff to the brim with secrets using key cards complete puzzles and various objectives juggling your resources by constantly managing your ammo health and armor move super fast bunny hop to gain more speed and control yourself whilst in midair collect tons of items and level modifiers to make each playthrough exactly unique if you're into gorgeous pixel art here is lost ruins really good looking visuals with tons of particle effects and some nice smooth animation fight your way through a dark and dangerous world in this 2d sidescrolling action game choose your accessories that will grant you all kinds of unique effects slash away your enemies or use magic to your advantage it's already got a ton of very positive reviews so if you're into the genre check this one out then if you want to survive a siege well here is siege survival glory invictus your medieval city is under siege and only a handful of civilians are all that's left so instead of fighting the invaders yourself your goal is to support the very last understanding build out your camp manage resources and craft your supplies venture out into the occupied city to scavenge for resources and new recruits stay in scene or suffer the consequences help is coming but it's weeks away keep your people alive and fed make the right choices and survive and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month here is before we leave the first thing you notice is the very unique visual it's a hexagonal map on a round world i love the way that clouds dissipate and the new tiles are discovered it's a nonviolent city building game build settlements and manage resources sail around the seas and explore the world to discover new lands your main antagonist is pollution so keep that in mind and avoid the mistakes of your ancestors colonize other planets and set up trade routes between them a nonviolent city builder is a pretty unique concept so i'd love to try this one out to see how they make the game engaging while only fighting the environment also there are space wheels alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity and launch in may 2021 if you want to be a successful indie game
