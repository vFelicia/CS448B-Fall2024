in this video we're going to review all the videos published in May 2019 in the TECs tutorials marines vs. zombies hit counter heart sound system and more let's begin so another month gone and several more great videos free to learn from this month was very exciting to me personally since I spent a lot of time researching and playing around with ECS in the entire unity dot stack I'm really enjoying SES and I want the insane performance benefits you can get from during my research I watch pretty much every unity talk on ECS and all the comments were asking for tutorials so I focus on that and there are several videos covering SES this month starting off with the getting started video this video teaches you how to get started working with ECS from a completely empty scene it covers the various packages you need how to install them and Samurai encode making entities than components and finally key systems after that came the video on getting started with the other essential component of the dot stack which is the job system this is what makes the code run insanely fast it helps you write clean safe multithreaded code so all your cores get busy and you can get ten times speed ups it has certain limitations that you need to be aware of but performance benefits are certainly worth taking the time to learn with the basics covered there was a nice video which is a showcase of what is possible with ECS a massive battle of marines vs. zombies where a handful of Marines fought off an endless wave of thousands of zombies this scene was made with the intent to try to apply everything I've learned on ECS so far and result is very nice in the video I cover a overview of all the systems and elements that make it work so the quadrant system that handles targeting the mesh based animation system the air interactions and so on I tend to keep expanding upon it and make a proper RTS using this as a base so stay tuned for that speaking of various systems there were a bunch of individual videos on ECS systems to videos on finding a target so we have a bunch of units and a bunch of targets the units look for the closest target move towards it and destroy it first we did it using a simple component system in order to understand the logic of cycling through units and doing logic on them and then we took that code and Java file to make it run insanely fast the other result is thousands of units correctly finding the closest of thousands of target this can still be further improved with the help of a quadrant system which is exactly how the Marines vs Zombies targeting system works then there was a very simple video on how to draw a sprite in ecs essentially I go over what are the absolute barebones requirements for drawing a 2d sprite the video deals with drawing a simple quad with a material using the default render mesh system then finally related to the job system was video covering how to get output from a job this is one of those things that is very simple when you know but very confusing when you don't know the job system is wonderful and insanely fast but also has certain very specific limitations the main of which being how memory is shared between jobs and the main threat so in order to do some calculation get the output it requires a different type of thinking there was a video covering level generation for a endlessrunner this uses a very simple method but also very powerful for creating infinite levels with a nice amount of variation it supports many only making some interesting level parts and then through code those local parts are automatically instantiated as the player gets closer to the end the result is infinite levels with the ability to expand the pond with different level themes or increasing difficulty there was a video covering healthbar damaging effects these are great effects that have polished your game in the video we cover three different effects and it's up to you to choose which one best fits your game there's a faith shrink and a cut effect are very nice and very easy to implement then a really cool video covering the player hit counter this is the same counter I used in hyper nights and one of the best things about that game it's an extremely satisfying effect with lots of tiny details like increasing size and shake intensity per head count it also deals with using a custom font texture to make him look extra cool which was covered in a video in the previous month a really simple video on handling the illogic of a double click to do something so we go through what a double click really is and how we can identify it then once we identify it we can use to trigger a special action so in this case we use a dash towards the mouse position it's really simple and great for beginners to start to understand how you can make complex behaviors from simple inputs another great video on an interesting game system in this case making a heart based health system like in The Legend of Zelda the hearts are split into four segments and we can easily damage each segment individual the code is nicely separated into logic and visuals we can easily create objects a deal just one quadrant of damage or destroy a home heart same thing for the heal then we also made a very cool healing animation where the hearts get healed over time and I have a nice animation one phone here there was a video on a simple double jump this one is a continuation of the simple jump from last month it starts off from that base and we implement a nice double jump with the option to make it a triple or even more the code is easy to understand and supports realtime upgrades as well as making it very easy to create a Metroidvania style game then we also added a nice little orb effect to automatically make the player jump thereby enabling really interesting designs with huge gaps there was just one quick tip this month it was covering how to return multiple values from a single function this can be very useful in certain specific scenarios and the same pattern is used in various unity functions so it helps to understand how it works another quick video was regarding how unity deals with photoshop fonts in unity 2019 they hid a function that was previously the default it's called remove math and automatically handles transparency for PSD files so in the video I cover while sprites have a weird white glow and various fixes including how you can get the option back and finally there was a nice video celebrating one year of code money it has been one year since I started this channel and in that time I've made over 200 videos covering all sorts of topics this has been a great journey so far and I hope you've learned a lot so many thanks to you for watching the videos the future looks great with many more topics I have yet to cover including a lot more easier since I'm looking how it works so that was it for the month of May 2019 I hope you found the videos helpful and learned something along the way post any questions you have any comments and I'll do my best Internet subscribe more videos and I'll see you next time
