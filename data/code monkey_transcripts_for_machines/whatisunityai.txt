hello and welcome I'm your cut monkey and earlier this week I made a video doing a quick recap on the unity GDC roadmap Tonk which covered what is coming with the engine in the near future however one very important thing that was mysteriously absent from the road map but was announced on that very same night was Yin Tai it was somewhat quietly announced just on Twitter the YouTube video is still enlisted which means it's not public now I say announcement but it really is just a teaser really nothing in terms of concrete details and because that the response was pretty negative a handful of people are excited most are skeptical or really just very negative and that's not really without reason AI is a very sensitive topic that can be done either in a positive or negative way and in this case we just how limited this teaser is and how it doesn't really have any details on anything I don't blame people for having a negative reaction however like I mentioned in the GDC video Unity invited me over there and I attended a private tunnel where I got the chance to take a look at behind the scenes and I saw the current state of a bunch of AI tools they are working on that talk was very much behind and then EA so I'm not allowed to talk about specifics but still I can talk about some things you can also sign up to their AI beta if you want to learn more I've signed up myself so here I'm going to cover three common questions that I saw as a response to the announcement and just AI in general so first is Unity announcing something quickly just to please investors which will then be dropped secondly are they doing AI ethically or carelessly and thirdly is Unity considering consent and legal issues in the data sets they are using those are very very important questions and the unity team had answers to all of them but before those I actually had a question of my own I asked them why announces quietly overnight instead of doing the roadmap talk it seems like this should really be present on the roadmap and the answer that I got has to do with how they are researching tons of things and they already have quite a lot working but there's a huge difference between making a quick working prototype and building a proper production ready tune so they have essentially learned the lesson from dots where they showcase it right away in the very very early stages and then a bunch of people were regularly upset when many years came and went and dots was constantly stuck in development so they learned from that and now they want to make sure they only show something concrete when they are very confident they have an actual reusable product and not really just a proof of concept that is why they did not make a Big Splash in the roadmap and also why the teaser announcement is extremely vague without any clear details they don't want to over promise until they know for certainly exactly what they can deliver although actually they have already shown one AI tool in the last unite they showed a tool that uses Ai and machine learning to easily position and animate some characters as you move a hand the tool uses AI to figure out where the rest of the body should be this really speeds up the opposing process so you don't have to move each bone individually then that same tune can be used for animations so as you add some keyframes it uses AI to figure out the position of every limb at every frame in a natural way and it can also do some post matching where you give it a picture and then it positions the character in that exact same pose this is one of the several demos that we saw in that privatonk with this you can also see how they are researching tons of areas so they're not just making a quick Chachi PT clone or a clone of stable diffusion and it's actually kind of funny to see the difference in the reactions that talk which showcase an actual tool in action is from a very very positive comments whereas the general AI announcement that has no details that one is almost entirely negative honestly I see this as a positive because it tells you that people are upset when there are no details but become much more positive when they actually see how AI might help them for me as someone with no animation skills I can definitely see this tune being very useful also lots of people were either very excited or very angry when kjiro posted about his AI command tool this actually demonstrates the exact same thing that the AI team was talking about like cager himself mentioned in the FAQ this is just a proof of concept This is Not Practical there is a huge difference between a research proof of concept and a proper usable production ready tool so those are the reasons why they quietly made this announcement instead of making a Big Splash in the official roadmap okay so now let's see those three common questions that I saw for example the first question several people posted a comment saying something like oh they're just announcing this because AI is the big hype right now so they're announcing it just for the investors and they're going going to drop it soon that is a very valid concern and it's actually the very first thing that I asked the AI team the answer is no this is not a kneejerk reaction to Chachi PT or midjourney or anything like that they pointed out how Unity has been working with AI for many years now their ml agents package has been around for several years and I've even used it myself to build some interesting things alongside the mligence packages project Barracuda this is their lightweight crossplatform inference engine which is what actually runs in neural networks this is extremely important to make sure you can run machine learning on all the platforms that Unity supports again this package has been in custom development since 2018 and beyond that they made a blog post in 2018 covering their guiding principles which I'm going to cover in a bit so with regards to this question is this just the next shiny thing that UNT is chasing just to jump on the AI hype bandwagon in order to police investors the answer to that is no clearly this area of AI and machine learning this is something they have been researching for a long time which showcase just how serious they are about it another question and the issue people have with AI is with regards to app ethics and again for this they already publicly posted their guiding principles all the way back in 2018 their guiding principles are be unbiased be accountable be fair be responsible be honest and be trustworthy these are their guiding principles as established back in 2018 in that private talks the team told me their principles nowadays are still the same as they were before meaning they're focused on making AI the right way they're not trying to eliminate developers or jobs they're not trying to screw anyone by scripping their dad without consent instead they're trying to do it the right way by giving you tools to help you make your games better and faster since AI is moving really quickly they're also paying close attention to the rules and regulations as this space changes another extremely important question is with regards to data sets plenty of people don't like how all of these AI tools just scrape the entire internet without consent chances are if you've ever drawn an image and published it on the internet that it was used to train stable diffusion or perhaps if you've ever posted something on stack Overflow chances are Chachi PT read about it and learned from it this is a a very tricky subject should the AI tools be allowed to learn from any public Source or should they require consent first that's not just a moral issue but in legal one as well is it legal to train a model on copyrighted materials there are already several lawsuits currently ongoing and right now no one knows which way the chords are on the side right now it's certainly complete unknown and if game development is your job you definitely don't want to be dependent on data known and potentially become exposed to legal problems in the future there are already some reports that various Studios have forbidden the use of AI tools simply because it is not clear how it works legally those Studios absolutely do want to use AI to improve their productivity but not at the cost of exposing them to legal action The Entity team said that this is something they take very seriously Unity does not want people that use the engine to be exposed to any kind of legal liability because of copyright questions related to the original data set so that means in order to do it right they need to gather the data sets properly and with consent this is another part of the reason why they didn't announce anything specific because these two homes are built on data massive amounts of data and if you're doing things the right way either you need to get consent or you need to build all that data yourself as you can imagine for something like an AI mocap tool it takes quite a bit of time and money to generate all of the thousands of hours of mocap data that you need in order to make the tune work for me this showcase is just how committed they are to doing Aid right way with consent and without exposing you the developer to any legal liability since Unity is working on building an entire data set that they themselves own they can then build tools and know for certain there are no legal issues as for what are the tones themselves like I said what I saw is under NDA so I can't reveal any specifics on what I saw but they've already probably shown that talk in unite where they showcase AI driven posing AI animation and postmatching from an image another AI tool they've shown many times is called kinematica which is an AI driven animation system now they actually pause development on this dual until that animation is fully stable which might happen sometime later this year so perhaps kinematica won't be back next year beyond that you can look at the General State of AI and assume Unity is researching of those areas like for example kijirusum where a chatbot can interact directly with unity of course using AI to generate all kinds of textures this is something that already exist you don't think stopping them from releasing something like this right now is simply the need for building their own data set from scratch Nvidia has already announced a text to 3D tool that one would definitely be extremely useful to game devs there are already some tunes on the accessor they use AI for terrain generation and placing objects with regards to code Microsoft recently announced GitHub copilot X which seems really impressive it allows you to generate documentation ask questions based on your code base write code with voice and so on so you can probably assume Unity is researching all kinds of use case related to AI but at the same time like I mentioned in the beginning there's a huge difference between a proof of concept and a proper usable production ready tool so it remains to be seen how many of these possible use cases they can turn into proper tools oh no I can definitely understand the skepticism and negativity that people had in reaction to this extremely bare bone Caesar I get that but what I saw behind closed doors really puts my mind at these that they are doing this the right way and actively trying to avoid all of the negative pitfalls of AI hopefully in the coming months as the Apparently announced more and more on this topic people will see how AI might help them make better games faster which will then generate a more positive sentiment if you want to learn more you can sign up to their AI beta I've signed up myself and I'm very much looking forward to seeing what the future brings alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
