hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights that were released in august 2021 in this first video i will be covering a list of free assets and in the next ones i will be covering paid assets and tools check out the phone plan list to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them and by the way check out my own assets on the store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your games and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create some custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out alright so starting off with a pretty impressive scifi police pack really high quality and tons of objects for a free pack it's in a low poly style so the characters look like playstation 1 models so it contains characters buildings vehicles weapons and tons of props could be great for a heist game or maybe a starting point for an open world game something like gta then if you need tons of medieval characters also in a low poly style there's this pack they are modular so you can create tons and tons of variation if you like this style then this developer has a bunch of other character packs and they are all using the same rig so you can easily mix and match to get even more variation next up an rpg combat system so this is a great starting point you just drag and drop and you have a working character with movement jump dash and attack supports both keyboard and gamepad inputs and it even includes a simple ai enemy so if you have a quick rpg idea you'd like to try out then this would be a great super fast starting point or maybe you need a quick environment to try out here is a nice desert it's a very large map with a bunch of rocks cliffs and dry vegetation includes 14 prefabs so you can expand upon it or reuse it in any other scene import this whenever you want to test some game idea but you want something that looks a bit better than just a boring plane for an interesting tool here is the quick object replacer tool normally when prototyping your game ideas you probably tend to use basic shapes so just a bunch of spheres capsules cubes and so on eventually you do want to switch it out for some proper meshes now doing that manually is very tedious so this simple tool lets you select the objects you want to replace select the object you want to replace them with and just swap them all with a click of a button so it's simple and it does exactly what it's supposed to do next up here's a simple free bicycle looks really nice very sleek very clean design maybe it could be a vehicle in your open world game or maybe use it in a downhill prototype also comes with a ramp so maybe to make some tricks as well as a finish line then for some nice textures here's a great pack includes five materials all of them with tons of maps so the final result looks really good not just a flat visual you've got some wood and a bunch of brick types next up if you want a character creator with a realistic style check this one out it's a male model with a humanoid rig and it includes a bit of customization this developer also has tons more really highend models so if you like this style then check it out or maybe you need a really cool effect for your sword slash here's a great looking one it's a mesh so it works great on both 2d and 3d games just swap out the material with a different color and it looks completely different and finally another interesting tool this lets you define a bunch of voice types then you populate it with a bunch of audio clips for each voice and through code you play the clip for that selected voice i can see this being very useful for something like an open world game where you have lots of npcs all of them saying the same ai barks but with different voice types also this has integration with an ai voice generator which could also be very useful alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unity asset store for august 2021 there's links to all of them in the description stay tuned for the next video where i will be covering paid essence and tools there's lots of awesome stuff there check out the phone playlist to see some more lists with free and paid assets and let me know if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also check out my own free and paid assets on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
