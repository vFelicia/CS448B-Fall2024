hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so a while ago I made a video talking about an excellent indie game called punch a bunch that just released and found massive success by my estimates it's owned about 13 000 copies in just two weeks making about 200 000 in Revenue that's a huge hit really awesome but recently I also launched my own steam game and results are very much a family with almost zero players so the big question is what is the big difference between these two games now I should point out that I'm using the word failure here with some very very heavy quotation marks the game that I'm talking about is Kitchen chaos this is the game that was fully built in my free complete course I added it to seem just for fun just make it easier for people who wanted to easily play the final game before starting the course so I wasn't really trying to make this a successful launch or anything so that is why it's not really a failure at all like I mentioned in the video is game devluck success means different things to different people so for this specific game I didn't add it to steam with the hopes of getting thousands of downloads I added it just for fun so based on my goals it actually was successful but still this is an excellent data point to end analyze how Sim releases can do how one game can launch and sell 10 000 copies while another one gets almost zero now if you're a regular on this channel you've heard me mention repeatedly the importance of wishlists you might be sick of hearing me talk about it but the reason why I mentioned it so often is exactly because of this it is so extremely important these two games are the perfect example of that for punch a bunch the game was developed over three years and all that time he made tons of devlogs which helped him gather around 20 000 wishlists by the time the game launched because of that as soon as the game was released a bunch of people got some steam notifications that the game was out then some of those people bought it then steam saw that the game was selling and showed it to more people and so on and on so those wishlists helped it get a successful launch whereas for my game I made this theme page quickly as I was building the course at the same time then I made it public and I launched the game when the course video went live which was pretty much as quickly as I could launch it seem requires you to have the coming soon page visible for two weeks before launching and that's exactly how long it was visible I think I just mentioned it in a single video and during a live stream before release so the result on this game launched with just 600 wishlists that is a tiny tiny amount for contacts usually if you want to find success then the bare minimum you should have is at the very least 5000 a better amount is at least 10 000. those are the goals that I set for my proper steam game tournament Liberation so for kitchen chaos with under a thousand wishlists that is essentially zero wish list which in turn means almost no one was notified when the game was released and in turn no one picked it up which means the same algorithm really just ignored the game again let me point out that for this game I didn't have the goal of making this a steam success or anything so I'm personally okay with the result I wasn't expecting anything different but the lesson to you is imagine that instead of having the goal of just putting it on scene for fun imagine that I had worked on this game for two years and I was hoping it would sell tons of copies if there were the case then this would be a catastrophic failure so if you make a game and you work on it really hard for a real long time with the hopes of finding success if you ignore my advice and ignore marketing and don't get a wishlist or tell anything about your game if you do that and you suddenly launch the game if you do then this is what will happen no one will know that your game exists no one won't buy it and no one won't play it so if you don't want that to happen with your games then I would highly highly encourage you to listen to my advice watch my video on the most important skill start studying about marketing start Gathering some wishlists through whatever method you can find so that hopefully when your game final launches you actually find the success that you're after I should also point out that part of marketing is choosing a good idea that is marketable and interesting the main reason this game didn't find success is indeed because of lack of wishlist but a second equally important reason is that the game is really nothing special now obviously that's intentional this was a game made permanently for a course so it was intentionally made to be simple and generic but obviously in your own games you don't want that one extremely important video that I mentioned in the marketing video is won by Ryan Clark it's an excellent video all about finding good hooks definitely watch that to validate that your idea is actually marketable having a marketable idea makes marketing a whole lot simpler so if your goal only still finds success as an indie Dev don't do what I did with this quick game instead pick a good idea and start Gathering wishlist as soon as you can if you do that then like I said in the Game Dev Vlog video I believe that success can be achieved also let me take this time to listen to my own advice so let me mention my proper steam game that I'm working on with the hope that it does find success it's called turnover Liberation it's an interesting mix of genres with turnbased strategy automation crafting resource Gathering and so on check it out to the link description and add it to your wishlist alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
