hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey and here's an unexpected nice surprise Unity 6 preview is now available I was waiting for this one for one specific reason I'll mention what that is in a little bit but before that apologies for my voice I've been sick all week which is pretty annoying I was planning to record a bunch of videos and doing a live stream but I couldn't do any of that and in this video I also finally wanted to try out some of these new features but in order to not mess up my throat too much this is just going to be a quick news video anyways like I said Unity 6 preview is out right now I thought this was still months away so this is awesome the reason why I was looking forward to this version is because in terms of features this has everything inside of unity 6 they talked about their new naming scheme a while ago now they have beta preview and then full release so beta is normally naturally quite unstable so normally personally I don't touch the beta versions unless I want to explore some specific feature then there's preview which is what we have right now this one is considered mostly stable and contains all the features that won't be in the final version and finally the full LTS version this one is usually the one you should be using for your final games I'm guessing this one willon be out around September that's when they have their Unite conference and I'm guessing the version won't be out by then so anyways preview which is out right now means it has all those features so that means all those really awesome graphics features like the GPU resent drawer literally just toggle the checkbox and everything runs much faster then it's also got GPU occlusion calling this one use the GPU in order to be able to render much fewer things if you got spatial tempor on post processing this is sort of their upscaler which makes the game Run much faster at a lower frame rate without any visual difference then you've got the render graph viewer to be able to see exactly how your frame is being rendered you've got 48 rendering if you're making some kind of VR application you can now much more easily make custom Pro frosting effects and even work directly with the volume framework you can finally try out adaptive Pro volumes this is one of the main ones that I'm really looking for it lets you do some really gorgeous natural glob illumination you can generate some really gorgeous lighting and then easily swap between them for AG grp you've got some really gorgeous atmospheric scattering that water system is also continually getting a bunch of improvements there's some very useful new VFX gra tools shed graph also get some nice interesting things you can now easily create some build profiles make mobile games that run the web and more things including a bunch of multiplayer tools like multiplayer play mode this one I think is going to be super useful then you've got distributed Authority more improvements for netod for enties that cated server and a bunch more so with all this un6 does look like one of the biggest jumps in versions and I was specifically waiting for this version for one very specific thing for a long time now people have been asking me to do a complete stepbystep dots course and I was waiting for this version before I started researching that since that course is on dots I want to use the latest version possible so I will be using the latest dots version and the unity 6 preview version hopefully that means the course will stay up to date for a really nice long time I've started doing some research I've been playing they are billions great game the design that I'm going for will be similar to that meaning RTS with lots of units and City Builder and defense elements like I said I'm still in the very early stages of planning but I have set up a page where you can sign up with your email and I'll let you know when it's ready so if you want to learn how to use dots in a complete project as a guided stepbystep course then check out the link in the description to sign up that's my personal reason for waiting for this specific Unity version but like I said Unity 6 is a preivew about these features for quite a while now they mentioned them last year at unite and a few months ago at GDC so if you're a regular on my channel then this will all be mostly familiar to you the main difference is now that really just the fact that the preview version is out so if you like me also don't normally touch the beta versions then now is the time to finally explore all of these nice new features if you're working on a project and you're going to release it in the next few months then keep using whatever version you're using likely the 22 LTS version that's the main version that I've been using in pretty much all my projects for about a year now but if you're at least 6 months away from releas or if you like me want to explore these new features then now is a great time to install Unity 6 and try it out I've already installed it myself this is going to be my main version that I'm going to use going forward I'm definitely curious to explore all these new features especially seeing just how big a difference it actually is to enable all of these graphical checkboxes so definitely stay tuned for some videos covering that and if you're interested in learning how to make a complete Game using D dots then check the link and sign up I'm hard at work researching and planning for that course and I'm really excited to finally use dots in a nice complete project all right so I'm going to go try to rest a bit now I hope you've been having a better week than me hopefully I'll be back to normal tomorrow to be able to do the normal private member live streams so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
