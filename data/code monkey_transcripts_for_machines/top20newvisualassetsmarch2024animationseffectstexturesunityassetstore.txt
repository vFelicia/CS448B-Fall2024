sing video for tomorrow so definitely stay tuned for that and if you need any assets then very quick mention this bundle is ending in one day it's an excellent bundle full of centy assets so if you're a fan of their style then this bundle is definitely worth it it probably has something like I don't know 3,000 assets on for 25 bucks so definitely worth it you can build a ton of interesting games with these assets and there's another one with also a bunch of tools and also a bunch of assets this one for just 15 bucks you've got some interesting paral effects a bunch of interesting tools a really highend character some wickeds and so on and again this one is also ending in two days so if you need either of these definitely get it quickly all right so starting off with a really awesome scifi dinosaur this is a really high quality model personally I love the design it comes with three skins and 26 animations so I could see this one being perfect if you're making some kind of game inspired by Horizon zero dong or if you're building a survival or garden management game if so here are a bunch of tools there's quite a lot of variety in all of this I don't even know the name for half of these tools you've got some hammers there's a bunch of axes there's some shovels some brakes and also a really nice wheelbarrow next if you want characters with tons of customization then check out this one it's a huge pack with over a thousand modular pieces allowing for near infinite variation I use a pack just like this one in my own game dinky Gardians if you want to know how I built the character customization system then check out my tutorial for it you could use that exact same system and use it as a base to apply it on this asset then for some fun VFX here are some map trackers these are really cool would be great for all kinds of use case right away it makes me think that it would be perfect for an RTS to control some units or maybe something like Diablo some top down action game it has 24 effects with lots of shapes and colors to represent whatever you want then if you need a gorgeous Castle environment check out this one it's got some really really high quality models along with some really gorgeous lava it's made up of modular pieces so you can easily build up your own castles or you can use this pack in some kind of Survival game where the players themselves can build their own castles this one is made by Nature manufacturer which is a publish with tons of super high quality stuff or if you need some artistic effects check out this bundle this one contains 10 really interesting unique effects you can make your game look kind of like an oil painting or you can isolate some colors like only showed the red or you can get some kind of comic look or just a really awesome tilt shift effect adding an effect like this one on top of your game this is an excellent way to give it that extra bit of Polish and make it really awesome then if you need some me check out this pack these are some super complex looking mechs there's some small ones and some really huge very powerful ones they have a very unique Style with lots of miniguns and Rockets So I can see this being perfect for some kind of Mech warar Inspire game or if you're into something a bit more spooky then check out this horror prison it looks extremely creepy if you're interested in making some horror prototype then this would be a great level you can just use straight up you can just get a first person controller you add some spooky music and some scary monsters and right away you have something fun and scary to play with then if you need some animations check out this parkour animation set these are all very cool you've got lots of slides jumps rolls front flips and of course lots of Falls so if you'd like to make your own game kind of like Assassin's Creed or mir's Edge and this would be perfect next if you're into making some automation game and you'd like some visuals check out these really nice machines all in a nice and inviting low poly style it features 21 machines all with their own animations also includes conveyor belts and lots and lots of props so great pack for any kind of automation prototype or if you're making a postapocalyptic game then check out this Command Center my first thought when I saw this one is it looks just like the division so this would be perfect for some game where Society has crumbled and this is your command center or maybe with some interesting lighting this could be a fun level in some sort of horror mystery game where you gather some unique items then if you're going for something military check out this huge sniper rifle it's a high caliber rifle with hands and firstperson animations you've got idle run inspect shoot zoom and a bunch more if you like this pack then this dev has tons more weapons and animations next here's a fun one it's a globe however this one isn't just visual it has some logic to place objects on specific points in the globe this one comes with three Globes and 8K textures or maybe instead of an entire world you just need a futuristic city look at this one it looks very Sleek very clean it's all futuristic but not too scifi this one contains a ton of buildings with lots of modular parts so you can build your own next for a fun visual effect check out this world scan it starts a scan running outwardly from a point it expands and attaches to any geometry it also includes some scripts in order to highlight some objects so it identifies if the scan has touched those objects and if so it shows their distance so this could be great for some kind of detective mode in your game some kind of radar scan to find all kinds of enemies and objects then if you're making a 3D platformer and you need a level check out this one it's got all the things you expect from a 3D platformer there are coins enemies Hammer swinging there's things to push you away some cannons there's some stars and even a trophy at the end this one has a winter theme which looks really great and you like this style the this T has tons more platform effects these are really great if you want to quickly get a prototype working next if you need some UI elements check out this super casual pack it looks exactly like you expect there's lots of bright colors with some solid shapes there's plenty of buttons sliders trophies icons joysticks and a bunch more or maybe you'd like to make your own game kind of like the Sims if so here's a pack with a ton of Interiors they look quite dirty so this would be great for some kind of postapocalyptic Sims you've got beds couches tables and all of it looking quite worn down but also really great or if you want the exact same thing but a lot more jum check out this one this is another huge pack it's got over 700 models all of it in a cute cozy inviting art style you can build some bedrooms build some living rooms maybe build some bathrooms a kitchen or even a garage or literally anything else then if you already have a character and you just want to equip something then check out this hat pack it features 66 models there's
