hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosore is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for July 23 even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these asses enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid ads and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets Investments and systems as always there's only CS in the description and as a bonus you can use a coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now UNT is having a fun sale called Dev days of summer basically they asked a bunch of YouTube game devs to pixel masses and make some videos related to it the devs and the assets they change every single week and next week I'm actually winning the devs so stay tuned for that video where I use a ton of tools to make a really interesting open war game there's already a ton of stuff on a 50 discount and the Cindy store is also still having their birthday sale for a few more days if you're a fan of their sound they've got packs for making pretty much any game you can think of so check out both sales Link in the description alright so starting off with a real gorgeous looking Sky pack it looks really great very stylized very anime like it's actually got quite a lot of variety and all of them really high quality I could see these being perfect for a game kind of like ancient impact or Zelda then for something more dark and Moody here are some scifi neon buildings it includes tons of them over 300 objects with many modular prefabs for rooms and stairs so it's not just the exterior but the interior as well it's a great sound lots of neon and gray so if you'd like to make a game kind of like cyberpunk or void Runner then this would be a great pack next if you'd like to make something like the Sims and you need some characters check out this pack it's a modular stylized character base this bundle includes both male and female you can modify all kinds of clothes shirts pants to shoes you can modify the hairstyles and accessories change the skin color eyes and eyebrows and you can even modify the body shape with all kinds of Sliders definitely a great pack if you're making a Sims like game then if you need something stylized here is a really nice soon Shader with tons and tons of options really lots of ways that you can customize how this looks you can modify fighting light Ram you can set up some half tone shading you can set up some hatching add some noise or emission also has some great looking uplines and of course this works on any mesh so really tons of options and it's actually pretty cheap then for some 3D icons here is a nice one these can be great to represent pickups or all kinds of things in your game you've got some Scrolls weapons Bells swords some gifts Maps dice really tons of objects in total there's 120 nice 3D icons for some effects here is a nice assault pack it's got very unique effects it's not just a boring regular the song each pixel vanishes or appears in a nice satisfying way for some very unique looks I assume you can customize the color and get tons of variations then for a nice calm gorgeous looking environment here is some fantasy nature looks very inviting so this could be an area street from Zelda with the different colors you can create multiple biomes you can place one area for grass then sand snow and even some alien looking purple areas it includes a bunch of trees foliage lots of rocks and cliffs this one does packs where you can just use the demo scene directly whatever game you're working on then if you already have an environment and you just need some characters check out these medieval knights it's got a realistic Style with tons of much more parts these start with a basic human body and then attach Parts on top of those parts they're all very realistic although it also includes a strange gray skin color with red eyes so this could also work for some kind of medieval zombies then if you have medieval characters you're going to need sword animations here's a nice pack with the sword and shield it includes over 200 animations tons of variety from some basic movement some sun animations there's some attacks get hit wind up Dodge and more it includes both standing and crouching animation or perhaps you need some effects but apply to the UI here's a mega pack with a ton of them there are some nice squares and hexes so perfect for card games or character portraits some that don't like spawning things some that are constantly certainly around lots of interesting stuff very interesting animations looking at this one reminds me that I need to get a pack just like this one when I go to punish up the UI for my steam game if you're building a jrpg here is a character pack you've got some phone size character portraits and some small ones for ingame now it says that this pack is meant to be used with RPG Maker but these are religious images so you can use them with anything then if your game has 3D characters and you want to customize how they unlock check out this hair pack it includes quite a lot of hairstyles to choose from everything from some simple to some very unique ones you can just attach them to the head and then of course you can modify the colors and even supports blending colors for some really unique hair or maybe you're working on a hex game if so check out this battlefield pack it's got some really nice looking hexagons nice visual style nice calm and cartoony this is actually from the same Dev from where I grab my dinkies and Zombies characters it's really interesting how a hexagon is such a basic shape but as you can see you can take that shape and build it in various ways I can see this being great for some kind of puzzle game or perhaps something like Exon which by the way my turnbased strategy course does have a free expansion that covers hex words then if you're making a pixel art game here's a huge pack you've got lots of characters weapons armors and items so everything from humans to monsters you've got swords bows ones and more there's potions food Scrolls and tons more and if you've got some pixel art characters you also need some pixel artifacts here is a pack that is inspired by the NES it doesn't look exactly like you expect it's got some thick pixels with some nice animation these are all 16 by 16 pixels using the NES palette for some cute characters here are some animal faces now these could be great as emojis or perhaps even just characters in some sort of Animal Kingdom game next here's a very unique one paddled unique and unusual grenades they are certainly very very unusual this is a very creative fact these are 2D grenades and includes over a hundred of them for something more grounded here are some gears looking at this makes me want to make some kind of gear based game just the other day I was watching some videos on using Lego Gears to make lots of interesting things with this you could make a fun virtual version of exactly that or perhaps you want a hyper realistic medieval environment this one looks really gorgeous it's a castle with some thick walls leather Stakes trees and more really has an excellent look excellent environment and looks very dark and Moody the skies are cloudy and there's some snow or some fog ever every part of it looks excellent so this would be great in pretty much any game or version production alright so those are my top 20 new visual assets on the NTS store for July 23. there's a link so
