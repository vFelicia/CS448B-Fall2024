here's a quick unity tip on the inspector next to the game object you see this button click on it and you can set a preset icon or a custom one this makes it very easy to find a certain object in the editor but do make sure you have gizmos enabled and this also works in the game view just enabling gizmos and the icon is there for another tip gizmos can change between 2d and 3d just click the arrow icon and change between 3d and 2d this will either take the camera position into account or ignore it and display a normal standard size and here's yet another tip you've got various icons and if you choose one of these it says the name of the object with a colored background very useful if the object name is something you want to see rather than an icon alright hope that's useful subscribe for more tips
