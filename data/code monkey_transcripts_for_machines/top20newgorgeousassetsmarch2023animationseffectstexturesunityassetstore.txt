more alright so starting off with a really interesting crafting pack it features a nice realistic fantasy style tons of unique crafting stations and lots of tools looking at this makes me want to build a quick prototype of some kind of crafting blacksmith shop simulator then for some particles here are some gorgeous looking stylized boost rails this one would be perfect for so many scenarios maybe you're making a game kind of like Sonic with a super fast character maybe a car with this effect while drifting maybe some magic bolts or really some projectiles if your game is character based then look at this huge character pack it features 500 acids so you have a whole bunch of body shapes and a whole ton of attachments you've got hats masks backpacks gloves looking at this really makes me want to make a multiplayer game with tons of character customization so for example you could follow my free multiplayer course and add this packed with all this customization to all those characters then if you already have the characters here are a bunch of really great artists all of them are really gorgeous looking really well made particle systems they've got lots of colors so they can represent whatever you want or perhaps you're making a SciFi game here are a bunch of great vlogging planets this one is an egrp pack so all of the planets have tons of maps to make them all look

and if you like it then this nav has tons more up next series the latest cinti pack this one is all about elves with some medieval fantasy as you occasionally it's in their gorgeous little pony style personally I love medieval fantasy Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite worlds in media so I definitely want to find some time to use this pack to make some fun prototypes then here's a pretty unique one some animated emojis it features 90 of them so lots of variation this could be used in so many ways maybe you could use them to add some animations to your text or maybe just some emoticons this is an easy way to add some fun communication to your games up next if you want to make a gorgeous stylized World here is a nice cloud and Sky pack I've said many times how changing the sky is one of the simplest things you can do that will have a huge impact in your games just changing the sky makes a huge difference it features 9 skyboxes and 25 Cloud textures for another animation pack here is one with a ton of Parkour animations features 60 animations so you've got lots of vaults some sprinting animations ledge climbs and drops you can do a bunch of flips and a whole bunch more could be interesting to experiment with making a climbing system kind of like Assassin's Creed then for a gorgeous environment here is a fantasy Woodland very bright right saturated colors everything looks really inviting it features over 200 models including two prebuilt demo scenes so if you need an environment just pick this up and use it or maybe you need some peasants and citizens here is a nice modular pack it features a male a female and a baby body type there is one single base color texture so it's all very performant with all these parts you can really make endless variations If instead
