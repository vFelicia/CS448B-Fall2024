hi there this is a quick tip for how to assign icons to a game object so over here is my scene window and if I select the game object and here is the inspector with the selected game object here it has a name and here it says the game object is enabled then here on the web side we have a very nice icon now here in the scene view since this game object doesn't have any visual component you can't actually see anything so if it's not selected then I have no idea where it actually is there's one there and one in there so one thing we can do is go over here into this button and we can select an icon and if you select one of these you can click on it and there you go you can now see the name of the game object with a colored background this way you can visually see where the game object is and if you go into the game window you can also click in here in order to enable gizmos and you can see it in the game window as well so for example something that I always find very useful in my games is to always have a game object named pointer and I simply drag a background and so I can easily drag this object visually in my scene and then I can look in here to see this position is on 4240 so some lighting that shows you the background and you can change the various colors however you can also select an icon you can choose one of these preset icons so for example like that this one and for this player game object and let's add this icon so there is those are now visible and if you have a specific icon text you don't like in here in my project files I have two nice textures and I can replace them by click on other and select that texture so there you go there's one and on the my game object what's also at the other texture and just like that all these objects are now visible in the scene so I can easily locate them and if I go into game scene and they won't get moves I can also see them one more thing is here on the scene window if you're working in 2d you need to come into the gizmos and disable 3d icons if you don't then the 3d icons won't be dependent on the size of your zooom so always is a from them when working in 2d so if you build your game using game objects to the level design then using iPhones can make the process much much easier and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
