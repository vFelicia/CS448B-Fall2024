all right so it's finally time it's out right now you can go ahead and play the free demo for my game dinky Guardians right now the game has a nice mix of automation mechanics with some Colony building some defense and resource Gathering elements these are from scratch and calling your very first stinky and build your Colony bit by bit you can give dinky some orders so they can help you gather resources gather power and so on you must keep them fed and keep them safe so if the zombies attack pick them up throw the dinky away and hit the zombie with a punch or alternatively build some Towers to defend your Colony then you can research new buildings and items on the tech tree change from manual power to automated power build all kinds of machines to do work for you then keep exploring and expanding until your colony is nice and safe and fully sustainable when it's all automated then you can build a rocket and throw yourself in the dinkies into space that's the core gameplay of the demo I really hope you'll like it it was very tricky to get a demo down in such a short amount of time but I'm really happy with how it came out although I do wish I had some time for polish in terms of mechanics pretty much everything is there but in terms of Polish definitely would like to have a bit more but at the same time this is just a demo so it's only the very beginning I would pretty much call this an alpha build I definitely need to take a mini break after working so hard for these past few weeks but I'm still planning to continue working on the demo and fixing any issues that happened this week there's still a long journey to go until the final punch game there's tons more things that I want to add improve and polish for the final release so I'm very much looking forward to reading all of your feedback especially in terms of game design I've been working like crazy to get all of these systems and mechanics all of those finally working but I haven't had much time to iterate upon the core game design so I really want to hear what you think about it perhaps you feel it's too easy or too hard perhaps there's too many or too few denkis too many or too few zombies too many or too few resources go ahead and play the game and post your thoughts either on the comments of this video or on these theme forms I'll be refreshing that every time I can so go ahead and download the free demo and give it a try make sure you add the game to your wishlist and let me know what you think alright so I really hope you enjoy playing the game thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
