hey everyone so i've been working like crazy for a while now and i'm almost done with the complete visual scripting course this course is focused on making complete games without writing a single line of code i'm nearing the final stages and i'm really happy with the current result i've managed to implement tons of features both simple and complex and so far i still haven't yet reached the limits of visual scripting at all it really is an insanely powerful tool and definitely capable of making games only with visual scripting and also another side benefit is as you go along and learn to use visual scripting you also start to understand programming concepts so visual scripting is also a great stepping stone for starting to learn programming since you will be exposing yourself to logic and programming concepts while working on it i specifically designed this course to include making several games from scratch so you can learn to apply visual scripting to any genre you can think of so the first game is a platformer it starts off simple just handling player movement jumping collisions and so on all without writing a single line of code then over time more elements are added then the game really starts to take shape so by the end there's moving platforms multiple levels hazards coins lava and so on the second game is an action rpg this one is a precomplete game with tons of features so it's got multiple weapons multiple enemies and hazards there's coins and pickups there's dungeons with portals cannons and lava so the final game is really feature rich and once again all of this built without writing a single line of code so this one is more complex thanks to building on top of the knowledge gained while making the platformer game both games are included in course from start to finish and they are set up to provide a nice smooth learning curve so first you'll learn the absolute basics in the platform and then continue learning and apply that based knowledge to the rpg game so this is a great course both for absolute beginners who want to start communicating from scratch and also great for more advanced users who want to see more advanced use cases for visual scripting or just want to see how to design and implement some interesting mechanics even if your goal is writing code instead of visual scripting this course is still very useful i chose to go with program and naming for the visual scripting nodes so if you want to write some code you can easily translate all of these nodes and convert these games into normal c sharp now one thing if you've heard me mention the visual scripting course before you might have noticed that i mentioned three games which were the platformer the action rpg and also a first person shooter now at lunch the course will have the platformer and the rpg game and then the fps project will be added later on as a free update to the course so initially i wanted to launch the course with all of them but my primary focus is always on quality and in order to hit a level of quality for the course that i was happy with these two games took quite a bit longer than expected so instead of making all three games slightly worse i opted to first focus on making these two as high quality as possible and now that i'm really happy with how these two came out i can get to work on making the third one with enough time to make it really high quality so like i said it will be added as a completely free update and it should be done sometime next month okay so if you're interested in the course go to the link in the description and sign up or hit the bell icon and i'll let you know when it's available i'm in the final stages so it shouldn't be done within next week alright so thanks for watching i really hope you'll enjoy the course and i'll see you next time you
