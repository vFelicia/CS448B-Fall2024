hello and welcome I'm your KMI steam just had the October Festival the other day so I asked you which one of your games had Dem was available here I'm going to play through five of your games and give my feedback on both the games themselves in terms of game design usability mechanics and so on and then I will also give feedback on the steam store Pages based on my knowledge of steam game marketing by the way there were actually more than five games submitted so thank you so much for that initially I wanted to go through all of them but this video is already insanely long with just five games this took ages to edit so I really had to limit it to just five there are time stamps in the description for each of the games and I also made a page on the website with links to all the games so you can go play demos for yourself and add them to your wish list now if you enjoy this video go ahead and hit the like button and subscribe if people find this format useful then I'll keep doing it every time there's a steam Festival the next one is actually going to happen in February so if you didn't make it in time for this one then maybe get ready for that one so next up let's look Aton Trooper so Eon Trooper is a thrilling adventure where strategy action and player choice are at the heart of each Mission delve into an territories execute crucial missions and choose between stealth strategy and direct combat to achieve your objectives okay that's a nice a nice little short description I like it nice short into the point and looking at the screenshot it's kind of like a top down shooter sort of thing okay so let's give this a try okay so I quite like the music on the main menu sounds really good okay let's begin with the tutorial all right movement WD of course grenade use stun grenade that's fun Crouch and roll then shoot knife Power Attack and of course supports controller as well but since I'm guessing this a shooter I prefer to use the mouse okay so let's see every time you eliminate an enemy with your knife you can get ammunition or bandages plus your special attack W be charged okay right away I like that mechanic sort of like Doom forcing you to engage in close combat so that's nice when ready to use aim and Destroy multiple enemies in one hit all right okay so that sounds good let's see right away I really like the art it's like some Vector art and it looks really nice really good okay so apparently we make some sound there are some nice music is great everything is looking really good so far can I interact with this thing I already forgot about the controls yeah I definitely have memory issues uh okay so on Q throws a grenade then on R I assume I have limits yeah I assume that's a two and five so an r that throws a sun grenade and didn't an e do something I thought it did something okay so maybe it's the interact how do I pick it up I guess I don't because oh crap I hit on N to reload and I threw another Sun grenade okay yeah I think that's going to be a bit tricky to to handle that uh muscle memory of always hitting R oh so I got a maximum range all right and he dropped some kind of gun okay I'm not seeing any stats so I don't know if this one is better or not okay so the bullets are moving at an interesting speed they're somewhat slow but they are perfect for being able to dodge so that's actually really good okay do I need any how do I pick up the health okay so for the interaction it appears that the interaction is not based on Mouse position rather on the character position okay so I'll have to remember that and again all these weapons it's really nice I always love games where every weapon is dropped every weapon is picked that just fun and do they have different ammo oh they do okay so I guess I should probably stick with my pistol which was somewhere behind this rock but I can't find it again okay so this one has 35 let's see and there was oh right on shift I can Crouch ah so I can essentially and can I throw a grenade over top this nope okay so that doesn't work although the sound is a bit strange because it says the range is like this but apparently they can hear me from quite a bit from F what oh yeah right totally forgot to use the melee and the power okay can I maybe try to sneak behind this guy I'm try to knife him oh nice all right so I think I got a little bit of power oh got something looks like a SMG and I got 150 throw grenade ah all right that was a nice uh radius I don't need any more Health right now I don't know what are these things well I'm assuming the objective disable defense lasers and sabotage the enemy ship okay that sounds good I wasn't there oh right I got a Dodge roll in space so I got to use that as well oh boy okay I went a little bit way too much let's hope this one has some health okay I think I prefer the more impactful shots of the other one I assume it's more impactful would be nice to be able to see the max range so like as I move the cursor past the maximum range I think the cursor should probably go rather or something like that or maybe I was wrong about the max range no cuz yeah if I aim there it doesn't get it there so it would be nice to be able to have visually see okay is that guy in range or not and when these games something that I always really like that always feels really good which I did add and cuz I made a bunch of top down Shooters back in my flash days I've never made a steam game like it but yeah back in the flash days I did and uh yeah basically just making the camera look a little bit towards where the where the player is aiming so basic if I'm aiming to the right side of the camera instead of pointing right down the mdal it should be pointing a little bit to the side that makes the game feel quite a bit more Dynamic so personally if I were developing this game that's one of the things that I would add it makes the camera move quite a bit more and also allows the player to see a little bit further so that's fun o nice one shot does this have head shots or something so I think they weren't being one shot a while ago yeah being able to see guys underneath it's a bit tricky I seee assume that if I touch that I'm going to die so I don't want to touch them I still haven't figured out what are these things maybe that's respawn points I really like a weapon that one shots enemies just one shot although I haven't really used the the uh melee thing I guess I should Dodge yeah but like that I take quite a bit of damage so actually shooting from distance and what are these things I have no idea more crates there got some ammo let me use the oh crap oh crap yeah I wasn't I wasn't expecting that like I tried to use the power but I but I wasn't I didn't know what to expect so I didn't know what was going to happen and yeah that kind of messed me up so I would say for that one I would probably like to see that mechanic and try out that mechanic in a safe space so on some kind of tutorial level just go so that I know what to expect so that this doesn't happen where I basally die just because I had no idea what to expect and all of a sudden and everything went into slow motion I just died instantly okay so do I start everything from scratch would be nice to have a little checkpoint but okay okay so now I got so apparently the star weapon is like the worst one like it has no range so on this one with much shorter range yeah definitely would be very beneficial to being able to see just how far I can shoot so yeah so I much prefer the bigger weapon just just shoots once and just kills them in one shot ah it's really difficult I I don't know what am I oh boy oh boy way too many I don't know how I'm supposed to do melee with them since it is really difficult to do it without getting hit also just a minor polishing thing ah crap a lot of hit boxes uh minor polishing thing would be down here on the health bar make it a little bit more animated so like when I get hit uh the red part should go down but then there should be some kind of white part that only goes down a little bit afterwards in order to demonstrate just how much health that I actually lose with that one shot cuz right now I think I land like five shots but I'm not 100% sure okay let me yeah it would be really nice if the interaction was based on the mouse position cuz yeah oh Bo picking that one up is really tricky yeah really not sure how the I get the idea behind the melee and I like it but it really needs some sort mechanics so that I can safely be able to melee all these enemies without taking tons of damage myself maybe I'm supposed to do something like that just do a Dodge roll really close them okay so maybe that's what I'm supposed to do all right that actually feels good so once again that is something that I would include in some sort of tutorial level teach that mechanic because yeah it does seem like that's what I'm supposed to do instead of just of just moving like that okay okay let me actually pick up a bunch of them just two of them can't I get more boom that was nice should have a few more effects but yeah I like the unlike the mechanic oh and only now I noticed that apparently there's oh crap all right so I guess I got to take this quite a bit slower okay so let's do it slowly now pick up the SMG oh this actually oh did the weapon change oh that's nice I like it all right I really like the the particle oh boy oh boy I put up way too many a all right that was fun but definitely way too intense okay let's try again yeah now I got an SMG yeah the shotgun was much better I would say visually the weapons probably need to be a bit more different cuz I mean I swear the shotgun looked exactly like that one yeah so basically I really I cannot aggro tons of guys at the same time if I do then I can't really also since there's a field of view mechanic that field of view should probably be shown to the player so like that guy gets okay maybe there isn't a field of view maybe just based on distance from the screen okay so basically I was going to say that if it is based on field of view like I can't see him behind that then the area behind that that should probably be a little bit darker but if it's just on the edge of the screen then I guess yeah just fading in although that's a bit strange if it is just on the edge of the screen then I don't think it should fade but okay I guess maybe I'm also supposed to be quite a bit more deliberate with my shots and use stealth quite a bit more oh boy nice I don't know what are these things and I haven't really been using my grenades so I would say for that that I would probably add some sort of timer in the code and if the player has grenades but they haven't used them in quite a while definitely flash it in some way something like that okay let me let me try to actually complete the objectives I would like to have a little special thing nice what is the max four all right that was cool nice can I shoot through the laser no apparently oh I can I just hit the it seems like the hit box yeah the hit box seems a little bit too big usually you want to have the actual hitbox quite a bit smaller than the actual object so the hitbox should be some like 20% smaller than the actual visual object that always makes the game feel quite a bit satisfying it's a small thing but it does matter quite a bit there was a guy there that disappeared and appeared so maybe there is a field of view fog of War sort of effect oh boy how many guys are there on this map nice I got to say when I manage to slide and slash them that feels really satisfying so that should definitely be encouraged just got to oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh okay I really like the sniper the other weapons are fun but yeah the sniper is just and does it have invisibility frames I actually didn't check yet ah I got hit ah I always get hit they really need some sort of mechanic to make it a bit easier to to get within melee range without ah cuz yeah like that oh crap I need oh crap I can't figure it out okay so how do I actually get inside there okay I got to shoot that I assume am I shooting the right thing there are no I mean cuz yeah there are no health bars so I have no idea can I go through the laser I'm assuming I can't and I really don't want to die trying out if I throw a grenade then nope doeses not get anywhere that far okay so I really don't know what the game wants me to do there I mean if the game had checkpoints if I were to die and I'd spawn there then I would com uh I would feel confident in trying out to see if this kills me but without checkpoints knowing that if I die I'm going to have to do the whole thing that makes it quite a bit trickier ah I missed grenade boom I still haven't tried out the oh crap haven't tried out the stun grenade yeah I guess just stuns them makes sense okay so maybe oh boy maybe I was right and not not trying to not trying to I don't know oh okay I got interact with it nice okay so I think I was right and not trying to lower the defenses okay all right let's try this one ah crap the range is terrible I like to shoot them from a distance oh I Mur grenades all right throw that one just mow them all down a crap oh crap a fire of the grenade accidentally am I out of ammo or am I stunned why can't I shoot okay I don't know what happened but I can't shoot why can't I shoot okay I don't know what happened but that weapon stopped working so can I now take this out run away oh boy extraction Zone okay let's go get out this the extraction oh crap I got to survive for 20 second oh boy it's going to be tricky I really wish the game would give me a few grenades right now oh boy yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not going to make it oh come on a oh boy all right yeah that was definitely definitely tricky yeah I really wish the game had given me a few more Health backs somewhere maybe a grenade or two cuz boy that was quite intense yeah say I definitely enjoyed that game so that was definitely quite fun so let's now look at the store page so I think the capsule is really nice nice and spooky nice icon nice logo so the capsule is really good I think the the uh short description over here is also pretty nice I think after playing it my only concern is I don't know how well the seam audience reacts to basically top down shooter but looking at the screenshots there's quite a bit of content so I think if it has quite a bit more abilities I still haven't figured out what those tiny things were supposed to do but anyways so with a bunch more abilities a bunch more weapons a bunch more enemy types more skills things like that maybe it could work again I really don't know cuz top down Shooters they're not quite uh very popular on Steam nowadays I don't know if that's because there aren't too many or because they don't tend to do well I'm not sure about that and yep as always got to check do you have gifts on the store Page I have no idea why this first one isn't animated but yeah all these nice gifts cuz I do think that the shooting Works quite well the sound design is quite good so yeah in general looks like a very wellmade game so I hope it does well let's go and add it to your wish list okay so next up we have TV's the Revival so TV's the Revival is a platformer single player game that balances exciting action with challenging puzzles when the hero U awakens from a coma he is driven through strange events living in the TV's real world to unravel the mysteries of his past and defeat evil forces plaguing the region by the way there's a of type over there on Plague but y a nice short description so basically this is a platformer single player game okay so let's try this okay my mouse is gone so I assume yeah this is like okay I assume this works with a controller okay so looking at the controls so I've got move jump Crouch roll and interact okay all right so let's go new game okay so apparently the story TVs are fighting one another and then something happened okay so right away in terms of visuals I quite like it obviously got some excellent use of lighting some excellent use of volumetric lighting volumetric fog so in terms of visuals right with looks really nice okay so this is a 2 and a half de platformer so I can only move left and right well that looks really bright okay so far so good and the reflections on the floor oh really nice yeah visually speaking right way it looks great oh boy okay I assume that's not intentional so I got stuck somewhere so I got the Crouch and why was a Dodge roll and then I've got an interact okay all right so the camera there it has no Cuts that's nice I like it looks good so far in terms of level design everything looks really nice and varying can I interact with this oh I can put questions why is the TV pointing straight down okay wow in terms of variety of environments quite a bit everything looks really nice oh boy okay okay all right well there you go okay so I apparently have to dodge the cameras so how do I dodge that if I can't jump above it can I just go slow nope or I guess maybe I am supposed to speed through it that sounds a little counterintuitive because I just got interact I can't interact with anything so I assume that I just have to speed through it okay yeah that definitely feels a little bit counterintuitive but okay all right I'll keep that in mind oh boy timing elements go on go on Oh I thought oh okay the it's a strange pattern it's got like three or four states okay go go go that one does it only have that one right okay so that looks like one of the bad cameras I can only move left and right so okay I got to get behind that little but why do I have to take this with me I assume I have to take it with me okay go go go okay apparently I don't need to take this with me or maybe I do oh boy I feel like I can just barely make it ah okay good all right then the background looks really nice they're destroying robots destroying TVs that's a bit dark let's go elevator oh so I die based on looking at the sun is that it okay so apparently the sun is bad for TVs okay so this is the sun this is not the sun right let me wait wait for that one to go down go go go come on go down down down all right nice go go go uh do I have to time it oh go go go go go almost oh things that fall down I assume oh there's an extra box here I assume I'm going to need this for something is there like a secret in there or something or I guess not I guess this is the intended thing cuz through here I can't go oh now there are TVs with guns okay so when is that TV going to shoot me do they see me okay so I guess I'm safe here again I really like how the camera moves in just one take I assume this is very very much inspired by limbo and inside and those kinds of games let's go Sprint Sprint Sprint get all the way here and Crouch even though I think I could Sprint through all way through go go go okay so I assume that light is in the background oh is there a way to get up there all right guess that's where I need to go right yeah I'm going to guess that I or not or maybe yes oh wa yeah I guess there's no way to go through right cuz that guy is I assume he's going to one shot me go go Sprint Sprint go nope all right that was fun okay so I'm really going to need to pick up a box or do I need to carry two boxes can I just jump on this one no it's not doesn't yeah does pick up okay so I thought I need to push it all the way back but apparently not okay yeah visually speaking the gamees looks really great it has a really nice use of lighting fog all kinds of effects all of them looks really nice okay so I need to get this box down there yeah I don't think that I can get through that guy so can I pick it up all right okay so there's a patrol guy there okay got to wait quite a bit for him to come through and go away okay jump and let's go run run run keep going oh how do how do I push this okay so I I grabed the holes okay go down nice right so I got to wait for the platform would be nice if the right stick allowed me to look a little bit ahead CU right now basically just waiting for the platform to come back all right okay the camera is shaking why is the camera shaking what am I controlling just a second one so do I have to stop him what does stopping do I don't know but I assume that I have to get onto this one and then jump out to that one then the next one but I don't see the next one go go go okay now what yeah I think now I'm screwed because I assume the other one is going to stop at that point let's see if it does okay yeah so that one stopped at that point so so how am I supposed to I'm pretty sure there's nowhere that I can go is there okay so I really don't know cuz I need to be sort of position it in the middle but I'm pretty sure I can't make that jump can I I'm pretty sure I cannot make this jump nope not even close Okay so honestly I'm quite a bit confused I'm not sure what am I supposed to do because this one just keeps that one moving our stop it yeah it just gets to that one oh I think it's timing thing okay so I need to get like super close to this one so I think like this one might actually work okay this is quite a tricky thing stop it a little bit okay is that going to be enough or is it going to get there too fast yeah it's going to get there too fast right come on move faster no yeah now it's moving the other direction I can't get it nope right so I got to say the puzzle definitely increased quite massively in terms of difficulty okay so I got to stop this one here I'm going to wait pretty much until the last possible moment all right so like this oh crap is it going to be two prob oh it is isn't it yeah I can't make that jump nope so I got to like wait pretty much yeah cuz they have the same speed so pretty much yeah cuz then I also needed to be super close to oh come on I also needed to be super close to the other guy so I guess I need to use that one primarily for timing yeah it needs to be close enough for me to jump on the other guy and hopefully that won't be close enough for this one as well right come on can I make the jump I can all right now can I make the second jump on where's the other one okay I'm in all right well that was tricky game was being super easy no puzzle no nothing and all of a sudden became really tricky all right let's go nice let's call in the elevator can I call in the elevator okay so I can do something up here and something down there okay so I got to drop the box over there let's first grab the elevator up there okay so I got to basically it's pushing me no uh well actually it doesn't matter yeah I can just the box is quite a bit floaty definitely should fall down with a bit more of a thunk but yeah all right next one nice I guess right now if anything the only thing is doesn't feel like it has much of a progression although to be fair I'm not the target audience for these kinds of games you know kind of like limbo inside very story Focus or supposedly story Focus uh platformer games that's usually not the kind of game games that I tend to play so I don't know what players of those games of those genres expect but yeah everything has a really great Vibe but okay I assume that's going to fall down so oh boy that one falls down as well that one as well all right nice see compared to that other to that other one this one is much easier okay is that pushing me it kind of feels like yeah it's just a uning bug yeah okay so how do I do this yeah I would say the the interface over there needs to be a little bit more visible maybe flash lights or something cuz yeah but anyways yep let's go and just roll I really like the roll it's fun oh there's one on the back there I didn't even see it let's go roll TR to that one roll and let's go yeah I totally missed that that first uh controller there right some really nice posters yeah in terms of art it definitely looks unique having a bunch of TV face characters definitely looks quite strange quite unique you got two more controls what does this one do so always rotates that one clockwise oh did I just accidentally get it I think I just accidentally got it okay I mean I'm not a fan of puzzle so yeah I'll take blind luck over skill any day yeah all right that was good okay I guess I made it that was probably supposed to be quite a bit more comp likes but okay all right so we got some lasers okay so I got to jump almost oh crap no don't shoot me oh that's going to be tricky how do I hide from it there's a oh God I don't want to risk it yeah I could probably have risked it a how do I get oh I can Crouch under I suppose so let me just go ah no NOP okay wait go yeah if I roll it doesn't actually okay no I thought I could Crouch but apparently I can't so I don't have any safety from that thing so I got to pretty much just Sprint the hall way through yeah I guess so but if I Sprint I'm going to die oh okay so it doesn't actually hit every shot ah okay so I got to keep moving but can I push this I can't so oh okay once again that was just blind luck I did not expect that I was not actively trying to do that but again I'll take it come on come on oh nope NOP nope okay so come again Dodge it okay go out push push push all right no crap go go go all right nice there's a box there I assume I'm I'm going to need it so I might as well take it with me uhoh red lights Dodge now what okay so I guess it's kind of like a boss fight with stages now they're all out intentionally okay oh boy go go go go all right that's fun that's a fun idea for a boss fight I guess uh okay so now what I assume at some point it's going to disable nope nope okay okay nice do I pass in oh boy how do I dodge this really nice camera motion nice oh did I die instantly a that's annoying yeah cuz I was on the other Edge oh now I got to carry the box with me yeah this this little checkpoint should definitely be quite a bit further ahead okay so Dodge this one okay jump that one now that one is intermittent so turn it on turn it off good and now I got to wait at the corner all right okay so now I know that apparently it's going to damage me if I'm on the left side so I got to be on this side order to run away oh okay that that was a bit abrupt but yeah that was that was definitely nice all right so yeah in terms of style definitely has a style definitely has quite an interesting artistic look I'm not sure about storying about what am I supposed to be doing what what is going on but I'm definitely intrigued with the whole TV aesthetic with weapons and doing so yeah definitely considering how this is genre that lives or dies based on Sal loone then yeah I would say so far looking great so looking at the store Page in terms of the capsule yep it is excellent I think the low is actually a little bit sub part compared to all the excellent artart that the game has logo seems a bit too basic but sure it's a nice capsule so yeah the short description I think it's also pretty decent so it says what the game is so platformer single player so that's nice down here again I really like this image I would only suggest make it an actual animated gift so like make these little units move forward maybe the guy in the background move a little bit maybe the smoke move so I think this would uh it's a really nice image really nice composition but I think it would be better as a GI and that I actually think the boss fight is probably the least impressive part so I would probably take a gift from any of the other parts in in the game but yeah like for example I think this one looks much better than that one that one looks a bit confusing I only know that it's a boss because I played demo without playing the demo I would have no idea what exactly is going on here whereas down here it looks clear that it's an environment so up here I would probably put a gift of the character playing moving around doing something so yeah but some nice gifts visually the game looks great so I think that should be the main selling point and yeah like I said not really my kind of game not really my kind of genre but I really enjoyed my time with it it was nice it was mysterious a spencil and Visually which is a big part of this genre visually definitely wor the game looks quite gorgeous so yeah really nice yeah great job nice so let's go ahead add it to your wish list all right so game number two is overrider so take on a highspeed hoverboarding Adventure through a postapocalyptic World make tricks craft gadgets and fight robots to stop an AI Onslaught threatening to wipe about the remains of humanity all right so let's give this shot all right so this one seems like a racing driving game so I'm going to be using a controller it's got a nice feedback window so that's always good it opens up a simple Windows Form so that's a super easy way to get some feedback and as always when getting feedback you want to make it as easy as possible for the user so yep just being able to choose between numbers instead of having to write tons of text Yep this is great same thing for the other Buton so wish list yep you should always have this devlogs okay so this is nice and Discord community again if you can do it that's great all right so let's start off okay we got some nice storting first thing that I would say is just add some simple text animation to the text that is one of those things that is super easy to add and that's quite a bit of Polish makes everything look quite a bit better just a simple text writer same thing for the character animations that could easily be polished with just making a handful of frames of Animation literally just moving the mouth and nothing else okay use rotor shift downhill some left trigger okay so left trigger brings me down and I can use momentum to start going oh left bumper all right okay not sure how am I supposed to do tricks do that mean oh boy okay I have no idea how do I actually okay XB okay somehow I get feel like okay so I feel like somehow I jumped off where I wasn't supposed to cuz I have no idea how do I perform tricks all right apparently I performed a trick there okay I would say I'm definitely quite a bit lost I have no idea how do I gain more power more something like perform trick so I'm pressing the right Mouse bumper but it doesn't I don't know how do I perform the actual tricks I don't know if I'm supposed to do something to this battery Rush delivery battery okay so we got some nice inor missions although it's a bit tricky that I still have no idea what the controls are actually like so okay apparently I failed that all right so I really would like to find my way back into the tutorial CU I have no idea what I missed okay so I really have no idea how am I supposed to perform any tricks so really no clue what just happened all right so yeah I think I'm just going to go back to the main menu and try to start a new game okay so let's see if now this time I don't miss where I'm supposed to go sound like went down there use rotar shift down here H okay perform tricks but I have no idea how am I supposed to perform tricks I pressed the left Mouse button and now I just lost okay I really have no idea what exactly I'm missing so am I supposed to go down there or not okay so I fell down here again okay I just picked up something again I have no idea what it is cu apparently I can't pick it up okay and I just fell down again so I'm going to quit again okay trying out again so let's see if now I can make okay go downhill yes I am going downhill now what perform tricks in the air to charge your end so I press okay so I finally figured it out that I was somehow pressing right bumper instead of left bumper okay so now I'm kind of getting the hang of it oh that's cool so I can destroy it oh and that's how you damage as well do I have health anywhere okay there it is 44 all right got to say it feels a bit strange how I have to hit them head on not sure how I'm supposed to die the bullets did I get them nope all right there you go oh are they respawning am I supposed to damage this no I guess not find destroy two rors I only got 6 hp so I hope it works okay oh god oh boy oh boy oh boy no no no no okay it seems I died I quite like the visuals I think in terms of visual style the game doesn't look quite nice and in terms of the movement mechanics it took me a bit to finally understand them but yep I do think the game plays quite well once you understand how it works although I still haven't quite figured out how exactly am I supposed to not take damage considering how they attack me like this cuz like I can only attack them if I go straight to them I guess I am supposed to just try to dodge them and then attack them I'm not sure where am I supposed to get some health all right cool but yeah the combat does feel nice the attacks feel nice and satisfying I assume that the faster I go the more it damages so hav figured out the the uh the tricks how do I do different tricks is it supposed to be random or is it supposed to have some kind of control because it seems like it doesn't matter which way I'm moving it always seems to do the same thing go one two three and I can hit it oh boy I'm already out of Health again woo let's go down oh boy I really like how inventive the robots are oh boy that's a big one all right nice the world does seem to be quite open quite variant quite vast so that's good I really like the fov everything looks pretty nice some random damage building here oh is that a healing station I could actually use that is it oh it is nice does it have a map nope I think the only issue is since the game is all movement Pace it seems to have way too many flat planes so like over here there's not much where I can have fun and go fast it's all way too flat so I'm not sure like I want to go in that direction it seems like I got to go through a super slow speed maybe the Boost effect maybe that one should reload naturally cuz like this yeah so do I slide down there in order to go in there I'm not sure sure okay so is this where I'm supposed to come I think I was in the middle of making some Mission oh so I got to get the other things let try to get these guys boom I get him oh God almost nothing nice okay I got to go there okay how do I go there but in terms of environment I quite like this world everything looks really nice lots of apocalyptic vegetation stuff like that looks really again how do I get there NOP not here battery Rush challenge nope okay I assume I have to go through here now what oh God okay so I have no idea if I'm even going in the right direction or not I have no idea how I'm supposed to get there okay so I've been playing for about 40 minutes so here's my thoughts basically in terms of the world in terms of the creation of the world itself the visuals everything looks really good I really like it in terms of the movement mechanics they take a little while to understand but after I do it seems to work quite well so that's quite good however in terms of world traversal well it's really great that the world is really big it also makes it really boring how there are so few Hills so there's like very few opportunities for me to actually get any speed and it's very easy to lose the speed then on the tutorial I was also completely confused as to what buttons to click that's definitely my fault since I haven't used a controller in quite some time so I was confusing left bumper with right bumper but still it would be nice to have some extra buttons explaining which one should I be using and in terms of guidance on the world while the world is great it's very huge very varied looks great I really think it should have some actual proper guided waypoints in the middle of the world so that I know where I need to go and I don't know if I'm missing something but I can't actually get to this Waypoint so that's a bit strange so in general looks pretty nice plays pretty nice just needs quite a bit more guidance for the player looking at the store Page the capsule is a bit OD I like the art I do think the art looks good but it doesn't make it super clear that this is some kind of hoverboard and the overrider over there it's a bit hard to read so in general I like the colors but I think it could have a bit better composition to make it a bit more clear what the game is actually about I think it should make it absolutely clear that you play as a hoverboard that is something pretty unique that very few games have so I think that should be one of the main selling points description is great talks about what you do so take on a highspeed hoverboarding Adventure make tricks craft gadgets and so on so I do think that's good screenshots also pretty good they're also quite varied they show quite a lot of the game quite a lot of the world so those are really nice over here having a gift for add to wish list that is really good that is really nice and gifts over here on the entire description really great work so if you like some fast Bas hoverboarding on a nice huge open world with lots of movement action lots of things then go ahead and add this one to your wish list okay so next up we have le with a strange character over there on the a that is always an interesting choice going for weird characters it's always interesting to see how various store Pages handle things like that for example Steam on the actual URL does actually include that a so create your own medieval Kingdom and watch your world come to life in this minimalistic city bunder choose your world size and shape and turn it into a kingdom any ruler would be jealous of sounds interesting so let's see okay welcome to the Le demo find controls by pressing the question mark in the top left and enjoy unlock new tiles by finishing builds and exploring fun and weird ways to build your kingdom okay so this one doesn't even have a main menu just go straight into the game so for a game like this that's great just get started right away let you see the controls so wnd in order to move the camera seems to move a bit slow but okay that works Tab and shift to rotate okay that's good nice and satisfying I really like the sound effect okay great then click to build right click to destroy duplicate change roof colors well that's an interesting feature rotate the building and switch a building okay so this looks like some kind of gate thing so let's put it over here okay what am I selecting okay I'm selecting a house now so let's put a house over there let's put a little Tower there another gate how do I rotate with the r oh and I can switch oh okay so am I supposed to switch buildings automatically or not how do I okay tab to rotate I put some trees some little things there another thing okay so I got a little entrance and behind I've got my nice little kingdom finish build Ah that's a nice animation okay so I've got a large Tower it's a tower but large with a tall pointy roof and a bridge bridge on water and a wallgate I got to say the animations for the text I really like it and all the satisfying sound effect those all sound really good oh so now I restart instead of basically continuing to build on this one okay so let's restart that one okay so now I got a big tower let's put a big tower over here on the corner let's put a thing over there I have no idea what that is some kind of wall with a strange hole okay and put some more things and some more walls and another Tower here and maybe another Tower there can I remove this one I want to put a a little tent in the middle it's actually quite a bit tricky okay there you go tent in the middle and another wall over here okay so this one should be a wall Corner some kind of thing oh I can't find the wall corner is that intended yeah I can't find on this one either oh so are the parts limited cuz I can't find a wall Corner okay so let's put just some trees over here and on the other side also some trees right there you go there's my super cute little tiny thing with two towers okay let's go finish building again the sound effects sound really nice so apparently that did not give me anything so let's see what am I actually supposed to be doing okay and goes to a steam guide I have to say I'm not sure how many players actually enjoy going into an external guide so I would say putting this inside the game is probably for the best so tals are unlock by getting ingame achievements okay so that's actually pretty nice making achievements gives you more tals that's a a nice simple way to do it oh and I can change the tile of the world all right so that's good I actually prefer a bigger world so let's go with five and again if if it is related to achievements would be nice to be able to see the achievements directly in game what is square do oh it makes it square or Circle okay that's good so I can build a bunch more things all right let's put a big one going I put another big one no some trees over there okay a bunch of trees I have no idea what that is supposed to be all right it's a little bit strange how everything is so pixeling but then over here the shadow is like super high resolution compared to the rest so that's a bit of a a strange visual thing but okay so I can place more trees more camps more things so just fill in the whole world with trees and camps what about walls we continue making some walls over here okay I'm definitely not someone who is good at visual things as you can tell it's definitely not the most appealing uh little castle I I have no idea what that is that meant to be like a tiny gate is that it okay that's my nice Castle put a couple more Towers okay lots of trees lots of things behind and basically the bad guys come in front something like that all right so I think that's a that okay apparently that did not make me an achievement so my suggestion would be in the beginning in the first few playthroughs definitely give the player at least something so I got a few new buildings on the first world but then the second and the third I got nothing so it would be nice to have something that guarantees the player always gets a little bit of something or at least maybe some kind of indicator over here talking about the next easiest achievements I think that's the main thing I think the goal with the achievements that is a good idea but it really needs to be shown in game rather than having to go into the Steam Workshop to see that okay so apparently even on the overlay I can't see the achievements so that's odd okay so it appears the game doesn't actually have achievements yet or does it only have these ones okay so let me try to make a five world complete okay make a five world like this and just complete it on everything okay try to make just some massive walls and everything try to finish it did I miss one oh crap I think I missed one okay let me try it again just place a mountain of walls all right okay so that worked a w with stairs easier to access than any of the other ones Cavalry so those are supposed to be horses that kind of looks like a trevet okay so there are a bunch more achievements place a rock on a one toown world although suddenly I have no idea which one is wrong is this A rock on a one town world this is the Cavalry this is some wall okay is this supposed to be Rock I guess it would be nice to have some kind of text saying Which object do I have selected so let's see if this one is a rock nope apparently not not okay maybe I just don't have the rock place a house on a one tile World okay is this the house let's see okay let's see this one a three town world with no Castle objects so a three town world no Castle objects so I have no idea what that is does cly count as a castle object well let's put just some okay does that work all right got some water nice there's a timer counting down demo time I have no idea what happens when that one gets down to zero okay so let's see this one have more Cavalry than houses so on the three town world let's see which one was Cavalry I don't have Cavalry okay so that's a bit strange I still haven't figured out what is the logic behind which blocks do I have available okay so my thoughts the idea is definitely interesting the music is definitely quite chill so I quite like that it does visually look like one of those relaxing games so I think visually in terms of Music everything works quite great the concept of going for the achievements I also like that I think that is pretty good it reminds me of a flash game that I used to love called Achievement Hunter was that the name I think so where you just made thousands of achievements that was a really awesome game so I think this could have a similar satisfying feeling to that one the only thing it needs is obviously some list of achievements directly inside the game as opposed to being on a external guide and also would be nice to be able to see the name of the things that I'm placing and maybe just say a suggestion of what is the next easy achievement that I could achieve but in terms of going for a minimalist super simple relaxing City Builder yep it does seem to be on the right track looking at the store Page I have to say this background works really well in game but over here it looks way too minimalistic I would say overly minimalistic to the point where it looks slow quality even though in the game it actually makes sense it actually works out but over here on the store Page it makes it look a bit worse so maybe the game could feature on like two modes have one mode where the background is kind of like this void where it's just a gradient and have another one where it's an actual physical background I think that would help at least make the screenshots look a bit more inviting same thing for the capsule I do think the title I do think that is really good Andy Castle on the side also looks pretty nice again it's really just a background that seems overly basic the short description is nice short and to the point down here yep we've got some gifts so that's great make your kingdom as small or as big so that's nice I would actually make this first gift start off as just a 1 by one world then expand to an 11 by1 world I think that would be a bit more visually unique and it really well written over here we've got various B points and apparently one of them is frog so I have no idea what that means but okay so you feel like a chill relaxing minimalist City builder then go ahead and add this one to your wish list all right so the first game we're going to look at is called utter takedown so this one is a top down technical stealth game set in the 2000s you have been a Hitman for a long time but after you stopped working with the local Mafia it decided to kidnap your family to get rid of you now your goal is to make the other Mafia take it out let's try out the demo and then I'll analyze the seam store Page all right so first thing is on the main menu there's a really nice wish list on seam button this is always something to have so that's great Discord is also great if you can manage that community and I also like the road map showing all the kinds of things that are coming up in the final release the buttons they do have some sound effects so that's good but they are super basic buttons they have no impact whatsoever so I would recommend adding some Polish to the buttons so they pop up in some way or at least change in a much more visually significant manner so it could be as simple as just making the text turn black and the background turn white then I'll the logo over here it looks super pixelated which I'm guessing means just forgot to add the MIP Maps if you just enable MIP maps and this should look quite a bit better okay so let's try out the tutorial okay that's a great transition I really like that one video tutorials always a great thing I always enjoy that so let's see okay so w to move all right okay I really like the sound area there's somebody asleep so right away it makes me test if I move closer does anything happen oh okay so I kind of expect there to wake up apparently I can interact so I don't know but anyway great use of the custom cursors this is something that actually not many games use but it's something that always makes your game feel quite a bit more polished if you have a custom cursor as opposed to the default one okay so anyways let's try following the goal so you can run faster with shift and as you run there's more noise okay great I have to say the running doesn't seem like it's much of a difference definitely doesn't seem quite as impactful I would say to make it more impactful to make it run quite a bit faster but then again that would break balance so I don't know if that was a delivered choice but it does look a little bit way too sluggish I would say but let's see if it works with everything else apparently we can interact with some objects all right so apparently it's right click okay so I can pick up a knife and I can pick up okay it would be nice to have a little tool tip to know what this is I assume that's a taser maybe the tutorial will talk about it in the future okay yep pick up items with right Mouse button you should be close enough okay so that's great interacting with other objects just left Mouse button all right you can change the camera angle and open doors with this technique okay so we can open doors by modifying the camera all right that's interesting how exactly do I open doors with that okay that's a bit all right so apparently the camera has a bit of a strange Behavior it looks like it's intentional to not do a 180 so as I press Q it rotates this area now I press Q again and I would expect to rotate the other way but apparently goes back here so that's a little bit confusing but okay I guess I can get used to it okay let's open up doors okay yeah the camera rotation is definitely quite a bit tricky I'm doing 180s when that is not my intention okay no like this yeah all right being able to interact with all that's great in a game like this being able to add these kind of tiny interactions these are always right so I'd recommend also adding an interaction over here with the sinks that would be fun the more interactions you had the more it makes your game feel much more living so that's always great okay so I see a bad guy there and there's no view cone so I'm going to have to guess as to how much can you actually see but I'm also going to have to guess how I'm going to attack him I still haven't figured out how I can use the taser weapon oh boy there's another one okay apparently can't see me all the way back here so for a stealth game I would appreciate if it was easier to be able to see the view cones is this okay no this just shows the interactable objects all right so yeah for attacking I still know do I left click do I right click and that is going to be a bit stressful since this is a stealth game so usually what you want to do in a tutorial like this one is you want it to be able to have the first attack Beyond some kind of dummy some kind of that does not attack you back so I would suggest adding that kind of thing to the tutorial make the first one something that you pretty much cannot fail over here I'm pretty much going to have to approach him and then try to guess let's try to go here go nice and easy approach him and I still don't see any icon but if I CLI okay left click works all right that was good that was nice animation I like the particle effect that was nice the blood pulling in the floor also really nice and I can Corp bag oh wait corpse bag oh okay I can pick it up and I can drop it anywhere all right okay that's that's good I like it now there was another guy down here oh boy okay all right that was a bit way too fast but all right and apparently we go back into way the beginning I would definitely recommend adding some checkpoints but anyways now I know what I need to do so let me just quickly go through all of these so I got to pick it up again yep okay let me open oh boy the camera is really tricky like when I'm over here I assume that pressing e is going to rotate this way but as I do it apparently rotates the other way so that is really confusing but okay oh I didn't even see there was another door here oh so you can actually see the conate all right so it seems that me going through the left door that wasn't actually intentional so yeah I definitely say tutoral should force me down here instead of to the other one this shows how to kill the enemy how to see the viewon in the state and see visual hints for the active item okay visual instructions for the active item oh okay so we chose the range oh and you can also throw things although I still haven't figured out how to use different weapons but okay so I go here and I can apparently walk all over cuz she's not going to wake up oh Control Plus move Mouse use the free look oh okay so that's good I like it being able to see further that's nice can I go outside I can't okay if I use the X in order to be able to see the range of things all right and if I middle Mouse click I can see the viewcon okay so that's good all right right so I got to take out this guy down here and that one up there I still haven't figured out how to use different weapons that's a bit odd all right got that one oh there's only one left a all right got to do it again okay this definitely does need some checkpoints but okay I got to go through all of these every single time go through all the hints that's quite a bit annoying another thing I would suggest is on the camera over here it seems like it only rotates 90° but in order to hit the the door like this it is really difficult and like this I don't like it I like the other view so I would basically like it to have a 45 degree camera that way I could open all the doors and all these vertical uh walls without having to constantly rotate the camera that would be nice a okay let's try this again for about the sixth time oh God going to run away can I run away uhoh okay I got to say the controls are a bit strange the camera oh why can't I kill him what what is going on okay that's a bit why okay all right that was quite frustrating oh why can't I kill him okay cuz this swapped weapons again and I don't know why okay I have no idea why this just swapped my weapon but but there's nothing that I can I'm trying to click every button okay so it's the numbers apparently all right that was quite stressful quite annoying so I assume that's what happened a while ago all right that definitely needs that took me way too long to figure out definitely needs at least like some icons of some numbers over there anyways okay so let's see if I can finally do this all right that was good that one is apparently just one shot but okay good to know a crap the door again all right finally oh boy I gotta say that was way too difficult I don't know maybe I just suck but yeah I think that took me about 10 tries so I would say your tutorial level definitely shouldn't require 10 tries 10 fails so that definitely felt way too punishing usually for the first tutorial you really want a super easy challenge so that is why I would recommend adding some kind of dummies just to teach how you actually use the items use the things and definitely not include so many enemies right off the bat on the very first tutal again maybe I just suck at the game but that was definitely my experience and just a quick thing over here challenges there's a small typo okay second level your goal is to steal valuable papers from the head of this small drug Farm do not kill the head okay that's going to be interesting careful this level is hard oh boy even harder than the first one okay that's going to be tricky let's use a civilian AI which can notice you always look before you go all right so that's good all right so now we've got NPCs I know what this plus icon is on top okay that's kind of interesting why did it not see me I mean I like it but yeah that's nice is she not supposed to see me okay so so it's not a problem if she sees me oh it just takes a while for her to wake up there's going to be that guy coming after me so can I take him out all right oh go back back back back back quickly quickly all right got both of them there's another one son of no idea who is is that the guy that I can't kill okay there way so far so good I just took out three guys that's nice we got a nice taser I think I would really prefer if the camera zoom if that snap back to the character because this is so strange right now I have no idea oh doesn't even have a limit is that intentional I assume that's not intentional am I supposed to be able to see that far away either way I really think that it should snap back cuz like this this now it's really tricky interactive tools so there's a cup what can I do with a cup I can pick it up and yeah I guess I can oh it makes noise that's nice once again the whole thing why can't I interact through the wall the camera is really very tricky a okay that was definitely not intended I clicked on the UI and it threw the cup that is not what I wanted okay okay let me try and I throw in there a didn't get him so I guess it would be nice to be able to see the audio range so let me pick try to throw over there okay so that's the maximum all right there they go I'm going to try to jump in and I was spotted he going to kill me oh boy okay it doesn't see me nice that guy doesn't see me either let's see if I can now go in oh right because I can't kill him so this actually a bad spot ah this is locked okay I did not expect that so is this guy supposed to be the B oh no that's a boss ah all right so I think that's going to be it for the game maybe just me but it seems a bit way too difficult way too punishing I definitely add some points I would also look at games like for example Asos 3 to see what they do like for example whenever you get caught whenever you get inside the field of view cone for one of the enemies time slows down you actually have an option to do something whereas over here you just die in one hit so the whole thing becomes really frustrating the camera is also quite a bit frustrating the way that it only rotates in One Direction then does a strange 180 the way that I cannot pick up things through the walls and the way that the Feld of view seems to be higher above ground so it's not exactly perfect as to to where exactly the character is so the game definitely requires some Polish a bunch of changes but all in all I like the general game idea I'm a big fan of stth action game so yep I would say this is a great starting point so keep at it looking at the store Page I do think the store Page is set up pretty nicely so the capsule over here capsule is extremely important I do think this is a nice looking capsule although it makes it seem a bit more like some kind of gang war as opposed to stealth Action so it looks good but might not be 100% accurate to what the game is for the short description usually you want want this to be more from the point of view of the player so like what is the player actually going to do in the game as opposed to pretty much just pointing out some lore some lore and Sor that's always fun but the player usually quickly wants to know what exactly do they do in the game and for that these screenshots I actually do think they are very good they are pretty very they show various scenarios and they show the UI showing how the game actually works so it makes it clear how it's a top down stealth thing the only thing is over here on the big description I always encourage you to put up some animated gifts those always make things look quite a bit better and again same thing instead of writing this from the point of view of more about the game or what features the game has try to write from the point of view of the actual player what does the player actually do in your game so instead of the game features a diverse range of maps instead of that maybe something like play through 10 different maps all of them with unique abilities and meet interesting characters something like that in general you really want to write your description from the point of view of the player as opposed to what does the game actually contain so if you like some top down sell action then go ahead and add this into your wish list okay okay so that's five games that you made thanks so much for submitting them I wish you all the best of luck with your full release I hope it helped you to hear my feedback and see how I play the games I know that as a developer myself it was extremely useful to watch people play my own game it helped me improve lots of things that I never thought about simply because different people play games differently so I hope that this video helps you in the same way check out the website page to see all the other games that I didn't have time to play and if you enjoy this format go ahead hit the like button and subscribe if people enjoy this and I'll keep doing it every time there's new seam Festival all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
