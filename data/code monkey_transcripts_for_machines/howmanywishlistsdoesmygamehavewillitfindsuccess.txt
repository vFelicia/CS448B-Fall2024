hello and welcome I'm your code monkey 1290. that's a number that's how many wishlists the game has right now so those are the hard numbers now let's interpret that is that number good or mad am I happy or unhappy in my announcement video I talked about lots of stats and in the end after doing some math based on common numbers I reached a nice optimistic goal of 10 000 wish lists in order to sell about a thousand copies and call the game of success So based on that things aren't necessarily going too well however I'm not too worried about it it does seem like I might hit the lower 5K wishlist gone which might still be enough to call the game of success so even though I obviously wish these numbers were a bit better I'm not too down on it here is the phone wishlist graph the first big spike this one is obviously when I made the announcement video then I have since made three more videos only to the game I made one where I talked about how I faked the multiplayer to record the game trailer then the first level covering a bit of progress and finally the big devlog video which actually did pretty well because it was my first video experimenting with a camera you can see the total graph which lists appear going up slowly but steadily each of those videos got about 10 to 15 000 views so potentially about 10 percent of viewers are interested in the game now in this case I have no idea if that's good or bad this is actually the first game that I'm releasing since this channel has a decent size my last release was Battle Royale Tycoon all the way back in 2019 and back then the videos on this channel only got some like a thousand views so I really have no idea if 10 of viewers interested in the game is good or bad since I have nothing to compare it to although it is interesting to note how my total one Liberation game that one which I had delayed for next year that one definitely got a ton more wishlists right as soon as I announce it by now that one is actually already past the 5K Mark which is really nice so it seems like that idea might be a bit more appealing to people which is great news for that project when I finally get back to it next year it should do well thanks to a nice amount of wishlist but anyways right now the focus is on dinky Guardians the current big deadline is the ECM Festival which is starting on the 19th I'm trying to work as hard as I can to get a great demo done for the festival if I can successfully build the demo that I have in my head then I believe the festival won't be a success and I believe I've seen some stats on how the highend for festivals is something like 10 000 wish lists so I feel that if the game is good enough fine maybe I won't get let's say roughly about a thousand and then if the game gets a thousand wishlist in the festival then I believe it could get between two to three thousand until the release at the end of July which would mean the game on launch with about 5000 wish lists which would be a decent amount again like I mentioned in the announcement video it's very much up to you to Define what success means to you and to me for this game just publishing another game is one part of what I consider success another part is I'm learning how to make these devlogs and getting better at learning how to combine editing with some cameras some background footage that's something that I'm in the process of learning with these videos and so far I've called that a personal success and lastly of course success is selling a decent number of copies thankfully since I'm leaving a low costlying country and the dev time for this game is actually pretty short I don't actually need to sell tens of thousands of copies to break even if I end up hitting my wishlist goal I should be able to say the sales numbers and call this game a success So based on that one I do wish the number of wishlists were a bit better I'm still happy and the journey is progressing nicely the numbers are actually pretty decent and the game itself especially coming along quite nicely I would actually say it's coming along better than nicely this past week when I was working on adding multiplayer it was a bit tricky but I did get it done then I also spent a bunch of time thinking about design which by the way all of your answers to my design questions were super hit on phone so thanks so much for that your comments really got me thinking in all kinds of interesting mechanics stay tuned for Devon welcoming soon where I will talk about the process for adding multiplayer and what I hope to work on this week before the festival I've already uploaded the initial build for review so hopefully I should be able to get it all done in time and I'm also enjoying this journey of trying out this new format and bringing you along for Journey with these devlogs I hope that watching this Series has been interesting to you my advice to you on this topic is actually something that I've already mentioned many times wishlists are extremely important in team nowadays so get your steam page up and running as quickly as you can pretty much as soon as you have decided upon the core game idea and you have some visuals to show get that done and publish the coming soon page as soon as you can so you can start Gathering wishlists the longer you have that page visible the more wishlist you'll be able to gather so actually what I'm doing here making a game in a few months this one isn't technically the best option for finding massive success but again like I said it's up to you to Define what success means to you in my case my primary definition of success simply launching this game this year and if you're just starting out then simply publishing a game can be considered a massive success alright I hope this video was informative go ahead and add dinky Gardens here wishlist if you haven't already I'm really hoping to hit the 5K going before the final release thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
