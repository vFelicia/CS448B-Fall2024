hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this is a pretty quick video just highlighting some changes with visual scripting in unity 2021 as you might know visual scripting in unity is actually based on bolt which was a thirdparty tool that unity bought so if you're using unity 2019 or 2020 then you use visual scripting through the bone package however if you're using unity 2021 then visual scripting is now built directly into the engine so there's no extra packages you need to install there's only a handful of minor changes so if you're searching for bond tutorials all of those should still work in unity 2021 just with a few minor tweaks speaking of that i made a complete visual scripting course going from start to finish everything i teach in the course is still up to date you just need a few minor changes if you want to follow it with unity 2021 the course teaches you everything about visual scripting through the making of three complete games starting off with a simple platformer game then moving on to a more complex action rpg with tons of features like multiple weapons enemies dungeons shops skills and so on and finally the last game is a really awesome fps that teaches you how to use visual scripting in 3d with tons of weapons a really nice hook shot ability and an awesome boss fight check out the complete course with the link in the description so let's see those minor changes the first one is like i mentioned how you install it in unity 2019 or 2020 you go into the asset store and grab the bump package then you open up the packaging package manager and import it and then pops out the bolt setup wizard okay so that's the install process for unt 2019 or 2020. for unity 2020 it's instead installed as a builtin package so you go into the package manager and appear select the unity registry and simply scroll down and find the visual scripting package now in unity 2020 you have a quick setup wizard menu whereas on unt 2021 this does not exist so over here you just go ahead and click on next and then here it asks you a really interesting question so do you want some human naming or programmer naming so this has to do with what text shows up on the nodes and this one is also different in unity 2021 in the new version you no longer have the option the only one you get is human name so continuing the unity 2020 wizard over here you see some assembly options this is for more advanced use cases where you want to unload some external libraries so in most cases just leave everything on default and head on next then you've got a list of types again for more advanced use case where you want to add your own custom types as nodes so again in the beginning just click on generate all right so after a bit everything is generated and we have bolt fully installed and ready to be used in our unity 2010 project now these last two things that we saw the assemblies and types on ent 2021 they are instead on the project settings so you go up here into edit then down into project settings and then here on the left select the visual scripting tab and up here you've got both instead of assemblies they are simply called the node library so you can expand and you see all the various assemblies so this is where you would add things like for example if you wanted to use cinemachine you would add that assembling here and same thing for the types are up here the tab options you can add all the types that you want so in unity version 2021 these are on the project settings so you would do all those changes and then regenerate on the units okay back into unity 2020 now when you start actually using it in order to make our visual script you go into add component and again this is a small difference between unt 2020 and 2021 in 2020 you go under bolt and then you add a flow machine whereas over here in unity 2021 instead when you add the component you go down here under visual scripting and then you add a script machine so where previously you had a flow machine right now you've got a script machine this is just a name change but they are the exact same thing then in order to create a graph in version 2020 they are called macros or flow macros whereas in version 2021 they are simply called graphs but again just a name change they're all the exact same thing so you just click on new and it creates the visual script so here in unity 2020 as you double click on the flow macro it opens up the flow graph window and in version 2021 when you open it the first time you do it's actually going to handle a bunch of processing and then it opens up the same graph window now there is a slight visual change but again everything still works exactly the same now another difference is over here in unity 2020 you have two other visual scripting windows as separate windows so you go up here into window and you separately open up the graph inspector and the other one is the variables so these are two separate windows so for example you can dock them anywhere so dock them down there and there you go you've got these separate windows also still in unity 2020 you have the graph window and right now it looks like this and if you maximize it it automatically opens up the graph window and the variable inspector however it will only automatically show these two tabs if the monitor resolution is big enough so they only show up after a certain size so if you have a small monitor resolution they might not automatically show up so if they don't then you need to manually use the dot separate windows so if i play around with the size of my ent window if it's big like this shows up those two and if i make it quite a bit smaller if there you go those disappear whereas over here on unity 2021 first of all there are no separate windows so if you go into window you do not see the graph inspector or the graph variables so the only window you have is just the graph window and this one always shows the graph inspector and the variables window all the time so regardless of resolution regardless of the size of this window no matter how big or small you make it it will always show those then there's also a few small changes on the nodes themselves so for example in unity 2020 you can add a branch node so this one takes a condition and runs something if it's true and something else if it's false whereas over here on unity 2021 instead of being named branch it is named an if so again the same thing boolean with a true and a fonts but now instead of a branch it's named an if so again the functionality is only exactly the same it's just a name change another node difference is over here on unity 2020 you have what's called the soft node so this one represents the current game object whereas in version 2021 this is instead called the this node so again they represent the same thing this one is still this same game object so previously named itself and now it's this then another difference is when you add the component you make it a state machine so this one again so these ones are still named the same they're both named the state machine the main difference is again this one is called the state macro whereas this one is a state graph and as you create the state graph the graph window is just the same so in 2020 and 2021 they all look exactly the same now another difference is when working with division scripting through c sharp and the differences are on the namespaces so over here on unity 2020 you add using bolt that's what you add whereas in version 2021 you are using unity dot visual scripting another change is also the new 2021 visual scripting also has some better builtin support for the new input system okay so those are the main changes as you can see they're all preminers so every tutorial that you can find that was made using bond you can very easily get it working with the 2021 visual scripting version if you want to learn more about visual scripting check out my complete course where you'll learn how to make three complete games starting off with a simple platformer game then moving on to a more complex action rpg with tons of features like multiple weapons enemies dungeons shops skills and so on and finally the unless game which is a really awesome fps that teaches you how to use visual scripting in 3d with tons of weapons a really nice hook shot ability and a really awesome boss fight check out the phone course with the link in the description alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
