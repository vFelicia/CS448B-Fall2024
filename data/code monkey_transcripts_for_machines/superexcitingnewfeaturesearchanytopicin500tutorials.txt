hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and i finally added a super useful feature on the website that i've been meaning to get done for a long time so the website now has a search bar this is a small thing but it's actually quite useful we are now entering into may of 22 and i started this channel four years ago in may of 2018 the first video tutorial on the channel was the health system video published on the 15th of may of 2018 my presentation back then was definitely pretty bad but the code is solid in fact just two months ago i actually made my second free asset which is a really robust health system where the core of it is based on that very first video which in turn is also based on the health system that i've used in pretty much all of my steam games going all the way back to survivor squad in 2013. so anyways in these four years i've made over 500 videos on this channel tons of tutorials on all kinds of topics and most of them are stepbystep tutorials since that has always been my main focus on the channel basically my goal when i started was sharing the knowledge that i've accumulated in this past 10 years of working with unity and making several indie games published on steam so i've made tons of tutorials on tons of topics however the way that youtube works is it mostly only promotes recent videos so if you just found the channel recently then chances are there's lots of videos that i've already made that could be super useful to you but you might not ever see them at the same time i've also got tons of topics that i've yet to cover so i prioritize covering new topics rather than remaking old videos for example i already made a pretty robust topdown 2d character controller two years ago i made a video on my fourstep process for solving nonreference exceptions i've covered the basics of converting between 2d and 3d i covered all about csharp interfaces generics and events so all those videos which contain tons of useful information they already exist so i'm not planning on covering those topics again anytime soon and that's where this search bar comes in it's right here on the main page and you can just search for anything like for example c sharp and over here you can see tons of csharp related videos that i've already done so there's one for quickly learning the basics how to fix nonreference exception what are interfaces delegates generics loops events and so on tons of stuff or perhaps you want to search for some editor tools so search for editor there you go how to create custom editors then a specific use case for a more dynamic editor capturing mouse clicks and so on how to show private variables in the inspector or a custom class have multiple inspectors and so on on the main page i also added these quick buttons for a bunch of quick searches for some interesting topics like for example over here all the videos that i've made on the grid system so tons of stuff then a whole bunch of videos on marketing covering lots of interesting things then a bunch of shader videos and a ton of videos related to my latest game battleground tycoon so as you can see tons of videos on tons of topics that i've already made previously and if you're new here chances are there's some that i've made that could be super useful to you but since they were made quite a long time ago youtube won't show them to you automatically i normally tag my videos with some relevant keywords when i upload them to the website so searching over here might be better than using youtube search and also since i'm talking about the website another website update that i made quite a while ago but maybe you don't know about if you log in and you go into your user page over here you can see tons of options these are email notifications so if you don't like being dependent on the youtube algorithm recommending videos then you can just toggle any of these options and you'll get one of these automated emails there's also over here links to see examples of these emails for example the monthly email contains some tags on what happened that month along with any current news and events and a few video highlights then the weekly email is a simple list of all the videos for that week the new video email is exactly what it sounds like just a simple email as soon as the video is live then announcements basically whenever i have a new course or new asset or a new game or anything i send one of these out then the live stream you can get an email a few minutes before i go live my live streams don't really have any set schedule i do them whenever i have something to do that would fit on a live stream and finally the asset sales so whenever an interesting sale happens sometimes i don't make a full video on it but i might send one of these emails so that's just a nice simple feature on the website i made it since i was watching so many comments from people who didn't get notified of new videos so if you don't want to be dependent on the youtube algorithm then i would suggest you enable at least over here the monthly newsletter so you get a nice email once per month and also the weekly one just in case youtube doesn't recommend a certain video so you can quickly see everything that came out that week then the other ones if you want just take them all and hit on save preferences and also since i'm on this page there's over here the character customization you can change the skin color the hair color the hair the beard the body and so on or you can even download the base texture then over here you can draw on top of all these places and then you can import your own custom texture and then your character will show up just like this on the live stream i definitely would like to do some more live streams it's always fun to do some work live and answer all your questions although i haven't done one in about two months the reason for that is simply because i'm hard at work at my turnbased strategy course and if you're interested in that there's also a link where you can sign up if you want to be notified when the course is out i've got the course fully written and i'm starting to record it so hopefully it should be done by around mid to late may alright so that's it just a quick video showcasing a nice new feature on the website and some other ones if you're a recent viewer of the channel check out that search bar chances are you might find some older videos that i've done that would be super useful to you right now alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
