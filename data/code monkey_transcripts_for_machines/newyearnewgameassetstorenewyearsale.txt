super fast pathfinding and this is what i found it's fully multithreaded so it has almost no impact on performance works on all types of grids both in 2d and 3d support elevation and tons more so this is the asset that allowed me to make my very first steam game and maybe it will help you too then make some fascinatingly weird worlds with this tool contains a bunch of shader effects to make your game look really unique you can flip the world around you like an inception or make a really nice curved world like animal crossing so it's a really gorgeous really good looking effect if you need

some user customization onto your games features automatic saving and loading so you can continue from wearing left off modify your brushes and mask your paint area works both in the editor and in game and supports all of the render pipelines then make your game run a lot faster with imposters just one click and you turn any 3d mesh with thousands of polygons into a simple flat sprite while visually looking exactly the same recently a lot of people have been playing cyberpunk 2077 and there have been some viral videos where people have noticed that the cars in the distance are rendered as flat sprites this is exactly that technique it allows you to populate your worlds with massive amounts of detail while remaining at a high frame rate the amplify shader editor is also a great tool
