hi there this is a quick tip for how to draw debug lines so as you build in your game you won't likely use debug log quite a lot it's very useful to show a message of something that's happening however in some cases it might be more useful to visually see something in the game instead of just looking at the console so for that you can use debug dot draw a line this lets you draw a line between two points so for example so for example this won't draw on line from 0 0 to 30 50 painted in white and it won't be visible for a hundred seconds now first of all when you run the code you can see that nothing is actually visible that is because in order to see debug lines you need to go up here and enable gizmos and just like that there's our line it's going from zero zero to fifty fifty and don't vanish after a hundred seconds and yep the line is now gone okay great in here if you don't set any duration it will only be visible for one frame so that is very useful when using on an update so let's make a pearloid update so without any duration it will only be visible for one frame but since it's an update the next frame it won't draw again and so on and so on so with this we should be able to see a line being drawn from zero towards the mouse position and being visible every frame so let's see and yep there's the line as you can see it is constantly pointing towards the mouse one situation where this is very useful is for example to debug pathfinding so for example let's say you have a pet filing system which returns an array of vector threes containing the path that your unit won't follow and then second through the home path drawing lines so you can visually see where your unit Moore phone so for example just like that you would be able to see which path your unit would phone another great uses if you have some sort of quadrant system and you can use essentially draw four lines to be able to draw a square so just like that we have a simple function doing a drop wasn't it simply draws all four sides of a square and we run it on update and just like that we have a nice visual representation of a grid in our map and again we can just disable gizmos and everything looks perform and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
