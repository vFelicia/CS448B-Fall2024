hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and I just got back from United 22 in Montreal it was great fun lots of interesting talks and it's always great to meet up with other ENT creators and enti devs and actually just before I get to the main part of this video there was a little tidbit of information that I picked up at unite which explains quite a lot about Unity communication or like thereof these past few years there was the issue with iron Source where some misinformation spread like wildfire and there was no efficient clarification from Unity dots was constantly talked about and then suddenly nothing and a bunch more things where people felt Unity just was not communicating enough Well turns out there's actually a very good reason for that as you might know Unity went public a few years ago and when a company goes public there are tons of disclosures that have to be found and especially with regards to a merger agreement like with iron Source while the merger is pending they are extremely limited on what they can say publicly so apparently that caused a lot of UNT employees to be really scared about saying anything in public and potentially getting into trouble once I heard that everything suddenly became much more clear with that in mind the lack of communication definitely makes more sense nowadays everyone is a bit more clear on the rules on what they can and cannot say so they definitely have improved in terms of communication recently they've been doing games focused blog posts communicating lots of things they've done there's also the devmolites where a team from Unity answers every question they get dots getting some more communication with some specific timelines and so on so that's a pretty important piece of information that I learned at unite which really helps understand some things that I haven't in the past few years okay so unite 22 here are some of my highlights from the keynote the roadmap talk and the various other talks that I attended the main theme behind pretty much everything was essentially iterative Improvement based on user feedback from everything that I heard Unity is actively listening to feedback from every single source and acting upon it to make the engine better and better for everyone so starting off with the keynote it began with the usual bunch of stats they repeat these stats quite often that nowadays I barely pay attention but if you think about it these are truly massive and definitely worth celebrating Unity is used by 50 of all games including 70 of the top mobile games through all those games Unity reaches 3 billion players that's a mindboggling large number and in VR it also has a huge presence with 60 to 70 percent of top VR games being made with yendi when you think about it those numbers really are truly insane the keynote itself was split into three sections first the build section which covers everything Unity does to help you build your own games then scale which is how Unity helps you scale your game to reach millions of players with ease and finally Innovation which of course is my favorite section since the main thing about it is all about the exciting world of dots but before we get to that let's start from the beginning the build section starts off with one of the most important things about Unity how it's multiplatform you make the game just once and you can build it for dozens of platforms they are constantly adding more and more the most recent ones were Chrome OS and The Meta Quest Pro which just came out a few weeks ago for building your game you use one of the two render pipelines agrp if you want maximum visual Fidelity it continues getting updates making it look better and better and there's a bunch of gorgeous looking games that already showcase what ajrp can do and urp for running your game on anything while still making it look excellent like the recently released Marvel snap or Lego Builder's Journey they announced a pretty big update to the XR interaction token I haven't had time to touch VR development just yet but it's great to see this continuing to get more and more updates this song kit basically helps you create interactions that work on any VR or ar device so there's no need for tons of ifs to run logic depending on this device building your game also requires UI and for that UI tokit got another huge update this is a tool that I've made a bunch of research on but I haven't had the time to make a proper video tutorial just yet this tool helps you easily make editor tools if you've ever tried building tools with I am GUI then you know how much of a nightmare it is UI tonkit helps make that extremely easy and it has a benefit of working for both editor as well as for runtime UI so you can use the same tool for both although at the moment editor UI is already fully supported while runtime UI is supported but I believe it's not yet only production ready one of the main benefits of UI tonkit is the separation of concerns basically the way it works is you define the structure in one place then the style and another and then Electric in another all three of those things are nicely decoupled nicely separated which means you can greatly improve iteration speed you don't need to recompile code changes just to change the sound you swap out the style sheet and everything updates one nice benefit of that system is you could for example include multiple sounds in your game so perhaps in a multiplayer game with two teams you could very easily swap out the entire UI visual if playing on team a or Team B or you could just let the player choose from a bunch of UI Styles or a bunch more things separating the visuals from the structure and from the logic is a really interesting approach for building UI and it's especially useful if you're working on a team mixing programmers and designers another big update is how starting in unity 22.2 of the default TNT editor windows they're all now built using UI toolkit one big benefit of that is you can now easily include property drawers in your own custom editor since everything won't be using UI token coming in the future is also a new data binding system I must say this is the one part about UI toolkit that I filmed was needlessly complex so I'm definitely looking forward to improvements in this area then came one of the biggest announcements and it came pretty quickly there's a lot of people who are pretty frustrated with the render pipelines and how they are separate for me I don't really worry too much about it I just make my projects with urp and that's really it but still this is a pretty interesting announcement soon you will be able to have both urp and hbrp in the same project the main benefit of this would be if you have game releasing on both consoles and mobile you could use hdrp for the console build and then easily swap out everything for urp to make the mobile build another benefit would be if you start the game with urp then later on you decide that you want to use egrp you could then switch they're working on making everything more compatible making it easier to make shaders that work in both render pipelines so it's a pretty big deal that will hopefully make using and swapping around the pipelines much more of a painless process beyond that both render pipelines continue getting upgrades urp is getting foreign rendering which enables you to have tons of Lights instead of being limited to just ain't it also now has decal support and a bunch of rendering layers letting you place bullet holes and what's better throughout your home levels and a bunch more features as for ajrp they showcase an Agri sky looks really great and then you can also swap out for a physically based Sky moving direction of the light makes for some really gorgeous sunsets then on top of that you can add a bunch of cloud layers they are separated into multiple layers and you can play around the opacity for each one there is also a volumetric cloud system it's really gorgeous watching the clouds block the sunlight with some good looking gun rays and you can even animate it by turning a bright blue sky into dark and foggy then the water system which also looks excellent and the whole world is filled with tons of light probes for some gorgeous lighting an important thing is these are part of a tool called adaptive Pro volume which automatically places light proof 3 so there is no need to place them on by hand one by one without this if you're using egrp and building a realistic game then you can build something truly spectacular in just a handful of flex during this section one thing that I noticed in chat was lots of people questioning what is the performance in agrp I definitely want to give this a try to see just how performed it is so stay tuned for a quick video on that that makes up the build section after that was a scale section all about helping you build massive games with ease and excellent performance starting off with the X1 support being production ready in 22.2 the X12 has tons of benefits related to multithreading and doing very complex work in a much more efficient manner especially if your game is CPU bound you can expect up to 30 performance improvements that's really awesome for just toggling a simple switch this allows you to build massive games with huge worlds and tons of objects another part related to scaling your game is supporting it after launch that's where all of the ugs Tunes come in handy plus the SCM got a bunch of updates so working as a team is easier than ever before same thing for cloud build also improvements across the board and cloudcon delivery this is unt's content delivery Network or CDN which enables you to update a senior game without having to upload a brand new build I have a full detailed tutorial about how to use cloudcon delivery in my ultimate TNT overview course the system is based on addressables which I covered in detail in another video One recent example of the game using all of these tools is the recently released Marvel snap they made over 15 000 builds and pushed out tons of content updates some more useful ugs tools for scaling your game are remote config game overrides and analytics then let you do a b testing Define different sets and values that different players receive and you can then analyze the results again all of it from the ENT dashboard without ever having to upload a brand new build so you can see how all of these tools work together enabling you to iterate upon the game to make it the best it can be after that was the multiplayer section starting off with some very impressive stats more and more people are making multiplayer games and even more want to get certain just a few weeks ago they'll launched netcode for game objects which is their official multiplier solution I made one of my most detailed tutorials ever when it came out check it out if you want to learn how to make multiplayer games they mentioned their other multiplayer tools which I very much want to cover in future tutorials there's multiplay which is apparently now called Game Server hosting that's a server for creating and managing dedicated servers and Matchmaker which allows you to Define rules and match players with one another finally we get to the exciting Innovation section it's all about how Unity is innovating making tools that enable you to build any game you can imagine starting off of course with dots and something that I really like is how they turn off this section by highlighting V Rising which is an example of a game that you can already go playing and is already using dots so even though it's only hitting 1.0 production rate in a few months it has already proved itself in production V Rising use dots to handle massive object streaming there are hundreds of thousands of interactable objects this would be impossible to do without dots another example is Zenith it's a vrmo which means massive amount of players and objects of those players need to update their exp whenever they kill an enemy or do something updating that many game objects every second would be nearly impossible so that's where dots really helps then ixion which I'm not very familiar with but appears to be a SciFi City Builder on a massive scale simulating thousands of objects and finally detonation racing which is a mobile game that showcased a really awesome feature at GDC synths is all about determinism you can read back and replay sections of the game that makes iterating upon the game design an extremely easy process the big announcement is that version 1.0 is graduating from experimental into preview in preparation for a full release on the 22 LTS cycle and once again a very important thing is highlighting how you don't have to go full dots or phone game objects the answer is a hybrid workflow use game objects where they make sense and use entities where it makes sense I also noticed lots of excitement in chat when the dot section came up lots of people are definitely looking forward to it including myself I'm actually right now working on a mini tutorial just checking out the current state of dots then when 1.0 is finally fully released in 22 LTS that's when I'll really get busy making tons of dots tutorials so stay tuned for that then more invasion in visuals Unity picked up the weather tools and zip Dynamics they're currently hard work on making those work in real time and integrate them into the engine there's a really impressive hair package demo that you can go around and play with right now you can also download the digital human using the very impressive enemies demo that demo was originally made using some extremely highend 4D captures but now they've got it working with a Ziva puppet I have no idea how these are created but you have a bunch of Sliders you can play around to get pretty much any expression you can think of and somehow all of this works in just 15 megabytes so you could use this hyper realistic Ziva puppet for all of your NPCs which is pretty impressive they even showcase it running in real time on an Xbox series X the goal is to bring all of the super impressive tools that are used in super highend Hollywood movies and bring them to every single entity developer so that's an overview of the keynote lots of improvements in pretty much every area the other very important Tonk was the roadmap here they mentioned many things that were also mentioned in the keynote all the awesome things coming out in 22.2 which is coming out in the next few weeks as well as a few weeks for further in the future in unity 23. again starting off by emphasizing feedback and how everything they do is based on the feedback they get from users like me or you lots of performance improvements making everything just a bit faster Shader compilation replenishing prefabs addressables build report which now lets you see more details the package manager also now lets you customize cash location pretty great if you're unlimited for space and also package signing so you can verify that you're grabbing the rate package one nice one is a plan to simplify the input system workflows it's a great system I've covered it in full detail in another video although it does require quite a handful steps to get it set up at first so simplifying that does seem great they showcase the memory profiler really awesome tool tons of stats if you have memory issues with your game then this tune will help you very quickly pinpoint them the Shader graph also got a full screen effects node previously this was only possible through a very hacky way so having a proper way of doing it is great adaptive proof volume which I mentioned a while ago this is a tool for helping you position light probes automatically instead of having to do it manually one by one which is definitely a huge help it's already available in hdrp and is coming to urp and 23 Ray tracing is also coming out of preview in 23.1 so that's fun really most of the things over here on this part of the roadmap talk where the same is on the keynote so Unity definitely took feedback to heart when tons of people were angry that the Keynotes and road maps were only talking about awesome things but there were also many many years in the future so they definitely focus on only talking about things that are either already out or just around the corner one thing that got quite a bit of detail is the multiplayer they're working on the tool for helping you test multiplayer games without having to make separate builds so you can run multiple instances of the game inside the same editor that's a really awesome tool extremely useful for testing and making multiplayer games another really great one is Network simulation it's a tool for helping you test out every possible multiplayer problem everything from like spikes latency and random disconnections and yet now that a really awesome thing is they are currently working on Unity transport 2.0 which will feature webgl support that is the one main limitation on the current version it does not work in webgl so seeing this is excellent news once again making sure that Unity is multiplatform and any game you make can be played on essentially anything they're also working on the ability of recording and playing back multiplier packets again super useful for testing as well as making it easier to support large persistent worlds so lots of detail on the multiplayer roadmap there were a bunch of comments in my multiplayer video wondering if it's safe to use netcode for game objects or if Unity won't just deprecate it soon based on the current state of the multiplier tools and everything mentioned here it seems very clear to me that they are in it for the long term then the dot section of the roadmap which has some really nice extra details once again everything is on track for 1.0 with 23 LTS there are some upcoming samples starting off with the original one Mega City it's a really impressive demo they launched all the way back when dotsworth first announced now they are going to upgrade all of that code to dots 1.0 this is going to be the sample that will showcase large scale streaming and subscene authoring the second demo is called ECS racing it's a competitive multiplayer game showcasing netcode for entities its server authoritative with clientside prediction interpolation and lag compensation and beyond that there's also tons of tutorials and learning materials showcasing best practices there's already a bunch of them out right now I'll definitely be studying those to learn the best practices and they also recently acquired the Dodge character controller it's an excellent fully feature dots character controller which is now available in free for everyone also they updated the dots and ECS main pages so if you want to learn a bunch more about dots those have quite a lot of info and some very helpful links as for the future of dots after 1.0 they are working on improving crossplay determinism to make sure that every single one of the platforms the unity supports always behaves in the exact same way then they are also working on tools for making large open World Games easier to build also the ECS animation package importantly this is going to be pretty much the first thing where the end user will never know it's using ECS for regular users they won't keep making animations as usual using Game objects but in the background the system will be using ECS to make it extremely performed that to me sounds like it's going to be one of the true tests of dots seeing how it improves the quality of everyone who uses unity and not just people using dots directly then for the rest of the roadmap there are also some new terrain tools coming up using splines to make rivers and a bunch of ways of creating some gorgeous environments for mobile there's going to be faster deployment on Android by doing incremental Delta builds also incremental Builds on console webgl is also getting tons of improvements starting with mobile browser support making your webgl games play well on the phone inside a browser it's getting a better memory inspector and perhaps best of all webgl is getting multithreaded support with Native C plus code honestly I didn't even know this was possible so that's truly insane that coupled with the previous news that the network transport layer 2.0 is going to support webgl seems like next year is going to be really special for web game devs then a bunch more news on the xri toolkit how you can simulate AR devices in the editor XR templates and more and plastic sem is also getting a very robust web dashboard so quite a lot of nice improvements coming in the near future beyond that I entered the talk on Unity gaming Services I'm working on various tutorials for how to use those tools there is also a really fun talk on how to prototype games how your prototype should be set up to answer a specific question how prototypes can be cheaper and a fun technique was to make 20 game ideas in just 20 minutes there was another one on some things coming to version 22.2 like the splines package there was a nice AMA with Lauren who is the dots Chief at unity and a bunch more some of the tanks are already online and some will be added over the next few days definitely give them a look you will definitely learn something new so that was unite22 it's been a long time since the last unite that one was all the way back in 2019 so it was fun to do this again I got to meet some other Unity content creators and even one person who recognized me thanks for that I hope you're really enjoying the turn based strategy course the feature of unity is looking great I'm actively researching lots of these things especially dots I can't believe 1.0 is just around the corner thanks Unity for bringing me out to Montreal Canada was a lovely place and surprisingly warm thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
