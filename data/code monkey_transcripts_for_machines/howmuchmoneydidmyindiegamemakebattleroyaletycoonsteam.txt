in this video I'm going to talk about the steam revenue and stats for my latest game barrel round tycoon the game came out in early September after spending nine months in early access so I'll cover the results of that which so far have been pretty nice let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you will learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing and yep there it is there's the total number for first month sales for veteran tycoon on Steam the game sold three thousand and seven hundred copies for a total of twenty seven thousand dollars in gross revenue the final total including all the sales in early access is about fifteen thousand copies sold for a gross total of about one hundred and twenty thousand so that's a pretty nice number it's certainly not cuphead or shovelknight but for a solo game developer it's very nice however by itself the number doesn't really tell the whole story so first of all this is gross revenue after taking away steams cut chargebacks refunds and taxes the net amount is quite a bit less than half of that somewhere around fifty K I'm making this video in order to add another sales stats data point into the world having more sales that out there will hopefully help people have a more realistic expectation of what game development is like if you're an aspiring indie dev I would recommend you search around for the various developers that have already published sales stats so you can make a better more informed decision before jumping in so as you may know if you follow this channel my mean job is still making my some of indie games I've been making games on Steam for seven years now with eight games total published covering a variety of genres from action to strategy to management some of my games have been successful and some have been complete flops so that's one of the main reasons why a single game sales number is not really telling the whole story I would say if you want to be successful as an indie game developer and have a long career it is essential to manage your finances wisely I always try to keep enough money in the bank so you can withstand a massive flop because it will happen there's an excellent talk by Jake Burkett of grey alien games which perfectly encapsulates what has also been my experience the tunnel itself is perfect it's called how to survive in game dev for 11 years without a hit my own games have never been hits but I'm still here after seven years thanks to constantly learning adapting and careful risk management so go check out that talk another great one is by Jeff Vogel of spiderweb software which again is a story of a long successful career without any massive heads his business model is to focus on a very very specific niche genre which are oldschool RPGs and serve that niche audience as best as possible since it's been in business for so long he also creates remasters of his very own games that's yet another benefit of having a deep bang work over a long career yet another one is cliff Harris from posi tech games he's definitely made some games that you could call hits like democracy 3 gratuitous space barons and production line also in business for over ten years and his blog is full of excellent information he also experimented with being an indie publisher and actually published shadow hand which was made by Jake Burkett so if you manage the same business for a long time and keep gathering an audience and Industry contacts that's another potential Avenue you can take and finally I've also written a blog post myself a couple of years ago on my experience as an indie bottomfeeder I wrote that right before I published hammer nights which was my fifth game and in it I talked a lot about my strategy for surviving in this business for the long run I'm still here two years after that so I'd say my strategy is working check out all of those links in the description so here are some stats on the game itself this has been my most complex game by far the game has a total of 90 thousand lines of code so that's quite a bit definitely more than any of my other games I first started working on it in April of last year which was also around the time that I started this channel so that's a total of 17 months of development for a few months I was more focused on channel than the game but for the most part that's working fulltime I published the coming soon page on June of 2018 and the game was released into early access on December 10 2018 then finally after 16 updates and 9 months in early access the game was fully released on September 2nd 2019 begin launched into early access with 6,000 wish lists and around 4,000 followers which are pre decent numbers nowadays that is the most important metric for finding success on you need to announce your game as soon as possible and start gathering wishlist and followers right away the way you find success on Steam is by selling a decent number in the very first few days and getting at least over 10 reviews once you do that you're no longer competing with the trash games whether they're only with the other great games so having a large number of followers and wish list will help you achieve that and send out from noise so again these stats for the first month of full release are three thousand and seven hundred copies for a total of twenty seven thousand dollars in gross revenue the phone release was on September 2nd with the early access release in December of last year the final total in all of that time has been about 15,000 copies for a gross total of $120,000 however again do you keep in mind that's the gross total so after taking away steams cut charge bags refunds and taxes the net amount is quite a bit less than half of that somewhere around 50 K for 17 months of work that's a decent amount so I would certainly call this game successful over time I won't slowly discount the game as usual and expect it to keep selling a decent amount for quite a while that's the main reason why right now I've been focusing hard on the channel essentially I have a couple of months to try to make this channel sustainable if I can do that and great I can keep making these videos and providing them for free on the channel if I can't do that then I'll have to quickly get started working on my next game if you like videos and would like to help make that happen you can support the channel by picking up the game bundle on the website that contains 7 of my games with a heavy discount there's a multitude of genres from action strategy and management the only game not included is been erotic hoon since it just came out but you can pick that one up on Steam so with this total number and 17 months of development I would certainly consider this game a success not a massive success but still a nice success here's some quick postmortem takeaways in terms of what I think went right I would say the genre the idea and the name I first started working on the game as an exploration of AI in a battle royale game so I built a map put some units fighting inside it and found that it was quite fun to watch him fight at the time the battle royale game mode was all the rage so I saw that as a nice marketing opportunity again if you want to make it as an indie dev you really need a very compelling concept so I thought okay but erotic hoon is a very popular genre and my most successful games have been my management games so why don't I try to take the barren ground game mode and applying to a tycoon then we thinking about how to make that concept work I thought about one of the games that consumed my childhood which was wrong agos tycoon and just like that the idea was formed make rollercoaster kun but achoo ting arenas instead of rollercoaster the player would film the park build the arenas and all the other buildings and the guests would go in queue up shoot each other and have fun finally the name I think was very well chosen you might say that the name varam Rafi Koon sounds very generic which is true but it also very clear only communicates what the game is about which again goes back to how important marketing is nowadays and how you need to make things as easy as possible on yourself it's better to go generic and capture some people's intention in the very first few seconds than to go extremely unique and get lost in all the noise developing the game also went quite well making the queues and managing the buildings was a ton of work but a ton of fun this was a very programming heavy game which means very difficult and complex but programming is the part that I love the most about game development so it was also very compelling to make in terms of what went wrong the only thing I can think of is the time time is extremely valuable for an indie dev and spending 17 months on a single project is way too much the longer you spend on the game the harder it will be for that game to turn a profit part of the reason for the along dev cycle was due to how I was trying to keep this channel running at the same time so that led to me being over word for quite a while which had a serious impact on productivity another part is simply due to the genre again the game is 90 thousand lines of code long so when you're trying to make something that complex it will take some time for my next game I certainly aim for a much shorter dev cycle probably around 6 to 8 months which i think is the ideal time for a solo game developer I also plan to document more of that whole process so make sure you're subscribed to the channel so you don't miss out another thing you should keep in mind if your goal is to become a professional indie game developer is to keep yourself mentally saying physically fit that might sound weird but believe me it's very important this is a marathon and not a sprint so don't work yourself to death remember to take frequent breaks and get up from your chair so you can keep doing this for a very long time to come if you'd like to hear my general advice on several topics covering indie game development check out the playlist linked in the description I'm also planning on making a video doing a nice game to have time lapse of building the whole game so stay tuned for that I've done a video just like that for the development of survivor squad and the video came out very nice it shows the game being built from absolutely nothing learning with the prototype and three thousand lines of code later it becomes a proper game there's a link in the description so go check it out let me know in the comments if there's any topic you didn't like me to cover related to someone game development or steam and again if you don't like to play my games you can pick up the discounted game button from the website and get better around tycoon from scene alright so I hope this video was informative and help put out another sales data point into the world so aspiring indie devs can make more informed decisions like the video and subscribe the channel if you don't like to see more content like this cause any questions you have in the comments and I'll see you next time
