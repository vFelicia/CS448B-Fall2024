hello and welcome I'm your code monkey man the series were making snake immunity in this video we're going to create a game over window let's begin okay so this is our game we currently have the snake moving around and if we eat some food you can see that the snake rose and if the body is big enough I can hit the snake body and the snake dies right now that just makes the game stop but in the previous video we have the unloader and we have our nice debug button in here so we can click it to test game loading so I click it and there you go it reloads the game scene and everything is back to start now all we need is a proper game over window that shows up when we die and run the same code that is on this button so let's build our window in our canvas so let's make a new game object this will be our game over window now inside let's make a button so an empty game object for the container for the button this won't be the retry button enzyme let's first make an image for the background and a text field okay so here is our very nice very simple retry button so in order to capture button clicks let's add the button UI component this is a class from the code mock utilities it has a bunch of features for a UI button so it's very useful for example let's make the button background change onmouseover so in here I can very simply do this again you don't have to use the utilities you can use the basic Unity buttons but this one already helps me make a very nice button okay so now that we have the editor all set up let's see on with the code so for that let's make new C sharp script to handle our window so in new let's call it our game over a window now here on a wait let's grab a reference to our button so we grab the button UI component and now in here we can set the click func which is the function that is triggered whenever we click on the button and now what we want to do when we click the button is the same thing we were doing on our testing button so we can go into the game hammer and let's go down here here's where we were making our testing button so this is all we need in order to load our current game scene all right so let's set and see if the button is visible and if it's working the same as previously okay so there's the button it's nice and visible if I pass the mouse over it changes Congre which is nice and now if I click on it if there you go with mode the loading scene and then immediately our game scene and everything resets so I can go down here eat that now I have 100 and the body size of 1 now hit retry and there we go everything is back to normal ok so far so good our button is being visible and it is working exactly as we want however obviously since this is a game over window we want the window to only show when snake dies so let's make some show and hide functions let's start off by making a private void show in order to show let's simply do a game object that's set active to true when we disable our game object everything is hidden when we enable everything is shown so let's do the opposite for the private oil hi and now on awake let's come over height since by default our game over window should be hidden now we need some way of showing this window so let's use a static function now in order to access our show function we need to know the instance so let's store a private static instance and on our show static we can now call the instance dot show alright so that's it this is a very similar question I spawn Ecstatic function that we can come whenever we want to show the winner so now we need to figure out where we're going to call this so let's go into the game hammer in here we had something to get scored net score and let's also have a function that won't be called when the snake dies and then here all we do is go into the game over window and show our game over window so now again the same thing we need to trigger this function from somewhere so for that let's go into the snake and see where we have our snake being set to dead and there it is we got a nice testing popup we can now hide that and when it dies let's call the game hammer that snake died okay so that should be working so now we have our snake when our snake dies it changes its state so it stops moving and we call the game handler that snake died then the game handler deals with telling the UI to show our game over window and our came over window has a retry button so we can try again so let's run the game and see okay here we are and as you can see the button is not visible exactly as we want it to so let's grow eat a bunch of food so there's that one down there okay so our snake is big enough to die so let's wrap around and die and yep there you go the snake is that the window popped up and we now have our nice retry button so now I can click the retry button and there you go the loading window and now it's back into the main window and I can try again to beat my score so there you have it to create a proper game over window that pops up when the snake dies and contains a button so we can easily retry in order to try again in the next video we're going to create the main menu as always you can download the project files and utilities from antigone monkey comm if you have any questions post I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
