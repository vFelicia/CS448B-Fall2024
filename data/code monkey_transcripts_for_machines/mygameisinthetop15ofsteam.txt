hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey in a previous video I showed sales of my recent game just one week after release basically it had made $13,000 in gross revenue and sold about 1,000 copies now for some of you depending on how long you've been learning about Steam and IND games in general if you just started out and looking at this might seem like a really low result especially if you're someone from the US and you're used to people talking about their tax salaries in the high six figures if so then compared to that Yep this amount does seem extremely low it might seem like this game is a flop however looking at the actual numbers at the actual statistics the game is actually doing quite well now based on first week sales we can actually do a guesstimate and figure out how much the game might sell in the first year that ratio is usually anywhere between 2 and six now for me I'm planning to continue working on the game and continuing to talk about it make various tutorials about it so in my case I can probably guesstimate that the ratio for this game will probably be around the five Mark so that means I can probably expect it to sell about 50,000 in gross revenue in the first year and according to the graph over here on VG insights by the way this is an excellent website if you want to see all kinds of stats Rel to seam in any games so over here we can see the revenue distribution and if the game does hit 50k on the first year then that would put it up here which is right on the top 15% of Steam games so over here you can see just how tough this business is you can see how most games don't even make 5K steam is constantly hitting new records it is absolutely massive and with all these users it makes a massive amount of money literally billions of dollars every single year but in terms of developers it's all heavily skewed towards the top basically most of the money get go to just this top 3% which in reality that still actually means quite a lot of games are finding success we can see the number of releases every single month there are tons and tons of games coming out every single month for example in September there were 1,200 games released that is a huge amount I believe in total that are over 50,000 Steam games so going back to the 3% 3% to 50,000 is actually still quite a bit that's still about 2,000 games making millions of dollars so that is still pretty good but at the same time there are still about 40,000 out of those 50,000 games that don't even make 5K now my goal with this video is not to make you depressed or discourage you from following your Game Dev dreams I really just want to be transparent and make sure you have enough data points if you want to decide that you would like to make this as a fulltime living just be aware that the reality is this is a really tough business in this channel my goal is really to teach you game development so you can make the games that you dream of however there's a really big difference between making games for fun as a hobby and trying to make a living out of it as a hobby I really believe that anyone can learn how to make games personally I'm a huge believer in educations so I believe that if you make the effort you can learn to build pretty much any game you can imagine for myself I can say that I've already reached a really nice point where I can pretty much build any game idea that I can think of so making games is a lot of fun and I definitely encourage people to follow that passion if that is something that they desire but when it comes to making a living out of your games the reality is that achieving that is going to be extremely difficult I still believe you can learn how to do it especially if you study a lot on Steam game marketing but at the same time it requires so many things to go right that I definitely would not encourage you to pry much just quit your day job and gble everything on the hope that your game will find success like I said I'm confident that based on my own technical skills I can pretty much build any game idea that I can think of but I cannot really guarantee that that game idea will find financial success although as you look at this graph as to how much money each game makes looking at this whether making a living sounds impossible or just somewhat difficult that is really up to you what I mean by that is how it's very much dependent on how much money you actually spend I believe that is really the main thing that defines just how easy or hard it is to actually make a living from your games this is also something that I've talked about quite a bit in the past I made a really nice video talking about my story and how to survive as a Game Dev for over a decade when it comes to making games cheaply I believe that is sort of my unintentional superpower I live in a lowc cost of living country and when I started making a living from my games I was making sure to spend as little as possible and over here I can actually survive on just about 750 bucks a month so even though this chart doesn't look pretty bad it looks pretty depressing even with that if I'm capable of making a game in just 6 months and my costs are just 700 bucks a month then in theory I can still make a living on this bottom part which such in low monthly cost and if I do everything myself then I can pretty much turn a profit with under 5K however on the other hand if I was living somewhere like San Francisco and I needed 5K a month just barely scrip by if so then even if I made a game super quickly in just 6 months that would still require at least 30 grand just to make a tiny profit so in general I highly encourage you to make games for fun making games Building Systems building game design with all kinds of rules that you define yourself that is really fun personally I really enjoy it but my advice is also be very aware that in terms of business this is an extremely tough business so just be aware of all of these numbers and how difficult it is before you make the leap and try to make it your daytoday living anyway so this was a bit of a random video just because I had the sudden thought to think of where does my game stck up in the entirety of steam it's obviously not a mega hit like the recently released and very excellent Throne fall this is a top 10% any game but based on my own goals my game is actually doing quite well so if you like automation Colony building and defense games then go ahead and check out think Guardians on seam and I really hope you like it thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
