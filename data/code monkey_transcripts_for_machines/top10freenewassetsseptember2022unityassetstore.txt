hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tones and assets help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights for September 22. in this first video I will be covering a list of free assets and the next ones I won't be covering paid ads and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also just before I publish this video humble launched yet another excellent TNT bundle this one is all about art I'm just quickly recording this part haven't really had time to dive deep yet but it looks pretty excellent there's tons of high quality visual assets as usual it's a massive discount 98 off so if one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it I might do a detailed video on it tomorrow if I can find the time and of course the awesome Unity tools bundle is also still active if you haven't picked that one up I highly recommend you do lots of awesome tools to help you regardless of what channel you're working on and with a massive discount it's super cheap these humble bundles with insane discounts only happen about once or twice a year so definitely don't miss out on them all right so on to the top 10 lists starting off with a simple airplane controller it looks like it controls exactly as you expect so you have multiple axes of rotation you have wrong pitch yaw and even a turbo button there's lots of parameters for you to play around with to get it working exactly as you wanted so if you have an idea for an airplane or spaceship game then this looks like an excellent starting point up next if you need some low polygons look at these ones there's quite a lot of variety you have a sniper rocket launcher pistol SMG and a bunch more the materials are simple and solid colors which means it's super simple to make tons of variations just by recalling them this pack includes 10 different games and developer intends to continue updating this package until it has over 50 guns then here's a pack with some really gorgeous cartooning assets a nice fantasy Village I really like this style it reminds me of either Warcraft or settlers the pack includes a nice house say well there's a table with some chairs rocks and a bunch more definitely great for making a nice looking diorama and this is a demo so you can like this pack if you like this style check out the phone pack then here's an interesting tool for helping you receive player feedback feedback is pretty crucial for learning what your players think of your game and how you can improve upon it so this is a nice SDK that seems to make that process as simple and easy as possible and this is more than just an input text box it features a help center you can connect to a person for oneonone help you can easily set up a knowledge base FAQ and much more up next if you just need a quick human character to test out then look at this freestylized human it includes not just mesh but also some basic animations as well as a bunch of card variations so it really is a very wellrounded complete pack this one is from blink which is a pretty prolific accessor publisher so if you like their style check out their home publisher page they have tons of stuff then here's something I don't normally include in these lists here's some nice combat sound effects the reason why I don't include sounds or music in these lists is because it's pretty hard to describe sounds but these do sound really great so I figured I'd include them in this list sound is one of those things that you might not notice but it definitely makes a huge impact so a packing like this one will quickly help your game feel much more powerful next if you need a super high quality Stone floor texture and look at this one this is super high res extremely realistic it's got a really intense height map which I love definitely makes it look like it has a ton of weight the whole thing is composed of six unique textures all in 4k really nice then for an interesting system here is a grappling hook rope wrapper basically it's a 2d rope that you can wrap around objects now making a rope is actually one of the topics that I've wanted to make a tutorial on for quite a long time definitely something I want to research but if you just want something that works then maybe pick this up then if you need some Vehicles check out this pack it's a nice selection of seven Vehicles only in a really neat low poly style pretty nice and there's some unique ones then for another interesting tool here is folder extension if your project has tons of folders that nested like this one can definitely help you stay organized you can customize icons backgrounds and fonts you can add some notes create tasks and even make website links this is the free version so if you enjoy it there's a paid version with many more features alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the NTS store for September 22 and don't forget to check out both humbum bundles before the end these only happen once or twice per year so definitely don't miss out on these massive discounts alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for
