hello and welcome I'm your KMI the assur is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for June 24th this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered the best free new assets and next one I'll be covering top visuals and effects as always there's links to the ass in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10% off your order and unity is also running a nice sale right now there's a bunch of messes at 35 bucks so for some of these that means that's a pretty deep discount here's the tool for motion matching animation you can make some really awesome mags with this CTI pack maybe pick up this one if you working on a cute game maybe this huge pack with 900 low poly weapons or this one with a mountain of customizable characters you can even watch my character customization tutorial or this parkour and climbing system or this really awesome looking alien environment maybe get this nice slow poly monster bundle or a really interesting traffic control system it says here you can get an extra 10% off with this coupon so based on the name I'm guessing this sale is ending this June so there's only a few days left so if you're interested definitely get it quickly oh and there's also a Humble Bundle with with a mountain of realistic stuff some of these are in real assets and some are unity these all have a really nice realistic style you've got towns Islands there's a viking Village a really nice Work Camp a bunch of characters some kind of modular Temple there's tons of props items and so on check it out with the link in the description all right so starting off with an interesting tool that combines splines and decals so usually there are tools that use splines to generate meshes but this one is different it uses spines in order to play some decal decal in case you don't know is basically just projecting an image onto an ex existing geometry so for example that means you can use this to place some dirt directly on top of your road mesh you can place some dirt or for example some Road lines you can also draw some footprints on top of some kind of Sandy environment and of course it's all using the Spain tool which makes it really easy to position it exactly where you want it you can make straight lines make curves all kinds of things so it's a really great combination of two great tools splines and decals next here's a really awesome outline tool now there are actually tons of these but those usually do it the super simple way which really just scales up the model approach works but usually leaves lots of gaps in the corners whereas on this one this asset does not have that issue the outline is really perfect all around the model even on some harsh Corners it looks really great on pretty much any kind of object so if you use an outline effect in your game and you want them to be super high quality then definitely look at this one then here's a super useful tool called mesh extractor I'm pretty sure I covered version 1.0 of this tool in this video series many years ago so version two is out right now this tool does exactly what it says it helps you extract a mesh from another mesh so for example if you have a model with a lamb tied to a pole you can just extract just a lamb if you have a box of apples you can just grab a single Apple so this is one of those helper tools that is actually really useful in many use cases where the assets that you want to use aren't 100% exactly what you need maybe you just need some part of it if you look at the many assets that you already own you will probably see how you already have tons of stuff although some of it might be merged into one mesh with multiple objects so with this you can just extract some piece from it then for a nice UI tool here is a great looking soft mask the builtin mask that un has is only a harsh mask so it's only on or off there's no fade so this tool helps you add that you can add a mess texture and then easily play around with the mask capacity and fall off you can also stack masks one on top of another so you can make some really interesting effects and it also support some text all in all a really useful really neat tool for your UI it gives you quite a lot more control allowing you to make some really interesting uis next if you get frustrated with clicking on scene View and picking the wrong object if so then look at this tool usually what happens is when clicking on an object it selects the LOD instead of the parent object itself that can be quite annoying so this tool helps minimize that problem by helping you select the object you likely wanted to select it has a bunch of rules like selecting the LED group instead of individual lods it can ignore the UI and drain objects and so on and you can also customize it in terms of colors so really nice tool if you're frustrated with object selection this is one of those tools that can definitely help speed up level design by quite a lot then here's another really simple but potentially very useful tool called scene notes it does exactly what it says it lets you place objects in your scene and add some notes to them this can be really useful for doing things like in list of tasks that you still need to do if they are related to something like level design it can be better to add note in the world space itself instead of adding for some kind of task list you can add notes to remind yourself of various things like why you added a certain house on a certain place maybe also a note to display the position that triggers some kind of boss fight so plenty of use cases the notes can have both a short title and a longer description you can create categories to organize your notes and then you can even tag them as start or completed on all really nice simple tool or perhaps you're making something with cameras or photos if so here is a tool to help you get hand and figure tracking definitely a niche tool but if you need this then this looks to be extremely accurate you can create some actual 3D meshes for the hands with the correct position in 3D space or you can just use some basic standard 2D hand shapes this works with a webcam live stream or it can also work with a simple video or some photos you just feed that onto the algorithm and generates the external hand mesh so this could be really great for making some interesting very different games maybe play around with a connect or something like that or you could also make some nongame apps you can use hand shapes to do all kinds of things for example you could create some kind of home automation then set up a camera pointing somewhere and instead of using your voice to control your home you could use some hand signals or perhaps use it to Define some Naruto hand signs so lots of interesting unique ideas to be used with this one this is the windows version and they also have versions for all other platforms next here's another asset that I'm pretty sure I covered the original version before in this series it's diable terrain 2D this one is version 2.0 it does exactly what it says it helps you dig 2D terrains right away it reminds me of playing worms as a kid destroying the terrain in those games was always a lot of fun basically just dig down and call an air strike that was always fun if You' like to make a game kind of like worms if so then this asset would be a really great starting point you can dig anywhere you want in the terrain any shape you want you can dig holes or cut off massive amounts you can also add physics to the remaining parts so if you cut off something from everything else it won't fall down and the terrain of course can have whatever Vision you want so you can dig through dirt Rock grass or really anything next if you're working on a 2d combat game look at this hit system it basically helps you easily place and set up hit boxes specifically how to combine hitbox shapes at various animation points handling hitbox is always a really tricky thing in games you want the hit to only connect if the weapon or the fist or something like that if that one actually touches the enemy so not just in general and of course you also want it to do only on certain parts of the animation like when actually striking and not when for example pulling the fist back so doing all that can be quite tricky so a tool like this one can really help you out you can define various hitboxes to Define when on the animation they show up so maybe for example you have a small hitbox at animation time of something like. 3 and then need a large hitbox at 04 until 10.8 something like that then depending on hit or miss you can spawn some really nice particle effects or if you're working in 3D and you want to build an entire world then look at this tool it's a node based World creator so instead of manually building the terrain piece by piece and setting all textures instead of that you use a node based workflow where each node defines Logic for generating the entire world naturally since it is based on logic it means that you can easily generate super huge worlds basically just keeps reusing the same logic to generate more and more and it also works with live editing meaning as you modify the nodes you can see the results in real time all right so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the UN assur for June 24 there's link to all in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code Mony 10 to get 10% off your order all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon
