hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's a quick video on something really awesome that I saw recently that I just have to tell you about so a few months ago I launched my free 10 hour course the response has been really awesome lots of people learn a ton from following the course the percentage of people who finish the course is low which is expected but every person that does go through the whole thing really loves it and one of the main goals with this course was to teach you how to write good clean code that is adaptable and easily expandable I've only recently made the design so that it's pretty easy to add more recipes more objects more interactions and so on and recently wouldn't have really put that to the test here eliane went through the course and then built upon it to make something completely unique right away you can see there's a completely different map all with unique art the player's original as is the music there are new recipes new objects new counters that do completely different things and perhaps most impressive all is how it even features a different completion goal in my original game you just dropped the correct recipe on the delivery counter and that's it whereas here there are actual clients that come into the restaurant they sit down on a specific table and they make a request this one change alone really changes how the game were Works instead of always dropping off the recipe on the same place now it's a different place every time another excellent addition is having to wash dishes with a completely new countertime again in the course I made this super simple the recipe is delivered and clean plates just spawned but here you actually need to wash them the clients finish eating and you need to pick them up take them to a brand new counter for washing dishes and then it sponsee clean dishes in terms of ingredients they are all different now there's bread which must be sliced there are some eggs which must be fried there's even a new counter for some boiling water then you put that boiling water onto a cup in order to make a proper cup of tea and there are even multiple levels each with different recipes the recipe UI clearly shows all the steps needed to cook each recipe and when the customers are done they will also leave a tip based on how quickly you serve them then you can take that money to operate the business and the character I was really impressed when I saw all these changes this is exactly what I was hoping people would do with the course take it as a base and really expand upon it this is an excellent example of what you should do if you're really trying to learn Game Dev every once in a while I see some kind of comment asking how do Escape tutorial hell and this is exactly how you do it don't just blindly copy paste while following some tutorial or some course use them to learn something and then test your knowledge by modifying and building upon it if you do that you will learn so much more so congrats only in really great job on taking a course game as a base and completely overhauling it into something very unique my advice right now is take this game to the Finish Line add some more polish create a proper level progression add more upgrades make it a complete experience and publish it to steam remember that if you want to become a game that of the publishing part is also essential so I highly encourage people to go through it you won't learn a massive amount from releasing your first proper game on Steam even if it doesn't end up selling anything speaking of steam I'm currently working on my next team game dinky Guardians this is going to be my 9th steam release it's a fun Coop action building automation game go ahead and edit your wishlist and if you haven't yet gone through my free complete course then go ahead and give it a try as you can see here you can take that course as a base and massively expand upon it you can expand upon it in this way to make a more complex kitchen or restaurant game but you can also take these same Concepts and apply them to different ways the game is really just all about interacting with various counters and various objects so for example you could make some kind of car mechanic Simulator game you could grab Nuts and Bolts from the container counters and create some special encounters to build the car or perhaps a strategy game where you're building weapons to deliver to some soldiers or maybe use some AI to control the player and turn it into some kind of automation game so you can really take this game as a base and really build upon it in many ways if you did go through the course but you just did the course as it was and nothing else then perhaps try going back to it and building upon it just like this and of course everything that I said here also applies to the followup free multiplayer course you can also build upon that one in the same way and make some unique multiplayer games so once again congrats to Elian great job on this massive overhaul I hope you continue working on it thank you all for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
