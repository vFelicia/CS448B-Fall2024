also one quick note specifically on the steam algorithm there are four buckets of reviews which greatly affect visibility if you have less than 10 reviews the score isn't even visible this is really bad so you absolutely need to get 10 reviews asap the next one is between 10 and 49 reviews at that point you do see the score but it's still pretty bad for visibility the next one is above 50 reviews this is where you want to be as quickly as possible ideally on the first day or maybe second or third by then you should really be at 50 or more reviews if not it's a really tricky start and the final one is at 500 reviews that one is really tricky and that's when you start seeing scores like overwhelmingly positive as you can see this game did not manage to hit 50 reviews even now several months after release until it gets that much it's going to be really tricky to attract a large amount of players so my tip to you as a game developer is definitely encourage your players to leave reviews and also my tip to you as a player if there's a game you're playing and you're enjoying it do make sure to write a review they really help the developer
