oh hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here nice okay now I have to say this stream is a bit off to a rocky start because for some reason Unity just randomly it seems like their license server is down so the goal is to do a bit of work but now I can't open Unity so there's some issue with the license server so yeah I have to say this kind of screws up my plans so let's see if this gets fixed or not so that's definitely bad timing since such a thing has never happened to me before so yeah that's a bit tricky uh but yeah let's see all right yeah definitely a a tricky start but hey everyone hey thanks for being here let's see if I can manage to figure out something but yeah uh just take out the background uh right cuz yeah if I can't open Unity that is going to make this a little bit tricky which I guess by the way now is a good time to ask all of you so are you having the same issue or is it just me uh you just opened a project okay so is it just me cuz basically this is what I'm seeing enable to refresh license try again then I try again and nope nothing happened so yeah that's uh person 500k thank you thank you so much uh so yeah is it just me are you all able to open up Unity right now cuz yeah I just opened up the unity Hub and apparently there's some issue with the license server L out and try again uh okay let's see if that does work cuz basically this is always signed in but it seems like it can't really all right let's see okay it signs in automatically and it signed in but nope still says enable to refresh license let me let me read chat no issue here open the project a while ago okay so that's very strange never had such a thing works fine for me oh come on so it's just a me issue literally on the only time that I decide to do a live stream okay so that's that's tricky okay so have to say this definitely quite a bit of uh Hey from edisa hey nice thank you thanks for being here uh okay so let's see if I can figure this out cuz yeah being unable to open Unity kind of makes a little bit of a tricky thing okay so yeah very very strange okay so I found a temporary fix maybe is it loading okay so I just tried uh activating a personal license and apparently that works so very strange but okay sure I mean right now I don't really need Pro anyway or actually I would like to try out Muse I would like to try it out a little bit there are some tutorials where I could use some nice material so I'd like to try it out but yeah it's like when your manager comes over and everything spits in your face yeah that seems to be the case I mean this has never happened to me so uh yeah very strange let's see if it's currently un loading let's see if this does open all right so yeah sorry for a rough start to the live stream trying to figure this out but okay okay so apparently it is working so I had to grab a personal license so that is very strange because I'm pretty sure my Pro license was at the end but anyways doesn't matter so it should be good all right okay so I can finally do a little bit of work and let's see if everything else goes okay yeah I'm not even quite looking at all the windows since everything got messed up so let me just okay let me actually prepare things cuz now it does seem to be correct so okay let me just do uh all right okay so this should be good so basically I'm going to prepare some upcoming tutorials uh I got to prepare the demo scene so that then I can record the actual proper tutorial so that's basically what I'm going to try to be doing whil trying to reach out trying to do all kinds of things so let's see a cnth acid pack and want to do a flash on the 3D object when it gets damaged what is the easiest way to do that if I'm not an artist to make artwork for it I mean to make a flash you really just need some some emission so like for example I actually I actually need to drag a character here so let me actually uh I'm going to pick up one from these one from these so basic character and I just need to update the thing because apparently I didn't so let me go into rendering to the converter and yep built into urp material upgrade usize and convert okay so that should work uh yeah so basically the easiest way to add some damage kind of thing that would be some kind of material emission like for example let's see this hat what is the kind of material let me make a material with emission so just up here create a brand new material let me go into the hat and drag the material onto the hat and on this one I can go and enable submission put the emission un like white or red I guess if you want to get hit that would be in red uh just increase emission increase the intensity and just need to make sure that I've got towards my processing volume My volume just make sure to make the volume quite intense okay I disabled the special effects and there you go so yeah basically if you wanted the easiest way to do that you really don't need to do any art sort of thing so you can just use a simple emission and just play around the intensity so as the player gets hit really increase it and then slowly bring it down so animated through some kind of interpolation so I've got a nice quick video on smooth with lurp so that's pretty much what I would do just lurp it increase the emission and decrease it and it's a really nice flash effect super easy to do so just increase boom and goes down so yep back to normal so yep that's pretty much what I would do something pretty simple use any framework for dep pendency injection nope not really I've heard great things about zenject and I've seen some videos on it but nope never really use it myself it's a it's a really interesting thing and I do try to make it so that my my code technically could be uh could work with some dependency injection so I use tons of interface tons of stuff but nope never actually use it so yeah won't that overr right the default texture uh yep if you have a glow it is going to work on top of the texture but that's pretty much what you want so if the base map is of a different color so if this one is supposed to be green then yeah that is going to look a bit strange but as goes down and you disable the emission then then goes back to normal so pretty much enable go up then go down when go down disable and so on but yeah that is the easiest way to do that congrats on 500k can we make custom gravity for different players in the same scene in 2D uh I don't think you uh can you do that I actually haven't used Tod physics in in quite a while but if I make just a basic Circle and I add a origin body 2D doesn't this one yeah this one does have a gravity scale so yep you can definitely have one with a gravity scale of something so let's put this one where's my camera cuz everything is far away where's the camera looking at okay it's looking at the other side so yep so yeah you can modify the gravity scale on that one just make this quite a bit smaller just make it two put oh great now it's not visible all right let's put in nice Cas your nice red and this one on the side now this one put it on one and now they should fall at different rates I mean two directions of gravity okay so that nope gravity always falls down on the Y I don't think you can change that so if that's the kind of thing that you need for a game then I would say the best answer is really just handle the gravity yourself so don't rely on the rigid body handling the gravity if you want you can still use a rigid body just make it so that it's kinematic so that you actually move it yourself and you basically implement the the gravity using some math yourself that that would pretty much be it so really just have a vector and then have the gravity Vector point to whatever Direction you want it to be and yeah you basically just need to handle it yourself because I don't think that is natively supported okay uh right active Ron can be triggered to set up that is actually something that I've been wanting to research for quite some time active ragon they are always quite interesting let me just unpack this prefab just so that I don't break the original uh yep so let put the character so Vis I'm going to need the character looking at did I modify yeah I did modify the intensity that is way too intense let me just move the camera a little bit where's my camera I put a player control but I don't need a player control on this one I just need a static camera so basically over here I'm preparing for a uh oh crap that is way too much for a tutorial on how to do character customization pretty much like I did in my game dinky Guardians that is pretty much the goal so Bas only going to have the character and then to the side of it there's going to be a menu in order to customize the thing so basically over here I'm preparing the scene which I will then use in the in the in the tutorial and so on I know if you're looking to go or have already looked into it nope I've I've seen a bunch of GDC talks talking about it it seems like in AAA development GOP is really used if if you don't know what is GOP that means I always forget go go something action oriented oh crap I for or action planning I always forget what the acronym means but yeah it's a it's a very interesting way of doing like behaviors and things so yeah I've definitely seen it being used in a ton of GDC talks I'm pretty sure I saw a bunch of those for Watch Dogs yeah goal oriented action planning yeah that's the one uh yeah so it is really interesting but nope I've never used it myself but yeah definitely something that I would like to research in the future because it's definitely an interesting way to handle behaviors uh okay so in order to prepare for tutal basically I'm going to need the character and the way that this character customization Works actually super simple because all based just on meshes so the way this one works so like it has a backpack and the way this asset pack is set up it's pretty much just modify the mesh just modify the mesh and that modifies all the customization so basically all it takes is really just a simple menu with a bunch of buttons for those buttons in order to modify things so yeah let me also make did I import the UI nope now you're a Unity guy curious how long you spent in in real or any other game engine uh the answer is nothing I think I've opened in real like once or twice but no never really I mean pretty much when I transition from Flash and I wanted to make some PC games that's when I started looking into engine where's my package manager oh there it is uh when I started looking into uh PC games back then uh I looked at my options and pretty much the only valid option was just Unity so yeah that was pretty much that's pretty much how I select back in 2012 I was looking for an engine that could make games and that was free Unity was the only option so yeah I picked unity and since then I continue using it just because I already know how to work with it and it does everything that I wanted to do so yeah because that nope I've never really explored other engines it's always one of those things where if I had infinite time I'd love to I'd love to spend some time in order to actually learn and see what they do different what they do better what does unity do worse what could Unity improve and things like that I think that's very very important very useful to be able to compare with the competition as it were and try to see what they do better and what you could do better but yeah as always my issue it's always the same so I can never find the time so it's always quite tricky the 3. lurp what we use for the third parameter if you want it interpolation uh linear interpolation then you use basally a number that increases from 0 to one YouTube's not receiving enough video to maintain smooth streaming is the stream lagging what is going on oh it was probably just CU it was updating G Pro anyways uh so yeah on lurp you can either use just an interpolation if you wanted to use the value from 0 to one or alternatively you can modify the original which I'm pretty sure is what I did in this video where I really like how I use lurp which technically it should be used it should be used well the main goal is to be used let me just mute it the main goal is to make it uh linear interpolation but way that I use it basically I use the transform that position as the first value which means that the distance between the start and the end value that distance is constantly getting smaller so by using that essentially makes us kind of smooth so it kind of moves quickly and then slows down as it reaches a point and yep so so yeah for the third time for third value usually I just use the time on time multiplied by some speed and yeah lurp is one of those things that is super useful like you've got two positions and then you can smoothly interpolate between them and I think I personally think that this one the uh ease in ease out I think this is ease out yeah because starts off fast and then goes slow yeah I think this is the one that is super useful so yep that is pretty much how I do it should I you stop down engine for my new game I mean that depends if you're making something that is top down then yeah the top down engine I'm pretty sure I've used it I haven't made a full review on it but I've used it quite a little bit and yep it does seem quite capable so yeah if you want to make something in top down top down shooter or something like that then yeah that can definitely help you speed up and get it to a really nice prototype really quickly all right so here I just need need the I'm just importing some UI assets just make oh hey custom character hey nice Game Dev JJ hey nice by the way if you'd like to make your own custom character you can do it so you can go on to the website you can draw on your own mesh and draw your character and make it exactly anything you want just let me know when it is because needs a manual approval process come out for tning lping with only a single call uh yeah you pretty much need kind of a SN or code routine or in my case I use my function upat class which has where's my where's my code my visual studio uh yeah basically I just got a super useful class in my utilities that I've used tons and tons of time which is pretty much okay let me just import this a crap everything is uh where's my's my window yeah I got to say my PC does become quite a bit slower as that's actually interesting am I streaming at 60 FPS that maybe why maybe why it's a little bit I should probably change that can I change it on the Fly no I don't think so cuz yeah I should probably not be streaming 60 FPS seems like that's a bit unnecessary but anyway sure so yeah just a little bit uh yeah what was I saying I've got my function updator is it still it's still loading my function up dat class which is my utilities if you like to use it go ahead feel free to use it and this one is super useful to me because basically it just creates an object which takes an action and then just runs that action on every update so this is super easy to use like what is the script I don't know but yeah so basically I just go into function updator and I create a new function updator then inside I pass any kind of thing run this every update so for example transform. position equals Vector 3. lurp and I would lurp not left lurp lurp from this transform. position to a Target position of some kind time do time multiply by some kind of speed so then it Flo for the speed 10f and a vector three for me Target position and this would be a new Vector 3 on 0 0 0 something like that and yeah so basically this is what I would do and this would be just one line of code and then the function updator that One automatically constructs a game object it automatically attaches a mon behavior and pretty much just would run this constantly and then I've got a second optional parameter not the function name but there's one for the yeah for my update Funk instead of receiving there's one for just action just runs this constantly on every single update NonStop and then there's another one that takes a funk which returns a bullion which basically when that one returns true that is when that one actually destroys the underlying object so basically what I would do is do this then just return a vector 3. distance distance between the transform out position and the target position and if that distance is within 01 F then basically that would destroy this h and stop running that code so yep basically if you want to do it in just one line personally I use my function of data class this is so useful I'm pretty sure I made this when did I make this in the hyperight days hyperight days I guess which was quite a long time ago when did I launch that game s power.com when did I launch that game uh hyper knights was that in 2016 uh 2017 okay so yeah basically there's a lot of the code that I basically this this game this was the sort of the first game since since I really started learning about writing clean code about making making code that is nice reusable super usable intens of projects so yeah pretty much the code base that I made on this I'm pretty sure most of the utilities I made back when I made this game which was back in 2017 and nowadays yep uh the code that I use in this game I still use it nowadays so that is super useful something that I wrote literally 17 that was what 6 years ago something that I wrote six years ago and nowadays it is still super useful a lot of the code that I use here a lot of the code in my utilities I'm still using in my own game Dy gardiens which I just launched so yeah it's kind of funny when you've got tons of tons of tons of code that you can then reuse and help you through the course of tons of projects oh hey the steam Awards that's fun uh right okay so what was I doing okay this fin no it did not okay I forgot to click on import so just doing something get let me read chat cuz I'm a a little bit little bit oh wow 245 people wow that's insane I got to say when I think about numbers about anything that I do on this channel and something it's always insane like my mind cannot picture 250 people but apparently there are 250 people watching this so thanks for being here yeah that's a it's quite crazy which of course if I complete the whole Unity pathway created with code I've actually never done that I've heard great things about that unity and learn course but never done it uh if I complete that then overcook and turn based will sh my skills provide solid foundation yep I would say that's an excellent path I mean I haven't done the C with code but I've heard great things about it so yeah if you start with that one and then go through my kitchen chaos course that will definitely take it to like intermediate level and then if you take the turnbased strategy course that will then take you into a more advanced level so yep if you follow that if you follow those three then yep by the end you will have quite a lot of knowledge r on un Awards oh thank you uh they actually said they that they made some physical Awards wordss that they were going to send out so I'm very curious to see what that looks like that is going to be funny pen spinning I already tried but it's difficult yeah uh yeah doing this is pretty much the only trick that I know I started learning pen spinning back when I was I don't know when I was like 12 years old when I was a kid and I found a website called px. comom I don't even remember where I saw the videos but yeah that was something crazy and yeah I really I really got hooked into it for quite well I learned a ton of Tricks but yeah nowadays I pretty much just know the infinity and the thumb BR so just the absolute Basics I don't know anything else yeah see you shouldn't stream in 6 oh hey L Mania hey thanks for being here nice uh I really like to look in 60 FPS yeah I really like it for for videos but as I'm trying to do some work that is actually slowing down my Unity by quite a bit so yeah doing it 60 FPS right now that's a it's a bit tricky can't even intiate an object after in the same code to control its position and rotation not sure what you mean I mean if you call intiate you can do ineni and pass in some kind of game object prefab you can entiate with a prefab and then you've got this version with the original and the parent but then you also got this version so you can bring it Vector 3.0 to spawn it on the zero and then qu. identity to spawn with no rotation so yep you can definitely spawn a prefab and position it right away although personally normally I do like transform for the spawn transform something like this so This should actually be a transform for the prefab transform so I usually spawn a transform I don't do anything then I go into this one that position equals new Vector 3 put it down one two three something like that then rotate and so on so personally I normally do it in two lines but if you want it then definitely you can do it in just one line hey Paloma hey thanks for ring here nice wave do you too thanks uh is animating UI would animator bad practice not really so can you please make on UI twinning yeah usually for the UI you do want usually people mostly animate the eyi with tning but you can definitely do it with animations as well uh like for example that is what I use in my game okay I'm going to try to open another un thing and apparently my My Cloud is my Unity license is still messed up but I'm going to try to open another Unity project and hope nothing breaks uh but yeah pretty much you you can definitely use just animations and I did use just animations in my game but so yeah you can use both for some reason usually the convention is in the UI people like to interpolate a little bit more but yeah you can definitely use just regular animations okay let me just make a little canvas make it in World space or why I want it in World space no I think screen space that is probably a bit easier plans for NS tutorial yep I've been re researching dots for the past few weeks and uh yep definitely want to make another one but at the same time I'm working on tons of things at the same time so I'm already super busy for the next week but yeah I wanted to do it before the end of this of this month but it might be early next month but yep definitely interested in getting back into dots uh actually yeah cuz I'm I'm trying to think how I'm going to organize the UI or rather how to organize the the tutorial itself why light mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it uh let me just scale with screen size 1920 by 1080 scale with a height and yep cuz this seemed quite a bit higher uh all right inside let me put not inside this one put inside put an image and yeah I wanted to make it look similar to my game that one is still opening so I assume the stream is a little bit slow right now since I'm trying to open another project at the same time personally I do dark mode in all I can yeah I know a lot of people prefer dark mode but yeah for me it doesn't I don't know why my eyes are broken I don't know but yeah for me it really does not work looking at something uh looking at White letters in a dark background for some reason my eyes cannot focus they get all messed up very quickly so yep for me it simply does not work okay so here's my that crap here's my game and someone was talking about uh let me load up the other one where's my where's my scenes my scenes let me go inside my game scene and inside the game scene a while ago people were asking about 2D animations where's my where's my UI why is my UI missing where did I put it is because it's where's my UI okay my UI just suddenly vanished why did you vanish where is my canvas 3D okay it's behind all that that's the issue with the with the yeah okay yeah uh so basically on all of these this is how I handle my UI this is the canvas 3D so this is the 3D y that has that sort of nice little thing and for example over here for the grab machine the itom grab machine inside I've got a container and Yep this one is using a regular animat game object so an animator I've got a simple animator just literally just a single animation just a window popup and on this one if I inspect the animation and yep that's what it does so it just moves up and has a nice little squish just to make it a little bit more satisfying but yep it's a regular animation component so every time that I inspect something that is pretty much what what happened so yeah basically to answer that question about can you use the animated in UI absolutely you can so it's really personal preference if you want you can do it based on where's the continue button if you want you can use it based on interpolation but if you also want to do it is this muted cuz I don't want to mess up the the thing uh but yeah so if you want you can make it based on animations oh that's a cool character uh or you can just make them like this so this is a regular animation so just as I inspect and there you go it comes up looks really nice and satisfying all right okay dzui yeah I've definitely heard good things about that I've seen a ton of great reviews on the EST I've actually never used one of those really complex UI Frameworks I know there are a bunch of them and they all seem to have very positive reviews but I've never actually use them so that's that's definely something that I would love to try out to see exactly what they do will you ever create a multiplayer FPS tutorial uh sure if I had infinite time I definitely would that's always my problem I mean I wish I could make a complete 20hour course on every single genre imaginable so making an RTS making a multiplayer FPS making a survival crafting game even making something like Flappy Bird or PacMan just the basics I'd love to be able to make like 20 30 courses but each course takes like I don't know two three months to make so basically for me to build all the ideas that I already have in my head that would already take me like five years So eventually over time I would love to be able to have a ton of content on pretty much every single genre imaginable but yeah it's definitely going to take quite a bit of work to to get to that point that's going to be quite tricky I'm using your multiplayer game as a template for mine it's incredibly helpful oh that's awesome that's cool hey best of luck with the game yeah multiplayer is tricky so yeah I really hope it helps nice what's difference between making a timer in update versus co routine versus async uh I mean in terms of the final goal those are pretty much all the same meaning those are all timers those all do things you can do it on update with a flow timer that is usually the thing that I prefer that is usually the simplest way just have a FL timer count it down when it's in laps do something pretty simple code routines I don't really like them because of the pattern they force you to use like you are forced to use a game object with a mon of behavior then you are also forced to uh return a numerator you've got to make yield returns and all kinds of things so personally I don't like all that pattern that Co routines Force but it it is valid it does achieve the same final result so yeah and async that is uh also another valid option that one is just something that I haven't really gotten used to ASN is still I don't know it's a little bit strange it's a little bit confusing although likely the unity packages a bunch of them have been have been um they've been using async white so because of that I've had to learn it and nowadays so quite a bit more more interesting uh I definitely find it quite a bit easier to understand now that I've spent some time working with those packages so yep asyn wa that is also another valid so pretty much all three of those those are all options really just choose the one that best serves you needs the one that you best prefer for me I really like simple float timer so so yep that's pretty much it love this chat template nice thanks uh yeah this is a a fun overlay just want to tell Code Monkey how helpful is oh that's awesome thank you so much and if you want to know how I made this overlay I covered a bunch of tutorials where I did this so if you want to go to the end of that page and you can definitely do it so this is a transparent Unity window all these characters these are all using mesh based animations in order to interact with YouTube API that's just a simple HTTP request and the characters these are actually a while ago I was talking about how I've reused tons of code from previous games and over here I'm using a bunch of code and art from previous game so these characters down here if you've played my game battle round Tycoon you won't recognize these characters these are pretty much exactly the same so if I search for Battle Royale Tycoon and there's my game oh yeah there's the seam sale I totally forgot it was discount anyways uh yeah so you can look at the characters down here yep they definitely match these characters so yeah that's another awesome thing when you make tons of projects tons of things you build up a library of lots of things that you can then use over time so yep all these Sprites that I drew this game was in like 2018 so I drew these Sprites back in 2018 that was like 5 years ago and now when I made this nice little overlay I was able to reuse the Sprites reuse the animation code and so on so yeah that is why I always talk about so much when it comes to uh writing good clean code and code reusability it's because it is this important like when you do something uh you can then reuse it and save a ton of time do you have a secret project uh yeah that's uh something that I've been working on which yeah i' like to do in a little bit but first I just like to to get this one working so I just need okay what did I want let me just try to do little bit nice have a nice day hey you too uh okay so basically I just want okay where's my let me go into the to the other scene that's the Character Creator scene let me go inside and over here why is it in Portuguese I don't know uh but yeah so inside let's go I basically just want to reference this just to be able to find so the frame table Navy let's just find this one here just to make the demo scene for tutorial similar uh oh crap how am I going to move this okay down there let me just move where's my I don't know where's my where's my scene let me just uh over here just put in there and yeah so basally for the character customization I really just need oh right I need the I need an idle animation so I'm going to have to do that what is the character pack you are using the one over here in the demo I'm actually going to talk about that in the oh crap oh right I removed it uh yeah this one I'm going to talk about in the in the video but yeah if you want to know it has a strange name it's called character 7 uh and yep it's this one so basically this is the pack that I'm using this pack that I'm going to be using in that tutorial which okay I don't know if I can say if it's spoiler alert or not but I've been told this one is going to be on sale so definitely don't buy it right now definitely stay tuned for for the for the future I hope I don't get in trouble for saying that uh but yeah it's uh so I'm trying to make the video in order to to come out next week and the video will come will come out when the thing is on sale so that if you're interested in following along or in just downloading the thing then you can do it Network object pulling yeah that would be an interesting topic uh but more interesting topic is we're only just doing things about uh client side did I not move this did I not move the object oh never mind I'm looking at the wrong project uh yep so basically looking into client side prediction that is the main thing that I very much would like to very much would like to work on okay let me just fix the helmet and then let me try doing the other scene and then I'm going to oh crap what material should I be using this one so let me just copy this one choose the helmet and put it not this one this the hair it's not the hair where's the helmet which one is the helmet this is not the helmet oh crap I can select it it's not this one okay it's this one okay so it's the hat that was the helmet NGO plus addressables is an interesting topic that is interesting how to load things dynamically that sounds complex but yeah definitely definitely interesting which games do you play in your free time uh lately I haven't really had any free time I mean I made that really interesting video on the uh on all the mechanics in uh Assassin Creed Mirage I really enjoyed making this I definitely want to make more of this but yeah so basically I played like 4 hours in order to be able to make this video and since then I still haven't gotone back to it I really would like to so yeah definitely lately I haven't really had much time to play some games but definitely would like to PR 500k thank you okay so let me just quickly try doing the other scenes on this one okay right I keep forgetting what I'm doing uh over here I really just want to add a simple uh animator do I have an idol animation this project I probably do Crouch I don't want to crouch an idol oh that's see Kevin's back very useful okay let's see if this has a regular animator long usually does it take to make a simple game uh that really depends on your definition of simple and also on your own skill set I mean if you're making something like Flappy Bird that's pretty simple so why isn't oh cuz I forgot to assign the Avatar uh yeah so for making something like doesn't this have an avatar this doesn't have an avatar uh if you're making something like Flappy Bird and you're very experienced like I'm pretty sure I could make a Flappy Bird colog in under an hour something like that so yeah that can definitely be done but yeah if you're a beginner I don't know something like FL bird would take like two weeks maybe I don't know it's been it's been a long time since I was a beginner and more than that it's been a back when I was beginner there weren't as many resources so yeah nowadays with all the resources with all the things hopefully it should be relatively easy in order to uh in order to be able to learn and do things doesn't this do I have to okay now I'm a bit confused I don't remember I thought this one came with an avatar premade didn't it let me go into my player visual just seeing hey Super Chat thanks so much I can't get past four views any tips oh boy uh YouTube is really extremely difficult so yeah I don't know that depends on what what topic you're going for are you going for tutorials cuz tutorials are indeed extremely difficult uh okay so I need to make the Avatar uh yeah making tutorials that is extremely difficult let just go make this humanoid from this one so yeah if you're making tutorials then yeah it is really difficult to get views I mean the best thing the the best tip that I can give you which is also a really difficult tip is simply focus on titles and thumbnails it's it might sound odd but on YouTube that's pretty much that's pretty much how it goes I mean the titles and thumbnails are the most important thing if you don't get a good title in a good thumbnail then it doesn't really matter just how good the video is so yeah it kind of sucks to say but that's how that's how YouTube goes I mean the content is obviously very important I mean after people click on the title and thumbnail they have to be able to want to stick in so so the video has to be good enough to keep them engag but before before the the quality of the video itself is important before that comes the title and thumbnail because if people don't even click then it doesn't really matter how good the the video actually is which is kind of the same thing as on scam if you don't have a good title a good hook if people never actually buy your game then doesn't really matter if the game is extremely good or not because if people never click on it then it doesn't really matter so yeah the best tip that I can give you study a lot about titles and thumbnails like if you want to uh study up on YouTube research like I high recommend col and Samir the the podcast really awesome podcast with very uh very successful people on YouTube so that is really great from learning from how people do uh they also got the Creator support that's the name yeah create support another excellent podcast by the same people they talk about YouTube so if you want to learn about YouTube strategy I highly recommend you go research because yeah there's quite a lot to learn I mean steam is really difficult for finding success with Indie Games but YouTube is just as difficult or maybe even more difficult so yeah definitely something that you have to really learn and at the end of day it also takes time I mean right now this channel is on a really nice uh really nice size I mean I just recently hit 500,000 subscribers so yep like I said thank you all so much that is an awesome thing but yeah keep in mind that it took me 5 years to get to this point so yeah even if you do everything right at some point it just takes time so hopefully that answer helped uh okay so totally forgot I keep forgetting getting what I'm doing okay so I just want to apply the basic character Avatar just get this one with an idle animation and then yep there you go ID anation pretty basic pretty simple okay good oh it actually changes that's fun uh all right T me how to use serialized field instead of public oh nice that's awesome that is trly one of the main things if you just learn that just that will massively increase the code quality of your games it will massively decrease amount of bugs that you find so yeah if you just learn one thing from my videos you you learn that if you learn to not make everything public then that is really awesome and if any of you are uh have been here for a short while then you might not have seen yeah pretty much a video on that topic so I highly highly encourage you to watch this video again when you focus about not making everything public when you focus on making things private and only expose them if they need to be exposed if you just follow that that one simple rule that will massively increase the quality of your code and that one thing alone will definitely save you a ton of headaches okay all right so this is so this should be good enough to then make the tutorial now let me see this one the detector this is another one that is really cool which is another it's kind of funny how I was working on my game and now that I made my game I've got tons of videos that I want to do on interesting things that I made in my game and one of them is indeed this one so let me just put this in 2D where's my air detector I saw one there it is the air detector a real nice window although hopefully it's a window that people don't ever see but actually they might they might end up seeing but if they do then it kind of helps to be able to tell basically this pops up whenever the code detects an error so that is something that is really useful so that is also going to be a tutorial that I'm going to be working on I want to purchase a St pathfinding but 50 it's a little too much I have to use Nev mesh yeah I mean if you've got simple use case then Nev mesh works just fine I mean I would say you only need pathf finding you only need that asset if you absolutely need the performance but at the same time I'm pretty sure that one has a a free tier so depending on your use case AAR path finding project I'm pretty sure this one has a free tier so thanks again for the Super Chat I hope my answer helped uh if you go into yeah there's a free version so yeah if you uh can't afford the paid version I would send look into the free version I don't know what this one has what are the limitations but I'm pretty sure it also has multithreading which is kind of like the main thing that I used uh that I used the ASD for so yep definitely try it out and hopefully that should help okay so let me see what did I want to do in this scene which is actually a scene from a tutorial that I already did and that now I want to do a bunch more things things oh boy this is way too sensitive oh crap yeah definitely whoa moving way too much all right so interact with this guy okay why is the text not showing up I'm not sure and why is it okay so I'll have to sort that out see why is the text not showing some kind of oh crap now my mouse is invisible uh use the old UI system or new UI tocket uh I would say right now still stick with unity UI just because UI T kit as far as I know it is still not production ready for uh runtime if you want to make editor tools and absolutely do use that but if you're trying to make uh ingame UI then yep I would say you absolutely okay okay so this one so it seems like I didn't cuz I'm pretty sure that I add a fix to this didn't I yeah chat bomb 3D I thought I did but apparently not because apparently this one needs yeah the hello inverted uh okay let me see where did I the chat bub on 3D so apparently I put this one wrong or maybe I just changed the code afterwards he that's it do shorts help you grow uh technically they should although I haven't really experimented with shorts way too much doing shorts for educational content is really quite tricky so so yeah that is one of those things that I would love to be able to do because yeah apparently they do work quite a lot but oh that's a thing really nice and open the door and yep that's good okay so that's the thing that I want to that I want to try out um yeah always use this un layout or try differ well I mean I Tred tons of un layouts until I found one that works and yep now I pretty much always use this so I've got my scene I've got my game view I got the inspector on the side the project with the console next to it and the hierarchy so yep after much trial and error this is pretty much what I've come to nice see you streaming hey thanks for being here yeah the stream got off to a bit of a rough start I still have to figure out what exactly that issue is but yeah thankfully now it kind of worked got to see my voice is already getting a bit messed up even though it's only been what like 30 minutes how long have I been streaming oh 45 minutes wasn't oh yeah started at 1130 I thought I started at midday yep how do you feel about unit testing as a solo Dev feel it's not really necessary although it might be beneficial for teams yep that's that's pretty much how I feel about it I mean I do think unit testing is really awesome really cool and I definitely try to write my code so that it could be testable but at the same time yeah for a Sol Dev I pretty much I have to write code NonStop and yeah pretty much just don't have time to actually write unit test so in my case I try to write code as clean as possible I try to write code as if I was going to make tests so I try to keep things nicely decoupled but yeah I never actually write tests just because I mean I have to be so fast in order to be able to make games in a short enough amount of time so that the games are successful so yeah I never really have time to do unit tests but but yeah I would say if you're a solo Dev at least write code that should be testable and if you are on a team then yeah at that point writing unit test could probably be uh very important so yep uh what was I saying oh right I was trying to talk about this scene just in case you haven't seen this scene this is the NPC interaction system it's one of my favorite tutorials that I've done I really like the demo scene that I've did so yeah and it's another excellent use case of interfaces so that is really awesome oh boy so many messages trying to keep up with the work and answer questions so just one second cuz I just got a okay let me actually uh all right so basically over here I need to this is going to be the demo for the error detector so basically over here I need to trigger a bunch of errors and the first one that I want is over here on the door so I got to remember how exactly did I implement this so I've got a door interactable and on this door interact oh it was the the script that I had open and that I was writing a bunch of random code okay so basically when I interact I talk on the door and over here how do I do this uh okay let's say because if I do this equals null okay that is going to force a n reference or simly if I remove that and I've never actually get the reference that is going to do it but I think it's only going to trigger the error once and I actually need it to trigger constantly so let's see that I don't have time to watch want to thank you for teaching amazing stuff oh that's awesome thanks for the kind words I'm glad the videos have helped you make a tutorial on UI yet yep that is one of the many things on my toal list I very much would like to but yeah finding time is always a tricky thing I've done a bunch of research and look quite interesting and it seems to be going quite well and okay got an error nice that's exactly what I wanted so yeah can you try my first mobile game uh probably not I don't really usually play mobile games so what are box and leather what is wrong with these box and Leathers okay I don't know but apparently a bunch of these box and Leathers oh they got negative that's strange all right anyways um yeah so let me just yeah that's the problem that it caused the error but just once I need to cause the error multiple times so uh okay so how am I going to do this uh basically just want to trigger an error on every single update so that I can then test out that the airor detector is able to ignore errors that had already seen before where the secret project that is a some really interesting questions a really nice system that I've been working on for a while and in a little bit let me just finish this demo and then I'll showcase that super secret project it's actually not that secret but yeah um okay but if I do it like this it's going to um let me do yeah basically just only set it if it's true obviously this would not be production ready code but yep how come you don't release for mobile that's because mobile is a completely different completely separate World in terms of marketing it's a completely different thing it's all about paying for user acquisition all sorts of things mobile is really tricky not to mention of course the input I mean being able to use mouse and keyboard versus touch that is always going to be quite a big change so you can't really just convert the game into Mobile with just one click requires a ton of work and then since I don't know anything about marketing on mobile chances are it wouldn't be successful so yeah that is why I don't really do it although I wouldn't like to go into consolle so I've been researching that potential because that could be useful since the game is already playable on a gamad should be pretty easy to put on a console all right so it is triggering the error multiple times Exel isign intended okay so that's good what were the other errors that I wanted uh oh okay so the other ones I'm going to trigger when there's the all right so yeah that's about it so I just need the dragable window what means production ready code I mean it just means that I I would not do this I mean this is this is very wasteful code why is it checking for is open and then setting the bullion in every update this makes no sense this is just a waste of performance the correct code is the one that was previously which is the one that I taught in the original tutorial which is it only modifies the bullion on the animator just once whenever the whenever the door Chang state so yeah that's pretty much what you do just change the state once instead of constantly changing it every time but for this demo for the air detector I do want the air to spawn constantly so that is why I'm writing this nasty code just to make sure that the air spawns so that I can actually do tutorial for the nice air detector consol is nice but do you require a Unity version from nintend to release on switch uh you do need to have Unity Pro in order to be able to export the consoles and beyond that I uh beyond that you need to make a account with the various Dev uh account things so a Nintendo Dev account a Microsoft Dev account something like that so yeah it does require that but in terms of software in terms of the actual code I don't think it should require much changes but we'll see I mean it's going to be the first time cuz I've never done a console game gam so that is going to be an interesting journey and if I can talk about it that's a problem cuz consoles those are all always behind some heavy ndas so I'm not sure how much of that process I can talk about but once I go through that process I'll see what I can talk about maybe make an interesting video how do you research uh love to do a video on that I'm afraid that would not be a very interesting video because research basically just unload up the documentation and I read through it then I write the script for the for the video then I try it out myself I figur out how to organize things so yeah I don't think it would make for a very good video just to be me right here staring at things so like for example I'm working on the video on the unity localization package so what did I do I mean first of all I've used it myself in my game but then I came here to the official documentation I went through the guides and they've got a nice a quick start guide for this one so just went through this guide in order to see everything that the package can do cuz I didn't use all the features in my Gam so I want to see everything in order to be able to really cover it and basically just I read through this every time that I'm reading through I've got a un window open on the side that I'm constantly trying this out trying to make sure that everything works that I'm also writing the script for the video and so on so yeah basically uh my research process requires a lot of silently reading so I don't think it would make for a very engaging video uh right uh okay so I'm triggering that error then I just need do I got the drag window here oh I do actually I didn't think I did but I do okay so let me just make a dragon ball window does this have a canvas do I got a canvas I do have a canvas and inside oh I've got the player interact you y okay so let me just make just remember how I made that so a window and then I'm pretty sure the window is meant to have something then inside I've got some kind of background and for the background let's put it something like this and then let's make another one for the title background uh make it a bit more gray and for this one okay so let me just make a nice window here so 300 300 put it on the top left corner and put one z0 okay and for the title background put it something like this so yep pretty much EX down like that for the window I'm pretty sure this one is meant to have okay let me actually just a second I'm not reading chat right now I'm trying to figure this out uh so for ttle background let me incur it on the top left corner like this like this okay so now I need to remember how that I may not the drag drop but the drag Windows because I want to make a window that's dragable apparently I need a reference to the canvas and the drag wre transform oh okay so I think this is meant to be on the ton background I think this is how it's set up okay let's see if like this this code already Works maybe my dog just just woke up so yeah I'll beit busy uh all right so I got the window a crap I forgot that I that I unlocked the mouse oh crap okay I didn't think about this how am I going to interact with the window I guess I have to lock the yeah CU like this ah crap okay this was a bit a bit tricky um myg is going nuts because he couldn't hear yours really uh okay so now I got to fix this okay so now this an interesting question so somebody was asking me how do I do research well this is part of the research process which is I want to do an error detector window I want want the window to be Dragon Ball So now how do I Implement drag ball if my demo already has a player that moves around so yeah unlock the mouse while that window is open yeah I think that's what I might end up doing even though I wouldn't really do that in a final game just because that would be really frustrating for the player but yeah I guess in the final game I would maybe do some kind of like Escape menu and on the Escape that actually brings up clears up the mouse H but yeah that is actually uh all right but just for demo cuz I really just want to get this where's my player where's my player capsule a crap now I don't remember how I set this up it's the first person controller so is this the one that sets the cursor uh was it the player interact because now I don't know where am I setting that oh make a tutorial showcase how you manage scene hierarchy like how you organize that stuff honestly when it comes to that I do something pretty basic like this is it so as you can see I don't really have a hierarchy this is the project for my game than you Gardens and as you can see I really just got separate scenes these are all completely separate I don't normally use additive scene loading uh so yeah pretty much just got a Lobby scene I've got a main menu scene so I've got all of these that get loaded pretty much just one by one so I don't really do much in terms of uh scene hierarchy I've got my character creator my character select my game scene and so on so yep although uh working on the learning more about additive scene loading that is definitely something that I would like to research just because it's something that I know a lot of people use but personally I've never really used it so but yeah in my case I don't normally do anything complex when it comes to that just do super basic keeping any uh right so let me just cuz I need to be able where did I where did I set the cursor. loock state equals lock mode. none let me just find the reference where on Earth am i setting this am I using the player character control maybe no because I unlocked it on the oh am I only putting it on all right or maybe it's this one ah crap cuz now I'm using this controller and I don't remember thank you for your work oh thanks for being here do you use Version Control not really for me my that is probably my most controversial opinion I guess the other day I post on post on rdit about okay so it does work okay that's all I wanted to see just as this works and yeah uh but yeah the other day like a few weeks ago there was a post on Reddit and I talked about my personal experience which is I really just create simple backups I don't really use any versional Control software just because personally doesn't really not something that I really need in my own personal workflow but yeah apparently a lot of people were really upset that I that I said no I mean I would never tell you to not use it no Version Control I mean if you like using it absolutely use it go ahead and use it just personally for me for my for my for my use case for the way that I work no I just use super basic backups like literally just take the entire project folder make it into a a RAR file and I just back that up that is simply it yeah it is a sort of Version Control just a very janky very basic one but yeah if you like using software I I definitely would not advise against it no by all means keep using it just personally yeah I don't really don't really use myself get help save my ass a few times all right so that means that it's definitely worth it so yeah definitely go ahead and keep using um okay so I just wanted to see if the moving the thing works so I really just got to figure out some way to disable the camera whilst the window shows up but anyways yep the window track does work which again a while ago I was talking about reusing code and this is yet another example of that so this is a video tutorial that I made I don't know window drag what did I call it no not that what did I call it drag Windows drag drag window there you go so I made this one in 2019 I made the code for this video and now I just reuse it in another tutorial so if you want to know how to drag UI Windows there you go so much freedom in trying out things without potentially breaking stuff that's true I mean I guess for me I don't necessarily need that I don't know it's just something that I definitely understand people who like using it absolutely and I do get that but I don't know my mindset is always if I try something then I want to get back to it then I'm pretty much just going to delete the code that I wrote and just get back to it so I guess I enjoy writing code so I enjoy the manual but yeah I definitely know that a lot of people prefer using tools and if you do by all means don't let me discourage you is it possible to make the window resizable absolutely you really just need well I guess you would use pretty much the same code as this meaning find out where the where the thing is clicking yes the developer I imagine that is yeah if you're already used to it then yeah it's uh simpler to keep using it uh so in terms of resizing you do pretty much exactly the same thing so instead of tracking clicks on a bar you would track clicks just on the edge and instead of moving the rec transform you would simply modify the transform scale so on the window you would really just modify over there the width and height maybe the position as well something like that anyways okay so this one does work with see your lives yeah thanks for being here I definitely would like to make live streams more regular so let's see if I can actually do that although yeah I got to say I I really don't get it how how people can doing live streams for 7 hours I mean I've been for 1 hour now and my voice already completely messed up so I really have no idea how on Earth can people do that but apparently I don't know apparently most people can do it without issues they can do well most people people who stream on like twitch like Len she TW she streams on Twitch every single day constantly for several hours and apparently her voice is fine so 15hour live stream Jesus that is insane that is crazy oh man check Avatar missions on the web oh did I not add it I thought I did but yeah I definitely got to got to update the website thing theye show more yeah I think that might be part of the issue is when I do a live stream I don't know I feel like if there's silence on the live stream that's kind of like my fault that's my problem so I try to talk as much as possible which means that in one hour of live stream I talk more over here than I do I don't know in an entire week of just living my own life so that is probably why just probably very intense for a very short period of time and my voice really gets messed up water Apple yeah I drink tons of water but it doesn't seem to work uh like I drink water nonstop but yeah it still gets quite a bit messed up okay so I just want to try out the tool tip canvas how do I try this one out um let me go into the player interact okay let's say when I interact with something let's go into the tool tip was it tool tip Canvas OR screen space cuz I'm pretty sure that I made multiple tool tips but now I don't remember okay now I don't remember but yeah I think this is the screen space canvas I like tea personally yeah I'm definitely that's only something that I need to try T and honey yeah how to relax The Voice what is your stream schedule I don't really have one I stream when I got something that I would like to do and I might as well do it on live stream but yeah definitely something that I would like to start doing a bit more regularly but that's kind of tricky since I work on so many things at the same time like one day I'm working on tutorials another day I'm working on some special project another day I'm updating my game another day I'm just doing research so yeah my life is very chaotic I do very different things every single day so that makes it hard to define a schedule for pretty much everything anxious coding live yeah that can definitely be concerning I Remember by now I think I'm pretty good at that at not panicking when something in the code goes wrong hey there you go there's my tool tip but yeah I remember doing a live stream like I don't know like two years ago one of the first ones that I made and I was doing something and the code wasn't working and it was quite stressful how I was live stream with a camera pointing at me and I was secretly having like a mini panic attack because the code wasn't working it wasn't so yeah that was definitely yeah writing code live is definitely a bit stressful although thankfully I think nowadays I'm a bit better at that but yeah that is definitely a challenge okay so that worked let me just increase the scale just make it a little bit more visible for the video oh T oh oh okay she P okay anyways right code not working is very normal oh yeah absolutely but the difference is that whilst I'm working just by myself that is a normal part of the process but if it's not working whilst I don't know 250 people are staring at me that is quite a bit more stressful okay so for this Demoine that should be good so the air detect factor I should be able to uh work with this a little bit and then record the video let me just see oh right the urp decals that is the other one so yeah for this project I don't think the shark the character customization I did that one okay so it's see localization and urp decals these are the two ones that I still need to prepare what time is it midday 41 yeah uh okay so let me actually let me close this project just so my PC doesn't get messed up with like three Unity Windows open at the same time uh now what do I want I want to open up both of these actually okay so let's see if that one do work why you win a stream reward quality stream with great attention to viewers thank you I mean I I do try my best I try to read chat but yeah sometimes it goes so fast that goes through quite a lot of things um how do you handle multiple Sprite based animations uh I haven't really done anything with too many 2D animations in quite some time but usually just using an animator and not using the the transitions usually that is something that really works you Bally just got separate animations each of them are separate Sprite based animations and you just transition instantly instead of having a smooth transition because that doesn't really work with Sprite based animations so you just got an animator with various animator States and you use code instead of the animation instead of the transition system in order to play one animation then play another one and so on what Happ to my avatar oh yeah it does what happened did you change it cuz if you change it then I have to manually validate so let me actually see if anyone made some custom avatars let me just open up that window uh validate player textures I really need to improve this system because takes quite a while in order to validate everything but yeah okay so that is taking a little bit to load and my window has already loaded and do I got uh what is this one this one is the miscellaneous one okay so that one is good thinky Guardians yeah probably don't need but leave that one open Drag windows and so on okay the basic coding is easy but is it hard to learn to more advanced concepts uh uh that's a tricky question just because I mean technically it is harder the advanced concepts are by definition going to be more advanced more complex but at the same time if you start from the basics if you start from the beginner level and you slowly increase difficulty of the things that you're trying to learn then by that point even though the things you're learning are supposedly more complex because you already have the knowledge of all the things before it hopefully that makes the learning C be nice and smooth it always gets supposedly more difficult you're always learning more complex things but hopefully the the learning curve becomes nice and smooth so everything is just slightly a bit more complex so the really the best thing is really just focus on the things that you are doing try to don't try to jump to something insanly Advanced like if you just barely learned about variables and maybe don't learn about I don't know interfaces right now focus on learning the basics and slowly get a bit better bit better uh yeah the more you know the more you know that you don't know that is that is definitely true I mean uh programming game development these are all things that have pretty much an infinite uh amount of learning so yeah the more you know the more you see that there's even more stuff to learn which personally I really like it I really love the idea that I'm going to continue learning Game Dev and programming for the rest of my my life I really enjoy it so I really like the fact that I'm going to continue doing it yeah run stream it's a default one yeah let me see if the if the little thing is updated see if any of these there are any custom characters yep there's one so let me validate that my website is a little bit slow so that is a bit something is there anyone else any more nope uh right so now if I upload the character yeah there you go there's the custom character again like I said all of you if you want you can make your own custom characters you can just download the Sprite and print it and where's my window there it is you can just draw your own custom characters from that link and then just let me know so I can manually validate it so basically it gives you a sprad sheeet like this one and then you can basically just draw inside these squares in order to draw a custom character which is a pretty interesting thing oh boy my voice already messed up all right okay what did I want to do on this one oh yeah it's on the urd counts so this is something that I'm working on update for my ultimate TNT overview course I'm trying to uh work on some lectures some sort of things using some type of compression also uh probably I'm pretty sure that that original Sprite sheet is like a th000 by a th000 whereas over here for the characters they are scaled down by some point so yeah there's definitely some compression the 3D model not really I've learned the basics and that was quite fun which actually by the way if you do want to learn Basics there's actually a nice sale on Humble Bundle right now so if you want to learn from the same place where I learned the blender Basics uh let me get the link there's actually a night oh not this one copy this one there you go so yeah if you want to learn the basics of blender then yeah definitely recommend I'm pretty sure it's this course yeah it's t by by Grant so yeah if you want to learn the Bas of blender I really enjoyed this course it was really nice I think it was like 10 15 hours so it took me quite a while to go through it but yeah I definitely learned quite a lot about modeling it's definitely not my skill set but at least now I know the basics so that helps me actually into interact with other 3D modelist and understand what they're saying so yeah if you want to learn I definitely recommend there's a ton of course here so if you're looking to spend if you're looking to buy something so you can spend the next uh month the month the the holidays doing something learning uh blender uh 3D modeling then I can highly recommend this one okay so on this one what did I want to do with this demo scene uh oh right I just wanted to it was actually not with this one it was the other one so now I have to open up the other project and I want the test 23 because I actually would like to try out Muse texture okay it's opening on the other window all right how to make selection character there's a billion things to do that but I would recommend you looking into my free course because on the uh multiplayer one I do include character selection so if you want to learn how to do that definitely look into that here's the course curriculum and yep there's a character select scene and you can go on YouTube and you can see how to make the character select where you can select from multiple characters and multiple things so yeah if you want the absolute Basics this is pretty much the most basic character select scene although at the same time time once this is basic is actually I was going to say it's the same one that I'm using in my game dinky Guardians and it is true but on that one actually the customization is done before that so it's a bit but yeah if you want to do the most basic things then it is that's a great resource um all right hey that was BL thanks for that he thanks for watching I hope it helped a lot okay so let me put this here and yeah cuz I actually still haven't tried out this so the new material generator so basically I would like to instead of using boring cubes in order to demonstrate over here how the decal projector how this one works I'll put this one on everything yeah even though the character move it off to the sign Yeah so basically I'm going to need some kind of pillar so let me reset that put that just something like this like some kind of pillar but I want it to be a bit more interesting and for that I figured I might as well try using this because I haven't I haven't used this yet how are you doing I'm doing well thank you thanks for being here need to actually complete kitchen chaos things have been so bus definitely take your time when you have time get back to it I mean the course is there forever so definitely don't speed up whatever you do just focus on exual learning so take your time go nice and slow and yeah thank for work thanks for being here thanks uh okay what do I want I'm just put concrete I suck at at thinking of think to do uh that's the thing I'm not an artist so I don't know what is a good looking texture now is this a goodlook concrete texture how do I make something a bit more oh yeah cuz I can use patterns oh so something like this could be fun could be interesting live in portal do you speak Portuguese yep see I was born here so yep even though I've been uh learning English since I was like 10 years old so yeah by now English is pretty much it's almost more natural to me right now than than than Portuguese if you're playing texture on default Cube make sure to adjust it oh yeah I need to modify the scale yeah cuz I scale that Cube so yeah that is going to be a little bit like that um let me put concrete but with some shape uh how do I get back to Generations oh that's strange oh so so if I oh it add its refinements on that one all right okay that looks good how do I turn this into a material is it that material preview is it previewing uh okay so that's the preview and the height let me massively increasing that was fun metallic no this should probably not be metallic smooth super smooth no concrete should probably not be smooth so now the main thing is because for my kind of texture Creator is this this is the uh Unity AI Muse thing for generating textures this is the first time that I'm using it so I'm learning as I go along secret part is the free C course that's actually not secret I'm pretty sure I've mentioned that yeah the next thing that I'm working on is a free C course so yeah the secret project is something a bit different but yeah going to be that in a little bit um drag from the com right what is that uh okay so this good how do I get this do I just drag it onto the project is that how it works so let me just oh what is that oh it saves the generations that's interesting uh okay so that save the select Generations onto the project okay so does that actually save or no okay so I'm not entirely sure how do I how do I save this what are these buttons is this oh these are the previews that is why I can't really see them okay so I'm not sure why is this not isn't it supposed it feels like if I click on there save the select Generations into the project you drag the material to the mesh yeah but I don't have a material yet so I can't do I drag it from here on somewhere let me put something here I'll make a 3D make a cube if I drag that one onto that one okay so apparently that do work thank you but that's strange how clicking on this button save Generations this one I would expected to save or maybe it didn't cuz where is this material where is this stored okay so now I'm confused is it a bug or something cuz over here this one doesn't have anything and I click on that one and this material does not exist anywhere is it supposed to exist like inside the other one you have to select the preview and then click on the save button oh okay okay I would say either I'm very dumb or that probably needs a bit of a better workflow cuz yeah if there's nothing selected and I click on it I would assume that it would download this one but apparently no apparently I have to select here then click on it and now it tells me to save on something so concrete material and now finally does save onto something okay so that's good that's what I want let me just okay I can't dock this window somewhere I can nice how to get this AI generated this is Unity Muse which has a if you were part of the beta you should have received an email with a with a coupon for 30 days free otherwise you can do the uh thing so yeah anyways so oh and shows the Muse points 89 I still haven't figured out what the points are s but anyways in beta doesn't matter so not going to worry about that anyways okay so I get my concrete maps and I got the concrete oh it creates all these oh I did not know that's cool I thought it just made the normal Maps hey someone asking does generate and yep it does generate I thought it would just generate the normal map but no apparently generates all of them okay so that's that's useful that's interesting that is interesting so if I put it on there and yeah I mean that does look like concrete I suppose so I guess basically the thing is I want to see if I can put this on another project and I assume I can so if I just show an Explorer I open up these now let me go into the other project which is actually on uh wait this is dinky Gardens not this one this one this one's on the 22 LTS so this one technically does not have thing but if I open up on project and I paste it in and there you go got my concrete Maps got my concrete and if I put it on this there and okay oh it's a Shader error I thought it was going to be a urp thing oh no oh crap oh that's annoying yeah it seems to be using a muse Shader oh that's annoying I definitely expected this to work so do I just need to copy the Shader where's this Shader can I save this Shader to a different place cuz yeah if you use a m special Shader does this use anything specific that only works on 23 let me see uh yeah save as let me save it on somewhere that why did that just open a new window I don't know hey congrats on 500k thanks so much thanks for being here I mean the only reason why I hit 500k is because all of you are here so I really hope the videos have helped you thank you all so much for watching them it's always a a fun twoway thing just like the differen Shader uh yeah I guess I could use just a different Shader but I tried copying the Shader will it import or does it have errors let's see it's thinking does it load up does it have any errors apparently has an HD unknown okay I don't know but it might work uh so let's go into the concrete and let's use Shad graphs and Muse material oh it works all right okay so that's cool so I don't know if they intentionally wanted Muse to be exclusive to uh to 23 but yeah apparently it's uh yeah it's the T but yeah so apparently you can use Muse on recent version so that's cool all right that's cool so basically I just want to try it out just to have an interesting place to put that but yeah I mean this is what this is what I think is like the best thing for the best use case for Unity AI like you probably wouldn't want to use the generated materials in a final game but for prototyping instead of using just a basic boring great box prototype yeah I think like this it can be quite good so like for example on this demo instead of having the scene like this I can have just this one off to the side let me grab the where's there you go the projector and yep I can project onto that one and yep like this I've got a bit of a more interesting scene all right that's cool so we're right now I'm just uh building up uh demo scene so I can then make some tutorials this one is on the urp decal projector which is an interesting one that I haven't really used Too Much be easier to use the Cindy protape as back sure yeah if you use any of the many material prototype packs that would also work yeah yeah that would definitely also work although I do think that since this is built in directly into Unity I do think this is actually it helps speed up iteration like instead of having to go into the accur in order to pick one of the many tons of free uh textures I really just write something here just use it and just drag it onto the project use it right away so yeah I do think in terms of speeding up iteration I do think this tool can be quite useful so yeah uh okay so D Gardians I don't really need this one anymore so yeah basally I just want to try that out and see so I might as well I don't know I guess my problem is I don't have an artist's mind so I can't even think of something so like what can I generate I don't know what kind of a wood texture tell me things to generate so I can try out this deal and see what it does do what do game objects need collider for the projector to work nope the or I'm pretty sure it doesn't like if I move this col nope yeah it's all cuz this is all just a uh visual rendering depth sort of thing so nope it does not require a cther in order for the decal to hit uh he look that some wood textures and yeah I guess this does look like wood so Mossy dirt Mossy dirt okay let's see that one that one sounds interesting generate a Code Monkey okay I'll try that when I go into the M Sprite hey Mossy D this is this doesn't look quite Mossy so if I edit this and I put it as a material does look like Mossy dirt and let's see on the scene view let me make a 3D plane heyu thanks so much for being here yeah thanks for the live streaming award that was a very unexpected but yeah thank you thank you all so much for voting that's a it's a fun thing coffee time hey thanks so much uh okay so it does seem to work for a Mossy dirt and if I put it oh yeah it looks a little bit low resolution which wouldn't be an issue by modifying the the scale but so I'm pretty sure this has a I put it on 55 yep there you go I mean this is definitely save no I don't want to save the shade graph yeah I mean this is definitely Mossy dirt yeah okay so that's uh that's interesting uh but yeah there was a upscaler sort of thing wasn't there great variation setus reference image something something like what Herring bone wood I'm not sure what is hering yeah low poly I guess the issue is that Terrain in low poly low poly usually doesn't really use materials but what did you say hering bone wood I have no idea what that is I assume it's a specific type of wood oh you can upscale is this that wood I mean these all look very specific types of wood so yep how do you up SC was on the drop down menu was how do I find the previous one which drop down menu this one oh upscale there you go I wonder how much is this upscale like 2K textures maybe oh that does look quite a bit more yeah let me go into material mode it's usually wooden Flor tiles yeah that does seem yeah that does seem more high resolution not sure by how much but yep there it is just need to play around with the scale yeah I mean like I said for basic protypes for quickly generating something I do think this tool can be quite useful I mean just have a player here and boom you got a player character in a nice thing let's actually put this a bit bigger so if I was prototyping a basic firsters player controller maybe 20 yeah I just got to play around with the thing but yeah so like this seems like a basic decent floor texture pretty much yeah and the main thing is really just how it like I said I think this is excellent for pro timing for iteration because it's built directly into the engine so anything I can come up I can add so it's quite interesting AI created Sky boxes oh that would be interesting yeah that would definitely be quite interesting floor is lava does this generate lava let's see let's see oh doesn't look much like lava or does it I actually don't know isn't lava supposed to be a bit more red I guess technically it depends on if it is or not so red lava does it do something it does I mean that's something so that looks like something that you could see in Mount Doom I guess if you has a PBR material try magma okay yeah magma would probably work but this one all seems pretty decent just constantly have to play around with the thing like 20 20 yeah I guess that is lava if I were to add some emission so would probably oh does this not have emission Ah that's annoying isn't it supposed to yeah I guess these materials don't or it's not the materials it's the Shader doesn't seem to have a mission which would be pretty easy to add so that seems like a bit of an emission bit strange but yeah looks like grass but just red yeah I mean if if it had some emission some glow it would look a bit more interesting definitely yeah try putting out style I mean technically the main thing one of the main selling points is how you don't have to constantly add all those parameters like d but yeah I mean by default they should all be table so I don't think needs so but if I make stylized lava texture I don't think this is actually very good for stylized stuff that looks slightly stylized I suppose these all definitely look very different so yeah I'm not sure how this works for specifically stylized stuff but I mean I mean that one actually seems pretty good always having to do that would be nice if this automatically adapted to something yeah I guess that is Source analized although it doesn't really look like like that yeah grass brick okay let's let's try that let's try a grass brick and on shape let's use a pattern so pattern kind of like this one okay let's try to see does do pixel tiles I don't think so I believe this was only trained on you know there's a model selection here Unity texture so I believe they haven't really tried anything with uh like stylizing so I think this is really only good for for um oh God what I want to say realistic yeah this is only good for realistic art styles but yeah grass brick okay these look more like bricks and grass with this one looks pretty interesting it's got a bit of grass but yeah uh oh it's trying to see import the black and white CNY image for getting the color important image like what kind of image you want an image of something I don't know let me pick I don't know like a a cursor hand what kind of image do you want uh cuz yeah wasn't this one supposed to have some kind of H yeah on the demo they showed some way of okay I don't know some way of drawing but how do I actually do that I don't know like if I want to modify like get rid of this part okay maybe that isn't included in this version cuz I'm pretty sure it was over here that they dragged something so yeah I don't know what is this image like is it going to do in the shape of a cursor if I click on so a grassy tile grassy brick and try to generate he going to generate a grip oh oh boy okay that's definitely all right it's in the middle top what is in the Middle top what am I missing drawing is for the Sprite generator yeah the Sprite generator does have that but I'm pretty sure on the texture they generate some textures it had a bunch of strange things there's a pen tool on top okay am I blind cuz I don't see it this one no oh this you mean this one no this is the ey dropper tool I don't see any pen tool in the shape no just say pattern just say go back before the hand bug back to what select this one maybe it's in here generation data what is this I would use something something it was there a moment ago okay I don't see any pen anywhere like this one has like a favorite up vote down vote something like that Branch I assume that clears create variations of this one export up scale something like that up what am I oh on the middle okay I guess I'm a little bit dumb all right okay good thanks okay yeah definitely uh okay so let me mask out this part and say this one is supposed to have but let's say lava so like got a brick with some mask with some lava let's see if that does does oh crap did you went back to okay it seems like it generated them but didn't really add any lava all right maybe that's a bit too strange uh B ring so red brick okay so it's not generating anything in red it is generating that part so it is working with the mask but apparently it isn't reading the prompt okay so I don't know if I'm missing something I don't think I am so I think this just I don't know General bugs things red moss covered brick so if I mask out mask out this area let's also mask out this area right here uh red moss covered brick and generate let's see what it does hey hey sh you thanks so much another Super Chat cute thank you Sun Val oh hey hey nice thanks for being here by the way you're new course on making a farming game looks really interesting so yeah great job on that does look quite interesting nice uh okay so yeah this one does seem to be broken maybe the negative prompt okay maybe they swapped it out accidentally just on the mask although it seems strange I mean at least the mask is inde the drawing a mask but yeah there's definitely something broken here because yeah look at that it is a bit the colors got a bit strange so like the negative seems to have kind of worked cuz the colors changed a little bit yeah yeah I assume it's a little bit broken since it's still on the Early Access I'll definitely make sure to uh I'm pretty sure I enable the VOD on this live stream so I'll definitely send over the VOD for this live stream to the uni team so they can see the issues that I had with the with the UI and with the thing sparkling symmetrical okay that's a very let me actually copy that cuz I don't know if I can write that that sounds interesting okay let's try that and patterns no patterns just like that a kaleidoscopic mosaic okay I mean it does look very although isn't kaleidoscopic supposed to have a bunch of colors sparkling colorful and something with a bunch more colors right yeah I mean this looks like a nice Mosaic this one as well that almost looks like a match three sort of background sort of thing huh let me upscale this and see what it does do you have the animation bot nope I need to yeah cuz that one is like okay it doesn't seem like that actually upscaled anything seems like it's literally the same image so probably another bug even though that one says 2K but I'm pretty sure my eyes are not deceiving me I'm pretty sure these are two exactly the same images so yeah D seems to be much higher quality yeah definitely that is why like I said I really think the the strong point for these tools are just for super quick interation super quick prototyping and not really for anything that you would use in a final game I think in order to get to that level it still needs quite a lot I mean but it does work it does generate something and if if I go and I increase the tiling and yeah I mean that's a mosaic so kind of looks like a strange bathroom of sorts but yeah that is a that's a background so you could put this on a wall yeah I guess I guess technically works let me see the the the other did I also install the other one I did the Sprite generator so I haven't looked into this one at all so let me actually close out that one so someone was asking so let's say codee monkey and see what does this generate let's see remove background this is one part that I think is inappropriate okay I don't know what's inappropriate about okay that is defin that's definitely very rough but yeah oh boy that's funny what is inappropriate about a Code [Laughter] Monkey oh wow yeah this definitely did not go [Laughter] well yeah I guess the Sprite tool needs to be for more things that you can that you can probably imagine because yeah that definitely does not look like any I mean that looks like a monkey I have no idea why code apparently means a pink shirt I'm not sure and apparently code monkey and lead you a lot of inappropriate content okay all right but yeah I mean these are monkeys so if I wanted the monkey Sprite I guess that would work uh so if I just write code what is going to generate where is secret project all right yeah I want to do that before I go so yeah uh how is code inappropriate and what is this I don't know I mean they the one they did on the live stream so a chicken TRex let's see what that generates pink shirt just in valid sh oh hey ha how's it going yeah I assume so I mean apparently it reads code and it thought Shader error I don't I don't know okay so those are chickens although don't really look like much of a TRex I mean this one looks sort of the beak looks right in pixel art I don't think this does pixel art on the awards hey thank you so much thanks sure it's appropriate to watch this broadcast yeah I don't know apparently something about that is inappro okay there's definitely there's definitely something going wrong with this to because apparently chicken TRex pixel art Apparently that is somehow inappropriate content yeah there's definitely definitely some rough things to be worked out on this one but yeah yeah definitely clearly still a few bugs clearly very much an early access release oh but hey I mean that does look pixelated I thought it would do it but apparently the pixel art does work so that part Works uh but yeah I think this was made primarily for like realistic stuff so if I do like a sword that one hopefully should be able to generate some kind of sword on adding game pable items uh Unity has some really great uh sample scenes on that I don't remember where they are though but yeah on the package manager they do have like the uh what do you call it a battle pass Unity battle pass sample I'm pretty sure they've got a sample on a battle pass which has a bunch of those yeah they've got a complete sample so if you're looking for that that kind of stuff I would definitely point you to their official samples which should hopefully help guide you in the right direction but I mean yeah I guess this does look like a sword uh so then what would I generation data no oh yeah I would do an export export sword.png and where's my where's my project where's my project and yep over here I mean this is indeed a sword Sprite I mean I think the best thing about this tool is the removal of the background that is something that usually has to be done very manually in all of the other AI generators so like I said I really think this to is really good for um for the prototyping stage like you need a sword there you go super basic sword you would probably end up replacing it with something else but yeah for something that you generate very quickly Yep this is definitely a sword but yeah definitely a lot of I don't know what is inappropriate about the the prompts that I use but apparently the tool did not like that uh try a tree yeah let's do a tree and see if it does a styliz tree or a realistic tree and then try out like a character or character by part something like that yeah I mean that's a that's a tree like this one looks pretty interesting I mean it's got the Flor whether you want it or not but yeah works better for things that are easy to find yeah I guess that's it which is kind of interesting because in theory like the goal of generative AI is generating things that are completely random those are usually the examples they give but yeah I guess this two would be better for things that are more normal rather than yeah rather than something that is very very unique very different but yeah and if I write a character what is it going to do I'm playing around with this and I have no idea the points okay apparently I just spent a th000 points I don't know yeah the points that is going to be another thing that is quite a bit tricky but hopefully they improve that over time okay yeah these definitely look quite rough say if you want to draw a tree or a sword that seems to work good like a coin so like for basic things that most most uh basic things that most games use it's probably going to be pretty good but anything more yeah keran might need more details given yeah definitely okay those are actually some very rough coins I definitely would expected to generate some like like a super basic gold coin so these are definitely quite a little bit rough we can use this as it on Steam technically yes because they said that they own all of their inputs so technically that does mean that you should own the the outputs for all this so technically that should not have issues although nobody ever knows what seam is actually going to do so that is quite tricky but yeah I mean this is a coin so if I were to create a2d object oh did I not install the Sprite package I didn't so let me just make a2d image instead to the image with a coin and put a coin and yeah there you go I mean that's a coin so yeah where is my canvas oh it's on the corner there all right yeah yeah so technically oh crap so Tech that is indeed a coin okay sure but yeah definitely the tool still needs quite a bit of work definitely very early access so yeah yeah but I'm curious to see how this improves over time with more training with more feedback from people it should hopefully be quite interesting question about multiplayer using Unity username and password so how can I make players search for each other uh you can't by default meaning I don't think Unity has a builtin tool for finding things I mean you can use the lobby and you can make a public Lobby and then automatically find the hey nice that's a fun one uh you can use the lobby service but by default you need some kind of server some kind of thing that has data of all the players that have signed in so I don't think Unity has any builtin thing for that of knowing which users are online at what time at what time so yeah you pretty much need to do something we kind of like have a general game Lobby like as soon as the player starts playing you send some data to a server that says okay this player is now starting to play then show that on the list of things but at the same time you should probably do uh I would probably just use Lobby so for that use case if you haven't seen it my tutorial on Lobby is pretty nice pretty not that one that one it's uh pretty good so I would probably use Lobby for that use case um okay dice again yeah pretty much all of these these are all very very rough but technically that is a dice I mean obviously the dots are very strange this looks very odd very odd but yeah technically for a quick prototype that would definitely be passable as a dice so yeah this looks unusable yeah right now it is definitely very rough uh but yeah curious to see how this to improves over time yeah uh okay what was I doing right so my super secret project which is yeah the uh so basly the secret project is this the question of the day so basically this is if you've been following the channel for quite a while you've probably seen me post a bunch of questions every once in a while on the unity Community tab Unity on the YouTube Community Tab and yeah so basically what I finally managed to do is after a long time I finally managed to work on this which is basically making an automated system so I wrote a bunch of questions and every 3 days I've got an automated thing that post the questions for example this question what is the significance of January 1st 1970 so is the is it the SCM release dat on the magnax Odyssey which by the way cool tip I think that was the very first console thing so yeah or is it the start of Unix time and this case yep I'm pretty sure that one is the start of Unix time and if that is correct that's a nice scen yep which are Unix s samp so if you don't know what is the significance of this date that is pretty much uh a Unix s samp is just an INT counting every second laps and every sing of laps since January 1st 1970 so Unix SS are super useful so basically the the secret feature is I've got I've automated the process of making a bunch of questions uh then I also have it to make automated emails so if you want you just get some nice fun questions in your inbox they get generated every 3 days and then you can try to answer the the question hopefully learn something new and then you can read a lot of detail on the various on the answer in order to understand okay so this one is Rel to Unique s Sams like for example if you don't know how to get a unique s Sams in C you can do it just like this so you can get that I've got a bunch of related videos where I used all kinds of timing logic all kinds of things so yeah basically you're telling scarm was not released 197 no probably not if they did that was definitely that would definitely be the work of a time traveler uh but yeah so I've got a video going more over in detail on this and basically for this system the one thing that I still need is I still need to edit a ton of the questions so I think I've done up until 25 and for the other ones I've got pretty much just an idea so basically this is where I this is my back end for writing the questions so I write a fun question like this one when create a new script you always have to extend modern behavior then the options yes no or only if you want to use that as a component and the answer is obviously see so you only need mon Behavior if you want to use it as a game object component ni making the tutoral about uni RX is that a testing tool or a dependency injection pretty sure I've heard of it uh yeah so anyway so mono behavior is only necessary if you want to have the functions called automatically however it is not absolutely necessary so basally this is the back end where I write the question I write the answers and all the things and then that turns into this page so this is the page that you would see you would see the question you try to answer it and then you see a bunch more details so hopefully it's a nice fun way to learn by answering a bunch of questions and it should be fun on a bunch of topics a bunch of things helpful links to help you learn a little bit so it should be fun what software you use for your website don't really use any software I mean for me my web dep skills are super basic like literally Bare Bones I pretty much just use the knowledge that I've gained oh crap the knowledge that I've known for about 10 years now so basically just basic HTML basic JavaScript basic PHP which as far as I know nowadays in webd PHP is pretty much I don't know it's supposedly horrible but for my super base use case uh it does work quite well so I quite like the language so it's an interesting one so yeah um yeah so basically I just need to continue so let me see if I can do like question 26 what is this one next place we need WR final text time to go hey bye thanks for being here that's cool PHP is awesome nice uh okay so yeah so basically I've got I've written 25 questions and a bunch of things so yeah I'm going to need to kind of write all of these so I've got a bunch of draft questions so I've got the question got the answers but then the answer is really simple so I've got about 70 of them written so I've still got about 50 of them to really flash out make something a bit more interesting so hopefully this should be a fun way to to learn answer a bunch of questions every few days and yeah this is something that I've wanted to do for quite a long time because I do think that it's a fun way to learn an easy way to learn integrate with GPT for automatic question generation uh probably because I don't think I trust it enough to know that it's accurate so I definitely want to do them manually based on my own knowledge so yeah I definitely want to do them manual but yeah over here like this it's um finally managed to automate this process so it's something that I've wanted to do for a while and yep I've got a video talking about it in more detail before I actually enable all this on the website because right now it's not yet fully enabled but yeah it should be fun what advice would you give to someone who wants to make games on their own meaning how can one learn a lot of things in this field so one can improve the answer is start with the absolute Basics so for me the main thing that I would point you to is to my free 10hour course I think that is a great one for complete beginners and people who are more intermediate users so I definitely encourage you to start from there and basically just remember that it takes time and focus on actually learning things so slowly learn the basics learn bit by bit and over time you will gain quite a lot of knowledge oh hey TJ hey thanks for being here nice yeah there's always more to learn with un yeah absolutely I mean part of the thing that is really awesome about these uh about these questions is how they are the S thing is automated and song random so of the 70 questions that I've written there are a bunch of them that I don't remember so I will also be receiving these emails and every once in a while also learning or remembering from the things that I that I've known in the past so yeah it's also going to be fun for me since it's such an automated thing as opposed to being manually manually me picking everything so yeah should be funing y get appreciated in the future nope I mean IM am GUI is still is still uh workable in the editor so so yep nope the UI I would say don't worry about it being deprecated if anything people are going to complain that Unity now has three UI systems because they don't like to deprecate things so yeah it's going to be pretty much like that thinking about jumping to the VR space yeah that is definitely one of those areas that I would love to would love to learn so yeah it's one of those things that's been on my todo list for ages and yeah it's always hard to find the time I mean when I was at unite I did see a talk about uh it was specifically from meta about their Quest three and specially about mixed reality about the pass through and does seem quite interesting and they do have quite a lot of quite a lot of new what do they call it like blocks like templates so like you want to get just a pass through working you literally just just drag a template and automatically sets up all the scripts all the things so yeah that is definitely one area that I very much would like to get into just need to find the time that is always always my issue be life support for animations is a big issue on uiit yeah that's that's the thing that I've heard that making animations is still not possible not doable so that is why I haven't really gotten into UI toet just yet because it still seems quite a bit underbaked how would you handle RTS resources in multiplayer uh I would handle it the same as anything else so pretty much only the host handles the resources only the host actually has like the resource manager thing only the host handles the totals and all the clients they ask the host okay do we have resources to spend this if so yes or no so yeah pretty much the same thing as on my on my multiplayer game on the free multiplayer course over here I also did um the recipes the recipes these are also the way they are generated and the way they are spawned randomly these are all only happening on the host so the host is the one that manages all of that choosing all the recipes which one to spawn so yep for an RTS this is only the same thing that I would do only the host manages what resource actually exist have conflict multiple clients no because all the clients they don't store any resource they just ask the host okay do we have enough wood to place this and then the host tells you yes we do and the host actually place the wood and so on so you wouldn't have multiple resource managers you would have just one on the host the client simply ask the host can we build this or not want to learn programming patterns from you that's actually something that I've wanted to do for a while is making a course just based on programming patterns I think that would be quite fun so one of the many things on my tun list if I can eventually get to it then that should be fun plans for gdau courses or tutorials not really I mean just uh Unity is really the thing where is all my knowledge so the reason why I have this channel teaching is because I have 10 years of experience making games with unity so if I went to a different engine it would take me quite a long time in order to get comfortable enough with the engine in order to feel like I can actually teach the people so yep pretty much planning to yeah what Happ to your Discord server I just couldn't keep up with it that's that's pretty much a simple answer I mean I'm already so busy trying to answer all the comments every single day trying to answer uh all of the emails all the course questions and so on so yeah trying to keep up with Discord which specifically is a real time time thing that was very very tricky so so yeah that is why I couldn't really make it we have tutorial on these guys walking around I do I do on the end of this page if you go to the bottom of that page over here are the tutorials for how I made this oh boy my voice is really messed up so I really really got to go so if you're curious how I made this this whole thing down here this is a transparent TNT window for the character these are using mesh based animations for interacting with YouTube API that is a simple HTTP request and for the characters how they are randomly generating these are the exact same code that I use in my game battle Tycoon so yep if you want to learn how I made this that is pretty much it okay game programming patterns yeah I've heard great things about that book I really need to get it but yeah I've definitely heard that recommendation quite a while so yeah I definitely would love to because honestly my issue is since I never went to college I don't really have a uh what do you call it like an official knowledge of patterns like I know how to write code I know how to use various patterns but if you tell me if you ask me what specific pattern am I using here I probably couldn't tell you I probably couldn't tell you what is like the factory pattern I know that involves a factory that constructs an object something like that but yeah I definitely have an an issue with finding the names that people use to refer to things so yeah I would love to read that book in order to basically assign names to all the knowledge that I already have I think that would be quite fun so I would love to love to be able to do that okay so I think that's going to be it because my voice is really already messed up like I said I have no idea how on Earth do people do 12hour live streams this seems really impossible oh man I'm really messed up anyways okay so yeah thank you all so much for joining me I hope this was interesting educational entertaining I hope so I definitely would love to do these more often if I can find a way to set up some kind of schedule but yeah anyway it was fun I did manage to do a bit of work so preparing for a lot of future tutorials a lot of future things so got a lot of work to do a lot of things to do but yeah thank you all so much for being here and yeah let me just set this up put up the background and pick up OB Edge and yep all right okay so yeah thank you all so much for being here here I hope you found it interesting so yep thanks so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye everyone thanks byebye
