hi there this is a quick tip for how to easily display a somewhat common rectangle using a sprite renderer this is very simple but still very useful let's say I want to make a health bar in my world now a very simple health bar is simply just a rectangle however in here if I create an empty game object and I give it the sprite renderer component you can see that it is not visible at all essentially I need to add a sprite in order to actually see it now what I could do is just create a texture with a correct shape so in here I have a simple health bar rectangle it's just a red rectangle and if I apply it and there you go there's my helper however using this method will force you to create a new texture for every different bar that you need a simpler approach is to simply have a white pixel texture in your project it is very simply just a white pixel as you can see it is a single pixel and this way we can apply it to our game object and then modify its scale to get whatever size we want and since the pixel is in white we can easily tint it into any color that we want so we can make this one and also make a background behind it and just like that we have a very simple health bar being created and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time you
