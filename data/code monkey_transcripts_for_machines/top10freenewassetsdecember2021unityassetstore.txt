hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the ssor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights for december 2021 in this first video i will be covering a list of free assets and in the next ones i will be covering paid assets and tools check out the phone playlist to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also right now unity is having their endofyear sale for these free assets naturally that doesn't matter but if there's any paid assets you've been waiting for then this is great there's over 8 000 assets currently discounted including many that have never been discounted previously so if you've been watching the s highlight videos for these past few months chances are some of the ones i mentioned in previous videos they are currently discounted go ahead and check it out with the link in the description alright so starting off with a really interesting one made officially by unity it's a bunch of animal characters some greatlooking models and these were primarily made to work with the unity live capture so that's a package that can do live face capture which is then used to place one of these characters on top of your face on live during runtime that's a pretty interesting use case but even if you're not using that package these are still some pretty nice looking models these would all be a great starting point to make the game kind of like animal crossing and up next here's a really nice and simple tool it does exactly what you expect it lets you create game objects and color them to make them real easy to find and easily organize your hierarchy you can use any color you want and create whatever categories you need in order to help keep your hierarchy organized next up here's a really interesting one it's a bunch of hand poses nicely animated you use an animator avatar to add these and animations on top of whatever animations you already have there's a total of nine poses there's a fist pistol thumbs up okay phone and more it's a really interesting asset to make your characters come alive then if you are making a game inspired by the worldwide supply crisis then this asset is perfect it's a shipping container features lots of sizes and multiple color variants including going from clean to dirty so yep this one would be perfect for a very specific type of game then over here is placer this one is a level design tool so you have your scene with no extra objects then you select a prefab or multiple prefabs from your project files and you just start clicking in your scene there's lots of level design tools but some of them are way too complex i like this one because of its simplicity and it seems like it works great then perhaps if you need some trees to populate your world then here's a really nice low poly pack features 12 stylized trees a bunch of plants and even a bunch of stones quite a nice amount of variety for a free pack and up next here's an interesting tool called vts charm i know vtubers are becoming more and more popular although i'm not very familiar with it myself this one is a simple script to easily interact with the v2 studio api so whatever the original api can do you can do it while inside unity and again unity can make games or just a nice application for example a while ago when i was making some live streams i did make some programs to control my live streams and the characters on screen and that control panel was indeed made with unity so if i was a vtuber then this would be great for also making a control panel for that avatar pretty interesting then if all you need is just a nice rpg character here's a great one it's a pretty nice style would fit perfectly on pretty much any kind of jrpg there's a nice amount of detail it's a nice model and it comes with seven animations attack item run stun and so on then if you need to make some curves here is curved designer there's already quite a lot of these assets some freeze unpaid this one looks pretty good and it's free it's all based on splines which if you want to learn how to work i actually made a whole video on that topic you just click and drag the points to make any shape then you use that shape and extrude some form of mesh from it and finally another interesting tool here is vertex it's a tool for visually displaying your mesh datum so that can be your uvs or your normals or even some custom data it's definitely a niche tool but if you have issues with your normals or your uvs then maybe this one can be really helpful all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unity assessor for december 2021 there's links to all in the description stay tuned for the next videos covering paid assets and tools there's lots of awesome stuff there check out the phone please to see some more lists with free and paid assets and let me know if you pick up any of these and
