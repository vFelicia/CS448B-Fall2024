hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so here's a quick video on a program plan you can follow to publish your very first game now the idea for this video actually came from a comment that I saw it's on the video where I talk about seven Game Dev mistakes that can destroy your games which by the way the video has chapters in case you want to jump into each of those mistakes so here's the interesting comment by Callum which says start working on my first game after finishing your kitchen chaos tutorial about a week ago in case you don't know kitchen chaos is my free complete 10 hour course it's great for beginners and even for more intermittent users and then I've watched many videos from Jason Wyman and yourself so I have the idea of starting with some simpler Games first hammered into my brain planning to get this first one done by the time the next infest comes around and here by the way I do think this is an excellent very practical plan for your first proper game keep it extremely simple something that you can make in about two months participate in the Sim festival and then launch the game as for myself I participated in the atlassian festival with my own upcoming Sim game thingy Gardens like I said my reply go for it the plan does sound great make a game until October release a demo on the next fast spend the money month afterwards improving the game based on demo feedback and release in November or December if you follow that you will learn a ton one thing that I've mentioned a bunch of times is how finishing games is actually a skill anyone can learn how to make games and anyone can start making any game but taking it to the Finish Line is another skill entirely and it's one that just like with any other skill you gain with experience a lot of people think that just starting games is enough so they have dozens of Unfinished prototypes with nothing really complete now I truly believe that one of the best things that ever happened to me was sort of randomly which is how I started working with flash and the way the flash gaming scene worked that was all about small extremely small focused games so in the five years that I was making Flash games I finished about 40 complete games and then I had dozens more of Unfinished prototypes I truly think that experience was extremely valuable completing all of these games really taught me how to finish games and finish that skill that is why my advice to people is both start and finish games don't just keep making unfinished prototypes if you do then you will simply never learn all the skills that are required to actually finish a game all the things that only come up on the final stage things like Polish option menu save systems localization input methods working with the steam backend or really just learning how to create satisfying endings for your games if you never take a project to completion then you never go through all these steps then the other thing that can't mentioned that I very much agree with is participating in the steam nextfest this one is coming out in October participating in the festival is something that is absolutely essential nowadays if you want to find success you need to worry about marketing and a crucial marketing step nowadays is similarly participating in a steam Festival once again going through this tab this is going to teach you a lot you won't get your first taste of family feedback which is both a great and a terrible thing learning to listen to feedback and be able to identify what are the things that you should pay attention to and learning how to withstand Sometimes some very harsh criticism learning that is yet another extremely valuable skill that you definitely must gain and once again you only have the opportunity to develop this skill if you take a project to completion so if you're the kind of person who tends to get stuck in analysis paralysis then here's a very simple very practical plan that you can follow and before we get to the actual plan if you need any assets to make your first game thankfully there are two excellent humble bundles running right now there's one with tons of visuals effects and animations of them in a realistic sound for example this excellent weapon pack there's a bunch of realistic gorgeous explosions if you've got some Villages elves Landscapes a ton of strange creatures some more Landscapes and also packed with a ton of animations over 2300 so this is a huge pack with tons of visuals it's worth 2500 bucks and you can get it for just 30. or if you need some sound effects here's another huge one again this one has over 10 000 sound effects files in over 20 hours of Music everything from some retro ones there's some hot VFX a bunch of voices some medieval some Asian there's lots of music soundscapes and tons of stuff again with a huge discount just 20 bucks go ahead and check out both bundles Link in the description and just one more note UNT actually invited me over to unite which is happening this year in Amsterdam in November this is their conference which is finally coming back in force this year the past few years it was either remote or it was split into tons of tiny conferences this year there's a really big one the tickets are available right now it should be fun so hopefully I'll see a bunch of you there back to the practical plan so step one either take whatever project you're working on right now or come up with a brand new project importantly make sure you pick a very small scope so don't try to make the next GTA or Skyrim pick something you think you can make in about a month and a half as usual people always under my estimate time so if you pick something that takes a month and a half chances are it's going to take you about three months so the goal always pick something that is slightly more complex than something like Flappy Bird but not too complex once you have the core game idea decided then step two is to quickly prepare a steam page and set it as coming soon this step will basically teach you how to get familiar with the steam backend what assets are required in order to make a steam page and how to do it well learning how to make a great scene page with a bunch of gifs and some really nice text and bullet points that is yet another skill and once again another one that you don't gain if you don't take partisan completion related to that is kind of a bonus for this step which is go ahead and start learning about marketing maybe start experimenting with some devlogs or shorts maybe some gifs or Reddit posts start researching about any game marketing and experiment with it to try to gather some wishlists although again at this point they're going with this game is not Financial success it is simply learning so don't worry too much about numbers you just experiment and see what works go ahead and watch my video on marketing and follow the links that I mentioned there for a specific timeline this step should be done roughly within the first month so before the end of August you should have a public coming soon page and start Gathering wishlists then step three is work on the game and get a demo fully playable by October although suddenly actually steam has a really short registration deadline registering for the October Festival they don't really end in midjuly so technically you cannot right now go ahead and register for that next verse but you can definitely publish a demo whenever you want so while you cannot participate in the Fresno official you can definitely make a demo build and publish it at the exact same time again since the going with this plan is to start and complete your first game then this is not a problem you will learn how the team back end Works in order to make a demo which is not what you want absolutely require for more serious projects So the plan for step three is to publish a demo on October 9th this means you have to have your game playable by this point it needs to have beginning it needs to have an end now it doesn't need to be super published or necessarily have all the content but but it does need to be a satisfying if short experience again working on this demo won't give you a taste of what it's like to complete a mini game in order to have a successful demo make sure you watch my video on how to get a wish list and make a good demo for the scene Festival then as the festival rolls around you'll listen to all the feedback from demo and you analyze all the analytics take that and build your game bit by bit until the very end of October by then you should have a near complete game then just spend some time punishing the game publishing everything that you have adding all kinds of tiny animations and effects that make the gameplay feel very satisfying and trying to only step four is either in November or early December you publish your game although keep in mind this step is not just pushing a single button the goal is release the game and then listen to player feedback so read all the reviews read all of the Forum posts if there are playthroughs on YouTube go ahead and watch all of those it's really important to see how people actually play your game rather than just reading text the goal with this step is basically learning how to analyze feedback and figure out what part of that feedback you should take in order to make your next game as best as it can be note how in this entire plan there is absolutely no mention of money or sales success anything at all the going with this plan is simply learning that's it for your first game learning should be your only goal any money that you make is really just a nice bonus once you have gained the knowledge from following this plan then for your second game you can hopefully put everything you learn into action and make a much better game with much better marketing which indeed May yield some Financial results now just one more note for this I should say that this plan is meant for people who are slightly above the complete beginner level if you are a complete absolute beginner if so then instead of starting with this plan I would recommend starting with some something quite a bit more simple for complete beginners first of all I would recommend following my free 10 hour course if you go through the whole thing and you pay attention then by the end you will have gained a ton of knowledge and of course don't assume that you can go through a 10 hour course in just 10 hours the goal is learning it is not just politely watching for me it took me several years to learn all the knowledge contained in this course so if you manage to learn it in about a month or several months that still means you're doing much better than me after that I personally recommend what I covered in my seven steps to become a Game Dev video I recommend making some super simple games things like Flappy Bird or Space Invaders these projects will help you get familiar with the engine then just go ahead and make one or two one month games mini games that take just one month to complete so these should be slightly more complex than things like Flappy Bird but again nothing too complex always keep the scope in check and after you go through those then you're ready to follow the plan in this video and since we're talking about a plan to release Steam games if you found this video useful you can help me by adding my own game thank you Gardens your wishlist also don't forget the 2x on bundles in case you need some assets or sound effects alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
