hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this video let's do a quick overview of what is the current state of unity dots although more accurately let's look at the state of entities the only reason why i put dots in the title is because there's still quite a lot of confusion and if i just put entities in the title then a lot of people won't know exactly what that is so as a quick refresher dot stands for the data oriented technology stack and that stack is composed of three things ecs the entity component system or just called entities then it's the job system and the burst compiler of those three the job system and the burst compiler have already been fully production ready for several years the only one still in preview is entities so when you hear dots remember that it composes of three things and two of them have already been out and right now there's actually already been some games launched that used dots in various ways one of them was diplomacy is not an option it's a really awesome castle defense game with thousands of units so it's very clearly using dots another one is zenith in less city this is a vr mmo on a massive scale with tons of players and enemies it's been monumentally successful and extremely well received by players and critics alike they talked about how they use dots in this year's gdc how entities help them in many ways it was really interesting another recent example which also found massive success is v rising great game i quite enjoyed playing it myself i even made a video recreating the very unique sunlight mechanic and this is also another one that also had a really interesting dev breakdown on unity switch so even though dots is still technically in development there's already been some games putting this awesome tag to good use so over here let's do a quick overview to check out the current state of entities this is not a stepbystep tutorial i'm waiting for the final phone release before i do a fullfledged tutorial on it and speaking of that final release the most important thing about the current state is the current roadmap they unveiled an updated roadmap a while ago and the goal is to have entities hit 1.0 by early next year they are targeting to have it production ready alongside unity 22lts so around march or april next year as to what 1.0 entails we can look at the other cards on the roadmap to get a nice idea importantly is a ton of ui and ux improvements for me i haven't touched dots in about two years and back then it was already really awesome in terms of results but it was definitely lacking in terms of basic tools of the editor windows you had for inspecting things they were all just mountains of text that was really difficult to navigate you couldn't even click to select a specific unit you had to find it in the entity list and somehow selected from the thousands of entities in the world so one of the main goals for 1.0 is to fix all of that to make it so it has regular ui windows with the same level of ux that you're used to in the regular unity tools so here in the roadmap we can see hierarchy windows showing both game objects and entities you can visualize components systems and archetypes and very important scene packing so being able to click on an entity to select it then also on the roadmap are some more debugging tools compatibility with game objects so the final goal is to use a hybrid approach meaning using game objects where it makes sense and using entities where that makes sense in the beginning when dots was announced a lot of people thought the future would be pure ecs but now it's looking like a hovered approach won't be the best approach entities is also meant to come with its own ecs based multiplayer which is going to be really interesting using entity is going to allow for a massive amount of objects all of them correctly synchronized in multiplayer then of course entity is great for a large scale simulation that's exactly one of the things that entities allows that is simply not possible with game objects and finally of course lots of learning content entities and dots is really awesome but it does have quite a steep learning curve than just learning game objects so that's the current state of the roadmap for me the important part is really just 1.0 next year but let's look beyond the roadmap into the current state of the package right now you can use version 0.51 in the latest unity 21lts version in case you don't know this was the huge update that happened recently about three months ago unity basically stopped updating entities publicly for about a year they just worked on it privately and then suddenly they came out with this roadmap and a huge upgrade to version .50 and now 0.51 there were quite a few changes from the old version 0.17 but at the same time not really that many changes meaning that if you like me play the round with dots when it was first announced all the core concepts are still the same you still have entities you still have components and systems there are still archetypes memory chunks trucks and so on so the videos that i made on dots quite a long time ago those can still be very useful for learning the car concepts behind a more data oriented approach although of course to make the code in those videos work requires a bunch of syntax changes and thankfully on the documentation there's a really nice page to help you convert a 0.17 project into 0.51 so if there's any old projects you have that you'd like to play with again or maybe follow some old tutorials then you can follow that upgrade path it all looks pretty simple you just need to relearn the new syntax for example job component system has been replaced with system base the dependencies for all the jobs have also been simplified so you no longer need to manually handle them yourself the code definitely looks quite a bit cleaner there's also changes to ijaw for each being replaced with ijob entity and again looking at the code side by side it's definitely cleaner the main complaint about dots since it was first announced is that it looks extremely complex and has tons of boilerplate code so these changes from 0.17 to 0.51 these definitely show that they are going in the right direction of making it easier to write good dots code netcode for entities which is the multiplayer part also got some updates as did the hybrid renderer and the dots physics there is also now a new build process so rather than going through final build like you do when building a regular unity project nowadays with dots you install the platform's package then create a kind of build configuration and use that to make the belt i wonder if this is just a temporary thing that will later on be integrated into the regular build pipeline this is the one part that still looks quite a bit janky so those really are the main changes of going from point 17 to point 51 based on most these changes it does seem that work is continuing in the right direction then the forums they also continue being very active with lots of people asking questions and unity devs entering them so for the current state i would say that everything is progressing nicely and the roadmap to hit 1.0 by next year doesn't look to be on track the question remains which is how much more different will 1.0 be from the current version 0.51 they say that it's a breaking change as you would expect but based on how easy it is to upgrade from point 17 to 0.51 based on that it does seem like upgrading to 1.0 might also be a pretty painless process so perhaps if you have a game idea that you're planning to launch by next year maybe you can start researching to see if dots can be useful for that project and definitely make sure to check out those dot songs from gdc and the recent vrising interview they are great to see how studios are already using it in final games even though it's technically not yet ready also unite 22 which is unity's big conference this one is in a few months in november so i'm guessing we'll also be hearing a bit more about dots in there and also another quick mention if you're interested in dots then a great channel that does primarily dot's content is turbo makes games johnny is constantly up to date with everything related to dots and doing some tutorials on the latest versions so if you want to play around with dots before i make a phone tutorial on it next year or you just want to keep up to date with the news and updates and definitely follow his channel as for me like i said i'm going to continue watching from the sidelines with a lot of interest i really think dots will open up tons of possibilities for the types of games that you can create especially since for me the types of games that i like to play are usually around strategy or management games with lots of systems lots of objects and everything interacting with one another so for those types of games i do think dots will be very much a game changer so the current state is looking great and i'm really looking forward to the future alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
