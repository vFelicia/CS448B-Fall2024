this video is made possible by my game bomber play seven awesome games and help support the channel get the steam game bundle at unity code monkey comm slash game bug in this video we're going to look at the awesome topdown shooter I made in just seven days you can play it for yourself and here we're going to see how it was made a lot of the elements I used were completely made from scratch in previous tutorial videos let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with enough tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing alright so here let's check out the topdown shooter I made there's tons of elements and mechanics that were completely created from scratch in previous videos and put together in this nice mini game the game is very quick and fully playable in your browser so check the link in the description to play it for yourself the web page where you can play the game also has links to all the elements that are used in the game so you can go and see how they were built as always you can download the complete project files for this game from the website and if you watch the videos for each specific element you'll be able to easily understand how the game was made and also this video took a long time to make and it's a bit of a different format than usual so please don't let me know what you think of this type of content where I take a bunch of elements made in previous videos and make it into a complete game for example what other minigames would you like to see made like this maybe a survival crafting game maybe a city builder our management game something like that so let me know in the comments ok go ahead pause the video and play through the game check out all the mechanics and elements used and then come back here and continue alright so if you're back here I assume you've played through the game now as he saw it contains quite a bunch of interesting features if you've been following the channel for a while you will have recognized a bunch of different elements I always try to emphasize the value of writing clean reasonable code so am I going with this minigame is to show that in action the reason why I was able to create something this complex in just a few days isn't because I work 20 hours days but rather because I reused a ton of elements made previously and put them all together into a nice complete experience so we're here in the editor you can see an overview of how the game set up how it's built and all of the various scripts attached to all of the objects okay so let's play through the game and I'll talk about all of the different things that were used but before we do that this video is made possible by my game bundle playing awesome games and help support the channel by picking up the discounted bundle on the website it contains 7 games in a variety of genres start off with some strategy in the survivor squad games control your group of survivors and make sure you cover every then get your controller out for some action with a bit of strategy in hyper lights quickly around and demolish your enemies with a bunch of unique really cool abilities capture castles and outposts while recruiting allies and moshing enemy Knights then work your brain with some management games build up your village trained ninjas and send them out on missions to get gold in ninja Tycoon then set up a complex chain of resource gathering and process them to craft more complex objects and make a profit in blueprint a [ __ ] and then chill out by running your own game studio in the awesome game Corp TX by playing those games you won't be able to see what I'm teaching here in action and you'll help ensure these videos stay free for everyone so go to unity code marcom slash game bundle and pick up the discounted game bundle okay so here we are in the main menu which is you can see it's extremely basic now when I click on play it's going to load the game scene so first of all that one is using the scene manager that I covered in the unloading video and the buttons here have some nice behavior handled by the button class on the utilities so let's start and just like that we are transported into the game scene and here you can already see a bunch of elements already news first there's the cinematic bars which show up and then hide themselves then there's the camera phone system which is smoothly moving the camera to follow the player as well as the mouse position as I shoot you can see that there are some sounds playing those are handled by the sound manager okay now let's go through this door and enter our level and over here we start off with our two nice enemies I try to design the enemies to be simple but also unique so as you can see this one is a wrench and me so he's throwing some chickens and they have some very nice particles behind them and the projectile look great then over here we have the charger which charges towards the player and it feels really great when I can dodge them so now let's take care of them and as I shoot them and there you go charger and yep there you go now the enemies are also using pathfinding so when we go over here and take a grow from these and there you go now they are following me correctly following the path so that's C pathfinding and they also have some very nice damage popups as you can see when I shoot them some nice damage pop ups and over here we have another enemy with some really cool design the shooting enemy as you can see there are these two lines merging together and when the angle between them is zero he fires and I get shot however if I dodge just before you can see that I can dodge it because I keep some invulnerability frames lost I'm dodging alright so let's take them out and then over here in the corner there's my nice second weapon so it's a very nice shotgun so when I shoot you can see a whole bunch of different effects first of all there's the weapon tracer rounds so you can visually see where you're shooting at then we have the ball jump particles as well as the enemy particles which were made in the mesh particle system video alright so let's keep going now here on this side you can see that the key that we need to grab in order to open up the door in there and in this room there is a really cool little script that I made to handle a battle so I might make this into a separate video since it's a very nice little system so as I touch the key the door won't close and some enemies won't spawn okay so let's go and there you go the door closes and the enemies get nicely spawned and there you don't look at that nice awesome to solve effect as they get spawned get most of that very nice so now let me take care of all these there you go they're fun wat and the Dodge works great so I can keep dodging them keep shooting them and almost there all right so there they go all right so we're safe and over here we are carrying our key so we can now go back into our nice door so this is where we're using the key door system we made previously this is now the second game that I've used this system you can also see it in action in the FPS game I made so as you can see in the UI I'm currently holding the blue key and here we have the pool door and as I approach it yep an animation plays and the door is now open all right so let's keep going and now over here we have a bunch more enemies there's a charger there's a nice range of enemy firing chickens and the particles will look really nice and on the enemies you can already see when they die they transform into a flowing body and flies away and fire some odd particles there we go very nice okay so over here is the red door and we need the red key so let's go all the way in here and then we have another nice enemy and it tries to hit and there you go take care of them and then here we have our nice third weapon so we have a rifle pick it up and there you go now this one fires a lot more a lot faster now here we have our key and again we have some more enemies being spawned with a very nice to solve effect so there you go take care of all of them and yep very nice weapon all right so far so good so now we can actually go back and open our nice red door so let's open the door go through it and heal up and there you go now we have the final door going into our final boss fight now if you've played the FPS game I made then this boss fight won't seem nicely familiar the main differences over here we have it in 2d instead of 3d and the main boss is actually a sentry gun turret which looks quite great so he's all the way in there I can't actually see him now the sentry gun was actually made a really long time ago for Survivor squad so go pick up the game bundle in order to play that game and now let's see if I can go through this boss fight and talk at the same time ok so as I approach him you'll see this door closed behind us and then some enemies won't start to be spawned and yep there's the enemy the door closes and now he starts shooting and some enemies won't start being spawned in here I can still dodge him and I can shoot him and there you go now he goes into the second stage so punch more enemies continue being spawned I gotta take care of them and dodge them and I gotta take out both of these shield transformers and using the Dodge is great for the invulnerability so keep dodging keep dodging and take it out and yep there we go now it's vulnerable again and also some very nice pump pop ups yep there you go okay so now with the turret venerable I can shoot it and they're gone are we going to the next stage with even more transformers and even more enemies being spawned so I constantly have to dodge everything and shoot them and this is very very hectic but also the mechanics all work correctly and very nice with each other all right so they're you he's almost done and keep shooting in there we go all the enemies get down and as you can see he dropped the Greinke and I picked it up immediately all right so just like that we defeat in our nice boss fight awesome so that was really intense but also a really great battle so now let's heal up and again another shader effect when we heal is the nice sprite tent and now with our nice green key I can go all the way up here and open up the nice green door in order to win the level so keep going over and over there we have our trophy and I go and I pick it up and there you go I've won the nice mini game so here you can see the cinematic bars showing up again as well as a nice zoom based on the camera system and an awesome animated outline effect made in shader graph all right so this is the nice mini game I've built these past few days as you can see it's pre complex or something made in such a short amount of time so the reason for that is simply due to the fact that a lot of these elements were made previously since the way we initially wrote them was using some nice clean code they were easy to adapt and add on to this project so I hope this serves as a great example as to why I should focus on writing clean reusable code now on the page where you play the game you can see links to all of the elements that I use here so if you want to see a specific element more indepth then go check out those videos you can also download the complete project files for this game from the website and if you watch the videos for each specific element you'll be able to easily understand how the game works if there's a specific element you see in the game that I haven't let me know in the comments for example I'd like to do a video on the viral spawner system it's very simple but it's a nice design so I think it's something that can be applied to many other games and also this video to come on time to make and it's a bit different from my usual format so please let me know what you think do you like this format where I take a bunch of previously made elements and put them together into a complete game what other minigames would you like to see made like this maybe a survival crafting game maybe a city builder or management game let me know in the comments and if you did enjoy the video please hit the like button and share it with a friend that really helps out the channel a lot so thanks for watching and as always you can download the project comes in a tony's from unity karma calm subscribe to the channel for more Ginty tutorials post any questions in have in the comments and I'll see you next time
