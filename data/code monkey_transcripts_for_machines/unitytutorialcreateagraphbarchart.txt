hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're continuing to create a graph in unity we're going to display our graph as a bar chart instead of a line graph let's get started so here I have my graph from the previous video we now have support for dynamic horizontal scaling and vertical scaling as well now depending on what values were trying to graph it might make more sense to use a bar chart rather than a line graph so first of all let's clean up our code and here we're using two different names and here we're creating a circle but then we're using a dot connection game object so that is not clean code to keep things consistent let's make own references called dot and here's a visual studio tip if you press ctrl R R you can rename an object in our code it won't automatically rename all instances of that object so in here certain game object won't be the dot game object and the create circle will become created dot the last circle game object becomes the last dot game object and up here the circle sprite becomes the Donal sprite and finally down here the dot has the name dot ok our code is now cleaner all our references are consistent and called dots so let's make our bar chart for now first of all we're going to go up here and simply comment out the line graph code but later we're going to make both types usable so let's just comment this out and comment this one okay so in here when we're creating the dots let's spawn a bar instead so let's go down here and make a private game object and call it create bar so in order to display our bar we need two things first we need the graph position of our value which is going to be the same that we used for spawning the dots and then we're going to receive the width of each of our values on our graph so in here I'm going to receive a vector two for my graph physician and a float for my bar width now for our code let's copy the dot code Seraph dot we're going to call it a bar it's also going to have an image but it will not have a sprite if you don't set a sprite on an image component it won't just display a solid color which is exactly what we want right now we still want to anchor it to the only one left side so this is correct and our ink position will be the graph position and now up here when we were previously spawning two dots let's spawn a bar so we're going to spawn with new vector2 for my x position and my Y position and for the bar width we're going to give it the X size going to store the reference to our bar game object and add it to the game object list so it can be deleted okay let's S&C for spawning a square where the dots used to be yep there you we now have squares were used to have dots so let's make these squares into actual bars back into our create bar function for our anchored position the X is going to be the same as we're receiving in here on the graph position but the Y will be 0 since we want the bars to originate at the bottom of the graph so my anchored position will be a new vector2 on the graph position dot X and then 0 and for our size Delta we're going to have the X as our bar width and the Y as our graph position dot Y so let's test it out ok as you can see the size of each bar does appear to be correct but obviously the position is not it seems the bar is being scaled from the center which is located at 0 there are two ways we can solve this first of all we can move the anchor position to the middle point between the bottom and the chart position or we can simply set the bar pivot to the bottom middle and the bar won't scale upwards from there so let's do the ladder so in here what's going to our right transform and modify the pivot which is a vector to the vector two is a normalized value so for my X since I want the middle I'm going to give it point five five and for my Y since I want the bottom let's set it to zero so this way the pivot should be on the center and the bottom so let's test it out and yep there you have it we took our line graph and we convert it into a bar chart you can see the first value has a height of five which was the value in our graph and the second one of about ninety eight and there it is if you want the bars to have a different width let's say in here sending our entire exercise let's just send 90% of our exercise and this way we can spawn bars with a bit of gap between them so there you have it we have transformed our line graph into a bar graph in the next video we're going to add the ability to switch between bar chart and line graph as always you can download the project files in new Tonys from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them ok see you next time
