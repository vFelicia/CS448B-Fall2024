here's a quick unity tip did you know that you can set the number of lines that you see in the console the default is three lines like this which shows the message and also a bit of the call stack but personally i like my console to be as compact as possible so you can go up here into these three dots and select how many lines you want to show if you want to see the constant for every message then you can choose a large amount or what i prefer is to just select one line and it only shows the message then if you want to go deeper you can always click on it to see the phone message okay subscribe for more tips
