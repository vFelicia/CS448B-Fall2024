hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top 10 upcoming unity games in 2021 all of these look awesome and they're also quite varied which is a great showcase for just how powerful and versatile unity can be i started by looking on the upcoming steam page and did some research to identify which ones are being made with unity so the order is based on number of wishlists so let's begin starting off with number 10 where we have spacebase sartopia this is a sequel slash remake to startopia which is a very bollocks game from 20 years ago it's a simulation management game where you run a space base with tons of inhabitants you need to keep them happy make sure your base runs smoothly and make a profit there's also combat with competitors and space pirates features an extensive single player campaign a configurable sandbox mode as well as competitive and cooperative multiplayer i've never actually played the original despite leaving the genre and hearing tons of good things about it so personally i'm looking forward to this one next up at number 9 is 12 minutes this is a very unique game with an interesting premise you are stuck relieving the same 12 minutes and need to find some way to break the time loop it's a really interesting premise it's also got some big names as voice actors with willem dafoe james mcavoy and daisy ridley the marketing for this game has been excellent every trailer they release just uses mystery and suspense then at number eight we've got ruined king on league of legends story this one is notable due to the fact that a massive studio like riot chose unity as opposed to making their own engine league of legends is massive and this is just one of the several games i have announced that exists in that same world of the other games they are working on are also being built with unity this one is a turnbased rpg united party of league of legends champions and set sail to the shadow isles to uncover the secrets of the deadly black mist i haven't played league of legends in quite a while but i really like tons of champions so seeing them expand this world into various genres is a great thing and before we see the

supporting the channel next up at number 7 we have the great looking rts starship troopers terran command this one is based on the movie of the same name and the movie is awesome and definitely the perfect source material for an rts so this seems like a great match i live games with tons of units and this one definitely has that the game emphasizes tactics by using true line of sight enabling you to set up ambushes you've got lots of units at your disposal basic infantry with assault rifles and frag grenades you've got rocket troopers and defense turrets as well as some airstrikes and giant mechs the source material really is perfect for this genre so i hope that this one turns out very well and at number six we have the tenants become a landlord and deal with tenants as you build your rental property empire take care of your tenants design and polish up your apartments invest in new deals and make a profit it looks really good with a nice slow poly style and tons of props to really design your own apartments just like you want them the tenants have various needs happiness and a bunch of sets so this seems like a mix between the sims and something like constructor it's a really interesting concept and a new nice entry on the management genre so i really hope it's well executed then at number 5 we have knights of honor 2 sovereign this is a fresh take on the realtime grand strategy genre become a king and take control over europe choose your court carefully and determine the destiny of your people do battle either automatically or by taking direct control commanding your units in an rts style battles so this one is an excellent example of just a scale that you can build while inside unity it promises accessible grand strategy with enough depth with religion diplomacy city and more but none of the confusion play it in single player or with some online multiplayer i've never actually managed to get into games like civilization or crusader kings so this promise of accessible grand strategy does make it very appealing next up at number 4 we have chris nails it's a very common phone very goodlooking classbased jrpg experience the past present and future simultaneously watch as your choices dynamically change the future it seems like a very interesting timebased mechanic master strategic turnbased combat and uncover a fascinating story and characters this is a great example of how you can achieve such gorgeous stylized visuals inside unity it also has a demo that you can try out and then at number 3 we have carlson this is the game being made by fellow youtuber danny honestly i'm very impressed with what i've seen so far this is his very first commercial title and it already looks great it's got a very solid premise for some reason it's all about milk there's some interesting mechanics and it's extremely well polished if i just saw the trailer without knowing anything about it i would definitely not have guessed that this was someone's first commercial title there's tons of great movement mechanics that really sell the sense of speed i would say this might end up very popular in the speedrunning community in terms of marketing this is also a great case study his videos are extremely compelling and entertaining where obviously he mentions that you can wishlist the game on team and that strategy has certainly worked it's up here at number two with a massive amount of wishlists it's fighting toe to toe with other games that have teams of hundreds of people if the final game ends up good which i believe it will then this will be a massive success and all of it made by a single person definitely very inspiring and by the way if you find the video helpful consider subscribing and hitting the like button it really helps out the channel at number two we have humankind it's a historical forex strategy game where you run through the whole course of human history start off in prehistoric times go through the medieval age and end up in the future combine up to 60 historical cultures and lead your people face historical events take impact on moral decisions and make scientific breakthroughs each game element is historically authentic customize your own leader avatar and involve it over the course of the game as your civilization develops show off your custom avatar to your friends in multiplayer matches up to 8 players master battles on land sea and air use cavalry infantry and boats constructs each weapons to besiege and occupy cities if you're into forex games and this looks like a solid new entry into genre and finally at number one we have party animals actually on seam it doesn't say 21 is the release date but according to a comment by the developer that is main goal this is an interesting case where a game found massive success with a demo which in turn led them to receive a lot of publisher interest which gave them the resources to really build out their whole vision it's a good example of how powerful a great demo and great word of the mouth can be it's a wacky physics game where you fight as fuzzy fluffy creatures fight as puppies kittens and other fuzzy creatures interact with world with a realistic physics engine based on how the demo was so well received this could be the very next big hit alright so those are the top 10 most won games made in unity and launching in 2021 according to steam wishlist it was great to do some research and find out how many of these games are using unity as you can see there's tons of variety in designs and complexity which really showcases the power of the engine you can make games that are simple and cartoony or complex and realistic i've gone further down the list and saw a bunch more games using unity so let me know if you'd like to see another video like this showcasing some more games i think it's great to highlight what games can be built to the engine which means that really your only limits to making your ideas a reality is really just your own skills don't forget for unlimited time the first 1000 people to click the link in the description will get a free trial of skillshare premium membership
