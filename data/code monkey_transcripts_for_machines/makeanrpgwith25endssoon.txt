then use for anything do some level design very easily make some nodebased tools get a better console and even the awesome odin inspector which by itself is already worth it so all that is some really awesome stuff and all of it you can get for just 25 bucks in total everything is worth over two thousand dollars so it's a massive 98 discount if just a single one of these looks interesting to you then the whole thing is an excellent deal i've certainly picked it up myself right away this is a pretty quick deal and in only a few days so if you're interested definitely get it quickly the link in the description is an affiliate link so if you use it it's the same price to you and you'll also be supporting the channel and of course with this being a humble bundle some of the proceeds also go towards charity and they paid some very important ones so that's always a nice bonus let's inspect some of these assets to see what they do and what they look like there are some tricky things with some of these regarding urp so make sure you watch this whole video to learn more oh and one more thing i think the voucher issue has already been fixed but if not if you don't see the assets in your my assets list just go into your unt id and select your organization then you can manually assign seats for each asset also there's timestamps in the video if you want to skip ahead to a particular asset or tool okay so the main one is of course the rpg builder it's a massive tool for letting you easily build out just about anything you could possibly need in making an rpg the original price is 180 dollars so that's why i said if just a single one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it it really has all of the features you can think of so you can make some characters factions items loot drafts crafting enemies quests and tons more this is a pretty complex tool but they do have some very good very detailed documentation with tons of tutorial videos so make sure you watch that in order to learn how to use it here let's try out the demo scene first up you start off on the main menu and you have the ability to make a new character or continue so it already has a save and load system when you make a new character and up here you can select the various races so by default there's all human then you've got a bunch of stats and some points that you can add you also have a bunch of interesting game modifiers so tons of interesting systems then you type in your name select your gender and hit on create and you see the unloading screen also has a nice image shows the progress on the bottom and so on and then yep here's the demo with some really simple nice controls the developer is very active on discord so if you have any issues just go there and ask any questions then yep here is the demo so i got my character that i can move around i can jump then you've got a skill hotbar at the bottom with all kinds of abilities so i can do a real nice fireball another one that is a frostbolt i can even spawn a companion then over here is an npc i can approach i can talk to him there's a nice dialog system so as something says something there's also a really nice sprint so it zooms the camera and makes the character go faster pretty nice then all kinds of weapons here so just approach look at the weapon pick it up and now i can open up the character window as well as the inventory and with some basic drag and drop i can simply equip the weapon there it is also a really nice tooltip so with my staff i know i have a basic attack that i can use over here is a table for doing some anchovy so mix up a bunch of recipes and get a bunch of items then this npc here with the exclamation point so he's got a quest for me so i can see see all the quests accepted see what i have to do any rewards and so on then up here some dummy just to test out all these skills on things and everything there's also a nice working mini map up there on the corner there's also resources scattered throughout the world so there's a nice system for approaching resources and simply gathering them then you can go into combat and the enemies have got some nice ai i can also apply all kinds of debuffs to them so that one is now frozen when the enemies die they obviously drop some loot and then there's also some resources that you can simply mine so just on this demo you can already see just how capable this is just how many features that has by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks now in the editor the main window is up here on blink open up the rpg builder now one quick note here normally i use unity on the light skin but it doesn't work very well with this window so the text over there is in black so i can really read it there is an option to change it from dark mode into light but it still causes all kinds of issues so for example as you browse around there are some buttons that have a black background so this tool is really meant to be used in dark mode and also another note which is over here i'm using the builtin render pipeline now this is a tool so render pipelines aren't really relevant for the tool itself just for the included demo some of the materials used in this demo they can be upgraded automatically but some cannot because they use some custom shaders so do keep that in mind that you can definitely use the tool using anything since it's just a tool but when you want to try out the demo make sure you're using the builtin render pipeline just to make things easier okay so on this window you can build out everything you can click up here on the icon to see the main menu and see each individual menu so for example if you go into combat and click here and go and see all the various things so for example how would you make a new enemy well you would go into combat then over here into npcs and then on these buttons here you can either create a brand new one completely from scratch or you can just go to one of these preset ones let's say the skeleton soldier and just hit on duplicate and there you go it creates a new copy and now you've got all kinds of things that you can change so you can give it a completely different name you can give it a different icon and over here you've got the prefab setup so this is what will actually have the visual for your new enemy then you've got the avatar the animated controller and so on then under combat you can define all kinds of factions so what faction does this enemy belong to you define all kinds of abilities aggro links respawn and overheating loot table so what's this drop a bunch of stats movement and so on so as you can see tons of things you can play around with to make each enemy really unique just one thing which is when you make some changes make sure you hit on save so as you can see this tone is super easy to use and over here you've got all kinds of things that you can do for example abilities make a bunch more abilities change these around then over here for the factions so add some more change how they interact each other so for example humans are hated by the animals but they are neutral against critters then in the main menu you can go and change all kinds of world settings search them over here on the quest change all kinds of quests that you have define some tasks to be done some resource nodes set up some dialogue which by itself already has a real nice download window so again just click and drag and you can make all kinds of interactions so as you can see pretty much every single rpg element that you can think of this tool can definitely do it and one of the main selling points is you can do all this without having to write a single line of code now for me i love programming so that doesn't really appeal to me but i could definitely see this as being super useful for very quickly making a prototype and testing out some specific idea so that's the rpg builder if you take the time to learn this tool it can be massively useful then for some assets here's a pack with a bunch of characters all of them with a bunch of animations included so one of these could be your player or maybe your enemies here i've got the pack imported into my project now as usual let's start off working with the builtin render pipeline so right now i'm using urp so for this pack you can run the automatic updater so just go here update the project materials and now some of these update automatically and some do not now the reason is because they are using some kind of legacy shader that does not automatically get converted so it's using the standard double sided which for some reason apparently urp doesn't know how to upgrade that one but this is an easy fix you can just manually change into the standard shader do it for all of these ones so just put them all on the standard and now run the upgrade again and there you go now all the characters so here you can see a bunch of great looking characters and all of them got some nice animations as well as a bunch of nice weapons alright so these look pretty great now there is another pack with just one very high end character also with animations now this one the demo is actually made to work with agrp so on the console you might see a bunch of errors but if you're using urp those shaders are also included all you have to do is manually change them so go through all the materials and then up here instead of using the clothing shader hdrp just go into the same one so the dawn shader urp and then up here replace for the urp so just apply that and manually change all the shaders for the urp version so just change them all and also this scene since it's made to work with hrp all of the lights are very intense so you can just disable these lights and on directional light set it to much less and yep so here is the demo with the only working character so as you can see this one the demo contains a bunch of cloth a bunch of animation so everything looks pretty nice it's a bunch of enemies both with a staff as well as a bow and then all kinds of variations that you can apply to this character so again also a great looking highend character for some more tools another excellent one that is also included is the odin inspector now i actually did a full review on the odin inspector quite a while ago go check out that video if you want to learn some more about it essentially it's a tool for helping you make your own tools which can then help you be massively more efficient as you're making your game it's absolutely excellent and super easy to use so again i think the home bundle is worth it just for that one so if you don't have it yet then this is the best opportunity to get it again go check out my review video to learn some more and then that video also includes a quick getting start guide so you can see just how easy it is to use for some environment there's a bunch of interesting ones so there's these modular houses they work great with urp without any issues here is the demo scene with all kinds of houses all of them look pretty great and they're all made up of individual modular pieces and the demo scene also has a real nice background so all those mountains look really cool so this would be a great starting environment for any kind of game you want to try out and since this whole thing is made up of modular pieces for example a while ago i covered the house building system so you can download the project files for that video and use them with these modular pieces so just grab one of these walls make them into objects and then build your own houses another great environment is the mountain trees pack this one supports all the render pipelines so inside the asset you've got the various unity packages for agrp or urp and yeah this one has some really good looking trees so some with a bunch of snow some really with tons of snow and some of them that look pretty normal and as you can see the trees themselves look very very good and of course they also have a wind shader so there is a nice way to them so if you have an rpg game idea that takes place in the forest then this one would be a great starting asset or maybe if your game id involves a castle this pack is awesome also supports urping this one looks really great really awesome and there's tons and tons of assets all of them really high quality so you can browse around see you've got a bunch of insides a bunch of outside scenes of them looking really great so yep this is another awesome pack so you can see just how big it is just how many things it contains really awesome and once again this demo scene would be awesome just to import it and there you go you've got a real nice environment to test out your next game idea another interesting tool is dream text splines so it lets you very easily create all kinds of splines now if you don't know about splines or bezier curves i actually cover them in detail in another video they are super useful and what i covered in that video is really just the basics so what this asset does is it takes that and it builds upon it so whenever you need to design some path for something like maybe the trajectory of a ball or maybe the path for the camera to follow in those cases splines are insanely useful and of course if you want to dynamically generate some meshes like some curved roads well splines are perfect for just that there's also tons of ui elements with this pack it's got all kinds of different buttons a bunch of sliders a bunch of toggles then you also have all kinds of frames with some really good art a bunch of icons some more sliders health bars a joystick then tons and tons of icons a demo for a main menu then we're for a downloading scene and so on also included in the bundle is a cloud system works on all of the render pipelines it can make some really good looking clouds and they are also very performant so that's already tons of stuff but there's quite a lot more in the bundle for example you've got a pack for some mobile tools so this one helps you integrate some ads achievements leaderboards and so on there's also a bunch of them with some sound effects so a fantasy ambient sound effect pack and up here another one with some fantasy sounds there's also another rpg builder here i haven't tried this one yet but also looks very capable if you've got a bunch more environments a bunch of low polytone so this bundle is excellent there's also a more advanced console congratuator a bunch of visual tools and also a bunch of games for you to play so yeah that's tons of awesome stuff you can get for a very low price like i said if just a single one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it personally i would say if you don't have odin yet then definitely get it just for that one i made a phone review video with a getting started guide so you can see exactly what that asset can do and just how much it can help you this is also a pretty quick deal ends in only a few days so if you're interested definitely go ahead and get it now all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
