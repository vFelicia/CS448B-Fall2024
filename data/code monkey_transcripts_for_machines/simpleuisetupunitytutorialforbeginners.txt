hello and welcome I am your code monkey and in this video we're going to cover the setup for the UI let's get started okay so here I have an empty scene it only has a basic 2d camera now in order to keep our hierarchy clean let's start by making a game object and name it game Hamlet we're going to put this on zero zero zero and drag the main camera onto it this is just so our scene hierarchy is organized inside it let's make another game object and name it the UI you can leave it on any position but personally I like to put it to the side so let's put it on a thousand and a thousand on the said this way you can view it in the scene view next to the game view so it doesn't block the origin of our action or game scene so this game object in here won't be the container for our you want let's go right click and create a UI canvas as you can see when you create the canvas the event system gets automatically created inside our canvas let's create a UI image just so we can see something in our game view so as you can see this square is a UI image being displayed in our UI now in here in the canvas we have several different render modes the screen space overlay mode displays a rectangle on our scene view and any UI elements you place inside it won't be visible personally I'm not a big fan of this one since it keeps everything very busy the other main render mode is screen space camera which allows you to assign a camera that will then render your UI this is the mode that we're going to use since using a camera allows us to do a lot of really cool things like for example displaying the UI with perspective and applying cone shaders so let's create the camera that won't display our UI let's create a new game object name it UI camera let's add the camera component make it orthographic so with this plays in 2d set the size to a hundred and there you go we now have in here a basic 2d camera that we're going to use to display however you want well let's set the clear flags to depth only so it only clears the depth after the main camera has render so now that we have our UI Cameron let's go into our canvas and set it to use this camera there you go as you can see we now can place our UI in here rather than having an arbitrary square and of Arsene this way it helps to make things much more clear when you're going in scene view you can see this is the origin of the game scene and this is where the UI is placed all right so now let's take care of the scaling there are several different scale modes constant pixel size maintains the pixel size of your UI regardless of screen size scale with screen size resize the UI to fit the screen and constant physical size maintains the same size regardless of screen or resolution the one that I find best to use is scale with screen size which resize the UI elements to fit the screen and resolution the reference resolution in here is the main resolution for your UI if the current resolution is smaller don't be scaled down if it's bigger don't be scaled up since I make mainly desktop games I'd like to set this to 720p so 1280 by 720 and for the match mode let's fully match with the height this means that elements in our UI won't only be resized if the height of our resolution changes so if I change the expiration here from 16 by 9 to 5 by 4 you can see the image does not get scale if I change the vertical size you can see that it does get scaled so with the UI setup like this you can place everything vertically and only have to worry about or Zanka movement for the reference pixels per unit let's just leave it at a hundred so our UI is now correctly set up inside the canvas is where you put your UI object for example in my games I usually have a version in the corner so let's make a game object inside the canvas let's name it window version on the rect transform let's expand to occupy our entire canvas so set it to expand and everything on 0 so as you can see in the corners it's occupying the entire UI window so regardless of the aspect ratio this one always occupies the entire screen and inside let's make a UI text object let's make it in white and give it a text of v1 point zero zero let's make it in overflow set the size to zero and we're going to anchor it to the oil and left corner and fourth position let's put it on 5 and 5 so just like that you can see the text object on the left side I can drag the game window to modify the vertical resolution and as you can see the version is always there on the corner it gets scaled up or down but it never moves that position and since i anchored it to the left side if I change the horizontal size it also stays within that corner so there you have it we start with an empty scene and send up to this player you want we set it to display using a camera which we can later use to make some cool shader effects we also set up the scaling to automatically resize the UI depending on the resolution ensuring that our UI is versatile and works with any resolution if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
