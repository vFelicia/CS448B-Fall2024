hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for february 2022 this month was actually really difficult to pick just then i saw at least 20 games that looked super interesting the indie game scene is truly amazingly varied regardless of what you're into there's tons of awesome games for just about everyone if you want to be a successful indie game developer you need to keep up to date with what's coming out i make these videos once a month so i can learn which games are finding success all of these games are initially impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also there's affiliate links in the description for some of the games by the way just a quick mention the senti humble bundle was excellent but ends in just one day if you haven't picked it up yet i would highly recommend you get it tons of super high quality assets that enable you to make hundreds of unique games all for an extremely cheap price there's less than 24 hours left so definitely get it now alright so starting off at number 10 with a really awesome one both awesome in terms of design as well as in tech here is diplomacy is not an option right away you can see the massive scale with battles feature thousands of units this one is a castle defense game and the reason why this one is awesome in terms of tech is because this might be the very first only release game using unity dots this is exactly the example of a game that would not be possible without dots this massive scale is truly insane and even though entities is still technically in development and there haven't been any public updates in over a year it's actually getting a massive update sometime soon but despite that all of the reviews are all very positive with over 1500 reviews so what that tells me is that even though the game is using some unproven potentially unstable technology it's apparently stable enough that the players are not encountering any weird bugs and of course the game itself also looks awesome personally i'm always a fan of massive battles and this game certainly provides them and up next we have tiny combat arena the description for the game starts off by calling it an approachable combat flight simulator game for me that's very important i'm a fan of planes and flying games but i'm not much of a fan for those hardcore simulations really i just want to fly a plane and have some fun which appears to be exactly what this game is about it also has a nice stylized look which helps make it look much less intimidating you can dock fight to other pilots or provide support to your units on the ground by dropping bombs on enemy tanks take part in a vast war with objectives and friendly armies to support then for something very colorful here is only only world it's a skateboard action platformer you can flip and flow through this vibrant world and meet colorful characters as you grind do some tricks and get some air this one is the third entry in this series and based on the review it continues to be excellent you can take things casually and just have some fun or you can compete against rivals with a hugely deep combo system with over a hundred move semester or maybe if that's too cheery for you and you want something quite a bit more darker here is blood west it's an immersive horror stealth fps game set in the wicked wild west it's got a really nice visual very much a ps1 style with some low poly models and pixelated textures lots of twisted demons and eldritch warriors for you to fight and of course you've got a nice arsenal of all kinds of wild west weapons at your disposal the action is a mixture of slow and steady during stealth and then some massive intense action after you're discovered personally i really like how the weapons are huge and right in front of the camera it really enhances the intense feeling making you feel much more vulnerable by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks then something very unique and also looks like quite a bit of fun here is modern builder it's a game all about building and customizing modern vehicles you slice open the box grab the parts and put them all together you can build tanks mechs cars planes and much more once they are built you can take your time and apply a nice coat of paint then you place your models on your shelf for all the world to admire certainly a very unique game but despite being what i would assume as somewhat niche it already has tons of very positive reviews so lots of people are really enjoying it up next if you're a fan of the cold then check out artico it's a nice exploration game with some crafting and building mechanics explore the arctic with your dark slide team use your kayak and your parachute gather some resources do some experiments and build up your base the game certainly has a zenlike quality so if you just want to build things in peace and don't want to fight any monsters then maybe give this one a go for some vr here is soul scade it's a dungeon crawler rpg use many spells weapons and even environment against your deadly foes dodge some fireballs by moving out of the way use melee weapons like you would expect but also do some magic by doing some gestures with your hands the enemy bosses look really powerful they've got some attacks that really look like they have some serious impact and it even has some chest mimics so i guess if you wanted something similar to dark souls but in vr form then this is it then for a game that kind of proves how a good title with a good concept is a great way to make your game much more marketable here is max v kaijus just based on the name i'm already very interested in you play as the commander of a mech army kaijus are attacking and it's up to you to defend equip and improve your mech place down some towers in factories right on the battlefield deploy support units and hold back the kaiju hoard then for something which just came out out of early access here is home behind i actually think i might have covered this one before in this series probably when it went into early access now it's finally fully out with over 5000 very positive reviews the game is a roguelike rpg you'll need your group of revolutionary fighters and try to overthrow the brutal authoritarian regime features side by side action very much like darkest dungeon although this one is in real time with a technical pause there's also some vehicle sections with some topdown combat so it's got a nice mix of mechanics you've got tons of weapons armor skills and lots of random events to test your skills and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month here is power to the people i've been interested in this one since i saw some random gif on twitter personally i love games about logistics especially when they focus on just one thing instead of having to build an entire city so with this one as you can tell by the very clever name this one is all about electricity the city starts off small with not much need in terms of power but cities grow so as it grows so does the energy needs it's up to you to build and keep building the electrical grid to stay up to date with the city's demands features lots of buildings to provide and transfer power so you can go with nuclear or maybe some renewables or maybe even try sticking with fossil fuels and of course the only challenge is not just the city growing there's also the threat of natural disasters that threaten to destroy your grid so build up your infrastructure make sure it works make sure it's enough and keep it running all right so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity and launched in february 2012 there's links in description for some of the games those are film playing so if you use them it's the same price
