hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the assess sword is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for May 24th this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video already cover the best free new assets and next one I'll be covering top visuals and effects as always there's links to the s in the description and as a bonus you can use your coupon code mony1 10 to get 10% off your order there's an excellent humble bundon right now with a M ofets all for just 25 bucks if you don't yet have a mega pack like this one then I highly recommend you pick this up any time you have an idea for a game it is really useful to have a bunch of assets you can easily pick up and use with all these assets you can make tons of really interesting games and if you want to stay up to date with the latest news on Game Dev Tech and gaming then sign up for my gamedev report newsletter if you've seen my videos on that format then the newsletter is really the same idea just text based which lets me do it much more regularly than these big videos so check out both links in the description all right so starting off with a really nice complex asset for making projectiles and it's titled projectile factoring this one is is a behaviorbased projectile system so you can easily Define the projectile data you can use whatever visual you want for it set it up exactly as you want to spawn what you want it to happen as it spawns then add all kinds of weird behaviors like for example should the projectile be rast based should it maybe have some kind of explosion Force should it just move forward or should it destroy itself on collision this asset is made by Infinity PBR so as usual it has tons of custom editor windows with lots and lots of details it also comes with detailed documentation and video Tut tutorials on top of that it also has Integrations with various particle visual effect effects so if you already own any of those you can very quickly set this up and something really unique is how this is actually the first asset that I've seen that has its own theme song definitely check out the asset page just listen to the theme song it's actually pretty fun and then to make your game stand out you need it to be visually unique and one way to achieve that is with some image effects like these this one is actually quite interesting it is not really just a postprocessing effect but rather it's a framework to give you control over how exactly you want your game to be render you can select various layers and apply strange effects to them so with a bunch of combinations you can get something very strange very interesting looking like I said being visually unique is extremely important nowadays and by playing around this tool you can definitely get some strange unique visuals that might help your game stand out next if you need a tool to help you make some maps here's a nice one this one is for making 2D Maps like for example your world map to move between levels or you can use it for the level Maps themselves it comes with over a th000 icons to make your own Maps they come in seven different Styles you've got summer spring and winter or you can also make them stylized in black and white or sepan you can change these through a simple drop down menu so just one button click and looks slly different and of course you can also change all these Sprites themselves so you can easily swap between a city Sprite sheet or medial or Arabic this can be a really great way to get tons of very different very unique Maps done very quickly next here's a really nice one for smoothing meshes basically the question is are you tired of the low poly sty with very harsh polygons if so then this actually helps you smooth those out so you can still use low poly acids of which there are tons and tons of them but you can make them look quite a bit more smooth now importantly this does not include new polygons it still has exactly as many polygons as before this one really just modifies the shading in order to make it look smooth you can select each individual Edge you want to smooth and easily make it much less sharp personally I love the low poly style I love it visually and I also love it because there's so much Variety in it but if you're not a fan of that harsh look then with this tool you can still use a ton of those assd packs but make them look much more smooth or perhaps you just need to generate a mountain of rocks if so look at this one this one is a tool for generating rocks and the results are actually quite impressive there are tons and tons of parameters all of them modify the output while always remaining really nice and consistent the results look visually satisfying whil also looking a little bit random you can modify the rock shape but also the material individuals so you can for example add some Moss or some snow on top or you can make it with some really strange colors to make it look like rocks from an alien planet kind of like namk and if all you want is just tons of pregenerated rocks then you can just use the ones in demo scene to use to populate your entire world and then here's a nice Performance Tool called animator LOD like name implies this adds a level of detail onto your animators meaning the further they are from the camera the less bones animate and the less often they animate making it quite a bit more performant this can give you a really nice boost if your game has tons and tons of skin characters on screen at the same time it is super easy to use you can just add a manager script and an individual script next to your animator and that's really it by doing that animators that are close to the camera will animate as usual but those that are far away will animate much less often you can configure a bunch of parameters to customize how exactly you want the LED logic to work but just by default it already works great next for another animated tool here is fake stop motion so if you're going for a stop motion or maybe some animated cartoon style if so then this tool can help achieve that look it simply takes your animations and makes them run much less often so you can cap it to just something like 6 FPS which makes it very stuttery so very much like stop motion or you can put it at some like 12 fps to make it a little bit more cartoony so if you were to combine this with either some kind of cell Shader or a pixel lady Shader if so then you can get a really interesting look for your game then here's one that I think I covered before I believe this one is an upgrade to version 2.0 it is called better transform and it's exactly what the name implies it's a tool that improves upon the regular transform component so you can modify the units so you can very easily scale things in either feet or meters you can inspect the size and units so a certain object like for example a character being able to easily see how tall is your character then you can also add notes to your game objects so you can do that instead of using the name itself as a note you can toggle between local and Global space in the transform itself you can also copy and paste in various ways all in all it does look like one of those assets that Unity probably should really have by default next if you're making something that interacts with the windows API then look at this tool I have done some work with the windows API like for example in the tutorial where I made a transparent Unity window interacting with that API is always really tricky there's lots of really obscure functions so a tool like this to simplify that it does sound really useful especially if you're making for example nongame things in unity you can use this to easily maximize or minimize your window you can modify the frame bord set the transparency the default menu buttons you can update the text in the title bar work with the clipboard get some system information and tons more so if you're making nongame things in normal Windows if so then this can help make that process much much easier then if you want a little bit more control over your look at this one it's a simple tool to help you manage your scenes much more easily so if you're the kind of person who likes using lots of additive scenes then this can really help you can add all of those additive scenes to a list and then when loading that object that scene it will automatically load every single one of those scenes or it also has just one simple benefit that I love since this tool is based on script B objects and direct references because that there are no string references so that alone is a really great bonus that is definitely something you should Implement in your games either with this tool or by yourself all right so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the UN assur from May
