hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here's an fps that i made entirely using unity visual scripting it's a complete game full of awesome mechanics as well as all of the normal things that you expect from an fps so there's multiple weapons starting with a simple pistol then a shotgun that fires multiple pellets and a rocket launcher that fires slow moving rockets at the undamaging area there's a really cool shield which not only stops but also reflects bullets and also a really awesome hookshot mechanic allowing the player to quickly move around the map in style it's got pickups coins keys doors enemies and ends with an awesome boss fight again all this built internally using visual scripting there isn't a single line of code anywhere the game is really fun to play and everything is built in a premodular way so adding more different weapons or enemy types or extra pickups is really easy the game is part of my complete visual scripting course which includes stepbystep guides on how everything was built it starts completely from scratch with a brand new empty project and goes through step by step until the final game the course contains not just this game but actually three unique games a platformer a action rpg and now a first person shooter it starts off teaching you the basics of unity and visual scripting with the simpon platformer then it ramps up the complexity with the action rpg which is packed full of features and finally ends with this awesome fps which takes all that knowledge and applies it to a 3d game so if you want to learn how to make games using visual scripting then this course is just for you if you have any issues or questions you can post them in the q a section and i'm always there to answer and clarify whatever questions you have alright so thanks for watching check the link in the description to pick up the course and let's build these awesome games together
