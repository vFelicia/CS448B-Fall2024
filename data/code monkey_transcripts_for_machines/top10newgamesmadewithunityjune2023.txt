hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with young teen launch in June 23. this was quite an interesting month I thought perhaps there would be a few releases because the steam Festival but not really still tons of games and still very difficult to pick just 10. the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test of these games are uniquely impressive so don't listen to no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick them also speaking of the steam Festival my own game dinky Guardians was part of it with a free demo which is still available right now it's a fun Solo or Coop game with some automation building and defense where you must keep the tiny defenseless dinkies safe from harm go try out a demo edit your wishlist and phone for devops alright so starting off at number 10 with a fun unique game called Driftwood this one is all about downhill longboarding and very importantly you play as a sloth so definitely a very nice genre but great presentation the concept of a sloth going downhill at high speeds is definitely quite interesting personally I love the original style very nice and appealing it looks like a more slightly casual racing game which personally I quite like you've got some drift controls to go down on turns in a nice satisfying way there's a trick system so you can do 360s and keep on going you can travel to new places and experience some interesting tracks all with a nice relaxing soundtrack you can play either solo for a nice casual time or if you prefer there is also a competitive mode where every second counts it is out now in Early Access with 200 very positive reviews then for some building and physics here is Mars personal Logistics it's a very physically accurate simulator where you build some machines from realistic pieces and set them up to complete all kinds of tasks like name implies you're on Mars so you start off with some basic machines just some wheels and Grabber easy to pick up a simple object and move it around then you complete some missions and unlock new parts to play with the level of customization is truly insane there are tons of parts that can be combined in an infinite way to build any machine you can think of the missions involve carrying all sorts of strangely shaped objects and you need to build your machine in such a way that it can actually pick up those objects also has a nice visual Style with some thick outlines several games have done this already and I think it always looks good if you like some realistic physics Simulator games and this looks like a great new one it is out now in Early Access with 200 very positive reviews next here's one that is definitely not for me but it does look great it's called killer frequency personally I am not a fan of horror games I get scared way too easily so I don't normally look at them for these lists but this one has so many insanely positive reviews that I just have to give it a look and it actually doesn't seem to have too many jump squares so perhaps I could even handle this one the premise is you're a late night radio talk show host where the colors are being installed by a mysterious color it's essentially a first person puzzle game through your choices you can decide who lives and who dies and either don't listen to their size of relief or their screams of horror explore your surroundings gather some Clues and try to help each of your colors survive the night the voice acting is absolutely excellent and Visually the game also looks gorgeous this is something that a lot of horror games do very well all the SSRS super high quality tons of great effects it is out now with 500 overwhelmingly positive reviews so that is 95 positive so if this intrigues you definitely give it a look next if you're into Colony building with tons of objects and tons of automation here is novolence you'll land on an alien planet and you have your trusty rayton weapon thingy that can help you gather resources and construct buildings and machines start off by manually harvesting some resources then quickly boost your productivity with some automated Bots tell those Bots to grab resources from one place and drop them somewhere the map is really interesting in that it is based on tiles you explore the world and unlock more and more tiles which are very unique each style has different objects and different resources you can also engage in combat and uncover Mysteries you expand and get to a point where you can even build a spaceship and fly towards the Stars to mine some asteroids and bring them back to land this game looks really massive while also looking quite inviting and the mechanic of unlocking different tiles in the world makes it more quite interesting it is out now and already has 500 very positive reviews next here is one with a very unique visual mechanic it's called pallav it's a building game where you start on a small plot of land and slowly build vertically you build houses for your people then those people also have needs they need some power food water and all kinds of things keep building upwards and keep your people happy unlock new buildings and resources complete some islands and discover new ones or hop onto sandbox mode and build without any limitations visually it looks really great a very nice chill style so something kind of like landscaper but only in a really tiny confined space it looks like a nice mix between a very cozy and inviting game but also one where you must pay attention and fulfill the needs of your people and bonus points there's also a nice friendly whale you can pet it is out now in Early Access and has over 200 very positive reviews then every month there's tons of new vampire survival likes here's an interesting one called Army of Ruin features the gameplay that you expect with these kinds of games so tons and tons of units and lots of ways to get rid of them these games are also about polish and based on trailer this one will looks really satisfying to play it's a great case study to see how you can make just something like unlocking a chest feeling really satisfying features tons of unique abilities with some very unique visuals the game looks really nice and colorful which is also nice and different from all of the other vampire survival likes you can upgrade your weapons unlock better more powerful weapons take out thousands of enemies and do it all over again it is out now and already has over a thousand very positive reviews for some VR here is an awesome one called battle Talent it's a super fastpaced physicsbased sword fighting worldlike name this is one of those where I really love how it looks the gameplay looks excellent it's a nice mix of swords and pistols so you can slash your enemies throw them in the air and then shoot them so kind of like a first person Devil May Cry or the weapons also remind me of the movie equilibrium really awesome movie one of my favorites just based on the awesome style Beyond swords and pistols you also have some magic so you can throw some Fireballs or some ice spells and a bunch more all of the objects they are all physically based which makes it look really satisfying you can fight over 80 enemy with a hundred weapons and 60 perks on top of all that it even has already over a thousand player created mods now the question with melee and VR is just how good does it feel and this one seems so fast paced with some excellent sound effects that it does look like pairing and striking feels very satisfying it looks really intense which some people can't handle thankfully this one also has a free demo so if you want to try it out and see if you can handle this much movement give it a try it is out now with almost 200 very positive views which is a great amount for a VR game then here is one that is targeted for a very specific audience which you can tell by the name alone it is called slayer's X terminal aftermath Vengeance of the Slayer with a name like that and visuals you can really tell that it's going for a really over the top retro style very old school visuals intentionally low quality assets and Sprites with some very inventive weapons and enemies the music is awesome I mostly don't pay attention to music but I really enjoyed listening to the trailer so if the final game has music just like that then that's awesome basically if you like retro Shooters if you enjoy what you're seeing right now then give it a shot it is out now and already has overwhelmingly positive reviews with over 500 of them at 98 positive which is insane up next here is a very strange spinoff it's called Kingdom 80s this one is part of the Kingdom series those medieval sites rolling strategy games this one is all about being set in the 80s now that's a very strange concept for a spinoff but honestly I do think it looks great it features similar side swirling gameplay so you grab your bike going left or right pick up some coins you build up your town with some defenses and stay safe from these mysterious monsters it is more story focused so you can meet some unique characters and befriend them you can ride together and give them roles as either Builders or soldiers go out on adventures expand your kingdom fortify it with walls and defensive turrets and when the Night Comes then you can defend them during the day you can explore the town you can visit the shops or find some items on the skate park all in all it's definitely a strange concept for a spinoff but it doesn't look quite interesting it has mostly positive reviews with the main negative being the short duration but if you don't like the a 80 style and short story Focus games and give it a try and at number one for my personal pick the month here is a huge hit of this month battle bit remastered honestly it's not just a hit of this month but almost the biggest hit of the year it had Peak concurrent users of 86 000 this is an insane amount for any game let alone an indie game this likely means it already sold millions of copies the game itself is a massive online shooter with combined arms something like Battlefield meaning you've got some infantry helicopters tanks ships and a bunch more all fighting on huge worlds with 256 players so really massive scale and it also features tons of very satisfying destruction so very much like Battlefield Bad Company 2 which personally I really love playing down the Gunplay is of course excellent for a game like this to be successful everything needs to be on point they also have a focus on high performance and hightech rate servers clearly they focus very heavily on making the gameplay as perfect as possible features a classic class system with some Medics assault engineer Recon and support drones it's got 19 huge Dynamic maps and 45 weapons now this one is called remastered but I have no idea what the original was whatever it was clearly people wanted a bunch more it just recently came out and already has 25 000 very positive reviews even though it's only an early access truly one of the biggest hits not just this month but the entire year it's really awesome to see Indie devs find this much success from what I can find this team is mostly just three people working on this game for several years really impressive alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with Indian launch in June 23. I hope this list helped you see how the empty engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just your own skills and Imagination check out my own same game dinky Guardians and edit your wishlist alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
