here's a quick unity tip if you create a sprite renderer you can actually see something so one super useful tip is to always have a texture of a single white pixel this is literally just a one by one texture that you can make in any program like paint or photoshop on the texture import settings set the pixel spray into one so it matches perfectly then you can apply the sprite onto the spread printer and now it does show up and since it's a white pixel you can even tint it in any color this is super useful for when you want a solid color rectangular shape like making some temporary walls alright hope that's useful subscribe for more tips
