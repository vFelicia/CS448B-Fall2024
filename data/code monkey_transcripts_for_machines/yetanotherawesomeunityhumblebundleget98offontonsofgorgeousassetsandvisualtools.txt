hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here is yet another excellent Unity Humble Bundle there's already the excellent tools bundle that I launched last week I highly recommend that one regardless of whatever game you're working on and now we have this one all about art but also include some very interesting art tools and a bunch of sound effects now since this bundle is mainly about visuals it really depends on if your style matches what you're using for your game although since the bundle discount is so deep at 98 off if just one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it I already have about half of these assets here but since the discount is so deep I'm just going to pick it up for the rest there's some really interesting tones here so let's take a quick look at everything included starting off over here with quibly enemy shaders and tools this one looks pretty great I've had it for quite some time and I've been meaningful look into it if your game has an anime sound shade unlock then this one is excellent It's a collection of shaders and a bunch of tools to make foliage and power lines for me I really like the associated look so maybe now is the time for me to finally dive deep into this one then we have polygon dungeons this one is made by cinti with their signature style this one is a pack with over 700 objects all to create dungeons it includes tons of modular Parts as well as 16 characters so this one looks great for making any kind of Dungeon Crawler game one thing that I would love to experiment would be using these in the assets with the equivalent enemy shaders I think that could make for a really interesting look then we have the tonal music collection this one includes over 800 tracks some are perfect Loops some are short and some are alternative versions if you don't have any collections of music then a pack like this one can be extremely useful then over here we've got a monsters pack the more interesting part about this one is that it includes Evolutions so you've got one Sage another one and another one so if you've ever wanted to make your own Pokemon type game then this pack would be a great starting point after that we have yet another sound pack this one is also massive almost 10 000 sound effects so again just a great General impact to have then for a very realistic Forest environment this one is super detail you've got lots of trees grass a bunch of flowers ground textures and some more everything looks really nice really realistic then it's an interesting tool for helping you make your characters bounce so this one is pretty great for making your characters and objects a little quite a bit more jiggly so this looks like an excellent tool to have that extra bit of punish to your game then if you want a force environment but this time in a cartoony sound look at this one I think this one looks really great really awesome really calming everything looks gorgeous so I'm looking at this one definitely makes me want to use this demo scene in some kind of feature tutorial environment after that is another interesting tool to make your game visually unique this one takes your regular 3D objects and makes them look like pixel art you've gotten lots of parameters to control the amount of pixelization the outline color lights and a bunch more the end result definitely makes it for a very interesting look now this one is a realtime post Crossing effect so it's a bit different from another similar tool that we're going to see in a bit then over here we have some realistic forest animals these are super high quality both models and textures so I could see this pack being quite useful for some kind of hunting game then we have a party monster pack this one is very colorful so would be great for making a game kind of like fun guys they have customizable body parts and weapons so you can create infinite variation up next is a very realistic very high quality Temple this one looks extremely nice really gorgeous assets everything is really nice and modular so if your game is inspired by Tomb Raider or uncharten then this would be the perfect pack then we have two packs with cute animals featuring a very cute art style and also including animations both packs have 90 animals so this one would be great if you're making some kind of zoo tycoon game if your game has any underwater sections then this one can be very harmful making an underwater scene look like it's actually underwater it's actually pretty complex so an effect like this one can definitely save you a ton of time and as you can see it looks great after that we have another sound spec this one is all about monsters it includes many creature sounds so it has zombies insects ghosts demons Orcs and a bunch more then the character created 2D it's a pretty nice sound on the characters it's a 2d very clean art sound of the body parts are separated for some easy animation so with this level of customization you could definitely use this pack for all your characters then we have another tool this one is magical cloth this is another one that I've seen many many times on the SSR but never only looked into it basically allows you to add physics simulation to a bunch of objects now obviously that's great for cloth but also for hair maybe a tail really works on anything that drapes down then over here a bit of a strange one strange because the scales over here you have thousands of footsteps sound effects I have no idea how it's possible to have over a thousand sounds for surfaces no kinds of ways to step on it but apparently here it is next is the basic motions pack now I really like this one I've used it in a few videos including one that I recorded just a while ago it's a bunch of generic motions so they are useful for pretty much any project of course you have basic movement but then also some more unique things you've got some talking animations some sitting animations you've got a victory hand wave looting something and a bunch more so this one is definitely a great pack to use in all your prototypes next up is the birds pack they've got a really nice very realistic art style they all have animations included so this would be a great pack to add a bit more in life to your world next up here we have some cute dragons these remind me of Skylanders or I guess maybe just spiral definitely a very cute art song with tons of animations then is the other pixelated I mentioned a while ago now the difference is the other one is a postprocessing effect whereas this one takes a character and an animation and generates a Sprite sheet so the end result is a pure to the character and they also mentioned they have a custom 2D Shader that makes it work with lighting so this is another one that I'd like to look into in more detail next up is the map graph this one is a tool for helping you make Town based Maps so this would be perfect if you're making some kind of oldschool RPG but it also works with game objects and prefab so you can also use it to make 3D maps next up over here a great looking VFX bundle features lots of effects and all of them will look pretty great you've got everything from some basic projectiles to some auras you've got some defenses some aoes there's tons of variety then we have a snow and ice skater this one has a very interesting effect so this would be great if you have some kind of snow Vamp in your game you can use this to make your character's movement through the environment feel much much better and finally over here a simple but very useful tool this one helps you take a texture and make it seamless for me every time I draw a texture it's always a pain to make it seamless to copy the left side to the right side and so on so this simple tool looks definitely excellent to me alright so that's a bundle now some of these assets are only useful if it matches your style but actually a lot of the art tools encoded here would be great in pretty much any project so that coupled with the extremely deep discount at 98 off makes this pack very unlikely worth it for me I already have quite a lot of these but I'm probably going to get it just to get the rest and just in case you missed last week's video there's also an excellent tune bundle going on these humble bundles with massive discounts only happen about once or twice per year so definitely don't miss out on them both are linked in the description and those are our film links so if you pick it up you get some awesome tools and assets and I get a nice commission alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
