hello and welcome i'm your code monkey one of the video types that lots of people like to watch my something included are some devlogs it's always fun to watch a quick video to see someone building their game week by week however just like with tv shows sometimes you just want to wait until it's over and binge the entire series so in this video let's check out three game devlogs that start from nothing and already have been completed with the final game of alban's theme also this video is sponsored by yunti which is currently having a best off sale on the assessor tons of the best assets are currently discounted everything from gorgeous visuals to some awesome tools and systems in fact almost everything that i've previously reviewed is currently on sale i can highly recommend the odin inspector if you want to build tools to improve your productivity the a star pathfinding project this one is an insanely fast pathfinding system that i've used in pretty much all of my steam games the allinone sprite shader for making your sprites look awesome also feel which is really awesome for adding that last bit of polish to your games so if you're interested in any of those you can go watch my phone reviews on those assets to see how they work and then browse the store to see everything that is currently on sale check it out to the link in description alright so let's look at some devlogs and before i get to the first game let me quickly mention my own when i first started this channel i was already hard at work on what eventually became battle round tycoon i did some tutorial videos on various systems that i was working on the game i made a series on the waiting qai on the graph the guest spreadsheets and the precomplex task system so those are based on what would become a steam game but their tutorials are not devlogs although near the end just before release i did do some more standard dev vlogs one of them implementing money and a restaurant adding some really interesting vips to the game adding some trading cards just before release and finally after release i also made a video sharing my revenue stats so that's my own contribution to the dev vlog genre whenever i start working on my next steam game i will definitely be doing a full series from start to finish so stay tuned for that all right so on to the complete devlogs let's start off with one of the most popular ones and one of the original ones here is the game equivalenox which has devlogs in the channel thin matrix the final game is a huge massive success it's got over 2 000 very positive reviews so people really love the game this one is definitely top one percent in the game in terms of results so it's really awesome that the entire dev journey is on video when i said this is one of the original ones i really meant it there is a playlist with 125 videos and the very first one came out in 2015 and the final game released in 2018 and actually before that he was already experimenting with java and opengl since 2013. the game is built on a custom java engine he was previously working on an action mmo and then changed gears to work on what eventually became equilinox the very first episode already shows a terrain prototype with some trees and animals it's surprisingly close to the final game he describes the game as a sandbox with various rooms like sheep and grass wildcats eating sheep and so on it's a game all about balancing an ecosystem and balancing biomes so from the very beginning the general idea of the game was already very solid after a few devlogs on episode 15 we get to see how design is becoming more and more detailed in this dev vlog he also covers how he made a great season for the game splitting the world into various weird positions so by doing that it is much more performant for each entity to interact with nearby entities without having to check distance against every single entity this episode also talks about the evolution mechanic so how animals breed and how various traits increase their chance for survival which in turn increased the prominence of that trait he made a really nice visual test where he made a trait based on color so she parspawned and the more red they are the better the chance of survival it's a simple mechanic but it's really fun to see the evolution in action very visually after a while all the sheep are pretty much completely red so it's really nice to look at then jumping ahead to episode 48 we see already quite a lot of changes the game now has some post processing it's got various animations lots more systems and mechanics this one is one and a half years after the first episode and actually this is a fun episode because he mentions rebuilding the entire game engine this is one of the interesting pitfalls of building your own engine making an engine is an extremely difficult extremely complex process so by building it yourself chances are you're going to miss something some engine feature that you will eventually learn about as you build more and more of your complex game this game is an example of a very talented very skilled developer that managed to make a successful game with a custom engine however for most people i would definitely now recommend that path doing a custom engine and doing it properly with all of these features doing that is extremely difficult so generally you have to ask yourself do you want to build an engine or a game you can't really do both this is one of the extremely rare occasions where it actually worked doing both at this point the game now has a currency it has points which you can gain by achieving tasks and spend on upgrades for new animals and fauna there is also now a growing system in the game so the points are off small and grow over time while also changing their visual look and the task system also now has a prerequisite system which has a nice progression to the game you can place animals to complete tasks gain resources with some more tasks then spend those resources to unlock more animals and so on so the core gameplan loop is already very well established by this point jumping ahead to an episode titled planning for release which was about two months before the final release this is another interesting episode because it covers lots of things that are absolutely essential to releasing a game but if you've never gone through the whole process going until the very end and releasing a game if you haven't done that then you might not know much about this part of the process he starts off by listing all the things that still need doing making a website preparing all of the images and captions getting the trailer done setting everything up on seems backend and of course announcing a proper release date also of course fixing lots of tiny bugs thankfully since he started doing the devlogs for such a long time he managed to get a nice amount of people interested in playing the game and essentially being bug testers if you're a solo developer then this kind of help is definitely extremely valuable everyone plays games in different ways so you yourself cannot possibly ever find all of the bugs then finally the video announcing the release of the game three years after the very first episode this one is a huge milestone for any developers and he even mentions that thankfully the game did much better than expected both in terms of sales and reviews but more importantly right after release a very important thing that again if you've never taken a game to release you might not know about which is post launch support and updates you might think that the second the game is out the work is done but that is far from the case release is just another milestone and after that things can become even more hectic it all depends on how much testing and bug fixing you did before release and if you do manage to have a successful release you're also going to have tons of people suggesting ideas and asking for more and more post launch content so after release there's still a bunch of videos all of them covering post launch content so that's the development of equinox 126 episodes and three years to go from nothing to a final c release and thankfully the final scene release did have massive success so thank you all so much thanks for coming on this journey with me and i am very much looking forward to whatever happens next for the second complete devlog let's take a look at the dreadful whispers by blackthorne prawn this one was 22 devlogs over nine months starting with the first devlog title starting a new game project in unity at this point the game was already in development for about a month so all the basics are there the first episode goes over the design the game and the various mechanics that it has the game is a 2d puzzle platformer where you control multiple characters and the world has different platforms where each can jump on very important to this poisson platformer genre is a nice mix of mechanics and varied levels so from the very first episode he was already experimenting with testing all kinds of mechanics to test them and see which ones fit the final game remember that you should always iterate upon your games and at the same time don't be afraid to throw away something that doesn't work so experiment build some new mechanics and if they fit your game keep them if not let them go also noah is primarily an artist so that is why the very first devlog on radio looks so close to the final game jumping ahead to episode number five this one is all about cut scenes and the process that he went through to turn them from photoshop to reality it's a great example of how you can use any tool at your disposal to achieve the final result in this case he decided to make the cutscenes using a regular video editor program then just using the video player component to play those cut scenes directly inside unity so this is always one approach that you have instead of building the cutscenes as actual animations inside the engine another interesting thing in this episode is when the final name the dreadful whispers is announced so for your own games don't worry about coming up with the name or the perfect name right from the beginning go ahead and build a nice prototype and design your game start playing out and testing your ideas your name can wait until a bit later then episode 11 is a very important one it's titled trying to become a healthy game developer game development and especially solo game development is a very taxing thing and when you add on top of that the usual issues with social media especially if you're also trying to create content around your game and constantly changing stats when you put all that together it can be very easy to end up completely burnt out so for one month he decided to do a little social media detox basically waking up and doing game dev or going for a run or anything other than instantly checking twitter and youtube so the takeaway from this video is game dev is a marathon it's not a sprint don't burn yourself out by constantly pushing like crazy definitely go ahead and push hard to achieve your goal but not so much that you go past your limits i must say this is one thing that i personally only have somewhat figured out i definitely value physical exercise very highly and i try to only use social media in a limited way just for working but i still have the thing where i regularly work way too much so if you're having trouble with managing a good worklife balance all i can say is keep at it it's definitely not an easy task i have trouble with it myself but always keep trying jumping ahead to episode 19 and this one is the last week before release and it seems that he learned quite a lot from that episode on taking a break and taking things a bit more slowly he planned enough time for release so we didn't have to crunch like crazy this final week this is the time to make sure that everything is ready you start sending out some steam keys try increasing wish list as much as possible and encourage people to pick up the game at launch and leave a review since reviews are so powerful both in terms of the steam algorithm as well as for your own growth as a game developer to learn what you did well and what you can improve so as a player if you want to help out some in developer definitely leave a review on their steam game and as a developer definitely encourage your players to leave steam reviews i made a quick video on how the steam review buckets actually work if you want to learn more about that and then on the very last episode in the playlist this one is all about stats so if you're working on a puzzle platformer which is an extremely crowded genre very difficult genre definitely go ahead and look at the stats to see how much you can expect all right so on to the third complete devlog this one is sapiens which has just launched into early access pretty recently the game is a colony survival sim that started development all the way back in 2015 there are 60 developed episodes over the seven years of development this one is similar to equinox in that it's a developer making a custom engine so the very first episode is showcasing a nice custom terrain engine it supports a huge open world it already looks preoptimized as you zoom in closer and closer you get more and more detail the atmosphere effect looks insanely cool really nice shaders but at this point this is just a terrain engine it's not really a game and from the voice over he didn't start with the intention of making a game just building a prototype for fun he even says quote i don't know if this will ever turn into anything jumping ahead to episode number 10 titled we have a name ambience which you might have noticed is not sapiens so that's a clue for how development of this game changed massively over the many years at this point the design of the game was still more about the terrain and biomes rather than a colony management game still lots of iteration with the detailed generation logic trying to make it more and more seamless the warden looks really nice really fancy shader but again still very far from what the final game would eventually become jumping ahead to episode number 23 and we already see quite a lot of mechanics that closely resemble the final game and we also get the first announcement of the final name sapiens at this point the game was indeed about colony management so there are colonists they can gather wood fruit and other materials you could order them to go somewhere they could research new tech there's also the nice mechanic about which village to start with they are randomly placed in the random world and you can pick one that you want to lead that's a pretty fun unique mechanic for a game like this giving the player a bit more agency over exactly where they want to start the minis were obviously still very early as were a lot of the visuals but at this point the final game was actually starting to take shape jumping ahead quite a bit to episode number 41 and we have some nice gameplay this was still two and a half years before release but at this point the game was definitely taking shape there was nice menus lots of actions that the units could take you could plant some trees and they had their own life cycle starting off as a simple sapling before growing into a full tree all the sapiens walked around they had animations for their various actions at this point he was still experimenting with various mechanics like what happens when a sapiens doesn't get enough food so do they get angry or do they leave the tribe still wondering exactly how new sapiens would join the tribe how often women would get pregnant and so on so still quite a lot of design questions unanswered iterating upon your various ideas is a great way to get some answers jumping ahead to episode number 55 and alpha testing has begun however this one is still over one year before the eventual release lots more variation with the visuals there's bloom post processing everything looks really nice and shiny lots more polishing lots of bug fixing work on ui and ux so exactly the kind of things you should be doing just before making your very first public build and for the final episode at the time that i'm recording this episode number 60 you can finally play the game it's out now on steam early access and the game is seeing quite a lot of success already has over 300 very positive reviews in just one week extremely impressive results so this is one example where a big gamble of working for seven years on a single game seems to have paid off although personally i definitely would not recommend that you follow this path which you see here making a game on a custom engine over seven years and finding some massive success this is the exception it's not the rule but that's the story of this game so far it's only just now hit early x's so this story is continuing since the game is selling very very well who knows how many more years and how big the final game will end up being i definitely look forward to playing it in a couple of years all right so those are three complete devlogs you can now go watch and binge from start to finish and then go play the complete games on scene this was a pretty fun video to research looking at all the devlogs that exist and see how many games made it to the finish line there's a bunch of devlog series that start and never finish but quite a bunch of them actually made it to the finish line there were a bunch more that i found out but the video is already pretty long with just three examples so like this video and let me know in the comments if you'd like to see some more complete devlogs and don't forget to check out the sale on the asset store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
