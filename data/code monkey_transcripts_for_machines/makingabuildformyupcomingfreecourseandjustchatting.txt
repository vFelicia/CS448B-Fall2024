foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign hey everyone hey how's it going thanks for being here all right all right nice to see you all huh on this random day thank you all right okay seems everything is working good all right okay so basically the goal is I've got a bunch of work to do so I figured I might as well do it on screen so let's try to do that are you a monkey or a human I guess I'm a human I think why would stream set for the 11 because that was usually the initial goal but yeah then I had some other word that I had to take care of so yeah I couldn't do it but then today I figured out yeah today should be good so let's try it out it's been about two months since I'm last made on live stream so yeah hopefully everything goes well at least technically everything seems to be correct everything is good music microphone everything seems all right okay all right is this course finished nope still harder to work on it should hopefully be uh Sometime Late this month hopefully still quite a lot of work to do but let's see all right okay so thanks for being here and like it says on the title and basically I'm I'm going to make a build and actually well since I might as well say Hey there you go just something fun that I decided to do for this uh for this game since this is going to be a course on making a complete game I went ahead and I made a steam page obviously it's free the game is free so I just thought it would be fun if people want to play the game before following along with the course so it's going to be on Steam so if you want go ahead on there edit your wish list or something I mean it doesn't really matter it's a it's a free game it's just a fun way it's easy for people to play the game without having to download the project files or anything so I just figured might as well do it since steam is so easy to use I already know how to use it so it was actually pretty easy to set up hey you know from Queen brand hey nice thank you all right so okay so basically I will be uh in order to make this prepared I need to prepare a build but I haven't finished the the course recording yet so I've got my test project so I'm going to have to make a proper bump for that have to make a main menu a bunch of things just make it functionally uh make it work properly so that I can upload it to seam have everything prepared so that when the course video is done everything can go live at the exact same time so that's pretty much the goal did it cost you to upload this you mean steam yeah steam has the regular thing it's just 100 bucks so it's really it's not something that I mind paying just to have a nice build that people can easily play so I think that would be fun so before you watch the course you can just go on Steam download the game play it and it should be interesting so there's the link again go ahead edit your wish list something like that okay all right okay so basically I won't be trying to do that work trying to answer questions at the same time trying to do everything so let's see if I still remember how light streams work where can we donate I mean you know I've got plenty of courses so if you want to watch those courses that's great you get some nice knowledge and obviously I get some money so that's nice the affiliate links anytime you need some some assets if you use my links I get a nice commission so and so on so yeah Christmas New Year's yeah pretty nice prechone nothing too special but yeah pretty nice thank you okay so basically if you haven't seen the the other video talking about the course does it ever release date not yet sometime late this this month so basically the course it's a game pretty much kind of like overcooked so I've got a little character I can walk around oh right totally forgot that I did implement it I implemented sound except I don't know if it's can you hear the game sound because the problem with the live stream is that I'm not hearing anything because I have to have my my speakers down otherwise makes the whole thing so anyways I'm hoping you can hear the nice music that was actually pretty nice I heard a sound designer on Fiverr to make some music make some sound effects so yeah I actually quite like the music that came out so anyway so this is the game you can pretty much pick up ingredients from these containers you can put them on a bunch of things like for example put it there to slice it so pick up some Tomatoes go ahead use the alt interaction key to slice them better give us a bunch of things then let's put some meat on the stove and there you go it's cooking pick up a plate and I can pick up the cooked meat I can pick up some cheese some Tomatoes let's also put some bread let's put a cabbage slice it up put it in there and finally deliver it and yeah there you go I made a nice liver of a nice nice complete Burger now let's make a simple Burger so just put one there just a cheeseburger so just a bunch of cheese gotta make sure to go quick otherwise the burger will actually burn so just like this make a nice cheeseburger and there you go and how about a salad uh did you use UI tonkit nope this is using regular Unity wine basically UI took it right now it's already production ready but it's only for editage Stones so in order to make proper game UI you should probably still be using mty but yeah I'd love to look into that one in a little bit okay so anyway so this is the game what happens if you burn the burger I mean it just becomes burned so on overcooked you've got a fire mechanic so the whole thing starts burning down starts going whereas here it just becomes charred so it just becomes all messed up so I can pick it up and obviously nobody wants it so I deliver it and just disappears or obviously I also got a real nice trash can hey CPU hey thanks for being here all right how do you get on top of feature creep well for that it's really just having a nice clear design there's really no no trick to it just have a nice layer design of what you want to do and then stick with that design that's pretty much it whenever you come up with a new feature idea really question yourself does this really make the game better or is it just something that sounds fun to do so yeah that is one of those problems that is definitely quite tricky itself but hopefully with the experience becomes quite a bit better all right Okay so basically this is the game and now my goal is to what we're using for voice vbox yep I wouldn't like to implement vivox in the final multiplayer video but I still have to look into that one because that one I haven't used it yet but yeah hopefully it should be should be easy okay so basically the goal is I need to make a steam build so that I can upload this to steam so that the whole thing is uh so that the steam build is validated and everything is ready to go whenever the final course video is live so if you just joined where's my window there you go basically I'm making a steam build of this nice little mini game so that it's easier for players to play that's pretty much the goal okay so let me do a little bit of work and then answer some more questions another film for Mac yep I will make a McDonald does it say not available because I think I've made it did I make it I think so uh yeah at least over here I set it up okay maybe I did not set it up on the on the other steam back end maybe only on this one but yeah I will make a McDon since it's on pretty much the same hey Super China thank you Mr PC Guru if you are doing well when you expect the course to be out and how long will it be basically the goal for having it out should be by the end of this month how long I'm not sure it's one of those things that started off as something supposedly pretty simple the initial idea was something that was like two three hours something pretty quick but now it's looking like it's going to be I don't know maybe eight ten hours so yeah definitely a lot more detail that I initially anticipated so a lot more work a lot more difficult but well hopefully the final video won't be good so at least you know being detailed means that it's a lot of work but hopefully means there's a lot to learn so pros and cons I guess okay putting the networking into it as well yep so pretty much the first video won't be on making the single play game and then the second video is focused on taking that game and implementing all of the multiplayer features okay so let me just do a little bit of work before I answer any more questions uh the first thing that I wanted was really just make a main menu so let me actually Circle that because that's actually should be a pretty simple thing so let's make a new scene for the main menu let's go inside it and make something pretty basic let me actually uh create the new what I want the plane I would put a plane put it on zero zero zero pick it up my form material there you go I just have to move my camera I'm also going to need the player so the assets which yeah on the on the final tutorial video there will be the assets you can download so it should be fun if you want to follow along because it won't come with all of the visual assets so I'm hoping that the final video won't come out really well everything should be really nice okay uh let me put this on zero zero zero okay so basically for my main menu I really just want the button and an interesting background so let's say something like this I want to see the all right let's put the camera here so here's the ENT tip control shift F you move the scene camera control shift F and the object it's placed in there so that's really nice for positioning cameras all right that's a bit too high Maybe yeah something like this just need the plane just need to be a little bit bigger so let's put it on five on order Okay so all right so that's kind of view with a bunch of buttons here so that should be fun also still need to uh call DBC shirt huh thank you yeah I love this shirt it's really awesome yeah picked up at Ibrahim that was really fun really awesome all right thank you uh okay so I'm going to need a canvas and let me make a brand new canvas screen space overlay yep let's go with scale with screen size 1920 by 1080 scale with the height so pretty much the default that I always ah crap my mouse is moving oh oh yeah because it's going into the other monitor so it's all messed up yeah yeah thank you so much for the Super Chat another one nice struggles thank you for so many good videos well thank you for being here watching them I mean the videos only work this is a twoway street so I keep making videos as long as you keep watching them keep enjoying them keep finding value from them then I won't keep doing them forever pretty much so thank you all for being here both on the live stream and just watching the regular videos thank you that that's really the only way that this whole thing works so thank you that's nice all right so a nice main menu and actually got a bunch more players so let me put a bunch of them to make a bit of an interesting little scene here for the main menu even though it doesn't really matter reset system requirements for the game I mean that really depends on the intensity of the game so for example for a game like this the ones that I put here are pretty much just basic things so any GPU from less than years a quart to do which is pretty much from less than years Windows 7 yeah pretty much so yeah if your game is relatively basic then you don't really need to worry too much about setting some accurate minimum requirements that really only becomes an issue when you start having some things that a lot more complex a lot more tough to run but for the most part for Indie Games yeah they won't pretty much run on anything okay so let me put one there let me actually put them side by side just to see so put one then maybe one there and one there Okay so this one let me put it in green you can drag it for this one okay let's make this one green on the face also green and then the other one next to it let's make it red just making a nice scene for the main menu something pretty basic all right so that looks fun how easy will this be to found multiplayer tutorials with visual scripting I mean technically it is possible if you use uh programmer naming on the nodes if you do that then you should be able to follow everything I mean the game does use interfaces at one point so that part might be tricky with visual scripting but yeah at least I don't know 90 of it should be dual mode with visual scripting but at the same time it's a beginner course so even if you're not a fan of programming I would still encourage you to try it out because it really isn't too difficult so I mean I say that but I'm with programming I know for some people it's a bit more difficult but soon even within the realm of difficulty I think this game is a great entry point for anyone when uh anyone who wants to learn pretty much let me just use the what do I want let me do a volume how much you recycle old scripts on new projects quite a lot actually I mean as long as you have a bunch of I mean I have my utilities although I actually haven't used them as much in recent videos just because I always get questions people think that there's something hidden in the utility so I always have to tell them no there's nothing hidden so you can read on the source code so but yeah I do have my own utility so whenever I make my own games I've got a bunch of interesting things and pretty much for the for example over here in this project I've got this little folder for example I've got here the input window that I made like I don't know three years ago something like that then I've got my utilities right here and usually on my projects I also have tons of other things that I made so many things so yeah why do you always drink water so much because I'm really not used to live streams talking this much I'm usually a very quiet person so having to talk nonstop yeah that really that is quite difficult so definitely need to hydrate quite a bit uh let me add my volume component and select it do tutorials on [ __ ] code share graph is great yeah Shader code that Shader programming is not my skill set so yeah for that thing it really should be someone else teaching that because for me yeah Shader code is really not my thing okay so putting some nice post pressing they are kind of flying a little bit which is a bit annoying can I squish them a tiny bit uh then it's a bit too dark okay anyways all right so once again thank you so much for the Super Chat alright so let's make some buttons so let's go inside let's make the main menu UI let's stretch out the whole thing put zero on everything and now inside let's create let's use the default button so button with text mesh Pro let's call it the play button actually put button lately I stopped using the abbreviation uh all right so let's put it like that okay so on this button let's say just play and where's the okay let's anchor it down there to the left put it a bit bigger like this put it off to the side actually I need this uh some like this okay this is free course all about multiplayer or what it's both it starts off the first video is on making the game in single player and the second part is on converting the game from single player onto multiplier so yes it will be two videos covering both the single player and the multiplier okay something like this let's also put a nice shadow of craft that's not it a nice shadow right here minus 5 over 10 minus 10. all right so that's pretty basic let's also put an upline okay change coding style around for TBS course uh I did change the the uh brackets on the new lines I did that because that was the game devtv standard but beyond that no no really didn't really change didn't really have to adapt much to fit their style their style is already pretty good so yeah actually was pretty easy all right so this this text is way too thick so let's bring demolition a little bit down all right great okay right so basic play button let's make this work before I do everything else possible to be a game developer without a degree well I myself I don't have degrees so technically I guess that means yes I mean it all depends on where you are in the world and what kind of job you want to make I mean if you want to be an indie Dev you don't really need permission from anyone you just start learning start making games so yeah if you want to be an indie Dev yeah you don't need anything but if you want to get hired at AAA Studio something like that then at that point they might require a degree so don't know that only depends tips on how to mix between keep on learning and discovering new techniques and actually making your desired projects even if you don't have the actual technique also uh that's a good question I mean I guess that depends quite a lot on what you're trying to do I mean I would say the mix is that mix maybe spend one week learning something new then one week working on your own project make sure your own project is something small on the scale that you can do the biggest issue that people do is they have too big of a scale that was my problem as well I mean pretty much my third Flash game was meant to be a MMO game about cops and robbers so yeah that was really not advisable and as such of course that that game never end up coming to fruition so yeah that's kind of the problem okay so play button actually no let me do a project void awaken on awake let me find the start button not that one that one so a private put a button inside the UI yep for the play button and then over here let's go to the on click as a listener and okay so for the play uh oh God I don't remember the uh what is it called scene manager yeah I think that's this one load scene yeah pretty much just load then yeah we'll probably have to go and look into my own code to figure out uh to grab my level items but anyways over here let's just put it just like this just make sure that it works first getting in the dev make his own open Worm Game sure I mean open world it depends on what you mean by that but for the most part that really just means in large world you can Traverse so that's just doing that is actually pretty easy the corner of your green screen is too dark is it because if I move around the lights might actually block a little bit and yeah this one is a bit darker so yeah yeah that's one sometimes might not work okay foreign menu I got my game scene and just like this it should already load the other one do you ever get the moralized and how to overcome it actually I've got a a all right I forgot actually I've got a very interesting video coming out on Monday still haven't finished editing it but basically it's on how to set goals so how to set goons uh piece by piece how to make it so that this year is the final year that you finally make your own game and so on so yeah if you have problems with motivation or that kind of thing go on settings then definitely stay tuned for the video on Monday it should be hopefully very interesting hey thank you for the Super Chat Julian I'm sorry I don't know is that just autumn does the o with the um loud I actually don't know what sound that is yeah thanks for tutorials thank you for being here thank you for watching all right thank you that's nice uh okay so just testing this out yeah uh what do I sell that what did I make no what the point oh God yeah I forgot I had the player visual script that's why yeah these guys are not supposed to have that just have the player just have the animator and no visual so just like that what theme is the game it's a it's a cooking game it's really just interactions so there you go start the host and let me start playing pick up some cheese and slice it and there you go I got some cheese let's cook some meat pick up something wait for the meat to be cooked pick it up pick up some cheese pick up some there and there you go anyone want a nice cheeseburger there you go really nice okay awesome all right please use dark mode it's like a flashbang I'm sorry but yeah dark mode really burns my eyes I really wish there was some way that I could have my preferred theme and other people could have their preferred theme but yeah that doesn't that's not really possible so yeah all right okay so basically yes so the basic main menu is working now the next question is how do I connect it with the lobby and for the lobby actually I imported my own projects over here the unlavi tutorial so let me put it over there call this the lobby scene let's go inside okay two cheeseburgers with large fries and gravy I actually don't exactly know what is gravy I have no idea what is the translation to Portuguese so I've I guess I've probably had it but I have no idea what it actually is ah it's a thick sauce okay sure uh you ever use Godot nope I have not used Godot I'd love to have some time to try it out see what they do differently from Unity how it works I do see devdocs devlogs so yeah I've seen the interface it doesn't look nice doesn't look interesting nice compositions between where everything is a scene instead of everything being a game object that's a a nice little thing so yeah whenever I find the time I definitely would love to give Godot a try also give an Ariel a try and just see what they do differently because for me I've really just stuck with unity ever since I first found it which was on the way back in 2012 December of 2012 that's when I yeah sure but what kind that's kind of thing yeah sure but what kind of mode that kind of thing yeah so that is yeah the design patterns used in Marvel snap I have no idea what you mean by Design patterns brown sauce made with meat drippings room what is Roux water and spices okay so sounds like a nice interesting thing okay Roblox Studio well that's another one that a lot of people are are are using okay so uh basically over here so for this one I had the authenticate so basically the main thing that I want is uh um basically I want the authentication to happen automatically right yeah my manager I think actually one question is right the lobby manager has an instance so this is going to be tricky okay authenticate with the player name I mean this is totally useful for the thing so right have you ever been to America well I was just in North America Canada just for for United 22s that was fun in the U.S I haven't been there since I was like 10 years old or eight I went with my parents very long time ago it was fun it was interesting uh right okay so basically the lobby should be working just like this let me see so I authenticate there you go I've got the lobby I can create one yeah obviously these parameters don't make sense in this game but yeah I can pretty much queer and Lobby and there you go okay so basically now I need the basically I need to do everything that I did on the on the relay videos so I might have to go watch my own tutorial to remember how that thing works but yeah so I've got the lobby create button where do I have the lobby let me just hide everything else okay so basically on the lobby UI I'm going to need a button to start the game so pretty much the same thing that I did oh crap I can't quite see under there let me just hide the characters just for a little bit just so I can see okay so on this one play or start game button alright okay so on the unlobby how did I make this like this so let me add another one for the start game button and let's see complex according directions with async command buffer reflection okay I haven't played Marvel snap but that's it sounds like you're over complicating things because as far as I know marvel snap is a card battler so you get a bunch of cards and do a bunch of things so I have no idea why you would need async command buffer why you need reflection definitely sounds like over complicated things why so many games feel unpublished but Triple A Studio game feels like garbage well that really depends on the game there are plenty of indie games that are not polished and there are plenty of AAA games that are polished so yeah it really depends on what kind of games you're looking at it's definitely possible to make a polished game at every every scale so yeah that really comes down to the team what were their limitations do they have budget issues were they forced to release the game way too soon yeah basically there are many reasons why that might happen that's always an issue everybody always wishes they had infinite time if you had infinite time then you could make an infinitely polished game but yeah infinite time isn't really something that happens uh okay so I've got my start game let me do the on click the listener and okay so on the start game button what am I going to do I'm going to need to go into the Sim manager and for now just load scene and let's load scene 2 and from the main menu yes in one okay so let's swap this out thank you again for the Super Chat another one thank you ground Rose to an application to help out with alphabeta testing have you seen it I don't know maybe I usually check the check the contact form about once a week so yeah I'm not sure if I have seen down but yeah basically I will be I will definitely be doing some Alpha Beta Testing but yeah still need to work on the game quite a lot more before it gets that stage so that is still don't worry when that happens I'll definitely let people know but it is still quite a bit away especially because now since I'm working on on this project this course which as usual has taken a lot longer than initially anticipated so yeah this is kind of messing up my schedule but hopefully it won't be fun so hopefully after the course is done I can get back to work on the steam game and hopefully in the future within I don't know a few months maybe have an alpha beta and then see something all right okay so let me just on the build settings let me add open scene put down down there and just like that even though this one really isn't doing anything just yet so I still have to I have to watch my own thing live stream is a view gaming yeah that would be tricky I mean because usually live streams about gaming are all about entertainment and I really don't think I have the kind of personality to do entertainment style content so yeah although I have thought about making some live streams uh playing my own games where I can at least talk about and say how I made this thing what was the challenge with this game so I think that could be a fun live stream so maybe that could be maybe that could be fun and a bit more educational rather than just interesting are you wearing your dragon ball shirt yes I am I love this shirt it's really awesome uh okay so let me just go back into the main menu so on my scenes go back to the main menu yeah okay what time is it oh it's almost five oh okay so I play then I go here then the authentication is going to have to be manual then the player goes into one lobby then I click on start and I click did I click on the wrong button okay yeah I definitely renamed the wrong button but the logic is indeed working uh so yeah right because the host hmm yeah I didn't didn't quite think about that but okay because I'm the only love you why did I mess up I didn't mess up uh the game mode button and the start game button all right so basically the thing is then on the game scene over here I need to start it right away so how was I handling that I don't remember I think it was on this one yeah it's waiting to start and the game has started so basically I start the host like that okay all right change the sound of our puppet on bottom of the stream yes you can uh uh oh God I don't remember the name oh God there's a link that shows up down here and now I actually don't remember my own link uh like stream custom character is that what I called it is it nope oh crap yeah basically you can log in and then when you log in you see the thing oh crap now I'm waiting for the popup to show up down here yeah basically there's a you can go on the website you can log in link your YouTube account with the with the website account then you can customize you can even use a custom a custom spreadsheet isn't there anyone here using a custom Sprite sheet there was a really nice alien a while ago but nope oh there you go there's a really nice uh SpiderMan over there so yeah you can use you can draw on top of the Sprite so it's a really fun thing uh okay so yeah whenever that shows up I'll see that but anyways all right which multiplayer service is more recommended well for me I'm going to be using the uh the net code for game objects which is unity's official multiplier stack so that's why I'm going to stick with that one even though pretty much all of them are excellent so yeah uh okay right so thanks again for the super Channel thank you uh all right so over here basically I'm going to want to I need to I need to go watch my own my own video to remember how do you implement relay because I was looking at this a while ago because I don't actually remember all right so initialized Services yeah then I sign in sure all right I need to create an allocation and then I need to get the join code and then afterwards okay so let me actually implement the relay afterwards so for now when this one is waiting to start the game let's put it right start and I'll start let's start host right away so that should I'm just thinking on the other side okay right need to use servers or peertopeer it's going to be peertopeer time between making your own game tutorials and other videos for YouTube the answer is right now very badly the answer is right now managing all of that is quite difficult I'm trying to manage everything but yeah for example making this course is taking a lot more a lot longer than I initially anticipated so yeah for now I'm focusing just on this I don't have time to work on my game so that kind of sucks but yeah so I'm focusing on this make this the best that it can be and then next month I can go back to make my sim game as well as any other videos any other thing so yeah it's very tricky to come up with time for everything you know that is very tricky uh okay so basically just start host so this should start oh crap no I didn't oh yeah the link was down there on the bottom and I missed it was it custom live stream character because um live stream character said ah there you go There's the link all right so if you want to customize your own live stream character there you go go in here there's a nice little guide you just need to link your YouTube account then going to customize your character modified or upload a custom texture or something like this you can draw on top of it you can make your own character save the changes and then it shows up in here and if you want to know how I made this there's also a bunch of nice headphone links so learn about how I made this transparent TNT window how these mesh based animations work how to trigger an HTTP request from Unity so that's how this is using the YouTube API and how I made the guest spreadsheets in Battleground Tycoon which is really just these Sprite sheets which make for the character so it's a pretty fun overlay all right can you explain your Unity layout and something done with so I'm not sure what you mean by that until layout I mean it's just what I like actually on the on the free course there's going to be a lecture on the layout so pretty basic basically unlike the inspector on the right side down here make the project with these options so make it a one column instead of a two column layout I prefer that one then the hurricane there and scene View and so on okay so basically this was automatically starting the game I use tone layout to secure yet you can use any layout you want there you go custom characters hey Danny that's a really nice character is that supposed to be a alien or a printer sorry I get those confused yeah I suppose that it's a printer looks really nice nice pixel art that's nice uh okay so let me just go back into the main menu yeah I'm actually not being very productive right now but it's okay all right so let me play authenticate create a new lobbying there you go drawing and there you go it loads and it joins right away creates the player okay all right so but I need to know okay so let me let me think about this uh because basically the lobby is going to have to all right let me think I think the easiest way is to First make some static fields and then figure out uh right so let me think I like Sonic Boom is host something like this so one of them is going to be the host but on the lobby when do you have the uh where do I get the the lobby UI right because this one is telling it to change game mode instead of start game okay so it's over here that I'm going to have to make a public void start game this is actually what I'm going to call and I'm going to figure out okay is Lobby host all right so I can just ask that so if this one is Lobby host let's put this hosted true and then unload the actual other scene so then over here I can go into the lobby manager the instance and start the game and this one will start the game then on this one it holds the scenes that it's a host or not and then on this guy before you start host just check if the lobby Lobby manager that is host what is a host start host if not start a client okay so technically that should work I think okay let me see hey super shout out thank you please make a video making one game in Unreal Engine yeah that would be interesting but yeah as usual the problem is always the same it's always lack of time so yeah I'd love to spend some time learning a little bit about Unreal Engine to make a comparison that would be fun there gotta gotta find time somehow and see because yeah that would obviously be a fun video those videos are always interesting to watch uh learning how to make a game make a game in one engine make it another and see differences and so on so yeah if I could find the time I would definitely love to do that kind of video I'm sure that would be fun also where is Danny I have no idea I do think that he in live streams uh regularly doesn't he I think so I'm pretty sure at least he had a live stream channel so yeah he's probably probably doing a lot of interesting projects as for Carlson I don't know about that that is going to be I mean it's the problem of expectations there's like I don't know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand wishlist so yeah I'm guessing he's feeling a bit of pressure trying to make the most perfect game possible so yeah that is tricky did not anymore so he's no longer doing live streams yeah I don't know what he's doing nowadays I hope he's doing well definitely seemed like a smart kid whenever I met him which was before he blew up so that was in what 2019 something like that yeah it was on a unite in Copenhagen that was what I met him he was nice Sam he was in the live streamed yeah probably busy doing a lot of things all right um okay so basically I think this is indeed working so let's just quickly make a build and then see if it does work so let me put a bone here just make a building and see if it works alright so thank you for the Super Chat another one hey CPU hey hello from Tim on the Discord server how many of us are here all right yeah go ahead and leave the link to the Discord I assume you can post links right I think so uh what was it called I don't remember the name not possible do I have yeah I haven't I haven't opened up Discord in ages so open your browser let's see if this works what is it United programming where do you have a link on this one how do you get the link from a from a thing is it on the welcome there's a link here but I can't copy it can I nope how do you call oh there it is right so if you want if you're a fan of Discord go ahead and join that Discord Channel if you want to ask questions meet likeminded people if you want definitely go there so yeah do you have a Discord channel for this community no I tried it but yeah I really I'm already insanely busy making all the videos answering all the comments course questions and so on so yeah it's a really difficult so yeah I can couldn't quite manage it but yep go ahead and join CPUs Discord if you want an active Discord on about Unity programming and so on okay so let me just see this if you're done Outsourcing for Unity development no you mean me hire people or me work for others I mean either way the answer is no so uh yeah okay so let me start like this I actually don't know if this is going to work but I guess we shall figure out let me put so down then display this one needs a different name although I can put I can put numbers all right so let me authenticate and join my Lobby okay both of them yeah this one definitely should not be visible there but anyways doesn't matter and that one goes in uh I mean technically did it work it did actually work all right nice okay all right so it didn't join automatically but the logic did work and actually don't remember because this is my testing script it's not the final course uh game because I haven't I haven't finished making that yet so this one is just a debug sectionally yeah there you go this one yeah still a bunch of bugs over here well that one actually kind of worked but now it kind of didn't yeah the uh delivery queue is not synchronized yet but yeah the object did not yeah right so I still gotta yeah I probably did not change the thing over there so yeah okay yeah anyways so yeah basically I still gotta work on fixing this up before I can make a proper build but at least the logic for the lobby and so on at least that part is working so that's fun so I can move around move the peel and so on okay great all right explain what our concurrent players in multiplayer well those are players at the exact same time if you're asking about the relay pricing thing yeah that's what it means so you can have 50 people connected at the exact same time and it's free that's pretty much it is peertopeer your preferred method for making multiplayer games yeah I mean it's usually simpler than dedicated servers and it's quote unquote free so yeah for small Indie Games I think peertopeer is more than good enough so yeah I would definitely encourage you to use that to make your own games because it's a pretty easy pretty reasonable and yeah you don't have to worry about dedicated servers so if you don't have something that is super highly competitive then yeah peertopeer is probably more than enough are using relay system for this not yet but yep that's what I'm going to implement right now if you don't have major amount of social media followers like you how can we Market the game for free well the answer is build something like what I've built here on this channel that's pretty much it I mean this channel did not spawn just randomly it happened by five years of me working on making interesting videos that people have enjoyed and have found value in so yeah that's really that's really it you just have to work hard that finding something of value that you can give to people then hopefully you find enough people then you can Market the game and so on so yeah there's really no magical thing it's just like that there you go someone woke up spear to peer more performance heavy for the host uh not really it's only more DNA's and things but yeah in terms of performance it works just fine but you can also use steam matchmaking yep that's right I definitely would like to look into steam transport because I do know they offer quite a bunch of multiplayer services but yeah I don't I need to look into that what breed of dog is that I have no idea it's a mixed breed and makes something no idea his name is tiku and his sister which is down there Teka so tikui teca foreign so in peertopeer you've got to go from one Pier to another Pier then back into the third Pier whereas with dedicated server it just goes straight to the dedicated server so when doing peertopeer you always end up with a lot more DNA a bigger round trip time so yeah for something hyper competitive where you need 12 milliseconds you know to do something like uh CS go so yeah for that you really need dedicated service but for most casual Indie Games something like this something like overcooked for that using peertopeer is more than enough all right Michelle all right okay so let me do a little bit more okay it's already 5 10 so yeah okay uh all right so basically now the next thing that I wanted was just Implement relay which for that I actually have to go learn from my own video because I don't remember how it really works all right so basically I need to create an allocation now the problem with this hmm I'm trying to think because the relay the issue that I had with really was you need to create the allocation and create the connection right away so that means that I can only create the real allocation when I'm in the other scene and then the other scene I've got to somehow update and Lobby so that the other ones get the lobby code and so on all right okay so let's see okay all right so let's try doing that so let me go over here on the kitchen game manager when we do an async void what did I call it it's a missing poetry really create real link then inside I've got to use the uh what is it called really service dot instance really serve this dot instance dot create allocation async so that's pretty much it this one right needs the number of people so the connection is a string and so on looking at your own tutorial seems so bad I mean it does make sense though I mean whenever I make tutorials I make it trying to teach in the way that I would like to learn so it does make sense that my own tutorials would be perfect for my own learning so yeah whenever I miss something yeah I go back into my own videos and it starts exactly how I like to teach it so yeah prefer Co routine or csharp task uh for me I don't prefer either of them I prefer simple timers but yeah if I had to choose between both I would probably go with a csharp task because coroutines I really do not like uh I really don't like how they force you to use a very strange pattern uh so what does this return a relay service exception all right so debug.log on the E okay so basically this returns an allocation location inside empty really all right so this is an allocation so I get that and I've got to await it all right so I've got the allocation uh then I just get the join code async all right so relay service service instance so get the join code async and I gotta pass in the allocation ID so do I pass in the whole thing just the allocation dot on location ID so this is going to be the string for the join code all right so recently this one gives me the code right I've got to oh wait this always Gotta Wait a weight and async is always still quite a bit tricky to figure out yeah how do you call this in the lobby manager script well basically the idea is the lobby manager starts the game which goes into this scene which actually starts the host because the issue with the relay is that right after I get the joint code I got immediately start the host so from this one I would oh crap I hit Ctrl B well that's messed up uh it's basically Channel after breaking so I missed brackies it's been like two three years now damn that was a long time I'll look forward to your free course video series huh thank you it's nice I didn't make a tutorial on how to make tutorial videos well the answer is you'll learn something yourself and then you write some script on how to teach it to someone yeah there's really no no special secret to that that's really it just have to learn enough yourself so that you can teach others that's pretty much it how you got the name Code Monkey for the channel I always I always found that an interesting term even though for a lot of people they actually consider that an insult but for me I don't know I find it fun I think it's a fun term and it was actually the name that I wanted to use for my Steam games instead of using endless loop Studios I wanted to use Code Monkey Studios but at the time yeah I ended up going with a different name and then when I first made this channel I decided hey why don't I reuse that fun name from walio so yeah that's pretty much it yeah and there's a really nice song about it so yeah that's also fun all right are you Brazilian nope I'm Portuguese okay right so I create really yeah that's pretty much it this is going to get the join code and so on all right so after I get the join code nah crap ads because I'm not signed in because I'm in my usual thing I've got YouTube premium which is actually quite a great deal if you use YouTube a lot like I do I'm constantly on YouTube so yeah for me it does work out quite well alright so we make the do I just bought hypernice Ah that's awesome I hope you enjoy it yeah that is a I really enjoyed making it that game it was my pretty much my only action game the whole idea behind that game was making it making it all about uh being thanks again for the Super Chat CPU thank you yeah hyper Knights that was really fun that was the one that I wanted to make make it make an action game something controlled by a Gamepad and I really enjoyed that I think it was a a really fun game I think it's an interesting idea and the reviews are very positive so yeah people enjoy it yeah this was a a really fun game to make very interesting and by the way you can notice the characters are are indeed similar that's because I've been using this animation system for well for well 2017. I think this was the first game that I used it I think so because on Survivor Squad they did not use that so yeah for this game was the first time that I used this animation system that you can still see that I'm still using it nowadays so yeah that is uh that's fun yeah anyway so this was a great game I hope you I hope you enjoyed playing it because yeah that was a that was a fun one all right which server provider are you using I'm using all of ginti's tools so yeah pretty much just Unity uh all right so over here let's see you once again let me try catch on the no not Lobby relay service exception to debug.log on the ink and then over here I go into relay service relay service that are way too many with this name instance and over here it would be join allocation async and then you gotta pass in the drawing code so the join code which I receive your restring for the join code and this one is in a weight or is it it is available you find this better or worse than rather for entity that I have not used writer so I don't really know much about it but I do know a bunch of people on swear by it so yeah it must be good because so many people I've heard say so many good things about it so yeah that must be good wait oh right because I did not make racing that's why async white is always so tricky 38 through your visual scripting course oh that's awesome glad you've learned that was a was also a fun course to make also a ton of work but I'm really happy with how it came out yeah I think visual scripting is definitely an excellent thing for people to learn if you want to learn about logic how to make games things yeah visual scripting is an excellent tool I really like it yeah the course be available sometime at the end of January of that you're making this course in Hong Kong give to the community yeah I hope the the final video comes out really well I mean so far I'm really happy with what I've written so I really hope that the final thing is going to be something really detailed that can help people who are both beginners and some more intermediate so yeah should be really fun Should Be contained quite a lot of knowledge for pretty much anyone of any skill level so yeah I'm really looking forward to finally having the whole thing and do that when you think of phone dots course won't be out for 1.0 well actually stay tuned for the video on Monday because on that one I'll be talking about what are my goals for 23 and indeed one of the goals is to make a complete course whenever dots 1.0 does come out so yep that's definitely part of the plan so whenever that happens probably around March or April when that happens yep I definitely want to spend a whole bunch of time making something really awesome think AI will replace humans in Game Dev industry AI isn't really about replacing it's more about uh working alongside it so chat GPT I made a video about it it's a it's a very very impressive tool it's really amazing what it can do when you when you look at it it's really insanely impressive but yeah it's not you're meant to work with the AI rather than just replacing you so yeah if you're worried about that I would say don't be worried just learn how to use it and that way you have a nice little assistant that can help you do quite a lot of things yeah it's a very interesting Tool uh okay so what was I doing so I got the relay I joined the relay yeah I just need to look into how do I make it a Connect right because there are two methods I remember that so yeah I've got installed the other ones so yeah basically just get the really server data with an allocation and then I get the does this have the network manager no but I do got the Singleton so I can use the network manager Singleton so on the create I do that all right get component of type Unity transport so transport so this one and then I set the really server data is it really server data yeah I think so so we only server data this one we only server data and basically I do a new one put in the location and dtls I still don't know what that stands for dedicated TLS maybe I don't know uh okay so basically really server data so basically this will create the relay and use it and then down here will there be collisions in this game uh yes and no there are collisions with the with the counters although yeah if you're looking for complex physics things then no that one will not be it's not a physics based game so yeah it won't just have just Basics just you don't push over counters that's it um to use really server down so is that the same thing all right so it is super easy so how do I get the join allocation I get all right this is one that returns from here right you've got the join allocation so join a location so you get this one then you pass in this one you set that one and yep so then you got the join relay and yeah yeah so it's from this one that you're going to either start the client or start the host all right okay so I think that's pretty much it super simple free course yep working on it should be really nice should be fun all right so basically all right so let me think about how am I going to make this so basically if you are a host and you're going to create the relay but the thing is after the relay is done then I gotta send the data back and the issue is that I'm not sure how I'm doing the hmm okay now I gotta remember how this works how you doing today I'm doing nice why don't you use the Dark theme because it burns my eyes hey CPU bye see you next time thanks for being here all right uh I'm trying to remember how the lobby works so you got the player and the player has a bunch of things yeah it's the change mode so that's kind of thing updating Lobby game mode because I don't remember how this one works can you do that all right so actually so if I do uh what do I call it set relay code and a string for the Relay code really join code that's more like set really join code right so I got this one really join code so I'm going to have to okay now I'm trying to think you're right exactly it's the it's the the host is the one okay so let me do the key uh relay join code so really join codes and actually on this one so on the key game modes and over here I'm going to do this one instead it's gonna make it public make it private even though it doesn't really matter how to add voice or text track to the game yep I definitely would like to cover vvox in a in a dedicated video tutorial that would be interesting I still have not yet looked at the that but yeah definitely within my goal okay tips for an inspiring YouTuber I mean study a lot and be ready to work a lot for a long time before you find something that works I'm sorry but that that's really it it's only very few people can make it right out of the gate yeah for a lot of people it really takes a long time I mean for me it took me 20 months before my videos generated any money so yeah if your goal is doing YouTube for money definitely I would not encourage you to do that because it is insanely difficult so yeah the tips are really just study as much as you can learn about good titles good thumbnails how to pick a good video idea and then of course it depends on the niche that you're at different niches have different results different things different cpms different everything so yeah quite difficult uh is it normal when I run an async function it still runs in the editor after a Subway mode no that's not really normal I mean sometimes you might have like some garbage allocation so you might get an error in the console but then it should stop pretty much making enough so that you have to pay Unity some amount of money uh actually right now no because right now my games aren't they're already preowned so right now they're not generating too much but anyways regardless of that Unity offers their Unity Pro to people who are in their insiders thing so yeah regardless of that I do have Unity Pro because they give me a key that's pretty much it okay so anyway so I got the set really join code so basically I just need to call this so on the kitchen game manager when I create the relay so this one create starts to host okay that's great then I've got to go into the unlocking manager access the instance and set the relay join code and pass in this join code so then the other ones are going to see okay so let me just uh right let me just try to figure this out a little bit so I got the key game mode and the relay join code so I've got to set this one set it as private and start off with nothing okay so then basically on the update I gotta remember how did I do this Lobby get Lobby async so this is the lobby that the player is in right so in here dot data is that it oh God I haven't seen well I haven't seen my own really video really video my own yeah but that's the key game mode okay basically I just gotta remember this let me actually just do a Depot dialogue I think I think at least I'm thinking on the right track so let's see if that is correct appreciate your videos trying to learn Unity finally for the thousands time trying to make it sick all right that's awesome go for it I hope it works out yeah definitely definitely stick with it I mean it doesn't it's not super easy for anyone I mean gamedev is an inherently complex thing so yeah definitely don't feel too bad if you have problems just keep at it and every time you try every code you write everything you do it always becomes easier and easier so definitely keep on trying uh uh boom there you go right of course because I because I destroyed the thing so I need to add don't destroy unload otherwise this thing is going to get destroyed so don't destroy unload this do I do this or game object yeah I think this works uh right and I didn't actually see if that one was working so let's see that pumping in game development I mean that depends on what you mean by that for example one thing that I think is really good is for example with regards only that memory uh with regards to coming up with ideas for games being able to flesh out some idea being able to come up with some more game mechanics that fit into your game for that kind of thing I think it's a an excellent brainstorming tool but for copy pasting code for that no I don't think so for that I did make a video on on chatgpt where I talked about entire object all right I forgot uh so yeah GPT is an excellent brainstorming tools an excellent sort of uh virtual assistant but yeah definitely don't just blindly copy paste code because there are some things that were calling some things that don't so yeah definitely be wary of using it blindly okay so pretty much like this I do think it should work do you think it's much better to aim for a job in Game Dev or go solo I would say that for that it really depends on where you live like for example for me when I was first getting started with game development I really didn't have an option there was no game development Studio over here in Portugal so for me the option was go ahead by myself or don't do it so so yeah for me there wasn't much option but if you do have an option well that depends I mean if you live in a low cost of living country then maybe it can work and why is this oh boy where's this broken I don't know oh it's not broken it's empty intentional okay um when you're in the lobby oh God right so this is actually going to be a bit trickier than I thought hmm oh boy I'm gonna have to think long and hard about this afterwards okay making an online cooking game yep that is indeed the goal it's to making something kind of like overcooked and it's going to be made in a free phone video course so it should be really fun all right so basically because the okay so I'm trying to think I don't remember what was the problem a while ago which one caused the don't destroy unload because this one back in this one this one was set the relay join code which then is it because it was firing this is that it all right so maybe I just need some yeah try dependency inject in unity uh not exactly I usually try to make my code potentially testable but I don't usually write tests so yeah dependency injection that sort of thing those are usually not something that I use in my own in my own thing but yep they are definitely very powerful tools especially if you if you work in the team they can definitely be insanely good um all right so what is this what exactly is calling the lobby it's the lobby y yeah exactly yeah I think that is the problem because Lobby wise listening to the event so the other one is still in firing events you have the game mode change actually I don't need to fire that event so I don't know why I was doing that so yeah so that's basically it and then on this one you keep poisoning okay so yeah so basically I do think my logic is indeed working so if this one is not known then that means we have a joined relay code so I can go first my start game my start game yeah so start game then let's see a private join game stream for the join relay code trying to think I name it the other way really join code and basically just going to go hmm so this one would be his host equals fonts uh and then for the joint relay code yeah for now let me put it here I'm definitely going to have to clean up quite a lot of code here uh all right so the relay join code just put it here and on the is host over here set it into this one so the lobby manager dot relay join code set it down so then on this guy I try to check and if you are a host and you create the relay if not then you join the relay and you've got to go into the lobby manager and access this one to get the relay code okay great all right so I do think that should work and now for the joint game I just need to do it here and I don't think this is going to run on the first one so I do think like this it should be working okay so let's see first one if it works here and then if it works on a build all right okay so let's head on play authenticate create a new one create let's start the game and after a bit and there you go no errors all right that's fun so I can pick up some cheese and cut it and make some meat and so on all right so that's fun have you used readymade assets well if you're asking about these assets and these ones were actually I hired an artist to make these assets so that I have the rights so that I'm able to distribute them so for the final course video you'll be able to download these Assets in order to follow along with the course and so on so yeah that was actually really fun finding an artist to make assets it was a a pretty nice process so yeah I'm pretty happy that I'll be able to provide the assets so that you can follow along and should be really fun do you play video games whenever I have time I do but yeah I don't normally have time so yeah that's actually quite tricky quite tricky yeah why is your visual citywide because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it yep yep Danny I did use Fiverr it was the the what's in like the simplest thing I went through a bunch of freelancer websites and Fiverr seemed pretty easy with a lot of people so yeah it definitely went through Fiverr found a bunch of people sent the message and there you go and I'm really happy with the final result I think they all look really nice the look at this bread model that looks really nice the cheese looks really nice the huge tomato also looks real nice yeah I'm very very happy with all of these that's pretty much it okay what channels do you enjoy most well actually a game that I started playing like two months ago but I've only played in like four hours was uh uh Marvel's midnight Suns that was really fun I was really enjoying that so I'd like to have some time to go back to that and keep playing that to the end because that was that was quite fun so that I'd love to continue doing that okay so let's make a proper build and see if it works the game already looks finished not quite this one I mean this one is my testing prototype so actually the code that you see here is quite a little bit dirtier than what you won't see in the final course even though actually it's a pretty uh pretty similar to the final thing but yeah so basically basically the course will start from a completely empty project and write out the whole thing so it won't have a fry counter it will have a bunch of lists a bunch of events it will have some inheritance it won't have a bunch of scriptable objects it will have state machines flow timers and so on so I do think the funnel core should be really fun and again building the whole thing from scratch so all the code everything explain everything really nice so I'm really really looking forward to finally finishing this project so that I can publish it and see what you all think hopefully it should be fun uh okay so I got this let me just open up another build so let me just open this go into the build and open up another one all right so on this one let's hit on Point Let's authenticate and create a brand new Lobby okay then on this one lets it play authenticate with a different name let's say Iron Man authenticate let's join the lobby and okay both are on the same Lobby so on this one let's start and see if this one joins after it receives a join code does he get it uh okay now the problem is that I don't have the quantum console on this one so I don't actually know why this one failed so let's see let's try doing it on this one why don't you use parallel sync Just because I haven't looked into it just yet actually Unity has an official tool coming up to deal with that so that should be interesting but yeah the only reason just because I haven't had the time to look into it since I'm making something that can create a bone super easily it's actually not much of a concern so yeah uh okay so make this one wait that's the yeah I messed up I messed up so on this one let me authenticate with a different name so this is the one that I want to create so let me put something let's create a brand new Lobby then on this one let's refresh join that one uhhuh there's an error right away really the key was not found really so the lobby isn't well that's strange why doesn't Lobby not have that is strange because you have to join Lobby we're drawing yeah create a lobby with lobbying really join code huh is because it's private I don't remember what the right okay that's it yeah yeah I am not very smart nope this one is meant to be member not private yeah that is why that one could not access it so where else do I got now private but remember okay so that was it I think that was the only problem so let's see make another build and see if it works all right it's nice thank you yeah I hope everyone will enjoy it it's been a ton of work so yeah I hope I hope the final result will be fun hopefully I'm studying engineering it's my second year studying it in Morocco and I still haven't deciding should I do programming should I think about it more because I'm passionate about Game Dev I mean I would say you can do both so you can keep studying engineering and do Game Dev on the side as a hobby I would definitely encourage you to do that that way you don't have any pressure there's no no stress you have to make you have to make some money or anything so you can just make money in your regular engineering job and then have some fun with Game Dev on the side personally that's what I would do that way it's much less risk much more easy to handle okay was it pen spinning yeah pen spinning is a it's pretty fun something that I've been doing for years I'm not very good I only I pretty much only knew the the thumb around and the what is called the infinity yeah which always drops every once in a while but yeah all right anyways uh so let me join and see if that one did that one uh oh there you go it worked did it work it worked all right awesome oh boy yeah that was quite something they want to go is your pen never right yeah actually this pen is not right this one is not it's not made for writing this one is just for pen spinning I got different pens if I want to write but yeah this one is just for occupying my hands while I'm thinking that's pretty much that's the goal of it yeah many hours he's been coding well that depends on what I'm doing I mean for making the videos most of my time is spent researching and writing rather than programming when I'm making my games it's pretty much nonstop programming from day to night since I mostly do code uh okay so yeah so basically everything worked perfectly right yeah I think so let me make two builds and see if both builds do work all right so I made a nice main menu so I can click I can go in then obviously the name I'm going to have to write get the steam API integration something like that or actually not I actually don't need the profile name anyways sure fine yeah so get one name different name doesn't really matter let's authenticate so on this one create a Lobby then on this one refresh join the lobby and connect and I just messed up yet because that one is not supposed to connect okay all right so let's go back ah crap yeah because I gotta hide that one all right what do you use for multiplayer I'm using unity's net code for game objects which I have a very detailed video on if you want to learn uh actually yeah I mean since I got the thing here so multiplayer so if you want a really detailed video on how to use netcode for game objects that's pretty much what I'm using as well it's really in lobby so basically in this project I'm going to be using all of the two almost all of them there's about opening eye yep and I did make a video about it so if you want to see what I think about chai GPT go watch this video so basically it's a really fun tool really awesome but no it's not going to replace people that's not really what it's meant to do okay so uh basically on this one let me create give it a different name create then on this one refresh let's join okay now I gotta remember this one is the host so on this one let's join this one goes in it allocates a real way it starts the thing this guy receives the join relay code and you go and there you go it does connect so everything does work all right awesome and actually let me see the um uh Unity dashboard can I see this so let me see over here on this one and I want to go into multiplayer and lobby but let me actually put this over here all right so yeah look at that it is working so this one is the lobby thing there you go getting a bunch of counts what are counts all right request is in kilobytes sending 41 kilobytes okay that's nice I have no idea if that's a lot or not a lot in the context of a and Lobby and then on the relay is it really sending data and yep it is so yeah if it does work so right now what time is it it's 5 42 so yep right now the relay is indeed active so these two these two words yep there you go so these two then look like they are connected just locally but nope all the data is going through an internet connection so yeah all right it works okay that's awesome are you open for code reviews of your students games I mean that that is something that I would love to be able to do but the amount of time required to do that that is pretty insane so yeah I would love to do that but unless I can find a time machine here I don't think I'll be able to do that is it free or peertopeer are you talking about really it's peertopeer and there's a free tier and after that it's paid so yeah which by the way if you just joined the live stream right now I'm actually making a nice fun steam build for the game in the free course so if you want go ahead on that add it to your wish list basically this game will obviously be free so yeah just a fun way for you to play the the course game before going through the course that's pretty much it what if the hostess connects as a relay out of sign hosting rights nope that has to be done manually or I guess they had that on the on the uh multiple roadmap but I don't think they've done that already so yeah for right now it does have to be done manually okay right well I think that's gonna be it because it's already my voice already messed up I gotta go have dinner and so on all right so I think that's gonna be it so when are you gonna release some prechorus well I'm hard to work on it so it will hopefully come within the end of this month the end of January so I don't know maybe on the 25th maybe on the 30th something like that so yeah selling quite a lot of work to do but yeah everything is coming along nicely so hopefully by then it should be a fun course
