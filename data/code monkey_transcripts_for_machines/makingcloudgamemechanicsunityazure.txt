foreign foreign foreign thank you thank you thing okay all right so go ahead post any question chat and I'll try to keep a nice balance between doing some work and answering some questions okay everything seems good so all right any reason you went to it Azure over gcpr AWS and the answer is really just because Unity recently announced their partnership with Microsoft so pretty much when that happened I went to research Azure so yeah that's pretty much the only reason just because Unity officially partnered with them although that partnership doesn't really mean much at least so far they haven't announced anything specifically but yeah pretty much that that's the only reason just because they announced has partnership so I figured if Unity is going to be more close to Azure then this would be a great time to start learning it that's pretty much it what is the best pricing plan for blob storage I don't know what you mean do you mean in comparison with Google cloud and it only asks actually don't know what is difference to that one but I do know that for the use case that I that I'm trying out for the use case that I'm going to Showcase in the in the video and in these demos these cases it's pretty much free basically on the amount of data that we're storing doing lots of interesting Game Dev mechanics cloudbased game mechanics that actually end up pretty much free since all of the pay as you go they're all extremely generous so yeah this is honestly a really interesting use case and hopefully this video will inspire some of you to add some interesting cloudbased mechanics and so on yeah premium hot cold and archive are you asking what those are I mean hot is basically something that you are constantly uh requesting constantly going to the cloud downloading a pointing and so on calling this when you do that unless often an archive is when you do that like once a year or something like that and pretty much unless often you access the data the more the cheaper it is that's pretty much it but the ENT uses Azure for empty Cloud yep I do think well actually a while ago like uh five years ago something like that Unity actually announced a partnership with Google so I think things like multiplay I think those are based on Google Cloud so the other enti gaming services I don't know maybe they are maybe they are Azure base or still on Google Cloud not sure but yeah it's interesting how Unity had a partnership with one provider and then essentially swap for another so anyways all of that is just it's just selections of the underlying company but for a game developer you can use whatever code you want and Azure is actually pretty simple all right so let's do some work so basically on this first one uh on this first demo I've got a little character right here which is actually exactly the same code as all the characters on screen here so I've got a character in the basic world so that's pretty much it and basically what I want to implement in this demo is something kind of like a Steam Workshop so pretty much some place where you can upload some mods some Sprite sheets some code a bunch of things and then in your game people can download them and one essentially a Sim workshop with the add benefit that with the same Workshop you need to be working on seminar for it to work whereas if you build your own using just some basic Cloud Tunes you can essentially deploy it on on Console Switch Mobile whatever so that is pretty much the main benefit all right so let's do this so the main thing that I want is I just want to pretty much go into the cloud and download the file for some kind of NPC and just place the NPC on a position to work so that's the basic thing that I want to do so let's first actually do this over here in the code and then going to handle the connection with that okay I'm waiting for your Zombie Survival game live stream oh did you see that unlisted video yeah that is that is a idea that I very much want to make but yeah requires a bit more a bit more preparation so yeah that one will hopefully be in the future perhaps next week I definitely want to do live streams a bit more regular so yeah live stream be saved as a video Yep this will be and actually for this one usually for the live streams I put them as unlisted videos so if you want to see all of the live streams if you go onto the playlist there's one over here for the live streams there you go so if you want to see all the past live streams they're on right here on display list but for this one I'm actually going to experiment leaving this one as a regular video whereas all of these they are all unlisted so yeah I'm going to leave it as normal and see what what that does basically because previously YouTube would pretty much punish a channel if if it had a bunch of live streams that didn't get many clicks since that's not the kind of content that people usually want to watch so for this one I'm going to experiment leaving it up see what happens with the analytics and so on so yeah that should be an interesting experiment we shall see but yeah so this one will be recorded right from Portugal yep yes I am okay so so let's do this let me just start our first thing let's make uh let's go into over here the workshop let's make a csharp script and let's go and with the cloud Workshop and okay so let's see so basically the first thing that I need is what data do I want to store so let's see actually instead of this let me make a crop where are my all right it was just compounding uh so let's make a script for the data that I want uh whatever I want let's say cloud mod something like this it's going to be very generic even though right now it's really just going to be an NPC but okay so over here I just want the glass just to Define what kind of data do I want hey CPU hey thanks for being here yeah White theme yeah sorry but dark mode seriously burns my eye so yeah I can't use dark mode I really have to use always in light mode otherwise I won't die okay so I want to store in Vector 3 for this falling position then I want to store some kind of string for the text message and then another string for some kind of uh Sprite sheet URL simulator and then perhaps add some more muddy things but okay something like this it should be good enough as a starting point so this is data that I want and actually all these should be public always make it private by by default yeah okay uh right so let me go into the other one called Workshop close on these okay so let's do a simple input test so get key down so pressing Tiki yeah okay so when that happens let's first of all just instantiate a cloud mod Cloud mod equals a new one and inside spawn position let's decide on some position then for the spreadsheet URL figure it out and text message say hi there not that it's not hit hi all right okay so I've got a cloud demand what skills we need in Triple A companies well that's going to depend on the company I mean some companies use Unity some companies even in real others use a custom engine so yeah it really depends what company what room what thing yeah that varies quite a lot only input system is more pregnant yeah for for super quick prototyping I run like the Simplicity of this one so yeah the new input system is definitely great I definitely encourage you to use it when working on a proper project but for making a quick prototype this one is just so much easier okay so I've got a quad mob now let's handle quite void spawn Fallout mods or just one mod this is a cloud mod Cloud mod and okay they're csharp specific collections to use with Azure now really I mean the way you interact at least the way that I'm going to be using it which is using the Azure functions the way you interact with that is really just with a simple web request so I actually got a class that I made in a previous video and I have since updated it so this one pretty much just does a routine on some kind of URL and just return some things and yeah I'm actually I updated this class but I made it originally let's see where's my browser where's my browser there it is um HTTP which one is it yeah right here so if you want to learn how to contact a URL which is pretty much the only thing that you need in order to interact with anything related to the cloud so that's how you do it it's super simple and yeah so basically all of the mechanics that I'm going to be doing whilst they don't look quite a bit complex they're actually pretty simple once you once you've built them so yes all right so okay so what about private spawn Cloud mod so over here I'm going to need the things that I want to spawn so let me make a serialized field private transform for uh just need to spawn some kind of NPC then down here let's instantiate this NPC on the cloud Mod Dot spawn position not the podmod.spawn position and for turning identity let's see transform for the MTC transform uh and okay just like this spawn Cloud mod and best in the cloud mod okay so let's see if I can spawn an NPC but in order to make sure that works well actually I don't remember I haven't used my 2D characters in quite a while but let's go on this project pretty much make a custom Steam Workshop that is pretty much the goal here uh uh right so on this one it's been a long time since I worked with my 2D characters uh Beyond let's say pfnpc com like that let's make it a prefilm and actually I have to remove the character controller I think like this it should still work let's put this somewhere else and let's give it a different body a different Sprite do I have multiples right here I don't think I do um right so actually let me grab a Sprite just for testing so go into Sprites into my characters and let me just put this over here there you go all right so which Sprite do I want to use just for testing how about the blueprint man so let's go with this one and let me just dump it in here so just place it in there okay so I've got my blueprint man then over here let me just duplicate the material why am I not finding the material why is that Marines 14 3D okay so let me just that's over here let's duplicate it and okay so it's called the Blue Print man drag it up here okay so over here the blueprint man let's use this okay let's just see if this guy spawns what's saying what do you think about visual scripting in unity I think it is awesome I think it is really great that is why one of my courses is on making games internally using visual scripting so yeah I'm a big fan I think it's great I think it's an excellent it can be a learning step if your goal was to become a programmer but if you're going to be a designer then it can just be an excellent thing just by itself so yeah visual scripting really awesome all right so my blueprint man worked perfectly oh okay I did not expect none all right so apparently I can push push the rigid body right because I don't have any controller okay I'll add another controller so or no just yeah I don't care about collisions so let's just make it a trigger just so I can push them around because that's quite a bit tricky okay can you make game like look for that using just Blueprints and Unreal Engine I mean as far as I know blueprints in Unreal Engine are extremely powerful pretty much just as powerful as C plus plus so technically yes although it's always a problem with some kind of visual scripting or blueprints the problem is always performance so yeah I would not attempt to make a game on that scale using entirely just visual scripting I would definitely use something more proper because you can always mix and match you don't have to always go for a fullon visual scripting or fall on csharp you can mix them both so yeah okay anyway so and did that work all right I didn't spawn it just make sure that the NPC okay that does work all right that's awesome so now that I've got an NPC let's make a script to run my cloud Workshop so over here let's just reset this let's go what game is he working on not really a game just just uh preparing demos for a future video future video talking about on the kinds of cloudbased game mechanics that you could build which is a pretty interesting topic okay if I press on t and yep and why did it spawn with the own okay I don't know all right so it worked and it didn't work did I selected wrong or did I not override it yeah I didn't override it okay so you use this all right so yep that one did work okay video on Unity twin twin 2.2 water system package well I won't I always use the LTS version so I won't be swapping to Unity 22.2 or 22.3 when that LTS version happens so when that happens I will definitely check out which ones what are the new features on that version because they're always interesting things all right awesome okay so I can press a button and I can spawn a character super simple by the way I can see someone here using a a custom live chat character by the way if you want to know you can actually do that so if you go here's a nice little tutorial so if you want to customize your character you can download the base texture you can draw up on it and then you can make your own character down here be a bit more special so if you want go ahead and use that it's a real interesting mechanic but actually not many people use it I guess it takes a bit of effort to draw on top of it but yeah only to some interesting results okay all right uh okay where was I right so I can press a button and spawn okay let me just move the position a little bit so for the NPC instead of going on zero zero let's say I went over there in the corner so that's on 2 4.4 so up here and let's go with a two and a 4.4 F okay great all right so that part is working all right hey Tempo Jones hey thanks for using it that's a really awesome character yeah boy I haven't played Rayman in ages I think the last one that I played was on the game boy yeah I haven't played the part new ones the Rayman Legends and Origins from what I can see they are excellent but yeah definitely need to know a lot of tweeting around yeah figuring out the correct positions for all the things definitely takes a bit of work but I think the results are pretty fun I think it's pretty interesting okay right so I can spawn a button and spawn a cloud mod and honestly this is the basics that I want to do for now now pretty much just what I want to do is be able to grab this not being hard code over here but essentially just being downloaded from the web okay so let's do that now first thing let's figure out how to convert this into Json so let's save this into Json the cloud mod so this one is going to be a string for the Json string and let's do a debug.org on this Json string Okay so all right so let's see if this one works and if so then save a file then upload to the cloud and so on remain in ages character just remind me of him yeah I mean I made them just because I'm not a very good artist so putting them like this with separate body parts makes it easier because I don't have to make any kind of arms or legs but yeah it's a nice uh it's a nice coincidence coincidence or maybe was inspired by it I don't know I made this style such a long time ago but yeah without having to do any arms or legs definitely simplifies the character creation process so yeah that is really great okay was I doing just tools for making good looking UI I mean good looking UI is all about good looking textures so yeah the tone would be whatever artist tools you have so Photoshop then add a lot of animations a lot of flashy things and so on yeah that's pretty much it Jason utility this is from the standard uh Unity Library so in the engine Json utility so this is all include all right so this is the thing okay great now the next thing that I want uh is to be able to download this from the web so let me actually copy this let's make a file that we're going to upload to the cloud so let me go into my desktop okay let's create a new text document uh what I'm going to call it mod yeah just mod.json and yep and let me open this with this and just paste my Json okay now let's go into where do I want to go I want to go into Azure and I want to go into my storage account okay let's go into containers and let's make container called mods and okay by the way if you have no idea what Azure is how to use it then definitely wait a while I'm still editing the video but maybe the other week after that so everything that I'm doing I will explain in that video so if you oh right um so yeah don't worry if you if you cannot follow this this isn't really supposed to be a tutorial all right okay so mod.json I've got my file in the cloud super simple all right so I got that okay and did I use uh right here because I don't get it directly get it through that okay great all right to use Azure 10K villain coming uh actually no really I mean for the use case that I didn't I mean I've been testing out tons of things and so far I've spent zero dollars so yeah for making interesting game mechanics it definitely doesn't cost much I mean if you try to build a service like Netflix where you got terabytes of data yeah it definitely becomes quite a bit like that but if you use for simple game mechanics you can build quite a lot in its own pretty much free okay great right let's focus what am I doing so mod.json okay great so the next thing that I want is to be able to return this through an Azure function so let's go into my Azure functions where it is there it is all right so here I've got a project this one is connected to my Azure and I've got a function so for the function let's rename this called get mod okay let's rename it okay rename this so get mod I'm only going to have a get okay log let's say just some like get mod is azure paid it is free and paid at the same time so it depends on how much how much you do with it yeah uh right so okay for now let's just return testing okay just like this so git mode get testing so that's pretty much it so let's try first of all just a quick test or actually oh yeah this works I was gonna I was going to use that but okay uh right so let's copy these oh crap yeah I shouldn't probably close that so let's go where's my browser it's kind of hard to see things with all the characters down there but if I get my Rosie yeah testing okay so it is working locally Azure preferable using Unity Cloud I mean those are pretty much very uh different things Unity Cloud does have a lot of cloudbased mechanics but not all of them for example the exam that I'm doing here trying to build a custom Workshop the unity Cloud doesn't really have anything equivalent that would allow you to do that so yeah for the things that Unity gaming Services already exists where am I going just close and publish uh for the things that entity gaming Services can already do definitely I would recommend you use that but for the things that don't then yeah using a standard oh that's why this one is open uh using a standard Cloud definitely has yeah a lot more options a lot more possibilities all that all right plan making a video tutorial on this topic yep I'm currently working on it currently editing it so yeah okay so while that is working let's see that of your videos you should stream Unity stuff more often yep I definitely want to that is definitely the plan now that the tech is working because I made a quick Tech test a while ago said because I hadn't live stream in quite a very long time but yeah everything went quite well so yeah okay so over here get key down any advanced course for 2D game art and assets that you suggest please don't say you and me why not use me I mean what I don't know what Unity uh use me what it has wrong uh yeah I'm I'm not an artist so I really can't uh point you to any specific point but yeah there's lots of udemy courses so I don't know why you would why you would intentionally not want to use either me but okay but yeah I mean there's also tons of awesome free videos on YouTube so if you want to learn how to draw I mean the main benefit that courses provide is simply the fact that courses can they provide a guided path but they don't really have any kind of special knowledge so yeah going with courses or free videos either way pretty much works okay response something what's my avatar oh did you upload something different so I'm going to it's a whole manual validation thing so let me see the validation okay where all the page is loading let me just finish this uh so debug.log doing a simple response of this response and on the error always got all the errors so debug download let's say error and say some kind of error okay yeah you updated so I'm validating it right now let's see if anyone else uploaded a custom texture nope apparently not after that or my website is broken but I don't think so just in case you're interested in interested in making your own custom character There's the link okay and let me just update the character customization where CPU yep there you are with the updated character really nice little tshirt that's nice all right tied dark mode on Ides nope I mean I have tried it and it simply burns my eye so that is why I cannot do them but yeah that is kind of the issue okay so let's go okay that's the file right so let's go up here into my function and that's going to get mod and just get the function URL and read only mode yep I know all right so let's get my function then go into my there you go paste my function and okay so let's see if this one let's see if we have a response from the clouds time is it ready 5 30. okay nice it's getting good so far hope you're enjoying the live stream I'm trying to do my best between doing some nice work and answering questions press the Y and yep we've got the testing response all right awesome that is great that is great because most are from beginners yeah you definitely will find mostly beginners course goodbye all right uh yeah you will mostly find beginner courses just because that's what well honestly that's what courses sell more because there's not a lot of market for more advanced use cases so the more advanced you are the more you have to be kind of an auto dialect that's kind of how things go pretty much most of the things that I that I that I learned nowadays I have to learn the hard way so to speak by going to all the docs and all the things because well when you're trying to learn more advanced stuff there really isn't much hand holding so yeah that's kind of how things are all right great so over here I can return all right awesome and now for another Quick Test actually now that I think about it yeah no reason to you to contact Azure itself if I just want to test then I can just contact my localhost so actually let's do another quick test so let me go and grab the file Json just go out of this one dark mode saves my eyes yep I mean different people have different eyes that's kind of thing some people really enjoy working on an extremely dark room and I do not I cannot do that I got to be in a welllit room so yeah pretty much just different people have very different eyes can I paste this like this string turn and actually uh right yeah because right yeah I always forget that it has this the paste special paste Json as classes that is really oh crap I don't want to paste it in there so let's base it out here so paste Json as classes all right so I've got a spawn position okay yeah this one is it's a vector three then you got a string another string and the root object what did I call this the class mod where's my other I call this the cloud mod so the cloud mod all right so over here let's uh let's make it Cloud mod Cloud mod and yeah over here I don't have the Json utility this kind of a thing yep nice step on page yeah but I just I just found that out recently like a couple of weeks ago yeah it's super useful you just post some Json in your in your clipboard then go into paste special and automatically paste the thing so if you've got a really complex Json string this is definitely a massive Lifesaver it's super awesome okay so over here instead of using Json utility since I'm not in unity I have to use the Newton soft Json so using Json convert then I always get this these confused the these serializer serialized I want to convert back so that's deserialize deserialize an object and the object is going to be this string did it cannot convert oh never mind uh cloud mod all right awesome okay so I think that should have worked okay so we've got the cloud mode and let's return the cloud okay actually do I need the okay object result I don't think so so let's see now let's make a mod system light one in fact or it won't I haven't seen the mod system like in factorio but oh crap this doesn't yeah wait what am I thinking about I gotta return jit yeah and it was uh yeah I haven't seen the one in factorio but yep absolutely you can't do that so string return Json Json convert.com object pretty much anything that you can do with the standard uh Steam Workshop that's pretty much what I'm trying to emulate on a way that does not require steam that's kind of the going with this demo okay so I've got the return Json let's see if this one is working it should be returning pretty much exactly what that what that string says so here I got my function let's copy the URL then where's my browser over here let's go in there and yep it is returning down okay awesome so now on my game instead of trying to go let's just go into the local host and try to get that one compound do you have experience with nope that is actually another topic that I've been researching because of course Louie is widely used in in uh modding so yep that is another thing that I've been researching I've seen that there exists something called uh moonsharp yep that's it so yeah I've been I'm actually currently researching that so hopefully within the next few weeks I will have a video on how to use Lua for modding and so on because yeah that one that one would obviously fit perfectly with this kind of stuff making a custom Workshop that would be very interesting all right so yep this did work then contact the download set an Azure free plan yep you can actually go into the the crap uh I never know the link but the pricing calculator if you search for that yep you see the this one is in Portuguese English the pricing calculator so you can go over here you can select all kinds of things and see it yep so for example Azure functions and this one as you can see the first 400 gigabytes per second and the first one million executions are free so in terms of making a small indie game this this part is essentially family free and in terms of a storage account this is the other required part making pretty much any kind of thing uh if you put location doesn't really matter pull up storage with standard just like that with local redundancy with a hot access tier and if you store just one gigabyte and you do pretty much a tiny amount of operations if you do all of that and over here 13 cents per month so yeah the functions are free and the storage is going to cost you at most 13 cents per month so yeah using Azure for small indie games this is definitely a fascinating thing that is likely completely free so yeah that is why I'm covering this because it's uh such an awesome thing that I don't think a lot of people know about so yeah Gibson likes unless he's looking for money yeah most games use little for modding it's one of the most popular uh languages so yeah definitely something that I want to research all right so where was I downloading I get the response to Json okay so now I just got to take that I gotta use Json utility from Json convert it into a cloud mod and it's going to be the response and this returns a cloud mod so that's the cloud mod and then I do spawn Cloud mod on this Cloud mod and now it should pretty much do exactly the same thing as it was doing like 20 minutes ago except right now it's going to be downloading it from the web so let's see and press the white button and there you go there's my thing all right awesome okay so everything is working pretty nicely there you go the get mod succeed and everything works perfectly okay so the next step is to make it downloaded from the actual cloud storage as opposed to through here uh and actually for that one now I'm thinking I'm probably going to need to refer back to my own tutorial video because I don't remember how this one goes let's see well first of all I've got two uh I've got to install this one so the web job is extension let's install that package okay it's good so how was this one it was the blog path first of all and let's see where did I upload the blog so it's over here where's the container mods and mod.json so mod slash mod.json okay then file access I just want to read and then for the connection string that is the one that I named and what name did I use it Azure web's job storage Azure web jobs storage okay then I just want to read so just for reading let's use a string for the mod Json okay so that's the mod Json and over here for that instead of using the debug which is copy this and instead of that one let's just use the mod Json okay does this work on the right I actually need to make sure that this is using the storage Azure web job storage uh all right yeah I think this should be working it's your web job search okay all right so I think this should be connecting that fix your turn on learn from it and I'm working on my game that's awesome I'm glad the tutorial on some people that's that's a goal so that is awesome I'm glad it helped you okay so let's try this out and see if that one returns even though right now it's going to return pretty much exactly the same thing so okay everything is working correctly now over here oh I actually close that thing so let's copy the get okay let's copy this go up here and yep there you go okay now to make sure this is indeed downloading the file over here let's modify it so over there instead of being on 4.4 let's put them to the left side so let's save this okay I want to save now let's refresh and there you go minus 4.4 all right awesome okay so yeah now if I run this on the game itself it should already be working so without touching any of the code in the game all right so let's see now press the Y instead of spawning here it's going to spawn around here press oh right I changed on the Zed yeah it works all right awesome okay so honestly just like this everything's already working quite quite good okay all right I didn't think about how I'm going to hmm trying to think about the file name uh okay yeah I think that does work to download the character hmm okay I'm trying to trying to think during GitHub do you think they might merge a new service I mean Azure has a lot of Integrations with GitHub so if you've got a GitHub project there's all kinds of things whenever you're making new Azure uh resource there's lots of things to connect it automatically to do continuous integration and deployment whatever so lots of things uh okay so the issue that I'm thinking is spreadsheet how am I going to handle that am I going to return the base64 yeah I think that would be quite tricky but yeah okay something like this I think it's already good I think maybe I'll do the spreadsheet a bit a bit later because I gotta I gotta think how do I convert it into base64 in order to save the Sprite sheet hmm because I don't think that I can alright let me think for a little bit just okay got your turnbased course create course thanks alright that's awesome I'm glad I hope you're enjoying the course took a lot of work to make but I'm really happy with how it came out so I really hope you'll learn a lot from it hey I'll just sort of chain is that is it bad weather there because apparently there's a hurricane around that area that is moving towards this area so yeah I hope you're safe I hope it's not too bad let's see uh okay what am I doing right I just want to see can I access this file from this because I write because I did not enable the public access yeah I think 4A for a hmm yeah I think for well I don't know um yeah I mean I think it does work perfectly fine trying to think about it's always the the question when making a kind of tutorial do you focus on the absolute Basics or do you make something a lot more robust that's kind of the thing but yeah so essentially yeah I think I'll Focus mainly on Basics so yeah okay so basically like this I just need to upload also something so let me also upload a character right so let's do a poem yeah because I haven't done a poll in a long time and this one does work so which Sprite sheet and let's see which one do I want to use about Captain America then perhaps Spiderman and who else uh let's see there he is Spiderman or the stickman let's see which one of these one or how about the TF2 medic okay let's make a nice pole and see who wins all right go ahead and vote in chat with exclamation vote and the number so vote one two three or four just select the the Sprite sheet to use for this modding thing so for me which one am I gonna vote for I like the tf2matic so let's go with that one so let's see what's up okay so this is work okay great because I hadn't I hadn't used the poll in quite some time so yeah all right so let's see yeah just write vote and then the number so don't include the n just vote in the number so okay let's see so I'm essentially going to post that then I'm going to save the file name URL on the on the thing then I have to download that file name URL and I'm going to do that with web requests yeah so on web requests I've got a function to get a texture that's exactly what I want so I'm going to post a URL then I've got a string error error and then I've got a cropped beyond Behind the votes string no it's not a string it's a yeah a picture 2D yeah crap texture today for texture 2D so this is what I'm going to receive so I get texture to D and then I apply it design so debug the hog just say texture 2D and if not the book.log say an error and error okay all right so apparently the TFT medic wins okay great so let's do that so let me go into my uh where's my browser over here let me upload the TF2 Medics so just go into upload upload a blob and now I need to find can I just drag it yeah I think that's the issue that I cannot write where's the TF2 medic can I drag the file nope I can't ah it's always annoying gotta browse through there okay so let's find it over here Sprites on my characters and find the TF2 medic over here all right great so what's the point okay great all right so I've uploaded the tf2matics branching there's this one yeah it does show that's really awesome uh all right so let's copy this URL and TFT medic is over there okay that's pretty great all right thank you all for voting that was that was fun it's been a while since I did that okay how to validate the email on your website you just go into your spam folder and click whatever link is in there if it isn't there wait a bit that's that's pretty much it there's nothing else to it okay right so I've got a URL and if we're going that does work so okay so let me just think right because I need the whole URL yeah let's hard code it for now and then download a proper thing okay so let's us and see if it does down with the texture and then I have to see how am I going to upload the texture right and I've got the PF and PC so I'm going to spawn that one uh so right I'm going to need to get that one so yeah this is going to be a bit janky I need to need to modify a bunch of things here so spawn Cloud mods so that's a transform for the spawn quad mod transform or just just the clone mod transform okay and then on this one yeah this is the part that is quite a bit changing I should make a proper script but just for testing just make sure that it was work I think it's called body then get component of the mesh renderer on the mesh render I've got a material so material material and then on that material that main texture set to equal this texture 2D and does that work or is it going to have an issue it apparently it does work it's always the question between texture 2D and texture so on yeah the characters Yep they're all right here it's really nice and by the way if you want to customize your character just follow this link and then if you do that let me know because there's a manual validation process but I am you can draw on top and make your character as early as you want it okay Advanced Resource Management 2D course film Defender but need more advanced I don't know that's I mean there is a billion course types that I would love to make I mean making courses only is really interesting making a a I don't know a 20 hour tutorial that's pretty much what a course is that is always really awesome but it takes a massive amount of work so yeah that's always the tradeoff I wish I had infinite amount of time but I don't so yeah all right awesome it did work okay so there's my little character that was downloaded from the cloud all right that is really cool okay okay and actually yeah in order to not make it spawn and then despawn so I can do this okay so now on the cloud mods inside I've got the URL so I'm going to spawn this URL so let's go into the yeah I'm still using this one okay sounds good so if I go yeah because if I just if I use the property URL so Cloud mod and instead of that one which is hardcoded let's just save this one here instead of that one if I go into the cloud mod and I have the spreadsheet URL if I didn't like this down it's going to be empty so this one should give an error so let's write out just to see a nice fun error so let's try that out oh and actually there was another thing that I want to test so a little bit all right so press the Y and yep got an error not found okay awesome that's exactly isn't it I did want to receive an error okay now let's go there and let's paste this into the URL so if I go where's my browser my browser over here if I go into my mod file over here I go inside my mod.json and for the URL I include this one all right save it and just like this without touching any of the code if I now update now it should indeed spawn with that one so press the white button and yep there you go all right awesome that worked how much you weren't with your game well on my last game I actually made a video about it so for battle round Tycoon and if there you go you can see how much money the game made so if you're curious as to how much my last game made there you go you can watch that video that was quite a long ago but yeah when was this 2019 yeah that's when I watched my last steam game so it's definitely been a while I definitely want to make another Sim game once again just need to find time of your accent where are you from I'm from Portugal thank you honestly I hate the sound the sound of my own voice so I'm glad you enjoy it that's uh that's nice at least someone enjoys it how do you type so fast while I've been programming for 20 25 years I mean it started when I was 10 and I'm 34 so yeah I've been programming for 24 years so yeah when you spend all that time running on a keyboard you do become quite a bit faster okay right everyone hates our sound yeah it's always it's always a thing okay uh right so what am I doing so here honestly everything is already working quite well the only thing is just publish it to the web but yeah everything it's already downloading from the web and let's just okay let's just do a super quick interaction Ally got a full video on an interaction system tutorial working in uh in a few weeks but over here let's try doing that so let's okay let's do a super quick interaction system because I actually got a bunch more games that I would like to try out during this live stream so I definitely got to get this demo done quickly and yeah the other project that I also wanted to try out so yeah okay but before that one finishes loading let's try doing this one okay so what do I want Let's uh create new C sharp script I cloud interactable okay let's open this now over here let's make it super quickly let's see how fast I can make this so an interface and I want a void interact that's all I want yeah that is honestly all I want drone so that is super simple okay so now on the NPC so let's make e Square for that let's make an easy sharp script won't be Cloud NPC okay let's open it this is a iCloud interactable all right and on this one I do want to implement the interface okay and on interact for now let's just do a debug.log and say interact okay great so now on the player class you know let's actually make one so I don't modify the bass player class so let's create new C sharp Square called The Cloud Player okay so let's make this one interact with that and actually this game despite using to the Sprites actually TV game or actually yeah I was already using the cloud Workshop but yeah whatever anyways uh update okay so on update um input hit key down let's go with kinko.e and on E let's go into physics Let's do an overlap sphere otherwise here on this transform dot position with a radius of yeah the units are pretty small so let's say about five units that should be big enough okay so this returns a Collide array so for either array and then let's see we four inch so for each collider collider in the collateral array and for each of these collider dot try get component try get component of type iCloud interactable so cloud interactable so I tried doing this and if this one does have that component so the current interactive one dot interact all right that's it super simple okay all right so now just need to attach the scripts so there's my player character and on the player let's Hitachi Cloud Player and on the NPC Apache cloud and PC you see the right did I not make it derive uh where's the script right yeah I need to make it mono behavior and icon Dragon alright I'm gonna use the Mickey utility package you mean my code monkey tones I mean I've been working on that since pretty much my first steam game so I guess I would be since 2013 so maybe around eight years since I've been building those interesting utility functions which actually I haven't used quite a lot in quite some time but yeah there was quite a lot of interesting stuff oh crap I cannot see the oh there you go I couldn't see it behind my own character all right I'm as quick as you come up with quick solution I mean that is only just just based on experience so once you have 10 years of Game Dev experience like I do then Things become much simpler so yeah the only thing that I can say is just keep on it okay so if I pre yeah actually if I press the E key then nothing happens because there's no NPCs but if I press the Y in order to download an NPC from the cloud and then we're down oh it's the texture now pressing e and yep I do got the interact all right awesome so can I spawn the chop bubble hmm okay now I'm oh just saying custom Avatar uh yep let me just refresh the page just wait for that to refresh um what did I want to do oh right it was on the chat bubble which I think I've got on this script yeah I don't think this part is gonna work is it uh probably not but let's just say well I don't know let's give it a try because actually yeah I should have where did I use this all right it's on the other interaction script okay so there's two new custom characters so let me validate them okay now let me tell the thing to update and let's see if they update actually oh there you go there's a custom character all right so there you go it does work you can draw on top of anywhere you want and yep it does show up and there was someone else with a nice character but apparently not here or is that over there in the corner maybe anyway it's really nice I'm really happy that this system works it's something pretty simple yep there you go it's in there really nice uh um okay so what was I sorry I'm a bit lost in all of my tabs it's all kind of like done second favorite after breaking so I thank you that's quite an honor I mean practice is still great you definitely left quite a legacy so yeah all right so on this one I don't think this is gonna work but yeah I really don't think this is gonna work but we shall see uh yeah let's see if that one does work correct sorry 6 p.m I gotta hurry up because I still want to make the other game um right so is that one going to actually it might work let's see listening to music or podcast well I don't like to listen to music which is the music that you're hearing right now I'm not hearing it because I have to have the Sound Mirror otherwise it would go on the thing but yeah the uh LoFi beats that's pretty basic and super awesome if I press on the E and I've got a known reference exception which one what is it oh it's the text writer okay okay so it's good so with the kind of work yeah I really gotta make the other one and someone was asking how do you make a custom avatar you can follow this nice tutorial to download draw on top of it and so on okay uh yep the music is in the description it's the live stream for the LoFi super awesome super chill so not very intrusive and definitely helps at least it helps me stay focused okay so I just need to add a text writer which is actually a pretty bad name because there's already something called textwriter but anyways uh how old are you on 34. and by the way I don't think I mentioned it during this live stream but if you want to know how the characters work then I cover that in the mesh video see if you want go ahead and watch that and also this it's a transparent into window for the characters down here so if you want to know how that works watch that one and what was the other thing I wanted to check all right the chat bubble which I'm going to be using here is another one so if you want tons of things that I'm using that I've actually covered in previous tutorial videos which is actually a pretty awesome thing I mean you can go you can watch on live stream see what I'm doing then watch the videos and see it in detail all right awesome it worked now obviously it did not work is only as intended because this one is super big okay so how am I going to do this does this return the not this one the create okay so I'm going to have to modify this one to return the transform so we're going to be transform for the chat button transform let's just return this because over here I'm going to need to grab the chat bubble transform I grabbed that one then I need to change the unlock on scale to something Vector 3.1 times something and for the position also need to modify it so over here let's see it so for the chat Bowl I'm going to need to push it up let's say 0.2 is that too small no that's pretty good then a bit to the side just like that okay great so one 1.5 then on the 0.2 so this one new Vector three on one zero is it zero no it's a 1.5 1.5 and then zero okay great so just like this it should be working it should be or it should be spawning it oh the only thing is the yeah it's not looking at the screen that's okay I won't bother too much with that I think it is already working pretty well okay uh right the last thing that I need is just to pass in the actual text that the Cloud should do so it's on the on the cloud Workshop okay I downloaded I spawn the cloud mode I spawn it over here okay spawn the NPC all right then on the NPC and let's get the component of type Cloud NPC and then let's go on a function called set text and I'm going to send the originally set Cloud mod I think that would make sense then I go into this one so probably void set Cloud mode I will receive a cloud mod and then on this one I can do a private Cloud mod to store it and then after storing it when I go into spawn the bubble I say the spawn text text message so this dot Cloud mod equals Cloud mod all right that's pretty awesome so my avatar doesn't disappear into the background not sure um yeah basically whenever people talk they show up up here then don't less often people talk they go into the background then they get deleted so pretty much only shows the recent the recent people to talk okay uh uh I don't even remember what oh right grabbing so right now I should be downloading the NPC info from the cloud and I should be downloading the Sprite sheet as well as etext so if I press on the Viking it contacts the cloud and it downloads the character spreadsheet and now if I approach and I do a simple interaction and there you go it does say the message from the cloud so now if I let's just actually this isn't the exactly using the cloud because I'm still using the localhost so let's make this properly using the cloud so let's close this over here everything's already working perfectly so I just have to go and publish it to the cloud so let's publish it okay so while that is working over here on the cloud Workshop yeah really the only difference is change the url so instead of going through a local host I go through the cloud URL all right recording will be saved Yep this live stream will indeed be saved so you can watch it in the future okay so that is working now let me just upload some more things to the cloud just to test to make sure that all of this is being downloaded correctly so I'm going to need to upload another blob so so let's go and see okay so let's see which one do I want to download let's say well how about the other two so let's say Captain America well Captain America and we're SpiderMan Spiderman let's upload both of them okay okay they're both in the cloud so now I just need the URL for this which is really just a name so if I go into the where am I going where am I going into the mod.json okay so this is the mod file that contains all the data so you get the message so instead of hi there let's say hello there instead of using the TF2 Sprite sheet let's use the Captain America spreadsheet all right so now let's see without touching any of the code at all let's see if now it downloads let's see if it downloads from the cloud downloads Captain America and says a different message so let's click on play and let's try it out and see once you save your own last live I didn't all of the live streams are unlisted but they're all over here on the live stream playlist so if you want to see all of them including all the first ones that I did you can win this really awesome one with a live chat game which is actually something that I want to test so just a few seconds but yeah you can watch hey how are you doing hey I'm doing nice thank you there you go another custom character that is really awesome uh what was I doing right so I press a button and downloads an NPC from the cloud yep there you go now it's Captain America and our approach I interact with it and now it's a different message all right awesome okay so everything does work so now I could pretty much build upon this make some kind of index for all the mods add some Lewis scripting from things but you have over here I can download I can download a character from the cloud that's pretty much it alright so that's that is really awesome okay so I think that's enough for this demo I want to do the other demo character customization link that's this one just tell me when you do because I have to manually validate it uh right so okay so for this demo basically just in case you just joined I'm pretty much trying to prepare the demos for a future video talking about interesting Cloud mechanics so yeah okay so this first demo trying to do something like Steam Workshop this one is already working very well okay so now the next one that I want would be some kind of asynchronous multiplier hey thank you so much for the Super Chat Prashant result I'm sorry I really cannot I'm no good at uh speaking Indian name so sorry if I butcher that but yeah thank you so much for the Super Chat thank you right so what do I want uh yeah the other one okay so oh right before that let me just you the other one that is really awesome although I actually forgot to do one thing so let me just quickly do something uh it's on this one all right just a second I'm just doing something on the other monitor trying to get my thing okay let's just see uh where's the code there it is so just go in here copy this okay all right so let's see if just a quick test on the other one does it have that okay I really hope this doesn't burn save better for cloud saving Azure or steam I mean it depends if you want to I mean steam Cloud save is super awesome but obviously it only works on Steam so that's kind of the that's kind of the downside I guess depending on what you want to do with it so yeah what do you use Azure for this specifically simply because Unity recently announced a partnership with Azure so yeah that's the only reason basically when when that happened that's when I started researching Azure and yeah I just use it but from what I can see all the cloud providers they all have pretty much the same thing so yeah you can use whatever you want okay let me just lower the size of the character so that I can actually see the UI for this little game uh and let's see if this actually does work oh boy it's a bit broken but I think it is worth okay it is working okay it is working oh there you go got double super chats I forgot this one also at Super Chat all right thank you okay so we've got a bit of duplication here so this was a mini game that I made like well I didn't actually finish it's only simple but yeah this is a really awesome idea that I really want to make uh some more uh anyways okay so let's make a gather flag in there and a gather flag in there so now basically this is kind of a very interesting live chat game where you just type some commands and your character won't go somewhere so for example I'm going to type in gather one because I want to go up here and gather whatever this is I don't remember I think it's diamonds so I'm going to type in gather one and my character is going to spawn eventually there you go there's my character and it's going to go in together one and yep there you go he's starting to gather some diamonds all right there you go this is the interesting thing so now some of you can go into gather two and so on all right so yeah this was a really fun mini game Prototype that I made like three years ago I think this was in 2019 but yeah really interesting uh then let's make some barracks and over here on let's make some storage there you go oh look at that uh this is a really awesome idea I really need to get back to this especially now that I'm doing that I want to do on live streams a bit more regularly yeah okay so now go ahead and try building this so let's see I'm going to build one oh man that's something all right so there you go starting to build that one and I think at some point there are some zombies spawned but I don't remember yeah I don't remember could have teams in the battle system yep there's lots of interesting things that I can add to this and there you go these storage is already built and that one I think that one is Barracks yeah this is basically a very Bare Bones prototype I just wanted to check and see if this does work and Yep this work so there you go there you go two buildings there are no errors all right so yeah this project is indeed working so let's go back into gather one I like to get so basically the idea is that I would be this would be kind of like a god game where I play God and you play all the various people so I I don't have any control over all the things then eventually some zombies will respond and the zombies will attack and I would pretty much use a flag to position say actually there's the defense flag right here so I place the fine fire flag right here then you have to type in the fan and people have to go there then I have to ask people to go gather and so on so yeah it's a really neat idea that yeah then that I made quite a long time ago and yeah I think now that I'm doing uh that I'm hopefully going to do live streams a bit more regularly I think this would be a really awesome idea to get back to because because I do think this idea has quite a lot of potential could be very interesting so yeah right now this is the only thing about the about the game just play some buildings and a bunch of points to do a bunch of things but yeah all right so yeah that's pretty much I just want to test out this project that I had here and yeah apparently everything still works this could be huge with twitch streamers yeah maybe that that could definitely could definitely work so if you don't give the bumper one that's awesome all right so yeah I just wanted to test this out and yep it does work so who knows in a future live stream I might take this project and push it a bit further because I do think it's an interesting idea as always the problem is always finding time but I definitely need to find the time to do this because I do think this idea has potential all right anyways foreign So yeah thank you for letting me test this this was fun okay so right now let me go back and make the second game mechanic idea all right so yeah so this one worked out okay so that's awesome I need to get back to this project at some point that is definitely going to be very interesting if I was from spinning too much yeah the spinning animation was just the the most basic animation that I could use to signify that it's doing something so yeah it looks a bit silly the spinning instead of actually trying to gather things but yeah that was fun goodbye all right goodbye when will you be streaming once already 6 20 over here so yeah maybe until about seven so we'll 40 minutes more okay so this one is working so I can download I can drag okay awesome the weird spinning around yep definitely weird but a bit Charming I guess it's too strange okay so the workshop this one did work it worked perfectly all right so that was great now the other one that I want to do was this one a super simple tictactoe game and pretty much just make it based on making asynchronous you know that's pretty much it please save stream Yep this stream will indeed be saved yep it remains to I'm working on my stupid game well don't call me your game stupid I mean if you're working on it then must be something that interests you so yeah just go ahead and yeah good luck with that development all right your work has its own identity good work all right thank you it's very kind thank you okay so up here let's make a simple tictactoe quicksil Mega scans works with UNT I don't know I don't think so or I actually won't if you use in Rio then you can use quixon Mega scans for free but if you use it for free then you must use it within real so you cannot use the free version with unity but as far as I know Mega scans does have a paid version and for that one yep you can use that with unity as long as you paid for things for sharing live streams I appreciate it well thank you CPU thank you and thank you to all of you I'm glad that you seem to enjoy it as long as people enjoy it then I can find the time I definitely want to make these quite a bit more regularly okay right so I want to make a simple tictactoe game and yep okay so let's do this this one should hopefully be simple but very interesting so what am I going to call it uh tic tac toe game state although that's a bit wording you know let's go just cloud game State yeah just like this okay so here let's go for the quality of mistake I just want to take base plus so this is the data that I want to save and for this one uh I only got two players so let's go with a public bullion so uh next turn is player a let's say that then I also got to keep the state of the map so how am I going to do this let's say yeah I think a flat array is probably for the best or actually do I go with an array or do I go with with nine Fields hmm good question yeah I think I think an array should do good uh but that's not a bullion rather oh actually this is a good experiment to see if enums do work so a public enum and let's go for yeah just come with player and I got player a and player B so up here I'm going to do an array of players so player no uh player board the ring maybe that's a bit of a strange name but okay um and then just a polykin for the last move time okay all right so that's pretty much the data that I want so okay so let's go where's my thing all right okay so that's for the cloud game state that you see data for the aim State okay so let's make another script called Cloud tic tac toe and let's make a game object to run it and just reset it all right 25 yep 0.5 you can that is another one that I would also like to research that is interesting that one does seem to do all the things that empty gaming Services seems to do with a bit more but yeah that one is the most comparable a while ago people were asking about TNT gaming services and how it Compares with Azure and Azure is much more of a low level thing so it's much more capable but obviously you got to build yourself but yeah playfab that would be the other thing that would be comparable to ENT gaming services so yeah that's another tool set I guess that I would like to research that would be interesting okay uh so up here let's just do a private void update and on update lets you input that get key down and let's go with the tiki okay so when this happens let's create a new what should I call it Cloud tictactoe okay and on this one wait record no I didn't okay thanks again for the super Channel CPU all right uh okay let me just clear this up okay all these belong to the other demo so don't touch them okay the cloud game State all right that's what I did so the cloud game States so let's create this one 40 and less move time on zero the next is player a yes and the player board array lets you a new array of Cloud Player and yeah this is the thing that setting this up manually is going to be quite a mess or not the uh hello team State player keep player array so this is the player board array only do multiplayer tutorials so I won't do them when in the net code for game objects comes out of preview when that happens yep I won't be doing that so hopefully that should happen within the next few I don't know months weeks who knows I mean there's the unite conference in 22 so they might announce a bit of interesting things there so that should be interesting okay uh so let's just create a brand oh crap I forgot yeah right well there's player a b or none of course so actually let's start with none none on all of them so okay this is going to be quite a bit tricky I got three rows I mean it's only tricky for the computer because for the human is never going to deal with this but anyways okay would be easier than Photon pun I don't know I mean uh uh photon is already very good uh mirror is already very good so yeah who knows maybe netcode for game objects will be better than those maybe not who knows it's always good to have more competition so either way I'm definitely looking forward to that hey thank you so much for the coffee thank you it's very kind of you thank you all right so the cloud game state and then I'm going to need one for avoid update game State and I'm going to receive a cloud game State football game state okay so I'm trying to think but all right so the question is do I do this first on just single player and then do it async multiplayer or not but for now let's just we log on the Json utility.2 Json so let's convert this one to Json so the cloud game State converted so that's the string so that the Json string and just do a debug download on the Json string ah crap Json string oh boy I'm missing a lot uh so yep let's go with that one Okay so all right so let's see what this one prints I'm pretty sure that the Json utility does work with arrays so hopefully that should be working correct so if I press T key and if there go this works all of them with the two okay awesome great so this is working all right so now let's handle the uh player input to try to see where I can click so on update oh it's actually interesting for the cloud game state okay focus one thing at a time all right um so if input.get Mouse button down so when I click with the unlock Mouse button when I do that I need to get my mouse warmth position and then I need to convert this position into a grid position to know where I am but it's not a great position It's actually an index position okay so Vector three some mouse were on position and on this one I think I just need to figure out what is the size of the Wind so let's see over here I've got a Quant and the quad is on 10 uh oh boy my brain isn't working right now I want to Round right because if I round that is correct right yes I think that is correct so if I go I do a vector 2 ins of the grid position and I do a mouse world I do a new on the mouse one position Dot I take the X I divide it by 10f that is going to give me something like that okay I take the Z divided by 10f then let's just see what this returns so the grid position all right so thanks again for sharing hey Super Chat cute this is this broken oh right because I did not convert so math after round two and gotta convert these into ins otherwise it does not work so meth F dial round two innings all right okay so let's see if this one does work right recognition I just want to say thanks for your tutorials started out three years ago with no C sharp in technology now my first game has 15 000 wish lists wow that is really awesome wow congrats wow 15 000 that is very difficult as well so that is really awesome I don't know if you can post links in chat but just did you post the name of World internals is that the name no I'm curious fifteen thousand wishlist that is quite a lot with my browser sorry that Accra store ah crap it's on these two Auto uh steampower.com oh it's this one I think I saw it previously all right looks really great yeah nice assets nice nice grid all very nice and hex different things all right that looks pretty great and with 15 000 wishlists that is pretty awesome so let's go into steam DB oh God I don't know is it.net not just steam DB Google won't tell me oh it's not info all right so world ah from Turtles case you don't know steam DB has tons and tons of info including a chart of the of the followers so if you want to know if an upcoming game is looking good looking like it's successful or not if you do you can go here and yep you can pretty much yeah it's funny how your game is pretty much right on the money which is usually the rule is wish lists are 10 times the number of followers so yeah 15K wishlist with 1500 followers yep that that matches so yeah congrats I mean 15K wish lists that is quite difficult but yeah so yeah best of luck with Development coming soon all right best of luck yeah with 15K wishlist you definitely hopefully won't have a successful launch so let's hope for the best okay what was I doing uh just trying to convert down all right so let's see let's see if this one does work so if I click here I've got a minus one minus one that is correct okay that is 1 over here okay zero minus one all right all right so it's already working that one is zero zero and that one is all right awesome uh so to offset this I just need to yeah just pause one because the grade has minus one all right awesome so if I go in here I think the word position in a great position uh all right I just go up here just add it by one and just add it by one all right so then if I go into the uh what am I thinking about hmm yeah I've got the update game State I need to do down in a bit uh okay so the grid position so then I've got an end for the grid position index and this one is going to be the grid position.y multiplied by three because I got three per row plus the grid position.x so on X of 0 0 is going to be on zero zero and it's going to be on three times three is that correct no yeah two times three yeah I think that is correct okay so the reposition index so if I do a debug down log just make sure that this isn't important Let's test where are you from I'm from Portugal thanks for asking and thanks again for the Super Chat best of luck with the game all right so let's see this not crap I'm running out of water that's not good okay so this one is position zero position one two three four five six seven and eight all right Awesome everything works okay great so next thing is to actually visualize the state of the board so that's the update game scene here yep so for that let's receive a serialized field private so prefab cross and another prefab for the circle oh this is a transform so I've got the cross and I've got the circle let's make those prespams speak Portuguese I'm from Brazil and I really want to thank you for all helping your codes yep well I'm I'm from Portugal so yeah well I'm from Portland I was born here I live here I'm right here so yeah I do speak Portuguese yeah thanks I'm glad your videos have helped you all right um what was I doing sometimes my brain just freezes okay so I want to make the prefab so I've got a Quant here so this is going to be the prefab for the cross then I need another one for the circle and I've got the cross material let's make these Circle material and do I have a circle Sprite here I don't like that one but yeah if I search for Circle uh those are way too hmm yeah I don't want to go with the phone okay I guess I'm going with the upline even though not a fan but okay sure that works so that's the circle let's use this one okay that's the circle it's a bit too big yeah make it a tiny bit smaller just so it makes sense okay let's make these into prefab so these Circle and the cross make both of them into prefabs yeah that is correct okay right yeah I mean there's a ton of people in Brazil so yeah although what time is it now in Brazil it's on the other side so it's about what 10 am there right now yeah anything I mean I've been working with unity since 2012 so later this year is going to make 10 years yeah and recording live Yep this one is indeed recording so yeah it's 233 really Oh I thought it was a bit more of a time difference okay uh okay what was I doing just write the references so the PF Circle the EPF cross and now when I click I'm going to want to spawn them where's my code where's my code there it is so on the update game state I'm going to receive the collodium state then I'm going to go into the color game State go into the player for the right all right and I'm going to cycle through this one so let's check on through an index I equals zero less than the player board array domain all right plus plus okay so now okay let's see we switch on this guy so if this guy returns a what's a Case Case player.player a then going to do something case player B you're going to do something else and K is none not gonna do anything okay so he's player a and let's call instantiate and going to instantiate for the player a and let's say crosses so the PF cross and for the position okay so now I got to convert an index back into a warm position so let's see Vector 3 for the grid World position and make a new vector 3. okay let me let me think about this yeah divide by three that is the Y right yeah so I take the index I divide by three so one on index 1 is going to have zero so I'm going to need to forward this so math f.4 I need to afford this one and then the other one is the remainder is that correct I think that is correct okay let's see if my math is working correctly so on that zero and down and eight load for the grid size equals 10f appears that one times for its size times the equal size okay let's see if this logic is working for turning that identity okay let's just see if this logic is running so update the game State and create a new cloud game state so by default let's see the section by default it should be all empty so let's first try it around aren't you troubled with object pulling or you don't always use a troubled why are you troubled by object pulling I mean it's an excellent engine just when you need it definitely use it yeah but if you don't need it then no need to use it that's pretty much it um playing any good games lately uh not really although I just recently received my steam deck so I'm kind of looking for what interesting game could I receive on could I play on that one because it was it took one years to arrive that was quite an insane thing but yeah finally arrived so that is going to be interesting how do you have good English if you are from Portugal well I've been learning English my the home programming world is on English so I've because of that I've been pretty much speaking and learning English since I was 10 years old so yeah that's pretty much why I mean my brain works more in English than it does in Portuguese so yeah that's kind of a funny thing okay so that test did work now if I put layer a let's see if I see a cross over here on the first one let's see let's see drum roll and nope okay did I did I put it on the Y where is that one it's on zero zero zero okay so I have to do uh and for the quaternion I also have to flip it forward so I gotta rotate 90 on the X so how am I going to uh it would be simpler to rotate the sound but let them be tricky ah crap I hate working with quaternions is it Euler well this work I never know if it does work ways all right another job besides YouTube I mean I have my games I have my courses so yeah YouTube is just one part of what I do but yeah nowadays YouTube is the primary thing so okay so where am I going wrong on here so let's see we debug.log on the eye and then let's do on this one because I put it on the first one right yeah so it should be on the corner there wait oh no I think it is correct yeah it is correct of course it is correct because I forgot about the offset say Vector 3 for the offset because the whole Grid it's offset by 10 so that one is indeed correct so the grid one position is this was the offset all right so like this it won't work okay let's use your Chico routines or async functions well personally I'm not a fan of core routines I don't like the pattern that they enforce so I'm not a fan of them but at the same time async is also pretty tricky so I don't tend to use either of them I've done some standard multithread code but async now really don't normally use it is there an API or assets that won't APR assets that won't be used to export model from game like Kenny I'm not sure what you mean grab assets from a game I think there are a bunch of programs that can do that although I'm not internally sure because I've never used them but I do know that a bunch of people mod um they do some mods and they grab the official models from the game so it is possible but yeah not an area that I've ever covered you know decompiling games and doing whatever I know it's possible but yeah never never got into that area okay so this is indeed working so I now know how to take a warm position converting to a great position index that is awesome and I know how to update a game stained so I can just take the cloud game state so let's just take this one so probably for the quality game today so I make this and I create it here okay and actually let's start with none okay so I do this then I go into that one and I'm going to go into the player board array on this grid position index and I'm going to set it to in this case I'm playing as player a and I think this should work okay so let's see prep I'm tapping through way too many windows you know how you made this Avatar thing well if you want to learn I made a bunch of tutorials on that topic so the characters they're all mesh based so you can look into this video it won't teach you how to do mesh animations which is how the characters are done and if you want to make a transparent TNT window I also cover that in a really interesting video so you combine both of those along with the YouTube API and yep you end up with these nice funny characters okay so let's see if I click here no nothing happens oh of course nothing happened I didn't update it well it's kind of obvious that if I don't run the code the code won't run it's kind of obvious okay so let's update collodium State quality game save just update like that all right okay right what time is it 6 40. oh it's already quite late I wanna be able to finish this demo so if I click here there you go Gotta cross click click click and there you go all right I win and that's really awesome okay great so that does indeed work and well let's just verify that the other one works as well so let's do instead of this let's do eight one and do player B and yeah just gotta modify this instead of PF cross so that's a PF Circle let's see that one 7.51 concrete video of yours because there are a lot of well that is why I made the the search bar over here on the website so you can search for anything like shaders and there you go tons of videos that I made on shaders you can search for csharp and it finds tons of videos related to csharp you can search for crafting and something like that so yeah I've got tons of videos but that is why I made this search window so if you search over here for whatever topic you're looking for hopefully some of the videos that I make won't show up Precision generation yep that is a topic that I very much would like to cover but as usual it's always tricky to find the time but yep definitely very much I especially would like to cover what is it called wave function collapse oh ml agents yeah that is another one I'd like to get back to but yeah wave function collapse that is a really awesome thing that I would very much like to do a video on so that should be interesting okay great parameters X or o to render well I just want to make this a very simple demo so don't want to over complicate it that's pretty much it is do you think could make a premium mobile game or turn one of your premium games to mobile uh not really I mean mobile is meant to be all based on based on based on touch so converting one game directly isn't really a simple thing especially my game since my games are all very Mouse focused so converting them into mobile using touch that would be extremely difficult so it is possible just depends on what kind game you're making but yeah it's uh if you didn't make it thinking about mobile from the beginning then yeah it's going to become quite a bit tricky but yeah and have I made any nope not really I mean I just I pref I like playing Steam games so I just make the kind of games I don't like to make I make the games that I like to play that's pretty much it uh right but I have problems with the building system do you have tutorials on this I don't know what you mean by building but I did the the well I made the house building system so if you want something on a grid like that then also made one more freeform and the other thing which might be super useful specifically related to rimworld is the test system now I made these videos super long time ago but they are really I mean they are essentially how I handle the test system in battle round Tycoon where I've got tons of units each of them doing different stats different tasks different things so yeah that would definitely this kind of logic would be super useful in a game kind of like Rim world yeah okay let me just focus a little bit uh as your playfab yep I would like to research that alongside Unity gaming services and see which one but yeah okay let me Focus just just one second um what was I doing everything is working right yeah everything's already working okay so I got the update game state and I know which one is the okay right great so let's make a serialized field for the cloud game state DOT player and uh this player that's a bit of a strange name but okay so this player and this one is going to be player a okay so when I click I can only play if it is my my time to play so I go into the cloud game State cloud game State and I check next turn is player a and player a so if this player actually why did I call it next turn is player actually that makes no sense if I have this so let's call it current turn player that's a player okay that makes a lot more sense uh so none of this so current turn play actually this testing code I don't need this at all but you know let's keep it like this so this one for the current turn player let's say player a so start off with player a then I make an action I trigger my action then I put the third internal player equals player B whatever's the opposite uh train thing but if you had one method for both layers yep I'm just this is only testing code this is not this is not production code I'm just testing to make sure all the logic works and actually let me put this on the thing here uh okay let me think so I click then let's check the cloud game state so if current turns player matches my current player so if it matches this player then I'm going to do my thing and I'm going to swap it out uh yeah let me make a quick function here so probably player to get other player return a player player so if player equals player a then return player.b and if not then return player dot Inc I don't care about the player.net that's not an issue okay right so get the other player wait did I make it okay make it static all right so over here I'm going to go into the static get the other player other from this one okay so now I can get rid this so I got just this scored eight three percent play my own game okay that sounds good I guess hopeful uh all right so I Center off this one is player a it's going to be the next turn is on this player then if it is this one then I'm going to be able to make my move then I'm going to update the game State okay sounds good all right yeah if you only joined recently then all of this Probably sounds confusing because I haven't done the connection to the Cloud yet but yeah so if I if I click anywhere I can click there you go now if I click I should not be able to click and there you go okay great all right and now let's try doing advice okay anyways yeah okay so this is indeed working now let's do the cloudbased part I'm gonna allow players to click on occupied space yep that is yeah that obviously has to be done but for now let's worry about that in a little bit um right so I've got the club game State now I just need to upload it to the cloud so let's go up here into my cloud function uh I've got the yet mod so I don't want let's make another function so let's create over here let's create a new ad a new Azure function uh we'll start with the get I think that's the most obvious one so um excited get mods so get tick game state of a strange name okay with HTTP trigger okay so get take game State this one is only going to be a get all right let's do analog say the exact same thing and on this one let's just return it so for this one let's do the same thing so let's use a blob in order to return that storage but it's not going to be in there so tic tac toe and inside let's say game state DOT Json and yep so this one is the Tic Tac toe tictactoe game State Json and well actually right now let's just return that one directly okay so let's make this one so let's go into Azure where's my Azure so let's go outside the containers let's make another container and for this one let's call it tictactoe okay let's create all right let's go inside it now let's make a file to save it so let's go down here let's call it uh tic tac toe game state DOT Json and just need to copy the Json for this one okay so I update the game State and after updating let's do a debug.log go into the Json utility and copy to Json for this one all right so let's make a move and copy the Json oh boy yeah I'm running out of water it's almost seven so almost about time so you don't be available later or delete it it won't be only now I noticed that the characters stopped working well that's a bit messed up or did it apparently not okay apparently not apparently they were broken for a while now they came back okay anyways I don't know I suppose it's easier to make a web socket yep you could you could make websockets but my specific my specific demo that I'm trying to achieve here is making it asynchronous so like one player plays one move then Waits five hours and the other player plays their move and so on obviously that would not make sense on a simple game like that too but thinking of something like Civilization something like that yeah that would make sense to make some kind of asynchronous multiplayer hey Gabrielle how's it going all right so post and let's see I'm out of water that's not good okay right so let's just copy this and let's face all right so this is my Json yep that one is correct okay so I've got to move okay would work perfect for European universals yep that's exactly the kind of games that asynchronous multiplayer would be perfect for so let me upload let me just find the blob to upload so I gotta go to my desktop the tictactoe game.json okay let's upload that one and let's see and edit and yep there it is all right so now if I access that it should automatically so let's do it on start does make sense on start yeah I think it does make sense sir um okay so on start one let's actually copy the well what did I name the other one yeah actually there's no need to copy the code is super simple so just web requests Let's see we get and forget we need a certain endpoint then going to return a string for the error then another string for the response okay so let's put all this all right okay so for the URL let's actually test it locally first so where's my there you go so this one yeah you just were turned down so yeah this one should already be working should be working locally that should work small to work for card selling gaming like cartoon or PVC Heroes yep it would definitely work I mean it's asynchronous multiplayer so any kind of multiplayer that you want to do without being in real time Yep this would be an excellent way to do it so let's see if that one returns did that not what is that is that an error no why is someone not okay that's strange why am I going to the URL and it's not going okay okay I have no idea that's strange why is it going but doesn't go maybe I didn't return anything no okay that's strange okay yeah I guess that's why uh yeah it kind of helps if you use the same file name that's kind of useful I guess let's open yeah that's why that one wasn't opening because obviously I did not use the same name so that kind of helps so let's do that let's go start off okay so now it should work is it running let's make sure that the file is running okay it is running so let's go up here let's go okay is it okay I'm a bit confused why is it not all right something is something is strange here you have two times Json do I oh God thank you oh man that's annoying all right so let's see if now it works yeah I'm definitely starting to become tired starting to make dumb mistakes that is definitely wise let's see if now it does work and yep there you go okay great all right so let's use this URL and now hopefully everything should work so here let's pass that URL let's see debug.log say error error and if not let's say the response and if I got the response then I'm going to use Json utility to convert from Json from Json yeah that is correct this is the cloud game state and I'm going to make a file game State cloud game state okay so I've got this one the response converted into that one then using that one I can just go and update the game state all right so now when I spawn the game it should spawn in the state that it was in last time seeing just watch the updates here read me courses I need to know about addressables thanks well that's awesome yeah that was that was really great to research you know the uh addressables are super super interesting thing and I thought it was going to be quite complex but actually it was pretty simple pretty easy to learn so yeah that was an interesting one all right so yeah the code did work so I spawned it and on start contacted the cloud and there you go with that poster thing all right awesome so now I can pretend to be the other player because actually I'm still playing as the cross player so if I now click okay that shouldn't have worked did I oh right of course that worked that worked because I made a local variable of course that is why so if I use the same one then now it should work so now it should download the cross on the side and when I click it should not allow me to click so let's test I have to switch layers yep so now if I click and nope okay great nothing happens now if I go into my code and I swap from player a now I'm player B and I click and it worked and didn't work okay why did you okay so let's see what part of it went wrong was it caching something no I don't think so yeah because that one it's and why did it plays three crosses I don't know um oh right because I'm not deleting okay so I gotta handle deletion as well all right yeah that one that one should be cross I'm I'm pretty sure I know where the issue is yep there you go this is the issue over here I gotta say that I am this player I'm not the other player all right so now it should indeed work okay so let's let's put this yeah just on play focused just so I can easily modify it so if I am player so start off player clicked on that so I cannot make a move but now if I'm playing as the circles and I click and yep does work and now if I click again and okay great does not work if I swap back into player a and click and you have this work back into B click back into a clean all right awesome that does work how are you spinning that pin well those are pen tricks that I've learned like 20 years ago they used to be really awesome to be on what was the website pen tricks yeah Pinterest the pen spinning Revolution this was really awesome a bunch of people using some really special pens do a bunch of tricks yeah that was uh oh yeah pen spinning that is the technical term it's youtube.com for ah crap why can't I the thumb around what's the name of the trick let's say oh if I can like this one something happened to the stream let's hope not thanks very interesting so okay just gotta wait for the okay come on come on there you go pendrick so if you want to learn yeah it's a pretty fun thing if you use a proper pen things get quite easier yeah there you go the uh what's it called the jump around something like that yeah that was a an interesting one yeah that's the is that the Sonic I think so that was fun yeah I spent a lot of time as a kid playing around with a bunch of pen tricks that was a it was a fun thing so nowadays I still know only about two or three yeah so it's a fun thing to do while thinking it's nice okay anyways uh what was I doing what was I doing this is indeed working yep so the next thing that I want is to well I have to upload the game State and then I have to request the thing okay so let's first hand on the uploading the game state so oh boy it's already seven all right I gotta can do it to another pen I mean this one is a normal pen it just needs to have the weight bouncing up but yeah this one is a normal Trend so it does work okay so set game state let's make an Azure function with an HTTP trigger okay and let's call it set game State this one is going to have just a post and the issues that I don't remember how I did it so let me refer back to my previous project so that I remember how I handled that and let's return just okay it doesn't really matter so for the get him state let me just uh the leaderboard functions I should be able to write okay so let's see how I did in my previous thing so just use the text right this is the ad score yep uh not to get away for this one okay so on this one let's call it uh what am I gonna call this what did I called all I gotta use the same file same thing so let's use this one so tictactoe game stained uh so game State Moab text writer all right so I've got this one and how do I write onto it I first deserialize the object do I need to yeah I don't need to do that now that I think about it I just need the request body yeah I think that's the only thing that I need yeah so this is actually super simple obviously what I'm doing here isn't secure at all so if you want to use this in a proper game you'd have to upgrade Upon This by quite a while but yeah for this simple demo this does work very well okay so yeah I think that sounds way too simple but I genuinely think this is only take so the set team State on a post and yeah and this one is still open okay so if I go into okay I don't need the leaderboard now if I go uh yeah what am I doing okay so up here update the game State I do my move I do whatever sure then over here web requests and let's do a post with Json and for the URL I'm going to need that URL then for the Json data let's go into Json utility to Json convert the cloud game state okay so I convert that one into Json then I've got a string for the error usual stuff thing and I've got a string for the response even though this one isn't really going to return response but yeah sure just uh no return debug's unlocked on my response okay and over here default.log on my error okay so I'm going to post the cloud game set down is going to save it then it's going to update the game set all right sounds good so all that I need is the URL for that one so over here let's run it locally try it out and see if it works and hopefully that won't return okay and hopefully that will take the things Okay so let's get the set game state with a post so let's see if that one does work so going to this URL that's all it takes all right let me just go into the storage okay so this is the current state just has an x on the left side now in order to be able to make a move I need to be playing as player B so once you're down so let's see if this one updates The Blob so that one made a move on there now this one I'll make it move on there and now if I quit the game and I play again let's see and let's see oh boy and yep there you go all right awesome okay seems unanimous what dark mode yeah yeah I know that I'm the outlier by by using light mode but well what can I say that's the way that my that my eyes work they bleed if I use dark mode so sorry nope can't do it okay so awesome so this is the only thing missing here is really just periodically updating the game state so yeah for that one I can actually use a function from my utilities so that's one and let's go up here let's make a function periodic let's create a function periodic going to do something and that something is going to be what and let's say every one second Maybe Okay so right I need to put some buttons as well and something like that anyways okay uh right so on the function periodic I'm going to get the game State and upload it right that's all it takes right I'm trying to think is that way too simple no I think that is correct so I go there I periodically download it and then if it's my move then I can place my move if it's not then I can okay so I generally think that is all that it takes again that sounds way too simple but I do think that this simple demo should work okay great so the final thing that I want is just some input to select the player so that I can make a proper build so on selecting team I'm going to set this player equals player.a and on pressing y I'm going to select player dot b okay so and let's make a can I make a serialized field private just make a simple visual using TM Pro and up here A type text mesh Pro ugly uh player text mesh Pro on right and then when I click let's go dot text equals a and on this one B just to make a quick debug visual uh right so let's just make that one right I still gotta clean up the floor so that's another thing that I still need to do but on D1 let's make a text text mesh Pro let's Anchor It To The Top put it on zero zero maybe a bit down just Dash zero zero put it in bold maybe with 40 and with that another okay actually why am I using A and B that doesn't actually make any sense I'm using amb instead of crosses and things that would make a lot more sense so let's put X and then o that makes a lot more sense okay right so I think this little mini demo of asynchronous multiplayer I think this one should hopefully be working so let's just drag the lucky canvas the text object okay I don't like it over there on the let's put it on that corner it's a bit more to the side like this in the same it's going to say an X so let's put it and higher and a bit or all right that looks good okay all right so let's see which was FPS dots button I mean okay yeah sure I can show it although over here on this basic thing doesn't really make much sense oh boy this is the issue yeah I definitely got a Hitman cleanup otherwise it's going to be constantly spawning more and more objects so let's just quickly handle cleanup so for that let's go here let's store just a simple transform and transform in a list of transform so the spawned what did I call Objects spawn objects list okay and I'll avoid yeah I should be doing this on on awake not on start so let's say this one is a new one put down and put down okay all right so I've got the spawned objects list so when I do instantiates with transform brief uh transformed and let's add this one and then up here I've got to do the prefab transform equals Zone spawn it to the list then when updating the state let's cycle through it transform object transform and the spawned object list and over here let's destroy the spawn object transform.game object and then let's clear the list all right good great so let's see if this one does work and all right so yeah it is no longer spawning an infinite number of objects okay that's great right so yeah like this everything is already working so if I yeah I just didn't test the setting the thing so if I click on T and yep I can swap it okay great all right so let's try making a proper build I just need to add this open scene and get rid of all the other ones all right so let's try making a build on this let's try a new builds let's make a windows down this one all right okay so I think yeah I think this little demo is already working do you get take game State yeah there's a simple 1B it should be working okay right so of water yeah quick test then yeah oh boy all right okay what do you have planned for tomorrow uh are you asking about a live stream now we're only planning on live stream tomorrow that is that would be a bit too much two live streams two days in a row but yeah definitely want to do another one who knows maybe next week something like that yeah is this for the next video no I'm um I still got a lot of work to make before this one becomes a video this one about making cloudbased game mechanics so this one probably in I don't know two to three weeks I certainly got a lot of work to do on this one gotta prepare the rest of demos I gotta make uh I gotta write the video record and edit and so on so yeah maybe about three weeks but before that I'm going to post the uh Azure Basics and a basic Azure tutorial so if you're curious on the basic things of what I've been working on over here on this on this live stream then yeah a tutorial about that one will be coming soon not sure when but soon yeah all right making the first build always takes quite some time so let's see what's the next game you're going to release I'm not sure I definitely want to work on something I've wanted to um I wanted to start working on something on the second half of this year but then my turnbased course that took way much longer way much more work than expected so everything kind of was pushed a bit back but yeah definitely wouldn't like to like to work on my next steam game just need to find the time but hopefully soon what are your PC specs oh God I don't know I've got a a 6950 X the CPU for gpua 3090 I think that's a pretty nice PC pretty nice why is The Game's FPS fixed at 61 because I put it at 60 okay all right did I make it oh crap I did not make this resizable okay so I gotta yeah but the logic should let me just yeah because I don't like that uh for the resolution presentation no I don't want full screen I want it windowed yep uh right so let's make another build I guess okay hopefully the second one is faster so yeah have any tips for reading the code of strangers if it's not documented gets very hard yep it is very hard I mean if the code is not well written if it is not well documented then yeah I don't think there are any tips that it just you're at the mercy of the person who wrote the code if they wrote the code in a nice clean way then hopefully it is the read but if they didn't then yeah your job is definitely going to be very difficult so that is why I always talk about writing good clean code because if you do then Things become so much better both for you and for whoever else might see your code alright so over here now the player should be the player X so if I click over here nope this one's not doing anything and now these are two instances and they are not connected directly with multiplayer but they are connected through asynchronous multiplier through the cloud so when I press over here it should place a Crosshair and after about half a second it should show up across here so let's see click there it is and yep there it is okay I don't know why that one became broken but yep it did work so now if I click nope this one can't do anything and if I click this one and after a while okay I don't know why that one is disappearing but yep it does work I can place across and don't get why someone deleting that is so strange becoming yeah anyways but yeah it does work so I can place over there even though there's no win scenario so if I place there and I win and no technically I won but there's no Winston right but yeah it does work all right awesome so yeah the asynchronous multiplayer does work perfectly so the only other thing that I need yeah is just handling how to start a new game how to do something like that so yeah right now if I want to make a new game I've got to manually go up here can this yeah this one needs to reload because if I go into edit yep all of them got done and I've got to swap all of these out for twos okay if I do this now it should pretty much reset the game obviously if you were to use this kind of logic you would have to make one blog for each uh game scene game controller and so on but yeah but yeah all the logic is working so the demo that I want to make so this one plays as the circle this one as the cross so the circle does not do anything on start so I can do anything not the cross click make my move get no idea why no one is Vanishing but yep after a while this one receives now the circle make a move there and after a while that one receives now make a cross and after a while that one goes and I'll go there and I'll go there and I'll put one there and put one there and there you go gotta win all right awesome oh that was a a fun demo to work on and it does work so yeah this kind of thing as you might imagine you can very easily build upon this to make any kind of asynchronous multiplier so yeah even though this is a simple demo the kind of things that you could build with this kind of logic are pretty much infinite so anything in the scale of civilization any kind of game like that that requires asynchronous multiplayer this is definitely very interesting hey CPU yeah see you next time yeah it's definitely a time for unless you to end yeah I hope you all found this enjoyable yeah so this demo worked so for that video I need to make about four demos so during this live stream I managed to do two demos so that was fun so yeah okay I think that's gonna be it and just in case you didn't notice the the previous demo please save the stream Yep this one is indeed being saved Nissan machine learning nope I haven't used it so not sure if it has changed but yeah uh yeah the previous demo I've got a character the previous demo is all about making a workshop so if I press a button I contact the cloud and I'm downloading a character from the cloud was that the button no that was the button no not that one that one there you go down or no what was the button okay now there you go that's the button so Tom was an NPC from the cloud I can approach it downloads a Sprite sheet from the cloud I can interact and it says a message from the cloud all right so yeah this was a very productive live stream managed to do two demos so hopefully finishing that video should be doable all right okay so I think that's gonna be it can I publish games on scene without creating a company I mean you need to have some sort of legal entity so that's pretty much it so it doesn't have to be a company can be well I guess it depends on the country at least over here unfortunately you can work as an individual but anyways all right so yeah thank you all so much for joining me on this live stream this was interesting I hope you found it interesting and educational maybe you'll learn something and stay tuned for this video obviously the final video is much more much more let's say well presented than in live stream so much less rambling so yeah that should hopefully be interesting so if all of you want to make want to add some Cloud mechanics to your games hopefully that video should be interesting all right okay so that's gonna be it I really need to go and drink some water so let's just stop this and let's put up the background all right so yeah so everything's good okay great all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here I hope to be making some more live streams more regularly so hopefully who knows maybe middle of this week maybe next week that should be something all right so yeah once again thank you all for being here thank you all so much and I'll see you next time thank you foreign foreign foreign
