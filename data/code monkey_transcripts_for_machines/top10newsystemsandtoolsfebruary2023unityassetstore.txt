hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for February 23. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video I'm going to cover the best three new assets and next one only cover top visions and effects as always there's only stats in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order speaking of free is something that I'm guessing all of you are already familiar with I recently launched my 10 hour free course I'm really happy with the resultant reception has been literally 100 positive I don't think I saw a single negative comment and the plan of asking you to like the video to make it go viral on the YouTube algorithm definitely worked right now the video has 200k views which is 10 times more than normal amount so thank you all so much I truly hope the courses helped you on your own Game Dev journey and a special thank you to the people that did buy the completely optional paid course or did a super thanks or became a channel member thanks to you I did manage to break even on the money that I spent on the assets so thank you also for you right now the SSR is giving away an asset apparently it's a new one every week so you just go into the link and use the coupon to get a camelli for free there's also a sale on new and training assets so if there's something you saw recently in one of these asset list videos it might be discount alright so starting off with a nice you want to add notes to your game it's very freeform you can have an empty board where you can place notes anywhere you want you can add some text add some images a bunch of arrows and you can even add a bunch of interactive elements like some check boxes positions colors and so on the main thing is that it's on freeform so you have plenty of space for all of your designs there's a bunch of websites that do this kind of notetaking thing but if you want one directly inside Unity then this tune looks great they also have a free version if you want to try it out first up next here's an interesting one it's a climbing system this is actually a topic that I've done some research to make a tutorial but haven't quite managed to do it yet it can definitely be quite tricky to get it working right handling the climbing positions the climbing logic all of that can be quite tricky so using a premade asset can definitely save you a ton of time and of course this works great on both moving meshes so something like a boss but also on some static meshes just for adding some climbing somewhere in your game the description says that very few games feature mechanics kind of like this one and if that is right so by adding this to your game you're definitely helping it stand out then here's a gorgeous one all about making some very unique books it looks really insanely good like I've mentioned many times if you want to find success nowadays you need to stand out in some way and adding such a unique visual to your game would definitely make it send out you can flip pages in a very satisfying way go forwards or backwards you can place models on the pages and they track along with that page it works on all the render pipelines and it also uses bursts and jobs to make it insanely performant so no very interesting tool if you want to get a very unique visual up next here's a 204 generating music imma say that for me sound design is one of the parts of game development that I know least about I normally just play one song on Loop and that's it previously using something a bit more Dynamic always yields better results so this one is a tool where you can choose a genre and a mood and then it generates a unique song so with this you could add tons of unique music to your game without having to spend thousands on buying individual products or hiring a musician you can make every level or every scene have a unique track the interface looks pretty easy to use and the resulting video does sound really good so if that's representative of the quality of everything this generates and that is definitely good news next here we have a grid Builder tool as you know I have my really detailed series on making a grid system if you want to build your own you can follow those videos or check out my turnbased strategy course for a more guided path but if only you want is just a tool you can simply use then this one doesn't look great it has lots of features supports both 2D and 3D you can place objects from an overhead view or down on the ground it supports vertical grids everything with a customizable size and visual there's a custom inspector to help you create whatever grade you want and set up all the settings so if all you want is just a grid system that is ready to use instead of building your own then this one looks great up next here is a nice UI for handling game options and settings this is one of those things that nobody covers in tutorials because it's not really a sexy part of game development but it is something you must have in your final game my massive free 10 hour course is probably one of the very few YouTube videos that does cover this and even then what I do in that course is a very simple options menu so having an asset like this one which contains a very complete options menu this is definitely a great way to speed up your projects and make them look quite a bit more professional especially useful if you're doing lots of prototypes in game jams for those games people usually don't bother spending time to make some options but if you can just drag and drop this then it can definitely be a very nice bonus then if you have some flexible objects in your game like maybe some hair or some cloth then look at this soon it does exactly what you expect you can set up some bone parts and automatically react to physics apparently this one is a lot more performant than some other tools so if you need this kind of thing on tons of characters then maybe that can be a huge Advantage it has an extremely detailed documentation with lots of samples and guides and also works well on top of any animation or really any motion system or maybe you're more interested in 2D if so here is a nice procedural landscape tool you have tons of parameters you can play around with it's generated which means you can make some infinite levels you can use it to build a background or make the actual unplayable area looking at the shape of the Hill it reminds me of an awesome game that I used to play as a kid it was called the elastic Mania I played that for hours on end it was really awesome and with this you only it would be great to get a quick prototype like that up and running quickly there's also a web demo you can try out next here's a really interesting one you can add some custom gizmos to your game one very important thing is these are not just editor gizmos they are visible and usable in game another important thing is how they can rotate so if your character is on a hill you can see the Gizmo attached correctly so with that this is definitely a very useful debugging tool you can make it show the character velocity add some handles to move some objects visualize some raycasts some linecast and a bunch of things you can easily draw cubes or any other mesh shapes so tons of options and on top of that visually it also looks great with lots of visual options then one thing that all games need is the ability to gather feedback you always have access to forums or emails or something like that but making it easy for the player to give you feedback is very important and it will definitely increase the chance of you getting that super valuable feedback so for that a tune like this can be hugely helpful you can easily add this window onto your game then the player can write whatever text they want and even include several screenshots they can draw on top to easily identify exactly what is going wrong by the way if you want to learn how to draw something on top I have a tutorial on that subject it also reports system data and in the end the entire report is visible directly inside Unity Cloud Diagnostics so you don't even need to handle hosting yourself alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the NTS store for February 23. there's links on the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also check out my own free and paint assets on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
