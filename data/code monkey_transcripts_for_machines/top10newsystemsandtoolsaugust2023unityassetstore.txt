hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the SSR is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for August 23. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I'm already covered the best three new assets and next one I'll cover top visuals and effects as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and the dev days of summer sale is still alive there's still a bunch of excellent assets on sale and over on humble if you need some realistic visuals there's a bundle with a huge discount this is a huge pack with a bunch of animations a bunch of monsters regular animals you've got some wizard spells some fire some horses some lava explosion GUI and so on along with a really nice realistic style and all for a really great discount check them out with the link in the description alright so starting off with a really nice 2D water system there are actually tons of water systems on the store but they are usually in 3D so it's great to see a 2d one and this one does look excellent the water has some really nice Reflections some really nice waves and refraction it can include some blur with Fallout off it works on infinite scrolling it's even got some really interesting Dynamic waves so this looks really great and it works either on a formal side view kind of like a platformer or a more of a topdown view if you have a 2d game then adding some gorgeous one like this one will really help you send out next adding primitive colliders on top of objects is one task that is really tricky so here's the deal to help you do that in case you don't know using primitive colliders is so much more performant than using mesh colliders so you should always use Primitives whenever possible with don't like this one it makes it really easy to use to build all of your colliders on any object there's no need to manually add a new box on leather every time and then painfully position it manually you just hold the button drag a widget and it automatically spawns a brand new one it also snaps to position so it makes it really easy to position it easily duplicates you can even play around with the visual for the bounce and the handles so this looks like a very useful tool if you need to quickly build tons of custom colors then here's a fun interesting one it's called better transform apparently this one replaces the default Transformer with a custom transform inspector that adds a bunch more options you can easily toggle between local space and World space you can modify the actual object size without fiddling with the scale you can modify it in metric or imperial or anything you want you can also visualize the child and parent info and even see some extra stats on the scene view so it's pretty interesting to see the transform component which is very much the core of unity seeing that one be expanded in such an interesting use case next here's an interesting sound tool one of the best ways to make your game sound great is just to have some interactive sound meaning make it sound different depending on what surface the player is walking on if it's on grass play a grassy sound if it's on metal play a metallic sound or another way to really punish your sound is just play some environment sounds this too helps you set all that up in a really interesting way basically it takes a screenshot of your world then you draw on top of it to define the sound areas just draw the shape in any image program it also supports fitting so you fade from white to black and as you move away for example the river volume goes lower and lower definitely a very interesting tool and by being based on images it can become super detailed then if you're working with 2D Sprite animations this one might help it basically takes a giant Sprite sheet of all of your animation frames and then you can slice blocks of animations from each of those frames importantly the animations don't need to be perfectly sequential so you can have something like for example a flashing animation in a corner which you can then reuse in multiple animations the whole thing is stored in what they call a blockchain which you can then reuse with multiple spreadsheets to essentially share animations between characters this looks like pretty useful 2D sprite animation tool with some like this you don't need to generate tons of individual spreadsheet images then if your game has something with legs here is a legs animator really the perfect name this one is an ik tool as the character moves around it automatically places the feet on the correct positions so as you go up or down stairs up or down slopes everything is placed perfectly this is one of those things that seems really small but makes a huge difference in the final game everything looks so much more natural building this kind of thing yourself can definitely be done but it's usually quite tricky so an easy to use to unlike this one can be very helpful and this this one does look like it has a really easy setup you just add a component Define the legs and everything just works although of course you also have tons of options to get it working exactly as you want it works on everything from regular bipedal humanoids to some insects with dozen legs adding Dynamic animations always helps make your game feel much more polished and if you like Dynamic animations then check out the other assets by the same developer they're all really great next here is a really special one all about aerodynamics this one lets you create some fluid zones which you can then interact with all kinds of aerodynamic objects so for example as you apply some wind it correctly applies those forces to a plane or a turbine now me I'm no physicist but this seems to be quite realistic the way the demo with the helicopter and the wind generator Works looks very physically accurate it's got some really interesting visualization tools just looking at those makes it seem like it would be super fun to play with you can simulate all kinds of wind forces and vectors you can visualize the flow around the wing or turbulence behind a spinning ball if the numbers are indeed accurate then this could also be a fun way to learn about physics then something that every game must have is settings but building those yourself is always really annoying personally I really do not enjoy that task especially if you want to build something that is robust with tons of settings so in that case a tune like this one really helps all these settings are already formally premade all of these sliders for volume changing resolution changing phone screen or vsync modifying antialiasing texture resolution Shadows postprocessing this one really does seem to include all the settings that you could possibly want honestly I think I might actually pick this one up for my upcoming steam game it would definitely save me dozens of hours of building all of this by myself next for another system that you could spend the time to build yourself or you can just pick up something very robust here is a really nice versatile inventory system it includes all the possible inventory actions you could ever need you can pick up objects or drop them you can stack them and split multiple Stacks you can even have equipment slots you can handle durability you can consume or use items the inventory has positioning so you can shift them around in the inventory you can activate them through a Hotbar this seal also comes with a custom inspector to make it really easy to create and set up any item you want so this one doesn't look like a really great tool if you don't want to build your own inventory from scratch then if you'd like to add vegetation to your worms check out this one it's a tool to help you spawn trees and grass it also lets you add it not just to the terrain but on top of objects as well it claims to be extremely performant which is very important adding tons of vegetation can very easily tank the frame rate this one includes an example scene with 10 Sunrise vegetation models of them ready to be used alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the NTS store for August 23 there's links on the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also check out my own free pedest on sword alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
