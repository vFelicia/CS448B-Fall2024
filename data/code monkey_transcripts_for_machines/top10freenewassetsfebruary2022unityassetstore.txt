hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for february 202. in this first video i will be covering a list of free assets and in the next ones i will be covering paid assets and tools check out the phone playlist to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them do you want to learn unity blender and programming patterns then check out my curated code monkey bundle with a link in the description this is a collaboration with gamedev tv all their courses have the highest rating possible i got in touch with them to specifically select three courses to make a nice complete bundle to take you from beginner to advanced i chose their ultimate unity 3d course this one will teach you both unity and csharp both starting complete from scratch then the blender 3d modeling course i picked this one up myself a few months ago and i've learned a ton thanks to it and the final one is a more advanced really interesting programming course all about programming patterns it's excellent for helping you massively improve the quality of your code which in turn helps you make better games faster i chose all of these cores myself to really give you a nice path to go from beginner to advanced the bundle has a really nice discount so check it out with a link in the description alright so starting off with a great car controller it uses wheel converters to make it on work you can set up the maximum speed forwards and backwards you can set up acceleration braking steering speed and tons more also it says in the title that this one is also a learning tool not sure how that works there's a tutorial in the asset store page maybe the code is heavily commented card driving is one of the topics that i haven't really covered only made a single tutorial so if you want to learn then maybe look into this free asset and study it then if you need a nice medieval house here's a simple one that looks pretty good features both interior and xseries it seems to be all in one piece but i think you could just load it into blender and cut some pieces to make some real nice modules either way it looks really nice or maybe you need a character here's a cartoony humanoid animal it's a nice stylized character also includes quite a bunch of animations so very easy to just drag and drop onto your project and start using it if you need some hit particle effects check out this one quite a bunch of variety and lots of colors you have hits explosions and slashes or maybe you're working on a fighting game and you need some sprites check out this one it's got 2d sprites in all kinds of poses there's not much animation which actually makes for an interesting style reminds me of divekick which was a very successful game and also had some very unlimited animations if you're building some kind of survival crafting game and you need some tools look at this one it's a nice pack you've got six tools so you have an axe pickaxe shovel scythe hoe and hammer they are low poly with a simplified shape and some materials which look really great then for some realistic firework effects look at this one they'll look very realistic made with the visual effect graph very easy to use just drag and drop also you can customize all the colors sizes timings and everything if you need some simple icons for a game check out this free pack lots of varied icons so you've got things for options sounds some links maybe some keyboard microphone home and tons more they have a simple visual sound so with some hue shifting or some color tinting you can get tons of variation then here's an interesting free tool a json model creator this one can be helpful to visualize the structure of your data you can add some fields select their types choose array or single this is only json so it's a widely used format you can make the model here and use it anywhere and if you're making a retro game here is retro screen it makes your game view very pixelated so very retro it's very simple does exactly just one thing you drag and drop the script onto the camera and it just works alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the ent assessor for february 2012. there's links to all in the description stay tuned for
