hi there this is a quick tip for how to set the number of lines per entry in the console so over here I have some random code just doing a bunch of logs my warnings and a log error and here in the game you can see how it shows by default you can see each entry and the console right here you've got the amongst the warnings and the errors so each entry is showing the in log message and also where that message came from so you can essentially see the first line of the stack trace now most times you're really only interested in the message and don't really want to see these stacked rates for example in here starting game I don't care where this message came from since it's just an information message so one thing you can do is click here on the console options and here on the unlock entry you can set the number of lines that your log entry should have so for example if you do want to see the stack trace you can increase this by let's say five lines and now you can more easily see where the messages came from or you can do what I normally do which is go into the log entry and select just one line and just like that you have all the messages nice and compact which makes it very easy to read and if you do need to see the stack trace you can simply highlight a message and now you can see the stack trace for this particular message and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
