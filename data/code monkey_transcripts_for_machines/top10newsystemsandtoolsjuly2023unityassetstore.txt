hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for July 23. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered all the best free new assets and next one I'll cover top visions and effects as always there's links to the desk in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now the city Store is having their birthday sale so pretty much all of their packs are currently at Half Price they've been doing this for nine years so whatever game ideas you have chances are there is a pack perfect for just that for example the military pack is great for any kind of shooting game the fantasy Kingdom pack is a great General medieval style asset pack then you can make a survival game with the apocalypse pack perhaps a racing game with a street racer maybe a tycoon game with the shops pack and tons more and the SciFi ones pack this one is the pack that I'm using in my upcoming steam game thank you Guardians go ahead and edit your wishlist so as you can see lots of great stuff around price points check out the entire sale Linked In the description alright so starting off with a massive update to an already existing excellent tool it's text animator version 2. this is one that I've had on my list to do a phone review for quite some time I've used it a tiny bit and what I saw was awesome basically it's a tune to really help you make your Tech stand out you can add all kinds of effects and animations you can make it wave Shake rotate you can make it change colors fade bounce and tons more pretty much every single game has text and a tool like this one can really help you polish that text this one is a very robust deal that has already been used in production in several excellent successful games things like slime Rancher packling and conflict lamp version 2.0 is a massive update which is almost a complete rewrite whilst adding tons of new features things like editor preview new effects and a bunch more I believe this massive update is free at least for me it already showed up on my account so if you already have it go see what is new and if you don't then definitely look into it it's an excellent tool that can really help your game shine up next here's a massive shooter game kit if you want to quickly make a shooter then this one would be an excellent starting point the name says primarily third person but it also supports first person it features some realistic Locomotion with Dynamic rotation and breakdowns it's got ik foot placement that it works on any terrain it includes multiple premade game sounds things like regular third person top down two and a half D side scroller and first person the weapon system is also very robust with physical bullets dual wielding Ricochet and melee weapon support it includes an inventory cross platform controls gravity system vehicle controls Ai and a bunch more it's super easy to get started just drag and drop the character and that's it also features extensive documentation which is super important for a company accessor like this one oh no it looks like an extremely complete package so if there's some shooter game idea that you'd like to quickly prototype then this can be quite useful up next here is one that is simultaneously just a visual but also a tool it's a level and volcano environment this one is visually gorgeous super high quality assets with some super complex shaders looking at this makes me want to make a game inspired by something like Mount Doom or perhaps recreate that iconic Star Wars scene it includes a bunch of tunes to really customize it there's a a spline tool to control the flow of the lever you can create Rivers roads and cliffs there's a tune for generating lakes or endlesses it includes nine demo scenes so you can see it in action in all sorts of environments so if you need some gorgeous level system definitely look into it or if you'd like to research foam apps then this also looks like great asset to research then if you want to make your game more performant look at this FSR package FSR means Fidelity super resolution it's an AI upscaling technique this technique is built by AMD but as far as I know it works on most Nvidia cards this can be excellent for making your game performant without sacrificing much visual quality in case you don't know on the render pipeline asset you can actually modify the render scale so one way to improve performance if your game is GPU bottlenecked would be to unlover that render scale and then use this tune to bring the visuals back up it is really easy to use you just add a component and it's done so this is a great option if you have some performance issues next for another visual tool here is planar Reflections this one lets you add realtime Reflections to your game if you don't know Unity only supports big Reflections by default if you have dynamic objects they will not show up on the reflections now in the description they don't mention what technique they're using they mention performance so I assume these are screen space Reflections and not Ray traced visually they look great and it also looks super easy to use you just have the component and play with the settings there's tons of options to modify Reflections is one thing that can really help your game look much better and unity's limitation of only being baked really limits things so this film is a great way to push your visuals to the next level then if you'd like to make a time of day system or some weather then look at this one it includes quite a lot of options you can change from day into night it even has a procedural Skybox that looks really great even the Moon is procedural you can watch as the sun rises and sets while changing the entire lighting there's also a weather system which supports rainfall with some nice water puddles and droplets then that water can be dried with a sunny weather or you can set up some snowfall which slowly fills up the world it includes two shaders for the weather there's a regular Shader and a stylized one adding a day night second like this one is one of those things that can really help you polish your game next here is a simple tool that does exactly what it says Google Sheets to Json to csharp basically you can Define all of your data in a Google sheet then with a button click easily import into your game and have access to all that data from a simple C sharp plus so like I said it does exactly one task and does it very well this can be extremely useful if you're working with a designer or if you yourself like to design all kinds of numbers on a Google sheet that workflow can sometimes be great when you need to balance tons and tons of values with this you can do all of that balancing work in a simple spreadsheet and then easily import all of it into your game then since a while ago we saw some lava now here is some water it's a water system for urp Unity has actually been working on an impressive water system but so far it's hrp only so this one looks like a great alternative if you're working in urp visually it looks really great nice waves nice foam it's got subsurface scattering and refraction includes cut out volume so the home of your ship stays right you can also Place water within water if for some reason you need to do that you can add some nice customizable Ripple Trails also include some highly performance buoyancy physics and some nice underwater caustics so this really looks like an extremely Complete featurerich Water System definitely give it a look if you need some water next for a UI tool here is a complete modular kit this one includes a ton of stuff you can customize your layouts you can define color palettes includes a ton of icons in both color and black and white every element is carefully organized to make it easy to find what you're looking for there's lots of prebone prefabs to make it easy to get started so you've got popups sliders buttons toggles scroll areas tooltips and gradients it even include scene fade in and Fade Out effects this is really one of those tunes that is massive which might require some time to learn but if you learn it it can make you very productive I can see this being great if you're constantly building tons of new projects then here we have one to help you animate things easier the unity animation window is actually pretty basic now I'm no animator but I have always found the animation curve Editor to be really tricky to use and this the only is meant to exactly help Santa features a very robust curve editor you can edit multiple keyframes at once which is super helpful you can create all sorts of presets you quickly select any action you want so if you like animating directly inside DNT then this looks quite useful alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the NTS server for July 23 there's links to all in the description and as a bonus you can use
