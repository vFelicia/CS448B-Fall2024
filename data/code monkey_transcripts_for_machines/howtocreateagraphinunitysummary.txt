hello and welcome I'm your code machina in this video we're going to view a summary of the creator graph series let's begin so the goal in this series is to make a graph that we can use to display data to the player it won't be able to display any values we give it whilst having many features for how each data point should be represented in the end we're going to view a really use case of this very class being used in a commercial game in battle royale Tycoon so first we're going to create the graph in the editor and set up the basic class as in line graph we're going to create a background and anchor on the transform so our graph has an origin on the lower left corner then set up the code to dynamically add dots for each point in our graph and lines connecting them thereby creating a very simple online graph then we're going to add axis separators so we can easily see where each point is in our graph we're also going to add labels so we can display what the X and y axes represent after that won't focus on scaling our graph so we can display any value first at scaling on the y axis and then on the x axis with the line graph fully functioning we're going to work on converting our graph into a bar chart since our code won't be set up in a clean way it won't be very simple to change the visual representation then we're going to set up the code to be able to swap between different visual interfaces we'll be able to show the same data set using either a online graph or a bar chart or we can also create a new class to fit any custom visualization we need using all of that we will add buttons to manually modify our graph in runtime adding buttons for changing the visual interface how many values are visible and what they represent then we're going to create a simple tooltip so we can see the exact value of each data point it's going to work both with on line graph and the bar chart visuals in order to prepare the graph for updating we're going to create a specific class to handle a single graph visual object first make it to handle the bar chart visual object and then take care of the online graph visual object with each visual object having its own class to handle how it works we're then going to modify the graph class to add updating we're going to make a function which you can modify a single point in our graph without having to completely destroy and rebuild all the points thereby improving performance and finally with all of that we will have a completed class that we can use to display any villain list we want the last video covers a use case of the graph class being used in battle morale tycoon so you can pick up the game on seam and see the class created in this series being used in a real final game so that's the plan for the creator graph series it's very featurerich and adapts to any value unless you give it the first video starts completely from scratch and each video after that covers one specific feature which add upon one another and in the end you can see the complete class being used in a real game so go watch the playlist and begin learning right now as always you can download the project files and utilities for each video in the series from unity code McKee calm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
