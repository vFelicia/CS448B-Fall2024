hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for october 2021. this month there's lots of games that graduated from early access you should definitely study these releases if you plan on going through it yourself if you want to be a successful indie game developer you need to keep up to date with what's coming out i make these videos once a month so i can learn which games are finding success all of these games are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also there is affiliate links in the description for some of the games alright so starting off at number 10 let's begin with actually probably the biggest game of this month crap game if you watch unity videos on youtube then chances are you already know about this one it was made by denny and the game is inspired by squid game it's in multiplayer with lots of chaos happening everywhere you play through a series of kid games like red light green light from the show but then also some other games like tag hot potato the forest lava and so on it has quite a lot of content with 9 game modes and almost 3 maps with up to 35 players the video itself already has over 2 million views and so the game is already massively successful with over 15 000 reviews and the thing about denny is that he's a genuinely good developer both this game and muck are great games themselves so these are not spam games simply made by a popular youtuber they are actual proper great games and of course best of all it's free so definitely give it a try then here's a pretty interesting story focused game named undying you play as a mother during the zombie apocalypse and you've just been bit so the goal is to protect your young son through this zombie infested world it's a pretty unique twist on the zombie genre explore this world scavenge for resources and craft items and recipes to survive your son learns from you the infection is a ticking time bomb so make sure he learns enough just before it's too late it seems like an interesting mix of a very compelling story combined with some great gameplay mechanics i definitely would like to give this one a try and up next one that i think i already covered in a previous one of these videos circuit superstars it came out on early access a couple of months ago and it just had the final release the thing that jumps out right away is just how good the game looks personally i love this visual style very cartoony very inviting but also serious it was built by racing fans for racing fans race vehicles across tons of motorsport disciplines everything from rallycross gt racing super trucks euro trucks and much more it features tire degradation fuel consumption and damage so the game also has a nice amount of pit stop strategy includes online multiplayer and lots of game modes you can even go into your garage and customize your cars in driver like the store page says this was made by racing fans for racing fans so if that's you definitely give it a shot next up here's a pretty big release nickelodeon allstars brawl now i have to say that nickelodeon isn't really a thing here in portugal so i really don't know most of these characters but i do know they're very popular it's a character brawler very much like smash bros that's pretty much the main selling point a very well made character brawler with some famous characters that you probably know and love it's got quite a lot of content with plenty of maps and characters features online as well as local multiplayer which is pretty rare nowadays it's always great to see a big release with some bigip choosing to go with yinti already has over 3000 very positive reviews so unlike most licensed games this one seems to be actually good by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks and up next for some vr check out eye of the temple it's an adventure game definitely inspired by indiana jones go inside this ancient temple and explore it using vr by actually moving your feet keep your balance as you move from one block to the next dodge traps solve puzzles and play around with your fully physically simulated whip this is one of those games that was built from the ground up specifically for vr so it's an example of an experience that is very much vr only and if you want to take it to the next level there's even a speed running mode so if you want to try pushing your body to the limit then this looks like great fun next up here's another one that just came out of early access gloomhaven it's a tactical dungeon crawling rpg lead your band of mercenaries through this unforgiving place where every choice is crucial choose your party from almost 20 unique characters each with their own skills as well as a thousand more abilities to master engage in turnbased tactical combat and experience a massive campaign it has over 5000 very positive reviews so this is an example of a very successful early access development where they develop the game alongside the community and final game is excellent then for something a bit more calm here is the last campfire this one is actually made by hello games so the developers behind no man's sky it's very different from that game this one is a puzzle adventure game it's got a very cute art style great characters and great creatures all in a very mysterious world you'll receive lots of nines and tens and reviews so if you're interested in this genre definitely give it a look then here is rebel inc escalation this one is by the same developers that made the excellent play gank it's got some similar mechanics to that one except instead of controlling a virus you're actually trying to stabilize a warden torrent country so you're trying to win the hearts and minds of the people while also stopping a deadly insurgency you expand your government military and civilian services capture and secure areas in order to bring peace and stability to the country features a campaign mode as well as coop and versus multiplayer this one also just came out of early access so it's got a massive amount of content especially for this price if you like plague inc or you like strategy simulation games then you'll probably like this one and yet another one that graduated after a long time in early access lots of these ones this month this one is legion td2 it's an infinitely replayable multiplayer and single player tower defense game based on the 5 000 very positive reviews it seems like if you're looking for a tower defense game then this one is one of the best build your own custom army choose from 8 unique factions and over 100 fighters choose your playstyle play offensively and smash your opponents or maybe focus on the economy to become a juggernaut in late game it's even got an illo ranking system so if you want to take your tower defense skills to the next level then give this a try and finally for my personal pick of the month here's a really interesting city builder called infraspace the main thing about this one is that it's so focused on efficiently transporting resources which is exactly the kind of thing that i love to do it looks like it has a very complex building system lots of roads going over each other with all kinds of twists and turns you start off in an empty planet but you cannot just eat credits so you start gathering some raw materials then transport them into factories in order to be processed and finally to the habitats in order to be consumed set up your food and oxygen logistics routes and make sure those supply chains are not disrupting keep gathering more and more resources grow your population and build the perfect utopia it just came out in early access but has already received several updates i haven't played a management game in quite a while so i might give this one a try alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity launched in october 2021 there's links in the description for some of the games those are film
