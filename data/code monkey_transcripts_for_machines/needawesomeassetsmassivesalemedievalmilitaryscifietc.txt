hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and right now there's a massive sale happening on the cinti store as you might know I'm a huge fan of their low poly style I've used them in tons of my videos pretty much all of their packs are discounted at Half Price along with some flash deals with a Deeper Discount every week stay tuned for the video tomorrow where I made a fun mini game using the pack that is on the flash deal this week looking at all of these packs giving me tons of ideas for all the kinds of games that I could build honestly I really wish that I could just stop time and build 50 mini games using all these packs the recently released dolphin Realms that one would be perfect for some kind of game inspired by Lord of the Rings maybe an RTS game like the awesome Battle for Middle Earth games or maybe something more stealthy unlike the upcoming Golem game with the military pack you could make a really nice first person shooter that pack has tons of weapons and attachments so just for that it would be fun to make a mini game all about setting up a weapon the ancient empire pack that one is one of my favorites I love the Greek slash Roman theme I used it in my camera system video I could see something like Age of Empires made with something like this or maybe an action game inspired by 300 maybe something like the game Rye son of roamed the dock pack would be perfect if you need some kind of companion in your game I've been wanting to use this bag to make a simple companion AI tutorial I think that would be fun The Heist pack is one that I've also used many times like for example in the destruction video it's pretty cheap and has tons of stuff so with this I would love to make some kind of Coop Heist game another great one that is also pretty cheap is the Battleground pack this is what I use in the third person shooter video it's got tons of props and a nice Island so again it's perfect for a Battleground game one genre that I love to play are Tycoon games so the shops pack would be perfect for exactly that it includes a massive amount of props so you could make an entire multicoon game or really just one of these shops if you'd like to make a city Builder something like City skylines then the city pack would be great for that a long time ago there was a nice bundle with some City assets and I made three unique games with those I made a nice farming game with the farm pack really nice I made an RTS with the SciFi space pack also came out really well and I made a card game like Crazy Taxi using the town pack related to cars the street racer pack is also really awesome this is the one that is on the extra deep discount on the flashlight on this week like I said stay tuned for my next video tomorrow in there I'm using this pack to make a fun drag racing minigame just recently I announced my sim game called dinky Guardians for the environment of that one I use the metal Forest pack they have three nice environment packs I really like these ones because personally I suck at worm building so being able to have some something made by a professional artist is really great and in my game I'm also using the particle effects pack I really like this one definitely very useful in tons of scenarios it has lots of effects that can represent whatever you want another very useful one is the icons pack it's exactly what it says a bunch of nice 3D icons that would fit any game for some horror you have the horror mention pack it's what I used in the v Rising video very spooky tons of props and some scary characters they also have tons of character packs with near infinite customization I use the fantasy characters pack in the character customization video I still need to get back to that one in order to make the part 2 of that video there's the fantasy characters then there's a Knights pack one with nonhero characters one with some normal City characters one with some zombies and tons more on the regular packs they also have usually about a dozen characters all of them are made in the same style so you can easily pick up characters and props from many different packs the Western asset also looks really nice would be great to make a game like Red Dead Redemption and the samurai pack also looks very interesting makes me want to make some kind of Samurai dueling minigame so as you can see tons of packs on all kinds of themes that you could use to build all kinds of games if you like their sound just like I do then go ahead and check out the entire cell in the description like I said there are Flash Deals which
