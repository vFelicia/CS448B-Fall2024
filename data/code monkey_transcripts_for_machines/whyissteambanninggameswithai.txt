hello and welcome I'm your kudmaki so recently there's been some interesting news about valve relating to AI content basically valve is not willing to publish games with AI generate content anymore so this was the news which really blew up recently this brings up a lot of questions regarding Edge and Rain art and the legality behind it although we actually did something really interesting about that and after a while valve finally put out an official statement and there's also questions with other AI related tools that are not about AI generating art for example GitHub copilot for programming and chat GPD for just text so there's a lot of questions regarding this but let's start from the very beginning and it all started over here on this post it's a post on Reddit where someone mentioned that their game was rejected specifically for using air generated art so this developer tried to release the game about a month ago with a few assets that were fairly obviously a generated and then they received this message where valve says well we strive to ship most titles submitted to us we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all the necessary rights after reviewing we have identified intellectual property which appears to belong to one or more third parties in particular the game contains are assets generated by artificial intelligence that appears to be relying on copper and material owned by Third parties as the legal ownership of such a generate art is unclear we cannot ship your game won't contains these AI generating assets of course unless you can affirmatively confirm that you own the rights to all the IP using the data set that train the AI to create the art assets for your game so basically do you own every single input that was used to turn the AI if so then that's fine if not then that's a problem so this is what started the whole thing and there's tons of discussion here there's also some people that doubt the veracity of this story but there have been some more reports of similar messages for example on Twitter Simon kernel has posted pretty much the same message with the same link and here in the requires Jake Burkett who is a veteran in developer he said that a source trusted by him also received a similar message and importantly it said that it's not just art it's text as well so the section only brings a question to myself like I mentioned in the video announcing my upcoming steam game dinky Guardians in there I talked about how I actually use Chachi PT in order to do some brainstorming to come up with the name for the game I didn't use it to generate rate any of the text ingame or any of the store Page text but I did use it for brainstorming and coming up with ideas for names for the actual game so the question is is that a problem using AI to just brainstorm things the other similar example are tools like GitHub copilot so this pretty much uses AI to do some pair programming so it helps you actually write code and again this whole thing was trained on billions of lines of code so here it is I haven't actually explored if they mentioned where exactly they got these lines of code so perhaps this one was indeed only trained on code that they actually own I'm not sure about that but either way these questions about modality this is going to be a big problem which is why back when Unity announced their AI tools all the way back in GDC where they announced to do nothing just a basic teaser back then they didn't say much but behind closed doors a few of us actually got invited to meet the AI team and we spoke to them and importantly they actually said how it was extremely important for them that they actually own all of the input data sets they thought it was extremely important that they own everything so that there were no questions about copyright however recently they finally announced some actual AI tools and when people ask them about the source for their training that their answer definitely leaves quite a bit to be desired they just say when license third party LM so nothing specific so this makes it sound like they trained it on some light Chachi PT and then just did some fine tuning with unity technical documentation if that is the case that could definitely lead to some legality issues on the other hand I don't think this relates to the air tones that they mentioned so no idea if they own all of the entire input data sets for those I really hope they do because I do think this is going to be a big problem if AI is ever going to be used in a serious Manner and one company that actually seems to be taking that quite seriously is Adobe as you might know Adobe recently added some AI generated tools into Photoshop and various products personally I've actually used it quite a bit and it has been quite useful I use it sometimes for generating thumbnails it's really great for being able to just erase something or just expand an image so the Photoshop AI tool has been very useful to me and with regards to concerns about legality Adobe actually updated their terms they basically added an indemnity clause which said with firefly AI Adobe will also be offering Enterprise customers an IP identity which means Adobe would protect customers from thirdparty IP claims about Firefly generate outputs surprisingly this means they guarantee that they own all of the input data sets that were used to train the AI and if you are a developer who uses any Adobe products and uses any generated AI if there's some kind of lawsuit then Adobe will essentially defend you again I think this is extremely important in order to clear up on the legality regarding AI art and AI content so I do think Adobe is doing something excellent here and I really hope that Unity does the same thing finally after a lot of talk a lot of speculation valve actually put out an actual statement in there they say our priority as always is to try to ship as many of the tunnels that we receive as we can noting that a regular requirement is that the developer has sufficient rights in using ad to create assets including images text and music so music that's another one where there have been quite a lot of AI tunes and they seem quite useful but again no idea what is the legality of the inputs used to train them so valve continued we know it is a constant evolving Tech and our goal is not to discourage the user it on seam instead we're working through how to integrate into our already existing review policies stated plainly our review process is a reflection of current copyright law and policies not an added layer of our opinion as these laws and policies evolve over time so will our process so this seems like it's basically just involved covering themselves in legal terms since there hasn't yet been any legal case that kind of confirmed the illegality of all these ad generated assets because that they are basically taking the safe approach and saying if you can't prove that you own the entire data set that was used to train AI if you can't prove that then they're simply not going to accept the game so this is definitely going to be a big question coming in the months ahead the guarantee that adobe is doing I think this is great I think this is going to be the future and I really hope that when Unity actually launches the AI tools for now they just announcement there is going to be a closed beta sometime soon so I hope that between now and when they finally launch ecules I hope by then they actually clarify all the inputs and give developers a peace of mind to know that everything they use has been nice and legal either way this is definitely going to be a very interesting space to see for the next few months all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
