hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for december 2021. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered all the best three new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it and in the next video i will be covering the top essence and effects let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order also right now unity is having their in the veer sale there's over 8 000 assets on sale including many that i've never been discounted previously if you've been watching these asset highlight videos for the past couple of months and adding some things to your wish list chances are some of those are now discount and there's also a bunch of interesting humble bundles for game devs there's one with a bunch of courses for learning blender 3d modeling i'm currently going through these myself learning the basics then there's another one with tons of ui elements lots of sliders buttons and so on another one with lots of music and a final one with tons of sound effects check them all out with the links in the description alright so starting off with an interesting tool if you need some fluffy furry characters very very impressive results visually it looks really unique and it works on both desktop and mobile it works with any shader and your fur can even be slightly transparent and there are no zed sorting issues you can groom the hair in any way you want either with individual layers or by clumping them together it also supports olympic rooms although i have no idea what that means so if your game has some furry characters or maybe just some armor with a bunch of fur then maybe this asset can help add a nice bit of polish to your game and up next here's a really awesome one that i'm surprised i've never seen before it's called 27 slicer which is the same thing as a normal sprite 9 slicer but applied to 3d if you don't know what is 9 slicing that is how you can set up your sprites in the sprite editor and you set it up with 9 slices and it automatically resizes the sprite to any shape and all of the corners keep their aspect ratio meaning that the sprite is never stretched in the corner only in the middle so it always looks great this one does exactly that but apply to 3d like i said a really interesting tool and i'm surprised this is the first time i'm hearing of it sounds like it would be extremely useful i guess maybe the only issue is that it's limited to things where this sort of resizing makes sense so it's perfect for couches tables rugs doors windows and of course it probably only looks good within low poly art style i definitely would like to try this one out to see how the setup works i can definitely see this as being extremely useful especially like i said if you have a low poly style game then if you want to add split screen to your games here's a nice tool it works perfectly the transition from double camera to single camera is really seamless naturally this is perfect for split screen multiplayer but could also work for a single player game where you control multiple units the split is created automatically and rotates around based on the camera angle and one of the issues with double cameras is of course double the rendering so thankfully this one also has a feature for automatic nonsampling in order to make it really performant even on low end devices and up next another super useful tool this one for 2d it lets you dynamically create shapes directly inside of unity so you place down some points and some curves to make any shape that you want then easily with one click you can generate the mesh with as much or as little fidelity as you need you can tint it with any solid color or even use a texture it includes an easy to use uv editor so you can make it look exactly as you want or you can even tint it with a gradient without having to manually make it texture in the end you can either use the mesh or convert it into a simple image quite a nice tool that i can see with tons of possible use cases then if you're like me and you don't like the process of populating a level then maybe this tool might help it's a tool to help with level building like so many others but what it does differently is it automatically finds prefabs that relate to whatever you currently have selected so if you select the tree it shows you all of the various trees for me that's always the issue i just end up copy pasting pretty much the same asset over and over again because it's really annoying to constantly keep finding new ones but with this one apparently that process becomes really easy it's got a custom inspector with a search function there's the ability to attend objects for finding them easily and there's even a connection to the asset store to help you find even similar assets then for another 2d tool here you have some digable terrain perfect for any sidescrolling game where you want to enable the player to build out their level so maybe a mining game kind of like terraria or seymour dig or maybe even something like worms you set up the terrain shape using the sprites you want for the film texture and the various edges then the player can easily dig in that area includes 9 different terrain types and a nice cartoony art sound then here's a very unique tool a transform changes debugger this one is meant to help you debug your transforms when they're acting weird it essentially hooks into all of the transform functions and keeps track of how it changed and from where those changes came from it's also a visual tool in order to make it very easy to visually see on all of the frames which had more actions than usual so at a glance you can probably find the issue right away just by seeing which frame had more action than it's supposed to this one is really a problem that i've never really encountered myself but if this happens to you then i can see this as being quite useful and up next if you have some blurry textures and no access to the originals or you just don't have it in high resolution then here's an ai powered resizer it does exactly what you expect takes your blurry lowres textures and upscales it using ai the screenshots on the store page look very impressive complex images and all of the detail is preserved in the hires version it lets you batch generate and override the original so with just one button you can instantly fix all of the low rest textures in your game the api can even be used in runtime so maybe if you receive some user images in your game you can use this to uprise them then here's a nice visual tool a stadium crowd generator you can dynamically generate the crowd on the stands use from multiple materials to get it looking like a football stadium or maybe boxing or nascar you control how the onions looks and reacts to the game you can color them and offset the animation to make it all look very natural and it's even optimized with gpu instancing so it's very performant and then if you want to display some gifs in your game here's a nice tool you might be aware that unity has a video player component but that one only works on video files so it cannot play gifs so this has an elms to solve that just one line of code to load any gif that give can also support alpha and it even supports screen recording so if you have some feature in your game kind of like a gamewin screen or some highlights and you want to enable the player to make some gifs to share them on social media then this one makes that process extremely easy it's very simple and does exactly what it's meant to do all right so those are my top 10 new
