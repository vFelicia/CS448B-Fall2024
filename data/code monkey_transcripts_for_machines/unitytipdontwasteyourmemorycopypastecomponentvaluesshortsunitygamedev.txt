here's a quick unity tip while you're testing your game you will probably modify some parameters while playing it for example let's say while playing you think this transform should really be on this position instead but when you stop playing these values get reset so one thing you can do is memorize these values or take a screenshot and write them manually or a much better approach is to right click on the component and copy component then you stop the game and then right click and paste component values super useful so you don't have to memorize values alright hope that's useful subscribe for more tips
