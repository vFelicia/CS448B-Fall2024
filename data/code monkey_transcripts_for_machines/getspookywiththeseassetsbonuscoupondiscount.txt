hello and welcome i'm your code monkey it's that time of the year again time to make some nice spooky games and to celebrate that there's a halloween sale on the ntsor tons of assets environments systems and effects all at half price and as a bonus if your order is over a hundred dollars you can add the coupon spooky to get an extra 10 off so let's check out some of the acids on this sale let's begin with a really interesting effect some animated boiling liquids perfect for any kind of halloween thing you can tint it in any color so you can make it green to make some poisonous liquid or maybe blue for some boiling water or even something completely unrelated to halloween and just have some boiling lava very interesting effect definitely looks very great then for a spooky environment you have this massive pack with graveyard props contains over 800 assets all in a really nice low poly style it's got all kinds of spooky props there's some headstones some spooky trees fences and tons more the demo scene looks massively huge so this one could be great just use the demo scene directly and start working on a prototype right away if you want some spooky skeletons here's a great one includes a skeleton along with armor helmet shield and weapon also has a bunch of animations including a nice death animation where the skeleton just falls into pieces then here's a really nice forest it's a great environment perfect for a spooky forest at night or maybe a really pleasant hike during the day features three seasons summer autumn and winter then for some animations here's a nice pack these would be great for some kind of witch character lots of spells shields blocks and dodges also includes basic idle and movement animations as usual these are humanoid and missions so they work with any humanoid character next up if you're working in 2d here's some great isometric sprites i really like the art style on this one very clean drawings with some really nice outlines so maybe you could use this as a starting point in order to make something like a spooky stardew valley or maybe graveyard keeper if you're looking for something spooky but cartoony here's some nice skeletons they've got big heads and big eyes so they're both very spooky and very cute could be a great starting point for something like a halloween rts game then here's a pretty specific one a bunch of horror busts great models all very high res you could place the busts on top of pillars or hang them on the side kind of like gargoyles so these would be great for adding more variety to some spooky levels with a realistic art sound and if you want a complete environment here's one it's a scene with a graveyard and some nature looks like something that you could find in some ruins in a game like skyrim then if you want to expand upon that environment here's a bunch of dried trees they are very spooky and looking lots of variations you could build an entire forest just with this pack just add some basic fog and it already looks quite creepy and combined with the previous one here's a bunch of fences and gates lots of spikes and stone just these are enough to create a spooky ambience and then on top of that here's a bunch of flutter props these would be great for decoration or maybe some potion simulator game then of course we couldn't have a halloween sale without a bunch of zombies so here's a nice pack features a total of nine zombie variations it's got pbr materials with some highres textures and all the models are also set up with separate body parts in order to enable easily cutting limbs for something more fantastical here's a dragon skeleton just like the skeleton asset that i showed a while ago this one also has morphing so you can get tons of variations it looks really nice and also includes tons of animations then for a complete environment here is a nice cartoony village it's a pretty good art sound could be a village on a topdown action game or maybe just use the buildings and make something like a city builder or an rts the buildings also have some nice variation including with some snow then if you want something indoors instead of outdoors here's a nice spooky dungeon in 2d great for making something in the vein of castlevania lots of objects for you to build out a huge world also if you need some ui assets there's a bunch on sale here's a nice one tons and tons of icons and buttons all of them looking very spooky this would be the perfect asset to add that extra bit of polish to your ui and then if you want a bunch of very weird looking demons here's some includes five demon characters all of them very very weird and all of them including animations alright so those are just some of the highlights check out the
