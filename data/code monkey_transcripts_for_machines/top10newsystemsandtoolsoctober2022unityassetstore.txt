hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video only check out some highlights for October 22. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered the best free new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them as always there's links to us in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your org also right now there's two bundles with huge discounts there's a Unity mega ball with 30 tools I would say this one is worth it just for the asset inventory alone it helps you search for anything in all the assets you own so this one has been super useful to me to find some props and objects for my steam game and there's also a Humble Bundle with tons of realistic environments they are all super high quality photogrammetry assets so you feel like a realistic art style definitely give it a look alright so starting off with an interesting one the survival engine online as you might know netcode for game objects was fully released just a while ago I made a super detailed video tutorial covering tons of things about it in there there were a bunch of comments asking me to make a course or some game samples to learn how it all works I'm still trying to organize my schedule to see if I can build such a thing but in the meantime here you have a very complex sample it's based on the survival engine which is Nest that has exists on the store for a long time features chopping down wood placing some buildings farming cooking hunting crafting and a bunch more again all of it in multiplayer using netcode for game objects so if you want to see a complete sample for how those mechanics can be built or if you just want to make a multiplayer survival game then check this one out next up if you want your game to look gorgeous then one easy way to do that is adding some nice weather changing the Skybox really is one of the best easiest changes you can do to make your game look much much better this one includes not just the Skybox but an entire weather system features quite a lot of variety so you have everything from sunny days to some intense storms you have some dense fog and some nice Autumn scene Works in urp and looks really nice then here's a really awesome tool called colorize it lets you easily change colors on materials by modifying the color palette this one is obviously perfect for meshes with solid colors so everything like low poly assets which is a sound that I very much like to use the main thing that I like is how apparently it lets you place down some colors with a mission so it looks like you can very easily make certain body parts glow that feature alone looks super useful and also you can generate the entire color palettes and swap them out easily so if you use low poly senior game then this tool can definitely be very useful if you'd like to show a web page in your game look at this one seems to be a very complete package it runs JavaScript supports https supports oauth payment methods and tons more the size is customizable it can even play videos and also support uploading photos directly from the camera see if your game has any content on a browser like for example you have a Steam Workshop or some forums then for that it don't like this one can be much easier than building it all from scratch natively with the ntui if you want to build some Vox on worms and look at this one importantly this is an ingame level editor so it works while the game is running this kind of thing is excellent for letting your players mod the game they can build their own levels objects are anything and easily share them between them and it's not just levels it's not just dumb blocks you can play some blocks with lights and even add some Behavior to allow you to open close doors or any other thing very useful if your game is Vox on base next is a nice and simple tool usually objects don't render on the inside if you want that to happen then The Simple Solution is to make the rendering doublesided but if for some reason you don't want to do that maybe you can't modify the material or it will change way too many things then with this tool you can just add a little bit of geometry to be able to see inside it's simple and does exactly what you expect then if you have tons of 3D objects and you want to easily position them look at this tool features lots of parameters to position all the objects exactly as you want them there are plenty of layout types you can place things in a grid you can place them all the spiral one curve randomly and more also includes animated components so your objects move into place in a really nice really satisfying way this looks quite useful for easily positioning object sign input next if your game features bugs then maybe I'll look at this controller the obvious thing is the leg ik system so as the ant moves forward the legs move forward with it all you really need to do is just move the main transform and everything else will look good features lots of settings to play around with you can easily swap with lengths so it's a very Niche tool but if you're making a bug game then I can see this being quite useful then if you'd like to make a Parker game here is a Parker player controller supports jumping crouching and while running you can go around curved surfaces you can move up while while running also has ledge climbing and moving platforms so it's pretty nice if you'd like to make a parkour or ninja game if your game is 2D and you need some interesting Shadows look at this one the main thing is they are extremely adaptable you can make them completely solid or Fade Out Over the distance you can rotate the Sun in the sky also includes a water Shader a wind Shader and some Sprite Rim lighting definitely a great way to add that extra bit of Polish to your 2D game alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the NTS store for October 22 there's a link
