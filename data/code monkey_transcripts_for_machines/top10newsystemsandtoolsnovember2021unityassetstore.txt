make games from start to finish and learn everything about unity so if you've ever wanted to get them then this is also the best time both these sales and tomorrow so check them out quickly alright so starting off with a really awesome tool for taking your spreadsheet animations and making them really fluid with just one click you can turn your flip box and make them extremely smooth the results really speak for themselves quite a massive difference flip books or sprite sheets are always an excellent way to have some very complex looking visuals but make them really performant the main downside is usually they look a bit janky due to the limited frame rate but with this they look perfectly smooth next up if you need some really high end liquids here's zebra and liquids i actually also covered this one in the free assets video because it also has a free version that one has some limitations but this one has everything visually you can see it looks really excellent great visuals and it reacts perfectly with all the collaterals lots of splashes waves and everything it's gpu powered so that makes it very performant works in both urp and agrp next up polish your attacks with anima text wherever you have text in your game usually it always looks better if it's animated in some way this one's got tons of effects over 80 which you can then customize in tons of different ways works with both the legacy ugui as well as text mesh pro also works with rich text tags so you can apply some bold italic color and it all works perfectly and it also works with any emojis sprites or anything so if you have any sort of text in your game you can make it look a bit better by making it animated then if you want a nice level editor tool here is edimapp it helps you design levels both in 2d and 3d just click to select an object and click to place it it's optimized to reduce draw calls and it also supports depth so you can easily make levels with multiple fours next up manage your ui with doozy ui manager this is one of those tools that is extremely capable and very complex but if you do take the time to learn it it can be very useful it contains multiple individual tools for doing all kinds of things you've got a tool for easily animating ui elements another one for sending messages between objects and also a nice visual tool to see the flow of your buttons it's already got tons of reviews so plenty of people have already found this very helpful up next here's a fun one stick figure it's a tool for creating and animating 2d characters now this one is not based on bones which means it has some pros and cons you can easily animate the characters by just moving the handles but also without bones makes it a bit hard to do some ragdolls so it really depends on what style you're going for seems like this would be great for animators who want to quickly animate some things inside of unity then here's an interesting one for object editing it's a safe system for your editor it has support for many many saves so what you can do is you place down objects in your scene you hit a button and the exact state is saved then if you want you can load that state back meaning that this can be super useful for helping you avoid having to create multiple scenes or multiple prefabs with all the objects in different states like for example in a scene with a bar fight you can save the state with all the props in their place then another save for all the parts on the floor and then dynamically simply load which one you want this works with pretty much everything so you can also play around with lighting settings save and load play with signs weather ui or anything definitely a very unique tool that i can see being quite useful up next if you need some really nice realistic rivers here is infini river like the name implies it's a water simulator primarily meant for simulating rivers the main thing being that you can place on rocks anywhere and water simulation accurately goes around it but of course liquid doesn't really just mean water so it can be lava mud or anything you want up next here's an interesting tool to create tons of content for your 2d games you select the various regions that make up the sprites and then you can easily apply all kinds of modifications to each region so you can play around the hue saturation or make it completely random this can really help cut down the amount of work you need to do if you have lots of similar looking items and being able to define those regions means that it looks much better than having to tint the entire object and finally here's another fluid simulator less than this month this one is in 2.5 d so it definitely enables different use cases from the other ones it's called fluid simulation so it's really not just liquids it works great for fire smoke gas or anything it really looks great for some smoke while the character moves or maybe just some paint swirling around and since the simulation is in 2d that means that it should be very performant alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unity asset store for november 2021 there's links to all in the
