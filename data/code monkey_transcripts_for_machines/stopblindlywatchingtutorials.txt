hello and welcome I'm your kmy so when learning pretty much anything there's something called tutorial hell this basically where people just watch tutorials nonstop they might watch a 100 videos teaching them all kinds of things but then when they stop watching and they try doing something at that point they get Frozen and are unable to build pretty much anything from scratch so despite watching hours and hours of really high quality tutorial content despite that those people feel like they haven't really learned anything so if this is you if you feel like you're watching tons of tutorials and not really learning anything if so then my best advice to you is to stop blindly watching tutorials and go actually do something specifically I think the issue is that some people think that watching just the tutorials is the only step on your Learning Journey some people think that just watching video tutorials is enough that if you watch enough hours of tutorials if you do that you won't gain enough knowledge however in reality watching these video tutorials this is really just one step it is the first and actually the smallest step now don't get me wrong tutorials are excellent I've made tons and tons of tutorials myself and I truly believe they are helpful in teaching you how to build all kinds of things that's really why I make all these videos however I want you to know that you don't learn just by watching you need to put what you learn into practice in order to actually solidify that knowledge so you need to open up some project and start writing some code modify it in various ways to see exactly what happens and specifically in terms of programming the more code you write the more you TR to learn so yes do watch tutorials but stop blly watching tutorials meaning don't just watch something in order to just take some box or tell people you saw some video the goal is watch a tutorial in order to learn and then take some action to actively apply that knowledge for for example if you want to learn how an interaction system works for that you can watch my tutorial on it to learn how it works to learn the theory behind it and how all these systems all the elements connect to one another but then very importantly do not ignore the crucial next step after watching the video then open up a brand new project and write some code to yourself you only truly learn by doing so do not skip this second step my C course that I just released was made exactly with this in mind I want you to truly learn so that is why I designed the frequently asked questions the quizzes and the interactive exercises you are supposed to go through all these after watching each individual video lecture by reading the frequently asked questions by doing that you are a bit more active than just watching and listening to a video Then by doing all these quizzes you are even more active and in order to answer correctly you have to retrieve the knowledge that you gained from the lecture and finally the interactive exercises these require you to actually write some code and actually put into practice what you learn I specifically designed all of these to have an increasing level of participation that is required from you meaning you go from passively watching just the video lectures to actively reading the frequently Asked question questions to actively answering some questions and finally very actively writing some actual real code if you just blindly watch videos you won't really learn much but if you put in the effort to actively learn and actively apply all the knowledge that you're gaining if you do that that's how you truly learn also let me make one quick note here the companion project for my C course that contains all this that is part of the premium version of the course however if you can't afford that's fine you can still learn I've already published the free beginner section here on YouTube and I will publish the free intermediate section next month in the video lectures at the very end I included the titles for the questions quiz and exercise so even when watching the completely free videos over here on YouTube you can still follow exactly what I'm saying here watch every lecture then actively go do all of this you just need to basically guide yourself and put in the effort to find the answers to all these questions and remember to actively write some code yourself if you do that then yep you will earn a great amount and on these two videos completely for free however if you can afford the premium version that's really great because it gives you a simple preplan guide path all you have to do is follow my instructions and put in the work and if you do that then I guarantee that by the end you will have gained a ton of C knowledge and also on this topic let me say I'm no different from you for example something recent that I had to learned from Squatch was dots I made a really detailed video tutorial about two months ago and the way that I researched for that topic was very simple first I watched a bunch of video tutorials on that topic then I read a ton of the official documentation and then very very importantly I took the next step of loading up a brand new Unity project and just started writing code so I tried creating a basic entity building a component writing a simple system and so on that is really how you TR learn that is true for you as it is for me if I had just watched videos and just read documentation then I wouldn't have been able to gain the knowledge that I gained which I then Ed to make that video teaching you everything that I learned so really what I'm saying here applies to both beginners and more advanced users regardless of how scill you are at something you still need to actively apply it in order to continue learning and truly learn whatever it is you're trying to learn and somewhat related to this is something that I always tell in the comments in my courses if you're following some kind of long course that is multiple hours if you do that and you don't understand some kind of part my advice is do not blindly keep going forward if you do then you're probably just going to be more and more confused so if there are some course you're following and there are some topics some part of it that you don't understand if so then stick with it stay there until you do understand research that specific topics more open up a project write some code modify some things to see what changes and ask some questions but importantly stick with it and only move forward once you finally fully understand that topic if you want to get the most out of pretty much any course my course or anyone else's courses if you want to truly learn definitely make sure what I'm saying here go through it step by step and don't go on to the next step until you fully understand the previous steps now this topic being stuck in tutorial heal this something that I see in a lot of comments soly now I can send them a link to this video instead of constantly rewriting the same thing every time if you want a guided path to actively learn by doing if so then check out my complete C course Link in the description like I said I specifically designed it to have all these kinds of interactive things to help you truly learn by doing all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
