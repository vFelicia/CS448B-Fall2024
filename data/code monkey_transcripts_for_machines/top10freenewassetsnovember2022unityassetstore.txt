hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the assets or is full of awesome tools and assets help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for November 22. in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid apps and tools also stay tuned because it's November which means Black Friday this Monday the sale starts on the unity asset store I'll be making an overview video showcasing some of my highlights this sale will have Flash Deals at 70 off you can already see what assets from Beyond that deep discount and when there will also be a Black Friday sale on the simply store also starting out this Monday and finally if you want some low poly Assets in a nice cute style there is a homophone running right now as usual a super deep 95 off discount this one is low poly but it's pretty different from the Cindy style I quite like how the characters are pretty cute as usual the links in the description are film linked so if you pick up anything during these sales you get some awesome assets at a nice discount and I get a nice commission alright so on to the top 10 lists are now off with a pack that is maybe a little bit late it's a Halloween pack but still even outside of Halloween this looks like a great free pack if you're making some kind of horror games or just a mount spooky game then this would fit right in features quite a lot of prompts mainly to build a cemeterylike environment so there's quite a lot of objects for this free pack anything like this style then this dev has tons more next here's an interesting simple tool that does exactly what it's called it's a background recompiler you normally save the code file in something like Visual Studio but Unity only starts compiling when you alt tap the DNT window so this one is a simple tool that can helply save a few seconds by starting the compilation right away so if you'd like to save a tiny bit of time then this sounds like a very nice very simple tool next up if you need a really good looking pistol model check out this one I really like the sound on this one it looks semifuturistic but nothing to scifi it includes the pistol a really nice case and some ammo also everything is split into Parts allowing to easily animate them then if you need some environment check out this repack it includes a whole bunch of pieces like some rocks and trees that you can combine in many ways to build a nice simple environment all of it in a pretty nice cartoon style after that here we have another nice system this one is a loot table you either find some objects and what chances they have to drop it features a nice custom editor so you can easily visualize the percent chance and set up all the prefabs you can set the chance to drop as well as adding some guaranteed drops then if you need a bunch of fantasy props check out this one you could build an entire village with just these assets you've got some wooden fences a bunch of barrels a campfire a tent and a whole bunch more next here's an interesting one it's a bunch of noise textures these are super useful for quickly doing all kinds of effects for example I've covered a quick video on how to do the transition effect like in Hades it's all based on a black and white texture sort of like these ones if only neither are some interesting grayscale shapes and a simple Shader so this pack looks great for achieving all those kind of interesting effects then here is an interesting Quest system it's based on scriptable objects it allows you to easily create some quests and Trigger some progression looks like a nice system to get a prototype up and running quickly if you're working on an oldschool 2D game check out this right back it looks very much inspired by something along the lines of Castlevania it features 400 free assets so this one is actually a pretty huge pack then if you need some realistic nature textures check out this one there's lots of texture Maps so it includes the color texture as well as some ambient conclusion some height and some normal Maps you've got some sand rock mud grass all of them looking really excellent it even includes premade terrain layers so it's all ready to use alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unity s store for November 22. there's links on the description and also check out my own free and pin as on store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
