by the way stay tuned for a very special announcement coming tomorrow hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for October 22. even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to unlock at them and see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid ads and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and the best sausage systems as always there's links to the apps in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now there's two bundles with huge discounts there's a Unity mega ball with 30 tools I would say this one is worth it just for the asset inventory alone it helps you search for anything in all the assets you own so this one has been super useful to me to find some props and objects for my steam game and there's also a Humble Bundle with tons of realistic environments they are all super high quality photogram 3 assets so you feel like a realistic art style definitely give it a look alright so starting off with a really gorgeous looking environment this one is very sound like I love how this one looks it's a nature scene so you've got tons of grass and trees there's a bunch of flowers scattered all around along with some rocks and a lake these environment packs are always great for making quick prototypes just use the demo scene and your game won't look much better than a boring plane then here's a really awesome animation pack this one is all about Stealth kills includes 42 animations for both the attacker as well as the victim it's really awesome looking perfect for any ninja or some Hitman sound game the animations are all mocaps so really high quality they all look great then if you want a nice pack to punch up your UI check out this one it's got a fantasy theme as usual has tons of elements so plenty of buttons bars sliders icons stars and really just about everything it's got a nice casual sound like you'd see in tons of mobile games which means it's easily understood by all your players If instead you're looking for tons of anime style characters here's a great pack they are 2D characters each with separate body parts so this one is not just an art asset it includes essentially a tool to mix and match everything to make thousands or millions of unique characters up next here's a gorgeous looking mention seriously this is the kind of thing that makes you question is this Unity or is this real life it looks insanely realistic it's obviously made using agrp has a very unique Baroque style this one is definitely a great example of how good Unity can look as long as you use some excellent looking assets if you need some VFX here's a gorgeous looking pack really nice stylized effects I love all of the wind effects they'll look super high quality with a high frame rate they are extremely smooth features 100 prefab so tons of variety and as usual it's up to you to decide what all of these effects shapes and colors mean maybe some are Buffs maybe some are attacked maybe some debuffs or special player moves adding flashy effects is an easy way to make your game feel much more polished then if you need some hyper casual characters here's a giant bundle they are all very simple looking they would fit perfectly in pretty much any casual game they are all humanoids so they work with any humanoid animation next here's a very ominous looking one some scifi metal structures it reminds me of Blade Runner or maybe control you just had some fog in the looks really spooky even though it's literally just a bunch of super simple meshes if you are a VR developer and you need some cool looking hands here's an excellent pack some super high quality hands everything from some regular human hands to some really thick gauntlets some skeleton demon hands or some really nice gloves includes lots of variety by easily changing the colors for another gorgeous environment here is an Autumn Valley this one is super realistic all about an Autumn scene so everything has some really nice brown colors tons of falling leaves some nice roads bushes and cliffs all of it looks really high quality and very Serene then if your game has magic of any kind and you need some auras or magic circles here's a great pack they are circles with all kinds of inner shapes so some of them look very demonic While others look quite Pleasant definitely a great pack that would fit perfectly for any kind of fantasy Magic game or maybe you want just a single high quality character here's a strange one it's a weird creature kind of like a moss river monster it's got some very detailed textures and a whole bunch of animations and it also includes tons of blend shapes especially for the face you can definitely create any expression you want by just modifying a bunch of Sliders then here's a pack with a bunch of gorgeous Skies I've mentioned several times on how one of the easiest ways to make your game look much better is to just swap out the default Skybox with a proper gorgeous looking Skybox this one is pretty cheap and comes with 5 Skybox sectors all of them look really great and this dev has a whole bunch more if you're looking for something you want a more realistic art style next is an interesting pack for creating modular guns basically you have a ton of separated weapon body parts all of them look around the 30s or 50s definitely an interesting pack if you have some idea based on randomly generated guns then here's a great looking cartoony Suburban City looks very anime like it has that specific sound it's a pretty large city with over 250 models up next are some really nice Magic Shield bubbles all of them are really high quality they've got all kinds of minor effects that really make them pop out as usual it's up to you to Define what all of these bubbles represent you've got have lots of colors and effects for you to make some Buffs or debuffs next up here is a humanoid animal it's a pretty nice model I think it's supposed to be a red panda with a nice outfit so maybe this one could be your player character and if you like this style then this dev has a whole bunch more then if you need some Collectibles for your game here's a pack with a whole bunch of them features some of the basic Collectibles you would need in some kind of nice casual game in total you have some money some diamonds coins Keys potions and tons more in total about 40 pieces or maybe you want just one super high quality character look at this alien Hunter very unique design with some very high quality textures the armor is all modular so you can easily pick up the pieces and it also includes 30 animations maybe your game is hacker inspired if so here's an office that looks straight out of a movie this one is the exact opposite of how I work for me I like tons of lights and light mode on all my windows if I lived in this place I would go blind pretty much instantly but it certainly has a very unique style so if this is is the kind of thing you're going for then this one looks great alright so those are my top 20 new assets on the NTS store for October 22. there's a link so in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your
