hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and as i'm sure you know from watching the news there's currently a war in ukraine looking at my analytics there's about 10 000 viewers from ukraine and about 30 000 from russia i'm really hoping that all of you are safe i'm watching all the news really just hoping for peace there's so much nina was suffering and unity has just made a mega bundle with a bunch of interesting assets but more importantly all of the proceeds from this bundle go towards several charities working in ukraine so from this bundle unity does not take their cut and i also don't get my affiliate commission all 100 of the proceeds go towards charity so you get a bunch of assets and you home support a great cause and unity actually made even more than that there are over 500 asset publishers from ukraine for the entire remainder of this year unity will also donate their entire cut from any purchases of these assets made by ukrainians so the publishers still get their cut and unity's cut is donated to those charities for all the sales for the rest of the year this will hopefully be a huge amount which will hopefully be a huge help the charities they are donating to are these ones and the bundle itself is a huge deep discount as usual up to 97 off so up here on the first year you've got a really nice water shader as well as a pre unique pretty nice stylized town then down here on tier 2 over here you have a pack with a whole bunch of creatures a minotaur troll medusa and the snake then you also have a bunch of animal sounds and a really nice cathedral and finally on the last year there's tons more for example over here is the polygon farm pack by the way this one is also included in the cintiq humboldt bundle along with tons more cinti assets i highly recommend that bundle if you like cinti town it's got tons of visual assets that will enable you to build hundreds of unique games that one ends really soon so if you haven't gotten it definitely check it out so over here the unt mega bomb has that farm pack then there is a nice racetrack generator very modular you've got a complete scifi ui kit and a really nice gorgeous looking realistic medieval village there's also a pack with a hundred skills lots of great visual effects also a super useful pack with tons of crafting animations using a hammer axe shovel and more this one is perfect especially when matched up with that cynthia farm pack then you've got tons of volumetric cloud effects you've got some space assets some zombie mocap animations you've got a kinematic character controller some low poly animals and tons and more so as you can see this model has lots of variety all kinds of things you've got assets ui systems characters effects and so on based on the deep discount just if one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is already worth it and again of course all proceeds go to charity and beyond this bundle you also have all of the assets made by ukrainian developers so over 500 ssr publishers for example you've got a really nice outline you've got rainbow folders so a great way to organize your projects over here a pack for easily generating tons of realistic humans then some nice cell shading kit you can get some more accurate meshes do some things with ar get tons and tons of textures lots of interesting characters special effects and so on so with this you have a chance to get some great assets and help support a great cause i'm really happy that unity decided to do this i'm hoping that this initiative will help lots of people if you're ukrainian i really hope you stay safe and if you're russian i hope you managed to convince your government to stop this madness and end all of this needless suffering i really hope that one day humanity can get to a point where wars are a thing of the past and we can all just focus on making games to bring more joy into this world so thank you for watching go ahead and help out in any way you can and i'll see you next time
