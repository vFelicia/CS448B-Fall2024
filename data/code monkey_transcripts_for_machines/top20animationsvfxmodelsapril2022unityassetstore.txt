hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the ssor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for april 22. even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them and see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all the kinds of games that i could build this one is the list of paid ads and effects i've already made two videos covering the best three new assets in the best tools and systems and as always there's links to the ads in the description also by the way you might have noticed fewer videos lately the reason for that is because i'm harder to work on my turnbased strategy course it's a massive course but i'm making some good progress it's a complex game which means the course will be excellent for learning some more complex programming patterns and learning how to structure larger projects the course is almost fully written so i'm just about to start recording hopefully it should be completely done by around mid to late may there's a link in the description where you can sign up and i'll let you know when it's out alright so starting off with a gorgeous fantasy environment all of the assets look really great really nice cartoony art style it includes eight demo scenes so you can easily just pick one up and use it in your next project then a bunch of awesome sprite effects the video showcases the effects applied to a card but really they work on any sprite you've got more than 20 effects to easily punish your game then here's a pack with a ton of low poly weapons also includes tons of attachments ammunition and lots of gadgets basically if your game is low poly and involves weapons then this pack seems great up next if you need to populate your buildings with interior and exterior look at this pack over 2 000 objects for a pretty cheap price all of them in a nice low poly style could be perfect if your game involves lots of house interiors like maybe you're making a sims game or if you're not interested in low poly but you want something really highend here's a pack with a bunch of creatures it's from protofactor this dev has tons of highly detailed models very unique designs these could be bosses in a regular game or maybe just regular enemies if you scale them down a bit if you are working on a zombie game of some kind then look at this pack with tons of weapons and props quite a bunch of variety in a nice realistic art song you've got an axe flare gun medkit flashlight and even a really nice crowbar for some effects here is a really nice teleport shader effect i really love how this one looks all kinds of variation to really make it fit your game definitely perfect for something inspired by star wars or star trek and up next the latest cinti pack this one is all about nightclubs it's their usual gorgeous style tons of variety in the demo scene lots of bar themes some of them look really highend while others look a bit suspicious it's got a massive amount of props and lots of them are pretty unique since this is a pretty unique theme then for some animations here is a fun pack it's some ghost creature animations really perfect for any horror game or maybe you can just use them with some regular zombielike enemies up next a really highend gorgeous character it includes both a human and a really awesome mech it is super highend tons of detail really love this one it makes me want to build a mech game just use this pack or maybe you prefer a low poly if so here's a gorgeous environment includes over 300 game ready prefabs with builtin led sages so you can really build some huge worlds it's got tons of objects and also includes a castle construction kit then if you're making a retro car driving game look at these cars the video is excellent for showing the perfect use case

some that look really interesting and unique i quite like how these look really nice and stylized with great frame rate or maybe you're working on a 2d game here's a 2d water shader it has tons of effects apply tons of distortion or keep the water nice and calm then if you need a really cute astronaut model look at this one really nice cartoony art style also includes a whole bunch of animations if you need some outlines for your objects then check out this one it's pretty simple does exactly what you expect also has an option for changing the outline thickness based on the camera distance then if you're making a game inspired by fallout and you need a massive atomic bomb here's one it's a really nice effect with tons of detail definitely looks very intimidating if you were to spawn this friend from the player in a first person perspective or maybe you're working on a pixel art game if you need some effects look at this one lots of projectiles slashes explosions hits and so
