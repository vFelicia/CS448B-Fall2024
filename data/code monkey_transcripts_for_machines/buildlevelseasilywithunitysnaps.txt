in this video we're going to get started using unity snaps these are assets built efficiently by unity that are made to be easily snapped together so you can very easily and very quickly build the level in minutes plus all of these snaps asset packs are made with pro builders so you can even customize them if needed let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with enough tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing okay so unity snaps are a very interesting and useful feature usually when making a game what takes the most amount of time is actually creating the assets so being able to quickly and easily set up all of them for testing is extremely useful unity snaps tries to solve that problem by having prebuilt assets that can be easily snapped together here we are going to see how we can import the assets use them to build our level with everything nicely snapped into place so about the prototype assets for AG assets and customize the assets using programmer this videos patreon sponsor is bad adventure bad adventurer is a game development duo currently working on their first game Wayfarers edge it's a RPG focused on exploring and settling unknown frontier lands in a low fantasy and Wild West theme check them out at bat adventure calm thank you to the patreon sponsor and thank you to these awesome supporters for making this video possible go to patreon.com/scishow code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone ok so first of all we need our assets now if you go into the assets store and search for snaps you'll find them all so here they are on the ones currently available and as you can see some of them are actually very recent like this one was just added two days ago so newer snap backs are constantly being added some packs are free and some are premium right now there's actually a mega bundle sale happening on the asset store in terms of snaps the bubble contains the scifi military base here then also the skull pack and then down here the super awesome buried memories wreck which is what don't be using in this video now the normal price for this pack and loan is over a hundred dollars so this totem bundle is an excellent deal you get three snaps packs along with tons more awesome assets and tools and even an included subscription to unity and learn premium so it's a total of over a thousand dollars worth of assets for 90% off the link in the description is also an affiliate link so if you pick up the bundle or any asset through that link you'll also be helping out the channel ok so back into our asset list now if you you'll see that there are two types some are called snaps prototype and some are snaps art this is one of the ways that it really helps you easily build your own levels essentially both packs have the exact same shape but these snaps prototypes are super lightweight models whereas these snaps art are very good and working high definition assets so even if you're a PC is very weak it won't easily run smooth with the prototypes and then when you make your first build you just click on a button to convert them all into highdefinition assets so this makes prototyping on level extremely easy so for starters let's pick up the prototypes package in this case I'll be using the snaps prototype for the buried memories wreck once you have it just click on open in unity and now here if you're working in unity 20 18.4 then you'll just see the package contents and if you're in unity 2019 or later it opens up the package manager set to show your assets so here in the upper left corner you can switch between the normal packages or your assets so some like the prototype pack hit download and click on import now once if you you don't see that the folder has been added to your project files and you can expand it to look at all of the various objects so here under prefabs we have the chamber then a bunch of structures and there you go we have all of our structures so we have floors wrong ceilings and tons of awesome props computer console and so on all right ok so now that we have on the assets prepared here comes a real reason where I snaps are called snaps now the reason is because they are meant to work directly with programs so if you're using unity 2019 or later then by default you don't have programs and programs are in salt and if not you can just go into the package manager and some of the programs and programs or packages once you do then you should be able to see the Tools menu all the way up here and once you click on it then you have the progress and you can click to open any progress window and in doing so it opens up this nice window over here on the corner now if you're not familiar with progress this is how you can very easily snap objects onto a grid so you have a whole bunch of buttons to interact to the grid like making it visible or not and most important one which is enable or disable snapping so now let's drag an object onto our scene so down here let's look for one of these fours and we just drag it onto our all right so here's the form and on the position you can see that it's on a weird position but since snapping is enabled we just move it around and there you go now it's on a perfect snap position another reason why they are called snaps is because all the objects are built in a standard way in order to snap to each other so there's this for town now let's pick up a different floor tile and as you can see the shape is exactly the same so I can snap it perfectly right next to down we can even go up here in order to modify the scale of our grid so we set up our grid scale and then here we can just duplicate and set up all of our four tiles all right so we have some floor tiles now let's also drag some walls and we can also rotate it all right so just like this we have a very basic room now over here I have a simple employer character controller so let's test can you up here we are in our very very basic room and as you can see there are no gaps anywhere because all of the assets are perfectly snapped together all right so now I'm going to continue doing the same thing and just build up a bigger level all right so in a couple of minutes I built up this level is in C just a bunch of rooms they've got floor ceiling walls and much of props and let's try it out okay so here I am inside my level with my basic player controller and yep it all looks pretty good from here so there's a floor in here then another one something there all right very nice and something in there all right great and as you can see all the assets are modeled with the correct proportions in realworld units so if you also have assets of your own that were made with real units in mind then you can easily mix them right here all right so we saw how we built our own room very easily but right now it still looks pretty bad when layout is good but visually it's very basic now if you remember the snaps in the asset store had two times the prototype assets and the art HD assets so now that our own level is fully pumped we can instantly and very easily swap our prototype assets for HD assets so back in the asset store we go and grab the art HD assets so in this case we use this one for the prototype and now this one for these snaps art HD so just open it and over here a new folder gets added onto our project files and in here we have very much exactly the same prefabs as previously so now to swap out from the prototype onto the art HD assets there is one excellent tool we can use back in the essence or we search for the asset swap tool and over here this is what we find so just open it and once he do then over here in our scene you'll see the snaps menu up here and then you can open the asset swap tool and now here you click on the button to select these snaps prototype and then on the other button to select these snaps art HD and now all these buttons are valid you know here comes the magic moment all we do is click on this button to swap all of our assets on snaps art HD prefabs and click on it and there you go everything immediately changes and now if we play the exact same scene and there it is now over here we are using our HD assets so you can see the walls changed the force change often light some of the things over there the balcony the ceiling and everything has changed and again if these assets are too heavy us were editing our game then we can just use our tool and swap back onto our prototype assets there it is prototype and click on that one and see GD and just like this back to prototype alright so that's the magic of the prototype and HD asset system now over here is another scene I made previously and again here our only gorgeous HD assets and I go through I go through this door and into this chamber and there you go just like that you can see lots of assets lots of lights and different effects and everything so here is the scene in the editor there you go all the assets right there now previously I mentioned the prob'ly on their package if you're not familiar with it this is an excellent tool that lets you do 3d modeling whilst inside of unity meaning you can very easily edit your assets to fit your needs so to use the program the package first of all you just need to have the package installed then you go into tools and over here you have the pro builder and the program the window and now with this we can select an asset we want to modify so let's say over here this nice console so with the object selected you click on pro builder eyes and just like that now we can easily add this mesh so if you're familiar with pro builder this is yet another way that you can easily modify these assets now personally I have no skill as the 3d modeler so I can't do much with it but if you do then this is incredibly useful you can build up your level very quickly using snaps and then you can easily manually adjust anything that you need so just like that you can easily customize all the objects as you need them as I said there's currently an awesome bundle sale going on that includes three snaps HD pack sentence more assets tools and learn premium at an excellent discount don't link in the description is also an affiliate link so if you pick up the bundle or any asset through that link then you'll also be helping out the channel so this is unity snaps this is an excellent tool for quickly and easily making some 3d on levels since personally I'm not very experienced at 3d modeling and drawing art I won't be using snaps to make a level for an upcoming test where I'll be using my normal 2d characters in a 3d world that should be a very exciting project so stay tuned for that this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to
