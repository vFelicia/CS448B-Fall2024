however we can look at the number of reviews to get a sales estimate using the box lighter method which means you multiply the review amount by a number between 20 and 70 depending on how optimistic or pessimistic you want to be so let's say we multiply by 40. currently the game has 25 reviews so that times 40 means an estimated thousand copies sold at a price point of 25 that means around 25 000 gross revenue that's not such a tiny number but that's gross revenue so it is not what the developer gets at all from that gross revenue then we have to take away refunds and chargebacks like i mentioned in the other video one excellent newsletter is game discover co and they actually did a case study on refunds they found that the rate for refunds is around six to eleven percent and chargebacks are also around one to two percent so for both of these let's assume ten percent meaning that the initial 25k gross revenue is now just 22.5 k then we have to take away steams cut so that leaves 15.75 after that we take taxes which is going to obviously vary greatly depending on the specifics of the developer maybe on a low tax country that could be something around 10 to 20 percent and maybe in a high tax country maybe around 40 to 50 percent so let's take a number in the middle let's say 30 percent with that we calculate that the final total net revenue going into the developer's pocket is around 11k that is much less than the initial 25k which by itself was already pretty small and of course this is revenue it's not profit everyone has costs the developers have to eat so it's doubtful based on this number that this game turned a profit so with this tiny amount we can definitely say that the game suddenly failed to find success despite looking like a high quality good game now let's try to identify why that happened and what they could have done differently
