hello and welcome I'm your code monkey made the series were making snake in unity in this video we're going to take the sprites we added previously and deal with rotation and corners let's begin here is our game so far we have our snake moving around the map I can eat some food and when I do the body grows and the body follows the path that the snake took as you can see every time we eat we increase the body by one segment now the one issue we have is regarding the rotation of the body as you can see the sprite is only in its natural rotation and it should actually be pointing where the snake is going so over here is our snake class and now in order to rotate our sprite we need to know not just where the sprite has been but also the direction it was pointing it so in here we are only storing that position our snake move position list only has a vector int which contains the correct position so we have to think about how we can store more than just our grid position so down here when we are inserting a new grid position we also need to insert the current grid move direction so let's define a class to store just that this won't store a single move position from the snake so for that first we're going to need a private vector int for our grid position and then we also need to store the direction the snake went towards so let's go up here inside our snake class and let's define a innum for our direction so here are all four directions that the snake can move in and we can use that direction down here okay so we now have a nice simple class containing each snake move position so we can now go back up here and change this one instead of using a vector to end let's use our class snake move position and let's also create a constructor snake move position where we're going to receive our grid position and the direction so here when we are inserting one into the list we insert a new snake move position using our grid position and then also the direction so in here in order to get the direction we are currently only using a vector to end so let's make our code actually use our neon define you know so we replace this with just a direct by default let's set to move to the right as we were doing previously so in here let's modify this code to using an ohm instead of using a vector to end all right so instead of dealing with our vector to end we are now correctly using our in home variable and down here we still need a grid move direction or to move our grid position so let's define one so we get our grid move direction vector based on the grid move direction and works the same as previously and now we can go into our snake move position and I mean here we can actually construct it using our grid move direction and then we insert this object into this list okay so now let's deal with the remaining errors in here on our function to return the full snake right position list we have an error since this norwich contains almost a vector to ends so we have to go through this list and manually add each instance into this phone list okay so our code has now been correctly converted into using a actual snake move position object instead of just using vector two ends so all of that just so we can add another piece of information to every move position so we can now store the grid position and also the direction which is what we're going to need in order to rotate our sprite so first of all let's just run the code to make sure that we didn't break anything by creating this okay so here's the snake it's moving and yep I can still eat food and all the sprites are still in sin she ate it correctly alright great so everything song works well we now have our code nicely set up to easily fix our problem with the sprite rotation so here on the snake body parts we are updating the position by giving it a grid position so let's replace this function and give it a snake move position instead okay so we have modified our function to work with the snake move position object and now that we have this we can go into our transform and modify the Euler angles and again we are in 2d so we ignore the X dy and DZ is the one we need to change so now let's convert the direction into angles so you know let's also make a function to expose our direction and then up here we can do a switch on the snake move position get the direction so we do a switch on the direction by default this snake is pointing up so let's deal with the up direction so by default we set the angle to zero and then now let's do all the other directions okay so just like that we should have our snake correctly pointing in the right direction so as you can see we are doing a switch on the direction from the snake move position and when we simply define a Euler angle and we set it on our transform so let's see there's the food I go to it and yep as you can see it is correctly rotated to follow the snake path so let's eat some more all right so as you can see the body parts are now correctly rotated facing the direction that the snake was moving when it passed through that point so the rotation is working correctly but the corners do look quite a bit odd we should add a different rotation in the corner so they connect perfectly so now we need to think of what information do we need in order to deal with our corners correctly we already have direction that the snake is going in but in order to connect a corner we also need to know the direction that the previous body part went in so we need to store both the direction of the current and the previous position so here in the snake move position class let's add another field for the previous snake move position and let's modify the constructor to receive it now here we might have an issue if the previous name of position is known since this could be the very first position so let's deal with that in order to not get an error in here so if it is no then we simply return a default direction and if not we return the previous direction okay so now let's go all the way up here to our constructor okay so when we have a new snake move position we insert into index 0 so before we do that we check if we currently have at least one position in our previous position list and if so then we grab the one on index 0 and that won't become the previous ok so now we can go down into the snake body part and now we have all the information needed to be able to deal with corners so in here first we're doing a switch on this current position direction and now in here we can do a switch on the previous direction in order to identify the corners so for example let's start off in here so this move position is moving to the right so in here let's do a switch on the snake move position and get the previous direction and here we do a case so we were previously going down and then we turn to the right so in here all we need this to come up with an angle that perfectly matches that corner and by default we have the normal angle so let's see if this angle is now correct regarding a corner when the snake is going down and then suddenly switches to the right okay so here's my snake with a large body now let's go down and now when I turn to the right yep there you go it is correctly angling to the right so as you can see the code is correctly testing for the current and the previous direction all right so let's apply that to the other corners okay so here are all of our various directions let's see if all of them are rotated correctly and yep there's our snake and the corners are now correctly following the path of the snake so they now connect and look much better we can still modify the transform to make it look a bit better but still it works perfectly fine so there you have it we added direction to the snake body positions so we can rotate our sprites while also making sure the corners not great in the next video we're going to handle snake death and wrapping around on level as always you can download the project files in utilities from unity called monkey calm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
