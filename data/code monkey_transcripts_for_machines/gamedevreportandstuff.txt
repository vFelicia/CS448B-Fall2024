e all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day yeah thanks for being here nice all right we are having a great what day today Friday Friday yeah are just right here all right so yeah let's read some interesting news some fun stuff should be interesting uh okay I minimize my OBS there it is been a while since I did in live stream so hope you're all doing great hope you've all been doing quite a lot of interesting thing these past few months so yeah nice he accidentally on the stream not quite accidentally just I definitely uh tried planning it honestly I tried planning it since like Wednesday but always so busy with so many things but yeah today finally managed to do a stream it's been a while since I did a a public live stream I mean I normally do the members Z live stream so if you're a member every Saturday uh remember how there's a private live stream to ask any questions something like that but yeah I haven't done a public live stream in quite a bit so yeah so this should be fun should be nice be a command to re randomize my avatar you can just customize it there's a uh I haven't made a video tutorial on it what did I call it custom character custom uh there you go how to make your own custom live stream character or rather you don't have to make a like draw you can draw if you want but you can also just go on to the website customize and you can modify how the whole thing works so that's actually pretty fun pretty nice yeah you think about the new GPT voice model not release not release what does that mean as far as I know it hasn't been out yet but yeah it should be interesting I'm in the original demo when was that like 3 months ago that was quite a while ago that was a definitely an impressive demo so yeah we'll see hey root bin hey how's it going nice yeah if you left making games nope I'm always trying to build things like just recently making the RTS for DOT score so that was a a fun game to to make and yeah in terms of proper game my last game d Guardians came out last year and yeah I definitely still want to get back to it there are still a bunch of things that I want to build upon it not to mention make a console build and all sorts of things so yeah definitely uh still want to do more uh let's say normal game development so on so yeah that should be fun get motivation to code but stream pop up let's see what happens here sure I mean you can make a 5 minute detour to watch the stream and then go back work on your code do your thing so yeah combine both a little bit you know make a nice break then go back to work that's uh should be a fun thing hey Gabor hey how's it going terminal hey everyone all right okay so yeah so by the way this is the game dep report I don't know how many of you know about it it's on the pin comment this is what I've been publishing like every single week for the past I don't even know when did I start the end of May so May June July yeah so I've been doing it for 2 and a half months basically every week sent out a newsletter with a bunch of news so if you want to sa up to date with the latest in Game Dev teen gaming definitely check it out so here let's uh read the last one which actually had some uh really interesting things so yeah that should be fun can I work on a game on Steam when I don't have Steamworks and the account holder only got Steamworks not sure what you mean by that uh the only person that needs Teamworks is the person uploading the the uploading the build but without that he can still work on the game so so yeah I'm not sure what you mean what when are you switching to gdau I definitely do want to try out gdau at some point so yeah no idea when but definitely something I have in my in my uh in my todo list my very massive todo list that is constantly very massive it's always way too big always got way too many things to do but yeah definitely do want to do same thing for making beginner tutorials more beginner tutorials more more tutorials in general all kinds of things so yeah definitely still want to uh do lots of things jaw exercises no not really as far as I know those don't really work so yeah that's a it's a not quite a thing yeah how' you learn to speak English quite simply by watching Cartoon Network that was kind of the well and by programming since everything related to programming is in English but yeah I spent a big portion of my childhood just watching Caron Network and it did have did not have any subtitles or anything like that so I was just watching I thought it was fun and I would learn a word here and there and eventually after while after spending a ton of time on the internet programming and so on so yeah basically just learned it uh let's say not intentionally so like I was constantly interacting with things in English and by that I sort of randomly learned and yeah by now honestly nowadays English Works my brain works more in English than it does in Portuguese which is kind of a fun thing kind of an interesting thing so yeah uh that's uh that's an interesting thing uh okay let me just uh read a bunch of things then get back to some your questions something like that and yeah last week I saw Deadpool and Wolverine pre fun movie that was quite nice I really enjoyed it I haven't seen a Marvel movie since like uh endgame so I haven't seen a Marvel movie in like 6 years or something like that or I guess I saw that P to which I guess came out after that but anyways just saw it really interesting and it does make me make me think makes me want to build a game where the character Never Dies so how would you make a mechanic like that interesting cuz basically if the player character Never Dies then it's kind of hard to make it a compelling thing I mean if there's no loose condition then it's kind of hard to make a compelling experience out of that but yeah that's definitely an interesting G game design question how to make a game that somehow works when the player does not die so for example the enemies could keep moving uh after taking out the player so some kind of open world game so the player is I guess some kind of immortal vampire something like that and a bunch of enemies come in they take out the player and then the player just stays there on the floor while the enemies keep rolling around going on their on their own path on the open world I think it could be a fun one so basically the world exists outside of you so you pick a bunch of fights and the enemies take you out and eventually you come back to life and keep roaming around I think that could be an interesting one or simply just taking a score penalty when dying so just a simple one or maybe they don't die but lose all upgrades or items so definitely a bunch of interesting possibilities when it comes to building a game where the character does not die that could definitely be an if you're interested in a game design challenge then that's a a fun challenge try to make something where the the character Never Dies the player Never Dies and somehow find a way to make that compelling so yeah when you die the enemy level up their stats that's a bit of a tricky one cuz then becomes like a a snowball of difficulty so you die once then the enemies are more difficult increase the odds of you dying again which then and so on so yeah it could be interesting as long as you then have some sort of catchup mechanic like in um uh what is it called Mario Kart where if you are way too far behind you get like a speed boost in order to make things semi competitive so you could do something like that so like the every time you die the enemy levels up so the enemies become super strong but the stronger they get if that cap becomes way too big you can then give the players some kind of bonus some kind of special thing in order to catch up then when they catch up take away that bonus and things like that so that could be that could definitely be an uh a very interesting approach so yeah if you want the game design challenge this would be a fun one yeah6 will you update the 70 features course yep I'm constantly thinking about ways to update that course it's one of the many things that I'm constantly thinking about so yeah although not necessarily Rel to Unity 6 there are still many nonunity 6 uh featur that I very much would like to cover so yeah like for ex the navigation package that one has been that one has updated quite a while ago and I haven't yet looked into it so I definitely would like to make el on that same thing for sin machine because sin machine 3.0 just came out just a while ago actually like now when you install in machine it automatically installs 3.0 which honestly is a bit annoying just because I'm already so used to using 2.0 so I really like I already know how it works so just put it and everything works great so I really like s machine 2.0 but yeah definitely got to spend some time looking into 3.0 because 3.0 is a massive update and apparently oh it was last year oh I thought it was a few months ago but no apparently 3.0 came out almost a year ago wow that is uh quite crazy yeah but yeah um so 2.9 got a last update in August of 22 and then yeah made 3.0 which is a massive change so yep anyways one of the many things I eventually would like to cover so that should be uh quite fun quite interesting yeah D two you're losing XP by dying really oh interesting I don't think I've ever played the Alum 2 I only played the Alum 3 so two yeah I don't think I've ever played two but yeah definitely definitely an interesting uh game okay so let's see and actually uh suddenly This Game Dev report starts out with a sort of a bummer news game inform forer ends after 33 years so it really really sucks but I mean for a new Sprint magazine to be alive still in 2024 that is honestly quite a quite an impressive thing but uh yeah so game form one of the most subscrib gaming magazines that started all the way back in ' 91 has just published its last issue and on the website they have just a farewell a bunch of messages 30 33 years which is actually quite a lot for a for a news organization like that that was definitely a big one so yeah for the last three decades they provided indepth coverage reviews and all sorts of insights into the game industry it was always a the big thing for a game to get covered on the front page of Game Informer which yeah I remember uh reading uh all kinds of news websites like I never I don't think game inform forer had a physical Edition here in Portugal so I'm pretty sure I've never seen a physical thing but I do remember reading websites like gamasutra and they would always uh mention okay this game has a really interesting thing on the cover Game Informer so yeah it was definitely a big thing although suddenly it appears website has been completely wiped and only has a fwell message I hope this is just a temporary thing because it's just happened hopefully in the future they will have the website back as a nice archive at least you can still find it on the way back machine so yeah this really sucks like they had so much information on the website but when they died it literally just end up just like this so just post a message no links no nothing although thankfully oh no oh oh crap did I not post the correct URL no I didn't it just this one kind of messed up the link address does it is the UTM yeah it's probably the UTM that breaks it are okay I think it's still yeah cuz this one had the website had so many things on there and thankfully does since it was a very popular website does have a lot of screenshots on the Wayback machine but yeah it definitely does suck how the official website just dead no memories no nothing so that really does suck so yeah that was a a thing why don't you reply on my comments I'm trying but trying to read reply to comments doing everything at the same time it's a bit tricky so I'm trying having a hard time getting better at programming C any tips I'm so poor I can't afford your course any tips I mean you can follow the if you're talking about the C course there are free videos over here on YouTube so learn C so if you want you can definitely follow this is the beginner one this is the uh intermediate one so you can go through those and eventually within what day is it 9 so around I don't know like 15 16 18 around this time maybe over here on a Monday so maybe on 19th of August I won't publish the video lectures for the advance section free here on YouTube so anyways even if you don't have any money you can definitely learn a lot from this and uh where was the comment and basically getting better just involves a looking through some tutorials in order to learn what does c do what can C do learn all the Syntax for all the things and uh hey yeah have fun at work yeah uh so first learn the syntax follow tutorials in order to learn that but then you have to actually apply it so when it comes to getting better at programming C or honestly literally anything you learn the thing and then you have to actually apply that thing so you have to write a bunch of code do a bunch of mini games a bunch of prototypes a bunch of mechanics a bunch of systems a bunch of random programs all kinds of things basically the more code you write the better you become so yeah learn how the code Works learn the syntax learn all of that and then spend some time actually putting that into practice I mean that is a big reason why in the course I to find the the uh the uh interactive exercises it was specifically for that so you can actually learn by doing and those interactive exercis those are a crap the ads those are part of the uh premium version of the course but over here on the free version I still made sure to include all the titles for all the exercise let me just skip this so at the end of every single one there you go it shows this thing so you can okay this one doesn't have size let's go over there onto the variables one there you go so if you don't have the premium version you can just look at these titles and you can basically do do some work yourself in order to figure out the answers to all these so what exactly is a variable why data typ is important you can do some kind of exercise to change a unit speed so change some kind of variable define a speed variable double some kind of variable and so on so even without paying anything you can just watch these three videos guide yourself to do all this work enter all the fqs do some exercise quiz but essentially at the end of the day it's really only about experience so the more code you write the better you become so write a ton of code and you w become quite a bit better so in general that's what I would say prob work your free course are probably best s that's awesome hey I'm glad people enjoy the courses and yeah as long as people keep enjoying them I will definitely keep making them so that's nice uh how long did it take you to plan out the code structure for the RTS do Score says Rook I'm amazed how you came out with Solutions i' never uh two months maybe yeah yeah something like that a month and a half to two months something like that was how long it took me to build the Prototype so basically first I had to spend a bunch of time myself learning learning all about dots so reading reading the entire documentation reading all of their they have a really awesome dots ebook Unity dos ebook and I think it's this one yeah like a 50 page ebook so I definitely recommend uh it's over here the link no it's not that it's this one yeah so a really nice ebook telling all about dots so I spent a bunch of time going through this I spent a bunch of time reading documentation spent a b bunch of time uh watching all the videos on dots that I could find on YouTube all kinds of things then of course like I was saying a while ago at some point you have to put into practice so I did all that all that research in order to learn how it works then I started building a prototype so I started experimenting with a ton of approaches and yeah eventually I did find the final structure but again keep in mind whenever you watch one of my tutorials or really any kind of code any kind of game whenever you see that keep in mind that you are watching you are looking at the final version of that thing so for example when you look at my dots scor the code that I'm teaching there is not the code that I initially came up on the first R so I first make a prototype get it working and then I iterate upon it I modify all kinds of things until finally reaching the final thing so basically what you are watching is essentially like version I don't know 30 or 40 of the initial code that I first did so so I never plan out the code perfectly from the beginning I plan out something I start building prototype start building something and then just constantly iterating upon it until it finally reaches something that is uh pretty nice yeah first stream C vis a ton nice yeah I'm GL my vide home nice so yeah that is uh awesome okay so let me uh just keep reading okay so yeah on the topic of game forer which is I guess a positive way to look at it is how it's actually amazing that they last this long so really three decades on a print magazine especially considering how YouTube has grown so much so yeah nowadays there's excellent stuff on YouTube so review channels like game ranks interview channels like no clip and deep dive channels like Ai and games so yeah if you want to learn I definitely recommend at least e like Ai and games this is a really awesome Channel they've got such super detailed uh videos specifically on on AI so like the one on fear that one is really awesome there was one on the AI in Watch Dogs and Legion I think it was that was really awesome so yeah a lot of excellent uh videos if you want to learn all about Ai and no clip of course if you want to see documentaries really well produced documentaries and yeah coming soon design of dredge so that's an awesome game so that should be a fun one so yeah if you like watching uh uh game documentaries then definitely recommend this channel definitely really nice so yeah here in Portal we didn't have Game Informer but I do have for memories of reading a few Mega scores so yeah this was like the uh local thing meas score magazine can I find some images nope ah oh not store score there you go nice local magazine a bunch of games oh that was the heart dark that was nice that was a fun one yeah a bunch of stuff that's what Tomb Raider legend oh that one nice so yeah so this was the local magazine here in Portugal uh for a long time and B Gamer that was another one that was also that was also fun so yeah anyways here we did not have gameing form but we did have that and yeah I remember being a maaz reading an article for an upcoming game where the graphics look in wishable from real life and it was the eldest Scrolls for Oblivion and yeah it's really funny how uh I mean I don't know how many of you are roughly my age but yeah when I was a kid and looking at games I definitely didn't look at a game like this and I thought there's no way this this can be better there's no way this game can ever look better than this uh steam power.com because yeah it really is a I mean nowadays looking at it you can obviously see that this looks quite dated but back then this looked insanely realistic I remember looking at it and thinking holy crap I wish I had a PC that was able to run this this looks so beautiful so perfect look at that oh man Oblivion that was a really awesome game I did play it for quite a long time I definitely did all the side quests everything so yeah definitely an amazing game it was quite impressive uh how good it looked back then so yeah this came out in 2K7 yeah quite a long time ago and back then it did look quite amazing so yeah it's uh it's a shame game forer shut down but yeah nowadays there's lots of places to get uh lots of news lots of things so yeah that should be uh fun think of the illen isolation of alen I see that it's Prett genus I've never actually played it just because it's sort of a horror game and I don't do well with horror but I definitely do need to play it just to uh check out the AI and I'm pretty sure that Ai and games I'm pretty sure uh he did a video on it so um let's go alien I'm pretty sure there was yeah there you go alien a alien isolation so yeah I think it was actually no I thought it was one of his first videos but apparently not 15 but yeah I definitely remember apparently saw this video so this one was probably awesome so yeah I've never played it but it does look quite amazing and it's especially great from the context of being in AI that makes the player feel things so it's not an AI that is like insanely clever but rather it is really good at making you think that it is extremely clever so yeah if you want to look at awesome AI definitely do play the game uh watch this and yeah it's uh definitely one of the ones that is usually given out as the example of okay this is excellent top tier AI definitely do that for dynamic typing or static typing me personally I really dislike VAR now again whenever I say this I have to say that's really just personal preference there is absolutely nothing wrong with VAR so if you like VAR definitely go ahead and use it but yeah for me personally I I really do not like VAR just because I think it makes the code much less readable I like V yeah that's oh hey Daniel it's you hey how's it going uh yeah personally I really dislike VAR just because usually it makes it it makes it not well I guess not usually it depends on how you're using it like if you're using VAR as like grabbing a a variable that is a return of some kind of function I really dislike the fact that most of the times I cannot tell what type that thing is so I'm calling some function I have no idea what the function returns just by looking at the function name so I have no idea what type that thing will be so that is why personally I really like being extremely explicit so I really like saying okay this is a type in it's a list of object it's a game object that say something so yeah personally I really don't like bar I really like being extremely explicit about what types I'm using it but there that's really just personal preference so there's absolutely nothing wrong with VAR so if you like using definitely use it but me personally I won't keep being as explicit as possible because yeah I definitely do prefer reading the code like that yeah speak to in private you can send me an email but lately I've been getting way too many emails so that is quite tricking feels like you're playing with an alien in not a dum AI yeah I mean that that is that right there is the perfect description of what an excellent AI is like you forget that you're actually playing against a computer opponent you're just really enjoying something that is compelling you're just enjoying a very compelling experience and not worrying about okay there's some code running background no it's really a creature that is actually attacking me so yeah kind of like that why to improve my channel uh maybe I'll check it out later okay is n6 fully released nope right now it is still in the what do they call it preview so yeah not yet but it should be coming out later this year I'm assuming it won be coming out sometime around uh unite which by the way I will actually be at unite so if any of you are coming to Barcelona I willon be there so go ahead let me know it should be a fun time so there's a bunch of things and they've actually just published the session list so if you want to see all of the sessions they're going to have all things like one on accelerating the creation of your competitive multiplayer game okay achieve your vision faster with technical ARS tools and un6 so yep they've already published uh all of the uh talks they're going to have so if you're going to uh unite definitely check that out and if you see me there yeah come come ahead and say hi Oh Daniel you're doing a talk nice that's cool yeah I will definitely go there what is it about can I find it here if I search for your name does it show up uh there you go connecting dots let's make a game with entities okay that sounds fun that sounds nice fors fundamentals to entities 1.3 give you a bird's eye view of the API landscape today through a HandsOn live tutorial with ECS s will Empower you to explore the API and build the confidence to continue your ECS development Journey all right that sounds awesome yeah I'll definitely be there that is definitely a a topic that I'm interested in so yeah should be fun yeah I hope you're preparing well should be nice definitely looking forward to it Peak Performance okay that's a that's a great theme that should be fun hey the qus hey how's it going right uh was I yeah uh uh okay let what oh let's see I thought the page was cut off but something like that mind the Observer and facade patterns in my project instead of having scripts communicate with each other directly interact through a single script that serves as a facade class what do you think of this approach uh when it comes to names of design patterns that is always something that confused me so the facade pattern I'm not 100% sure I remember what exactly that is is that like an interface so you have like an interface and with the Observer pattern you are communicating with the interface instead of each other directly just a wrapper okay so I guess I just don't understand exactly what you're doing so you've got the Observer pattern which is really just events so you're publishing something listening to something so then you've got the sound pattern so you're using some kind of some kind of thing to the okay so I'm not sure how you're using it but single script to communicate with oh so you got like a main event manager and then you are like uh listening to that main event manager instead of having different objects listening to them themselves is that what you mean if so that can definitely be a valid approach uh personally I do prefer to register directly with the event but yep having an event manager and basically anyone that listens to events talks to that one and anyone that publishes events talks to that one basically you have an intermediary in between those twoos that can also work so yeah personally normally I usually just connect to the event publisher directly but having the event manager in the middle that can also work uh quite a bit getand does a lot of good videos on patterns nice and yeah actually speaking of patterns one of the things that if uh that I want to cover in a little bit is Unity actually has an excellent uh little uh project that they put out on the assur alongside a really nice uh uh what's it called really nice ebook and yeah talks about solid principles design patterns so yeah in a little bit I want to I want to go through this and just in case you I'm pretty sure I had a tab here nope not that one nope nope nope there you go that one so if you want Unity has that awesome one so yep definitely do this a great ebook it's quite amazing how un has so many awesome ebooks so much information so yeah if you read through all those ebooks you're definitely going to learn quite a bit and uh yeah this one is actually uh quite an amazing thing uh yeah problem I forgot coding syntax how they are declared is my memory problem by me do you mean like you forget the syntax for C sure if it's a basic syntax like how do I Define a function yeah that's just something you learn with the experience so the definitely just write more code that is usually so kind of like the question that I was answering a while ago the answer is really experienced so really just write a ton of code and eventually it becomes Supernatural this is how you define a function this is how you define a variable property class whatever so yeah when it comes to basic syntax it's really just a basic memorization but when it comes to problem solving every problem is always different so when it comes to problem solving it is not about memorizing Solutions it's about becoming better at problem solving but then when it comes to syntax sure memorize that and in a little bit you should be able to memorize quite a lot of things yeah okay let me just uh keep going because there's actually quite a lot of interesting things so yeah the second story is start small and stay small and actually about a really interesting red post on a topic that I personally very much agree with so that is the post is titled why I absolutely love making small games and why you should do it too so the goal is start with a small scope making small games so that's really common device but then keep doing exactly that so you don't have to graduate to making multiyear games making multimon games you can really keep the scope small and really just keep building fun small games forever so this is definitely advice that I really like uh because personally at least for me it doesn't really I don't find it very appealing to spend like five years making a game I really much prefer making five games in 5 years as opposed to just trying to go from one massive one all at the same time some people really prefer that I do think that is a much more high risk potentially High reward option so personally I do prefer the slightly low risk of making five games in 5 years cuz then you have essentially five uh five chances at making a game that does find success so personally I definitely do prefer this advice of small scope making small games and really just stay there so you don't have to graduate to making multie games you can just always keep making small games and this example this post written by one developers behind minim Lane so that's a really nice cozy game that has been very successful and he mentions a bunch of benefits and one of the main benefits is simply cost so basically if you spend 5 months working on a game you'll likely just need a couple hundred or a few thousand cop sold to break even whereas if you work in a game for 5 years you'll likely need tens of thousands of sales which is really tricky to achieve so yeah the faster you make your games the more efficient you are the more smaller scope you make it the much easier it is to make profitable games so not just finish the game but actually make the game and being able to make enough money so you can make the next game and so on so yeah that is one big reason why small games are really awesome and making multiple smaller games also helps you T out lots of ideas and maybe one that people enjoyed where you can spend more time working on a sequel so you can put out tons of games in like every 6 months then one of those maybe people really uh Vibe with that idea they really like it then he can take that one and he can spend let's say one extra year working on either a SQL building upon it something like that because basically it is really difficult to find something that scks something that resonates with a large amount of people so that it can be successful so if you do find something like that then yeah definitely working on it pushing it Forward I do think that is a uh an excellent strategy so use this make small games to test out ideas and then if you want if you really want to make a game that is like a multiyear game then at least I would say test out lots of ideas to find out one that does have the potential to find success when you make it for multiple years so yeah the post very well written explaining lots of benefits of this approach definitely give it a read and yeah this one does have it's a Prem massive post it's all really nice so yeah this one is from the developer of minim M which was actually a very successful game look at that 2.9 th000 reviews this is one of those cozy games you run the street and it's all really nice and it has really beautiful colors so it definitely is Chill cozy Vibes just have some fun characters some fun things so yeah sometimes hard to think of small ideas well the main one for that is really just think of not a big idea but think of a normalized idea and then just break it apart into pieces so like for example this game maybe the big idea would be something like Sim City where you have an entire city with tons of NPCs and you talk to all of them so this could be an example of a small scope out of that big idea so basically you take the entire city and you cut it down okay no I'm just going to make just one single uh Road of this city so really just a handful of buildings instead of building the entire city just build that so when it comes to making small ideas think of a normalized idea and then just break it apart into all the pieces and really just make something much much smaller very focused so instead of making something with 100 mechanics focus on just five of those and make those work really well so that is probably a a great way to come up with small ideas so think of something like GTA and then think okay no I'm just going to make the the driving I'm just going to make missions I'm just going to make like a poli Simulator game like a uh what do you call them like the ambulance game sort of thing like GTA is a huge game has all those mini games and each of those mini games could by themselves be uh one complete game so yep start Le game development St learning coding one week ago nice yeah that's cool have month to prepare for my university project okay wow that that took a turn that took a jump you started learning one week ago and you have one month to prepare for university project okay I feel like it's missing a little bit there but okay how should I start and from where and how could I learn okay so if you want to learn where's my tab where's my tab uh definitely check out my uh where's my cuz I didn't call it kitchen cows watch my there you go my free kitchen chaos course definitely go ahead and watch that it's 10 hours so technically you won't really be able to learn all of that in just one month but you'll be able to gain quite a bit of knowledge so that's what I would say but yeah one month for university project I have no idea how complex that university project is but yeah not sure how you start coding just a week ago and suddenly have just one month to prepare so yeah that won't be uh quite something anyone can give a g idea how do you generate a good game idea had this question in my head forever can you give some tips I do I love your vide so much nice and that is a very tricky question that is essentially the million dollar question so if you have a way to guarantee that you have good ideas then you would basically print money because the idea is such an important thing when it comes to a game being successful or not so when it comes to that the basic idea or I guess the better way is come up with a ton of ideas and then depending on your knowledge you have to be able to analyze what EX makes a good idea and how do you do that is essentially you just look at the uh steam page you go and see what sells so basically you see for them down here new and trending so you go over here and you see all of these games so all of these that are on the popular new release all of these are doing at least decently well so you come up with 100 ideas and then you study this page you refresh it every single day in order to see what games sell what people want to play and then with that over time you get a better sense for what kind of games can sell and specifically what kind of level of quality the average person on team is expecting so as you can see the the uh competition is definitely very Fierce so the amount of games look at these awesome games coming out literally every single day what is that knock on coffin oh a card game with vampires I guess anyways so yeah lots of variety all of them is really awesome so that is something that you learn over time as you analyze so meaning not just play but actually analyze okay why is this game being successful as you analyze that you get better yourself at being able to identify what is a decent idea versus an excellent idea but at that point but even if you do that you still don't have a guarantee of a good idea so then what you do next is you really just test out the idea by there are many ways but one of the easiest well easiest quote unquote is basically make a bunch of gifts a bunch of short videos and just put them on Tik Tok Reddit Twitter whatever just make a bunch of tiny things put them out and see what the reaction is like if you post on Twitter and you get zero likes that might be an indicator it might be an indicator that either the idea is not very compelling or it might be an indicator that you simply were unlik and then reach that's the issue where with testing you can't fully test you can only slightly test so essentially if you put it out on Twitter and you get 10,000 views on a brand new account that is definitely a clear sign that there is uh interest in that idea same thing if you go and redit if you go on take it out and so on if you make a Tik Tok short video basically a prototype your game like a mini visual vertical slice if you do that and goes viral then you know okay this idea definitely has something on the other hand if you put it and gets like 10 views that probably uh means it doesn't have way too much so yeah when it comes to testing ideas first uh grow your own skills of being able to analyze what the what sells on steam or uh I guess what players want to want to buy for me personally I work mainly on seam so that's my focus or but you can say what sells on seam what sells on mobile what sells on console something like that so develop that thing and then come up with a bunch of ideas and test them out so uh that's how I would do it l oh yeah for mixing uh ideas yeah good artist Copic great arst steal best artist steal for multiple sources to high tracks yeah basically combine multiple things so yeah if you want to if you want an idea that has better odds of finding success yeah definitely take two already successful games and come up with your own uh mish mash of that gen def uh do something like that so yeah com L buying a 5x P plus hard valy yep all of those three very successful games so that is quite nice try to make a game development Studio or do you prefer solo I'm really not good at managing people so yeah for me making a proper game development Studio probably never going to make that although who knows perhaps one day in the future I will work at a studio meaning I will not be the one in charge I will just be working alongside other people maybe that could be fun but but yeah uh building my own Studio being in charge of building my own Studio yeah that that requires way too many management skills which is definitely not the kind of skills that I have so yeah that is uh and yeah game studio is slowly dying off because they can't make enough money making games anymore that is also one of my benefits of being a Sol developer I really don't need that much money in order to make a living whereas if I was a studio with like 10 developers to pay all of a sudden even small games become really expensive and need to sell tens of thousands of copies whereas as for example on my own thing like I talked about the results for dinky Guardians so this is looking at the reviews this is a pretty regular game it's definitely not a hit game definitely not a hyper success but definitely more than enough for me to uh pay my wages pay my living so yeah being a Sol developer or a small scale developer also makes it much easier to make profitable games although of course that doesn't mean that I have to do all the work so pros and cons kind of like that the 20 Game Challenge yeah I just heard about it recently and actually really awesome one and uh yep there you go this one it's really awesome a really excellent idea uh I was told about it from someone on the private Discord uh a while ago and it's really awesome basically it's the idea of building a ton of simple games well simple two complex games just build a ton of games specifically 20 games and you will learn quite a lot so I definitely do do think this is an awesome thing so yeah if you're looking for challenges for games to make definitely look at this one building simple games or not even simple building any kind of game is always going to give you a ton of experience a ton of knowledge so yeah definitely a big fan of this concept and yeah honestly my longterm plan is to eventually have video tutorials on making a bunch of these simple games I would love to do that so I would love to have a free 2hour course on making pong another one on making FL bird making breakout uh asteroids that's an awesome one lunar lander that is really cool uh Mario Bros just just a basic one but worms that would be fun that would be nice super M that would be cool making Doom Maybe Minecraft yeah that could be interesting and yeah so yeah if you're looking for uh basic games to to build to grow your skills definitely go ahead follow this uh this uh website which has a really nice list of nice simple games to to do so yeah I don't Ser too personal but would your games provide enough in come for you alone not including YouTube Etc yep I mean I did make my games for how long I started this channel in 2018 and I started making my first theme game in 2013 so I guess for five or six years uh yeah I was making a living just from my game so yeah specifically for my use case specifically for living here in Portugal where uh in the beginning when I first moved out when I first started Living on my own I was living on like €750 a month so yeah I could essentially make a game in one year and make more than like seven Grand off of it so yep thanks to having very low cost yep I was definitely able to uh make a living from my games hey CPU hey how's it going nice uh new project would you prefer Unity 6 or previous versions considering how Unity 6 the proper final version is almost out about to come out I'm guessing it's going to come out like I was saying a while ago it's probably going going to come out during unite which is going to be in uh when is it I was tab uh unite is going to uh there you go late September so I'm guessing around this uh time they are going to either publish unit6 final version or give a date for it so yeah if I were starting a project right now yep I would definitely use the current un6 version and then upgrade to the LTS version whenever that one does come out so yeah that should be it should be nice in what could case in what case should you buy assets well in the case that you need something that you probably can't do uh can't do yourself so in my case I am not an artist so for me when it comes to visual stuff yeah I'm just going to buy assets I'm just going to buy animations textures visuals so yeah you can use assets either to supplement your skill set so basically help you fill any kind of skill apps you have or essentially really just you okay I do have the skill set of being able to make like some kind of pathfinding system but making a proper one is going to take a ton of time so let me just buy an asset and just save a ton of time so yep either play skill Maps or save time those can be great ways oh reply to you okay yeah I'll check it out in Li yeah thanks for your reply I'm definitely interested in hearing more about that conversation seeing different viewpoints definitely an interesting topic uh about way more project management I don't make too much project management uh specifically talking about in the context of like making uh game design documents usually I don't do anything too complex I just make some simple high level overviews and very quickly start building a prototype so that is usually how I do it so nothing too insane I don't make like 20 Page 20 pages of designs and making uml diagrams connecting this and that usually I don't do that just make something simple hand L overview and then just start start building a prototype and really iterate from there so yeah when it comes you project management in that sense of Designing the entire game just design a little bit and then constantly itate upon let make a horror game I very much in theory I would like to just because just to test out the the uh uh the theory that uh Chris has said multiple times uh Chris over here yeah why every Indie Dev should make horror game so I would like to try out that theory to see if horror games really do have a relatively easier time of Finding Traction and relatively easier time of actual building game so from that so as an experiment I would like to do it but yeah I am not a fan of of playing horror games so that would be a very interesting one like can someone who does not like horror games build a good horror game I guess that's an interesting question but yeah eventually I very much uh would like to experiment with that that would be fun code question I get the same transform from the children of a parent in my queries not having a parent works but how do you get the transform of a child in dots so in dots for all the children those are all if you look at the parent uh not game object for the parent entity it's going to have an array it's actually a dynamic buffer uh it's called CH or something like that I think it's like the child array and inside it's it's an array so it's an element that contains all of the uh children so yeah not having a parent words how you get the transform of a child yeah so then you can cycle through all those entities then on those entities you can access the local transform which is going to have the local values and then it just becomes a little bit tricky if you want to convert those local vales into Global although I think that the uh the local transform I think that one does have a function in order to basically do that mat convert a local transform into Global so yeah essentially that cycle through that component that uh Dynamic buffer and it should be uh quite nice nor only BR s of horr ask uh it's more stry it's more well it's as much horror as some like XCOM I guess which yeah does have some pretty scary zombies but doesn't have any like like in yourr face uh scary flashing things so yeah it's definitely more strategy than horror but yeah I guess it does have zombies so ores is your Fitness going do you see any improvements yeah it's going pretty nice I mean just uh just a while ago I did a really nice challenge where I did a bike ride for 127 km so that was fun I spent like 8 hours on a bike going nice and chill nice and relaxing so yeah that was fun spending an entire day on a bike that was definitely an interesting really really nice one and uh yeah just a while ago I hit my my bench PR of 120 kilos that was fun and just like early this week I was doing 110 kilos and it was pretty easy to do five reps so yeah hopefully hit a new PR uh sometime soon so that should be that should be fun um okay so yeah so on the just read the TDR so again I really recommend you watch uh oh is this oh wow this one has a limit does it yep it does have a limit so I can't post such a long link that's funny that's funny uh uh so yeah really great post on making small games and why you should do it too again that is also very much my advice start small and continue small Ione like it so T what time you have on your personal funds better to make a few games than make no game or making just one giant game so basically if you have X number of years that you have savings spending that time making multiple games gives you more chances at finding success as opposed to just one so that's really awesome and refund rates are not high on Tiny games so if you make something that is only like 4 hours long as long as it's good the refr rate is really going to be the same that's usually one criticism that people have of tiny games which is oh they're going to play it for like two hours four hours they're going to play like half the game refund and so on but turns out most people don't really do that so you can even make a 2hour game as long as it's good then yeah like for example a short hike yeah this is a great example I think this game is like less than two hours long but there you go overwhelming positive view oh wow that is literally 99% positive wow that's insane that is cool uh so yeah definitely and uh yeah people playing for 6 hours 7 hours 4 hours 1 hour 8 hours 3 hours so yeah basically the idea that small games get higher refund rates thankfully that is not really thing so you can definitely make small games and won't uh be a negative impact and yep you won't make your dream game but believe you'll make something better yeah for me this is an interesting one because I don't necessarily have any kind of dream game I've got a ton of different ideas that I very much would like to build but no dream game specifically I actually made a video on that topic yeah I'm making my not dream game on how I don't really have dream game I just have a ton of different ideas that I very much would like to wouldn't like to build so as I as I imagin myself like 70 years from now when I'm 100 I want to look back and be able to see okay I made like 50 games that are all really interesting really different as opposed to oh I just made five masterpieces I guess I don't like the idea of making a ton of stuff as opposed to just a small amount of things this game but tiny such an easy pitch yep that's also like a while ago we were talking about how to come up with ideas and the one% didn't like a short hike that's a good question uh so yeah it's an easy pitch to say it's just like this game but much smaller much more focused so yeah coming up with ideas for small for simple games for small games that can also make it much easier to come up with interesting ideas making small games makes your indie game death life and mental health so much better yep I would say being able to basically finish games much more quickly so it's relatively easy to stay motivated on a single project for like 3 months it's much much harder to stay motivated on just that one project for like 5 years so when it comes to that when it comes to being able to deal with yourself oh yeah gmtk finish mind over magn yeah I I saw that video I haven't or I saw the video on my recommend but I haven't actually seen it but is it actually finished or or or okay so oh November yeah so I'm guessing he's doing a bunch of Polish and yeah this is also one that took him quite a lot when did he uh when did he start this one uh my magnet on SE I think the first one was called your first C game did he do it okay so this was kind of like his prototype when he made the or nope yep that's developing two what's developing one uh did you make it or was it that one okay maybe it was that one anyways it was around around here that was two years ago so yeah he spent over two years so two to three years making a a really interesting puzzle platformer at least he like me personally I'm not it was after the flight Bird video so yeah that was um where is it I'm not seeing flight burn but yeah anyways around this like 2 3 years so yeah I mean in his case he started essentially from zero as far as I know he didn't have any previous uh Game Dev experience so yeah spending two to three years building a complex like this cuz it does look complex even though it's a platform it does have a bunch of interesting mechanics and it made a lot of interesting stuff in terms of well building the entire art himself so that takes quite a while so yeah definitely uh an interesting steamdb doino to see so if we see mine over magnet and let's see how much is it it's on 2,000 so around 20,000 maybe 30,000 wish list so yeah although this one again for all of you watching keep in mind this does not mean puzzle platforms are easy to find success chances are this one will find success because a he has a huge audience and B he's actually been doing a ton of play testing so I'm sure the final game will actually be good because he's been having a ton of people play it and improving on the feedback and doing all those things so he has been iterating a lot so I'm pretty sure the final game will be good in terms of gameplay but if you yourself are making a puzzle platformer I would definitely carefully caution you against that just because puzzle platforms are really difficult so essentially this one is essentially going to be uh the exception that proves the role so making a successful puzzle platform is really difficult this one is likely going to be successful but don't use that as an example of saying okay this one is going to sell uh 10,000 copies so mine can also sell 10,000 copies now that is actually uh quite difficult but uh yeah with uh 20 to 30,000 wish list hopefully the game willon be good hopefully it won't be successful so yeah that will be I'm definitely curious to play it just see it should be uh quite nice soon videos on dos course getting out soon keep up the good work yeah thanks I'm glad you like the videos uh yep I've been researching like for the next uh update I'm going to be covering the animation system and I think I'll also cover a bunch of buildings so I've been looking at my my prototype that I built in order to see all the elements that I made I'm refactoring a bunch of that code in order to make the final uh course code so yeah I'm currently in the process of doing that but yeah in terms of when I'm not too sure I was planning for like the second week of this month but but it's already like the end of this so I'm not sure it's going to be that so maybe around this week maybe something like that so I'm actively working on it so definitely at some point around here it should be fun and see animation uh part so yeah animation is fun to work with so even though it's going to be relatively complex to get animation done uh it should be a fun one so yeah definitely stay tuned for that yeah plan to upload games to the Play Store for mobile if not then why uh well the why is because making mobile games is different from making PC games you've got a different input system like you've got touch instead of mouse and keyboard so that makes it different you've got different screen resolution so basically you can't really just take a uh PC console game and just Port it to mobile and just assume that everything is going to work properly now it does require quite a bit more iteration on that so that's one reason then another reason is mobile is even more difficult than steam like the in terms of uh how crowd it is like on Steam uh you can see Steam developers complain about steam all the time because steam has like 20 20 new games coming out every single day on mobile that is like 200 games so yeah steam is already crowded and mobile is insanely crowded so on mobile essentially if you don't have like an advertising budget it is really difficult to make it so yeah those are usually my two things I don't know too much how to how to do marketing on mobile how to find success with mobile game and in terms of input it requires quite a lot of reworking quite a lot of refactoring so yeah because those things I really just stick stick in my Lane so stick making PC games hopefully console games stick with that uh doing something like that yeah that's about Y6 I've only been using it a little bit but so far seems fine haven't had any crashes everything works pretty fine so yeah it's all really nice although I haven't uh use any of the new graphics features I haven't touched those yet so yeah definitely do want to give those a try but so far it's been Prett pretty nice so yeah M you can talk with Publishers yeah I guess if you have a publisher that does know the market and they can help you actually bring that that game to Market that caned help although of course with a publisher you've got you've got to give an amount to that polisher whether that is a good or bad deal that really depends so as with so many things when it comes to polishers there are good ones bad ones there are ones that can probably be really good and ones that can probably be not very good so yeah finding which one of those again you got to know that world and me personally I really do not know that world so yeah have any materials on inverse kinematics yep I do have the one on animation briging which is the the uh rigging the uh there you go which is Unity to for making um uh ah crap I hate the I'm used to having premium I'm used to not seeing any ads uh yeah so animation riging this is unity's uh package for doing inverse kinematics so you can do a bunch of constraints put a bunch of targets and yeah you can do a bunch of fun stuff and at the end you can make the simple thing so just making a weapon follow any kind of thing so so yep if you want to make some uh animation riging definitely uh go ahead and do that yeah y do has something you would not recommend for beginners and uh yep that is correct I do not recommend for beginners I think dots and ECS is really awesome really cool but but yeah it's definitely an an advanced tool set so uh yeah like here on the on the course page like I said this is not a B level course so dots is an insanely powerful tool I definitely recommend you learn but only once you're in the intermediate or Advanced stage if you're a beginner then do not worry about dots at all just focus on learning the basics with game objects and normal C an example you can follow my beginner kitchen CH course or my C beginner to advance course to learn those Basics to get the intermediate level and then once you get to the intermediate level or if you're there already then yep I highly recommend you learn about dots so essentially when it comes to dots for beginners nope don't worry about it just stick with game objects you can make pretty much any game with game objects so you can do all that and then once you feel comfortable and once you would like to explore a tool that has a lot of really awesome positives at that point then yeah you can start learning about dots and basically get a new tool in your tool bound but for beginners sck with game objects don't worry about dots yeah your water intake a day 4 liters a day uh it's been a while since I counted but yeah it's roughly around 4 lers that I drink per day yeah pretty much that's about it basally I got a mug and that mug fills up with about 300 and this thing is about 750 I think so yeah that plus all the water that I drink at the gym plus all the water that I drink at the middle of the day yeah roughly around 4 lit a day which is a pretty nice amount it's pretty cool it's nice to be it's nice to be hydrated I guess uh bench max it's uh 120 kilos which is pretty heavy it took me quite a while to get to this point so yeah it's quite crazy at the same time to see people like Larry Willams just easily warming up easily warming up with my max bench but yeah it's a it's a fun journey I remember back in the beginning when I started I was doing it with like five kilos on each side of the bar so 510 uh I was benching just 30 kilos and it was pretty heavy and yeah now being able to do 120 that is definitely feels like a nice fun achievement so that could be uh that was nice think about the future of VR is an industry that won't grow should I start in VR or X that is a very good question I think yes I think it it's an industry that will grow but like if you go back like 5 years ago people were expecting VR was going to essentially just flight the the moon when in reality it's been a very slow and steady uptrend so yes it is still growing as far as I know but it's a very slow growth so in the future it won be bigger but it won't necessarily be like 10 times bigger so it w keep growing there is an interest in that personally I'm a big fan of VR and I think both VR and X are I think those are really good although at the same time with apple coming into the um the thing with the Apple Vision Pro which actually made a a can't open it uh with the Apple Vision Pro people thought okay this is going to save a ton of things was see I did one of these uh talked about the Apple Vision Pro don't remember which one but yeah essentially with the Apple Vision prop we're expecting okay this is going to really blow up but in reality nope it did not blow up it just sold a little bit so moved up a little bit but at the same time uh meta is currently working on the meta Quest Pro or uh sorry The Meta Quest 4 and also a new iteration to The Meta Quest Pro so lots of interesting things and yeah definitely is an industry that I do think yeah VR is also used a lot in maintenance for big manufacturer yeah I do think in terms of Industry VR is going to grow more than it does in entertainment I think that is probably going to be the thing in terms of Industry maintenance working with big machines or education sort of things like educating doctors and stuff like that I do think the industry is going to grow quite a bit more in those areas and when it comes to entertainment it's going to be a much slower smaller run so yeah that is roughly my view I do like VR I do think it's great I do think it will continue to grow but we not have an insane uh grow just like that uh incline bench I really don't like incline so I've never really tried out uh my Max on incline so my Max is like I don't know like uh 2030 60 80 so like 80 is like the most that I normally do cuz I really don't like incline just I don't know it's a it's a it's a strange one I don't feel too confident so yeah normal justu uh normal bench yeah hey artam hey how's it going yeah want to learn how to combine different program languages on the same project can you give me an idea of a small project combine C++ C and python I mean for that goal you don't necessarily need any specific project literally any project can be and you can be like you make one mechanic with C normal in unity then you make another mechanic in Python although how do you can you export python into a dlll something like that or can you I guess you can run python directly inside Unity so I guess actually that could be easy then on C++ you could make some kind of uh some kind of liary and important C so yeah I guess you could do that just come up with some idea and just split it into multiple different uh mechanics so yeah flppy bird that could be a good one so maybe make the bird jumping up and down maybe write that code in C for the pipes maybe write those in C++ and then for the UI for calculating the score maybe write that in Python so yeah that could could definitely be a uh fun one yeah should be nice okay let me just uh keep going here yeah this was fun yeah so on the one about start small and say small yeah m is a big fan of making small games as opposed to spending 5 years working on your Masterpiece I believe you'll learn a lot more by making multiple three to six months games than spending years on a single one especially if you are a beginner my advice is don't spend more than six months on your first three to five games make more games make them faster and you will learn a ton very quickly so this actually something that I didn't mention up here which is also the rate of your learning I really do believe you'll learn a lot more by finishing multiple projects as opposed to just making one massive project something that I've said many times is how unintentionally one of the awesome things that I did in my Learning Journey was just spending my five years that I spent making Flash games like in those five years I made 40 flash games so that's 40 40 and yeah I really do think that helped my learning process quite a lot making so many games and making so many games that were very different so it wasn't like 40 games those were wrong like top down Shooters no I made shooter games I made simulation games management games I made racing games I made all kinds of games and I really do believe that building all those games all that gave me a ton of experience which gave me a ton of knowledge so that is another reason why I'm a big fan of this strategy start small and stay small is because by making multiple games you'll learn a lot more than making just one giant game so yeah definitely a big fan of that host are participa in the game Jam Thor just had his uh there are more than a few coming up this month yep yep I definitely would like to host a game gam that is something that has been on my ideas list for many many years but yeah being able to organize game gem is a ton of work so technically yes I would love to but I'm only so busy with so many things so coming up with organizing a massive thing if I want to do I want to do it properly so I would want to properly organize not just say okay here's the game Jam go out do your thing no I would want it to be something quite a bit more properly so yeah eventually yes but don't know when so I guess uh we shall see to make your dot scor free if yes then when I'm planning to make the first few hours of the course free so like if the entire course in the end ends up being I don't know like 30 hours long I do plan to make like the first 10 hours free on YouTube so that is essentially the goal so that is partly why uh on the course itself I focused on on the first few lectures focusing specifically more on the on the court things of dots and the 11 lectures on more spec specific things more specific to this game so that way when I make the free version on YouTube you'll be able to learn a lot about the general things of how dots works so if you want to learn just for free just that one will be more than enough and then if you want to learn about this specific game all those specific uh features you can then pick up the entire thing but yeah you can see here right in the beginning starts with all the setup and so on then learning about not subc baking how that works how to create a component how to set up the the unit how to do a basic system how to work with physics how to get the mosor position how to click to move so click to move somewhere how to convert into job and so on dots physics recast and yeah so basically I made sure in the beginning to include as many different dots things as possible so that even people who just uh follow the free version they can still learn the dot stuff and learn how to use this really awesome tool in their own games because yeah it is a really awesome tool really nice a video covering how to proper destroy objects with dots I'm I mean uh no I don't have any specific video on that although I'm not sure what you mean by properly destroy in theory you just destroy the entity and everything gets destroyed it only becomes slightly complex if you have like parent child relationships but even at that point if you destroy the parent everything should be destroyed so nope don't really have anything specific just because that usually should should be relatively simple depending on what you're doing so yeah that you've got your bearings and thoughts that affect your thoughts on its ideal use case anything harder easier than expected uh well in terms of in terms of my thoughts didn't really change too much I thought dots was awesome whenever you need Extreme Performance and I still think it is awesome whenever you need Extreme Performance so I guess the one thing that changed in my mind was like when they first announced it like five years ago it looked like the best thing was going to be okay just make games either full dots or full game objects whereas now it is very clear no the goal is a hybrid workflow so for some things like for example DUI really don't make UI and dots that really doesn't make much sense so keep building your normal uis just using Game objects but then for things like you've got an RTS you want to control tons of units those units should probably be dots entities if so they benefit quite a bit and once you learn how dots works it is actually not necessarily harder or easier than game objects really just a different way of doing things so so yeah when it comes to ideal use case anytime you need Extreme Performance I think it's a great thing or if you just uh if you just personally really enjoy working on a data oriented design if so then yeah dots is also a really awesome thing so yeah it's really just another tool in your tool belt and I do think it is an excellent tool for a lot of use cases specifically when it comes to Performance so yeah it should be fun if you make a thown shooter yep you just call uh en manager. destroy the entity and there you go it just gets destroyed so yeah usually should be uh pretty much just like that would you make like procedural mesh generation with probuilder like multiple rooms with like one mesh I'm not sure with probuilder well I guess I mean technically with prob Builder you can call the functions so technically I guess you could although that seems like a I don't know probuilder is usually made for actually building the things uh inside the editor and not that necessarily for building things dynamically although again technically you can cuz you can call all the functions but yeah personally I wouldn't really do that if you want to do procedural mesh generation I would really just work with the mesh itself just work with the vertex array and modify those I would use those instead of trying to make it work with probuilder so I don't think that would make things easier I think that would make it more complex but if you want multiple rooms in like one mesh normally when it comes to Pras generation the easier way to do it is make a bunch of prefabs for all your rooms and then instead of dynamically generating those rooms instead of that really just pick a random room then connect another random room then another random room and so on so you're not randomly generating like entire meshes you're just manually generating a bunch of pieces for the prefabs and then just connecting random pieces together and that uh Works quite well so yeah that's usually how I prefer to do that oh it's right the anti antic command buffer yeah if you're uh cycling through entities that is not the if you're trying to destroy an entity that is included within the query you're going to have an error so yeah definitely do use a an anti command buffer in order to do it afterwards yeah recently got hot reload have you tried it nope I'm pretty sure I did buy it I think but nope I haven't tried it yet it's one of the many assets on my list that I very much would like to try because I've heard great things about that one I think that one is even like an official uh like Unity uh what do you call like supported Unity something uh acid unity.com I'm pretty sure it's actually yeah there you go with the popular asset yeah verified Solution that's what I want so yep I've heard great things about it I haven't used it but I have heard great things about it so yeah look at that nominated for the awards fun wow that is that's a big difference nice uh yeah very good so yep I haven't used it but it does look really awesome so yeah try UI tilit or stick to yugui in unity I'm planning to adapt it not sure I have tried it and for example for my C course the the companion project that I built is this I don't even know see. my C course for this one I did make the entire companion project so all this all these custom windows that I made for the uh making the quizzes the exercise the things all this I made in UI tokit and was actually really nice I really enjoyed working with it it was definitely a nice experience definitely much better than using IM GUI for building editor windows so yeah that was definitely much better but when it comes to real time ingame UI for that I'm really just going to stick with un UI this is a big upgrade when compared to I am GUI but I think un Y is really awesome I really like it so I really don't see a reason of changing from that one so yeah for edited tools I will definitely use u toen in the future but for uh normal uh ingame UI I will keep using uni just like that yeah programmer's guide to Art no I haven't seen it that sounds like an interesting topic yeah definitely want to our art nice I haven't seen it yeah I'll add this to my Q thanks for the tip they for me my best uh my best trick when it comes to Art is just buying assets so yeah if I was able to produce something a bit better that would be uh nice um of course I learned that there are some very useful uh packages like s machine Sprite CD input system Etc what basic packages do you recommend to include I mean those are basically the ones that you mentioned so yeah the sprice package I wonder why that one is not installed by default makes me wonder is there any game that does not use the Sprites package that seems very strange cuz even 3D games they have UI elements so I don't know why that one is is is not built into the engine but anyways yeah that's one that I install all the time C Machine yep always and input system yeah whenever it's a more complex project I also use that so yeah other packages I don't know I don't think anything else specifically those are all really awesome ones so yeah beyond that uh TD TD Sprite Yep this one I really don't know what it seems like you always need the Sprite editor window for something but anyways so out of those yeah when it comes to the essentials that's pretty much it first why is this installed by default oh it's used by the universal RP oh I didn't know that that's nice that's fun see C Machine really awesome and yeah when it comes to the general ones that are used for all things and yeah those are basically it I mean I guess if you want to use super fast code maybe in the mathematical Library so you can do things with the job system but that feels like it's a bit more uh of an intense use case uh maybe spines maybe that could be interesting I haven't used it too much but the little that I've used did seem like an interesting one and yeah so for those uh those are indeed the general ones that I would always uh install in6 prevent Found Real Time lighting urp broken when you use it from Custom Sky Box okay I'm not sure because I have not used a custom Sky Box so really is it broken like over here I've got this is Unity 6 but yeah it doesn't have any Uh custom Sky Box so yeah it's not going to have any issues uh but yeah anyways uh so nope I haven't experience that so I'm not uh sure I make people hear about my game on Steam uh the answer is well the answer is marketing so Twitter Reddit Tik Tok YouTube uh literally anywhere you can find anywhere you can tell people about your game that is the answer there is no single bullet there is no one single thing uh it's really just yeah talk about your game as much as possible make some compelling shorts on YouTube some compelling Tik toks and hope that one of them goes viral and gets you a bunch of wish lists and then hope that those wish lists convert which then helps you find success so yeah it's very much a it's very much a case to do a ton of stuff hopefully some of it sticks and then hopefully some of that uh gets you quite a bit of uh success well Unity 6 at this point we're still testing it out right now would say fully in like if I were to start a new project right now I would definitely be using Unity 6 I mean it's probably going to reach LTS version within the next few months so yep and it seems pretty stable I haven't had any issues I've been using it in a bunch of projects and no issues it's fast works fine so yep definitely seems like a uh pretty good one okay so let me just uh yeah so another news so subscribe to your mouse so this was a very strange one so Logitech the company that makes tons of peripherals is apparently thinking about selling a mouse with a subscription service the forever Mouse this was very strange news the idea being that a mouse requires software updates so doesn't yeah I don't know know uh but the hardware does not need to change so in order to support constant development of those software updates they cannot sell something just once so is this premise correct does the mouse require updates since they work by default even without their special software it tells me those updates aren't really required I'll replace my mouse when it stops working I think I've had four different ones in 30 years so in my case I really I do know that uh Logitech they do have their special software thingy uh but but this doesn't feel like it is necessary like it's only necessary for like setting up lights changing DPI and so on so basically with this I installed this just because I have to then set it up to 800 DPI and that's really about it so yeah technically there is software but it doesn't feel like it's a requirement so when I read this news that was my main thing so does a mouse really require software updates it does feel very strange anyways but yeah one interesting tidbit of information that inter for you was when says how only about 50% of people use a mouse and a keyboard today which I guess makes sense given how prevalent touch devices are nowadays but me as someone who use desktop 95% of the time I find that that fascinating so yeah for me I definitely use mouse and keyboard uh all the time so whenever I'm here on my desktop or when I'm on my laptop so yeah for me I do find it fascinating I mean I would assume that it is relatively High the people that don't use it just because uh mobile phones and lap and uh tablets those I've gotten so so much better but still 50% that seems quite crazy like I can't imagine doing any serious work on a touch device at least to me that but I guess not everyone is a programmer so not everyone needs specific typing of things so I guess for more simple just talking about things I guess just such devices work well so but yeah that was definitely a an interesting set on how it's 50% that seems actually uh quite high so when it comes to software we are never going back so Photoshop is a subscription Unity is a subscription office as well but for Hardware especially a mouse I can't imagine people want that so yeah and I think since uh since I wrote this I mean this news came out like last week and since then I think they have posted out a statement saying No this was just an idea we're not actually going to pursue it so thankfully it seems that people weren't really interested in in uh subscribing to their Mouse so yeah thankfully it seems like this one is not going to really happen we don't want software RS either yeah but sadly for that one I think that one uh that one has been settled there are more than enough people paying for it either happily or unhappily so yeah I really don't think that when it comes to software those are going back even if people dislike it like I wish I could just buy Photoshop ones and that's it but nope I don't think that one is going back but yeah thankfully at least when it comes to Hardware hopefully this will really take hold so yeah I use my g915 keyboard G 920s webcam and a Pro Wireless which is kind of funny I it's like it it wasn't necessarily intentional but I did end up with tons of Logitech stuff just just by accident and I really like it so yeah I mean uh these are really good but I definitely would not like having to pay a subscription for it that would definitely be a strange one uh although no matter how much I like it how much I like my setup I can't imagine paying a monthly subscription so this idea sounds very strange to me I also have no interest in an AI powered Mouse with tons of extra lights profiles features that they have nowadays I just set the DPI to 800 to 1,000 HZ Z the RGB and that's really it so yeah when it comes to me really no need for complex software for my mouse as long as it works as a mouse uh it's working perfectly fine for me so yeah this is a definitely quite a strange one yeah [ __ ] is good enough never going to pay yourself for Photoshop nice yeah yeah if uh you find something with a better service model better business model that works then yeah definitely do go for it and yeah it's uh it's definitely awesome to not have to pay 60 bucks a month but yeah for me I got used to photoshop I got used to Premiere so they kind of got me yeah sadly that's uh how it goes what might the use yeah it's the blue yeti which I've had well I've had for literally since the very beginning of this channel so yeah I've had it for uh well I guess since 2013 so I've had it for a very long time and some works it's a nice microphone seems to work pretty well so yeah pretty uh pretty nice one yeah Le the Advan seop course uh they go somewhere in the middle of this month so probably on a Monday so probably yeah probably on here probably on the 19th something like that so yeah that's that's a plan so it should be uh around that use the pendy injection I recently started using zenj dependency injection uh not quite just because when when it comes to Super hardcore testing usually I don't do too much usually I I try to make my my code testable without actually writing tests so since I don't actually write tests I don't necessarily need too much for dependency injection but I definitely do use a ton of interpace in my code so technically if I wanted to do it technically I could do it so yeah I don't really use it but I could use it and uh and yeah zenject if you're doing something uh pretty complex then that using a proper API to do dependency injection that can definitely be a positive thing so yeah that is a a great tool to learn how to use yeah have a few friends that have expressed interest in Game Dev but are starting totally from scratch do you have video series you'd recommend for absolute beginners uh I would say oh man I've got way too many tabs oh if you want to learn about C then my uh free C video or my C course that would be great but if you want specifically about Game Dev uh or beginner I've got my kitchen chaos 10hour course which a lot of people seem to run love so I'll definitely use this love you hey love you too yeah thanks for being here uh so yeah this one a lot of people really enjoyed this video it's probably my most successful video on this channel so yeah uh for beginners this one's really awesome starts from the absolute beginning until making a nice fun game uh so yeah definitely start with those either that one for C specifically or that one for learning how to make a game from start finish yeah guys great nice yeah I'm glad I'm glad people like it hey Ward hey Brazil so what time is it in Brazil I guess minus eight hours 6 hours something like that so I guess like midday yeah yeah what uh said 120 m is having a 10mth free you pay annually but I think uh price for miles is Pro game price uh yes with difference being that I guess after uh one year you still have the mouse whereas with the subscription you paid for one year and after one year if you stop paying you'll lose it so yeah for me I'm a big fan of buying things and then keep using them until they stop working so for this Mouse yeah I'm guessing this mouse is like 100 bucks something like that but I've had it for over a year I think so yeah I guess I've already paid less than 10 bucks a month and still works great and I'm hoping it still work great for like two to three years so yeah that should be uh should be a fun one having a problem where the debugging lines don't match up when debugging attach Unity I try cing the build Del the library cash anything else are you doing something with dots cuz if so that is a known bug how dot says okay there's an error online 128 but it's really online 130 something like that so if you are talking about dots that is a known bug so I don't think there's anything you can do about it you can just look at lines that are nearby instead of looking at just this specific line if you're talking about non dos then I'm not sure what is the thing I I don't think I've ever had issues with like debugging with different lines so so yeah sorry I'm not not sure if it is non dots then yeah if it is dots then yeah it's a it's a known uh issue with it I've had that issue myself where it says happen on some line but it's actually on nearby line so when you have that the solution is really just if it tells you that it's on this line don't take that for granted look above and below and any of those might have the line that has to do with how dots in the background does a ton of source generation and all of that Source generation basically it has to uh hard code in the intermediate compiler it has to hard code line numbers so that it tells you the correct line numbers but apparently sometimes I get messed up so it says here on some line but that's because the source generation messed up and section different line so yeah the only option that I know is really just look on a the similarly related line and hopefully you should find the the issue any advice for Iranian beginner Game Dev uh the advice is the same as for anyone else so really if you want to learn then kitchen chaos course really awesome one so if you are a beginner start that one maybe watch my uh cop course if you want that so yeah those two are really awesome beginner things just depends do you want to make a game or do you want to focus on the language itself both are really great starting point yeah R my $15 keyboard for years now yeah the previous keyboard the one that I had before this one I had it for like I want to say like 15 years something like that cuz I remember that I had that keyboard as a kid and it only died like two years ago a year ago so yeah and it was not an expensive keyboard so yeah I'm guessing I paid for it some like 15 bucks 20 bucks and it's somehow that keyboard survived for literally 15 20 years so yeah it's quite amazing how some things just seem to last quite a lot so yeah it's a nice one part two not course be ready soon I'm currently actively working on it so the answer is yes soon as to when soon I'm not sure perhaps on this week something like that so yeah I'm currently researching writing testing it validating and so on but yeah so around this hopefully should be something like that should be a nice one do you have many Portuguese people in the channel I'm curious how many Portuguese DS are making games I think that would be interesting to see that is a good question I think the answer is like 3% let me look at my analytics uh like audience or geographies uh try moving this one look at that so this for the in last 30 days so us up top with 70k then India Kingdom Turkey Germany Russia and looking at Portugal I'm guessing it's there you go down here so I guess 0.6% so it's a bit less than I thought but still 3,000 people that's quite a lot of people so yeah that's uh uh pretty nice so yeah definitely the uh but it's a nice mix I like that so it's not like there are some channels that are like 90% us I like how this one is quite a bit dogs are getting hungry yeah he's walking around everywhere uh so I like it's a nice mix so us India UK turkey Germany yeah really nice mix of countries and you have Portugal over here on 0.6 yeah pretty fun pretty nice uh right there something a bit of fun so no man's Skai loading system debug so a fun video showing a debug camera moving super fast no man's Skai where you can clearly see their loading system in action and importantly see how fast it is so here is the video so uh someone with loading time smoking mirrors and how in reality this one doesn't actually have that much smoking mirrors like it just moves a camera super fast it is super fast just loading all the all the things there's all those flashes which I think it's actually loading something and you can see how the terrain streams how the level of detail how the trees start coming in so yeah but it's quite insane how in 20 seconds you can go from one one world which is all loaded into memory somehow unload all of that load a completely different world with a complet different biome and somehow do all of that super fast and the whole thing running on a PS5 right here it's definitely quite quite insane the loading system they built for this so yeah it's quite an amazing thing I mean if you try doing this by default you are going to encounter a lot of issues so this is definitely a very amazing thing so very impressive yeah on these don't care much about cutting patterns clean code just trying to make the thing instead of trying to understand how the thing have to be made they will make the Indie dream I mean technically when it comes to code quality technically you can't build anything with bad quality code but but if you write bad quality code the chances of you ever reaching the end of that project are much much smaller as opposed to if you write proper code if you write dirty code you can always build something tiny that's that's not going to be an issue but if you make anything relatively complex like if you were to make no man's Sky if you were to make that without any concern for code quality you would never finish this game you would get to a point where you just get drowned in a ton of complexity you would never reach the end you would get to a point where you can't just add more mechanics you can't just add more things because anytime you add one thing you've got to modify a billion different files and you just get all completely messed up so yeah technically you can make anything work with bad code but the more complex it is the more that becomes a really difficult task so yeah you don't care about clean code and patterns until you experience your own foot gun injury so yeah that has definitely happened to me quite a while I did spend quite a long time not really worrying too much about quality of my code just okay if it works it works and eventually what I was saying was actually happening to me as I was trying to make more and more complex games I was figuring out that at the end of development things were becoming much much more difficult uh to develop like I remember making Survivor squads I remember in the end trying to make the boss fights and all those things how it was such a mess so difficult to do all this AI like if I had a proper code base I could have made all of these uh all these complex systems interactions that would have been much much easier to to make if the code base was actually solid but the whole thing was quite a mess although it wasn't as much a mess as when I tried cuz by the time that I made this game I already had like uh six years of experience making games so yeah I already had a little bit but still the code was definitely not I was definitely not super focused on code quality and that did definitely like Ben said yeah you definitely get your own foot injury you're going to shoot yourself in the foot so yeah I definitely did experience that and since then I definitely gained more and more of an appreciation for how to write good clean code and if you do that that is the only way you can make complex games like I could not have made dinky Guardians if I was not crap I could not have made this game without focusing on code quality this is a very complex game tons of systems all of them interlocking all of them talking to one another I could not have made this game without concern without thinking about code quality if I was Runing dirty code this game would simply never be finished so yep that is why nowadays I'm constantly talking about clean code it's because I did experience what it's like to not worry about it and I did experience these sufferings I did shoot myself in the foot many times so yep that is why nowadays I'm very much like that RTS build space and surface combat yeah I mean making oh is this one playing sound oh crap I hope that doesn't mess up the stream uh so if you want to make a giant game some like total Annihilation an RTS like that you definitely do need to consider loading quite a bit because it is going to be uh quite a challenge just ignore me too that works sorry I'm trying to keep up with all the comments live stream after to use I'm using OBS actually right here on the side there you go look at that Inception uh yeah OBS really awesome free software it's quite it's quite amazing how this is free it's like definitely quite an insane thing such an awesome software so useful so used by so many people and yet it is complet free so yep definitely a big fan of OBS uh it does pretty much everything all the time uh so yeah this really fun video in a few seconds you can easily load and unload multiple completely different planets along with all the levels of detail in all the objects and if you pay close attention you can naturally see some popping so loading is fast but not instant and the grass rain detail of that rendering showing up but in normal gameplay it just looks beautifully perfectly smooth so yeah if you really pay attention frame by frame you can see terrain popping out look at those objects disappearing the terrain slowly fading away look that a different level of detail for the terrain mask that one showing up and as it zooms in yep you can see it starts to show the clouds then shs to show some terrain then terrain merging into another terrain then different level of detail then start showing all the particles and so on so yeah so if you look at it you can see things streaming in and out of existence but yeah in normal gameplay you really don't see it just because it is so insanely fast and looks really awesome look at that going to another different one loading all the things and Yep looks perfect insanely fast insanely performant that is definitely quite an amazing one so yeah always learn I was love learning about tricks for how developers had loading 20 years ago it was all about long elevator r yeah it's kind of funny how this is kind of thing how I can write this over here and I wonder how many people know what I'm referring to because nowadays yeah for a few years now well I guess I guess the god of war game which came out in 2018 did have some tight spaces to hide the loading so that probably hasn't necessarily fully uh vanished but yeah I do wonder how many people remember long elevator rides because yeah those used to be all the way back in the early 2000 because it did take some time to load a complete different level so yeah the best way is really just making a long elit ride add some dialogue and you can easily unload something load something else and looks really awesome but yeah nowadays we just need a tiny bit of smoke and perhaps one day things might be so fast we might not need to hide any loading at all so yeah chat sharp that's a that's a funny name yep portal to always those elevators really nice really cool yeah how do you come up with a game name that is a very tricky question because yeah coming up with a good game name is indeed quite a tricky thing uh so yeah that is one thing that you definitely have to Workshop it look at uh similar game uh look at games similar to yours to get some ideas maybe ask AI to brainstorm a bunch of uh game name ideas so yeah basically anything can work as a game but some things like for example change together that is a great name it's a very clear uh name it very clearly describes what the game is all about and it wasn't taken so yeah just by itself a really great game her truck simulator I like uh really descriptive names so seven days die that is fun but yeah if you try going for something super complex super unique like fields of mystera I don't know what that is but apparently it does have a th000 reviews so apparently it is a positive one but yeah if you try going for hey Min solers that was fun looks like that factory game with thing nice just 27 reviews oh interesting looks nice uh so yeah coming up with a name is always an interesting challenge it's always uh it's always a fun one yeah the name should generally describe the core concept or the idea yep especially for in developers if you try going too unique that is going to be tricky so usually for in developers going a bit more generic a bit more X simulator that is usually a better way as opposed to coming up with a really unique name that nobody's going to know how to pronounce so yep about to learn how to create a 2d turn based strategy is Unity good way to go yep sure I mean pretty much any engine nowadays is great for making any game so unity and Realo all of those are capable of making uh 2D turnbas strategy game so yep personally I love unity but yep use whatever and all of those are really good to work for making that kind of game yeah do a copy of Gun Mayhem implementing enemies that shoot and move through the platforms is doable and how much time without experience I'm not sure what is Gun Mayhem interesting shooting game is it an iio game okay so like a sid scrolling shoot them up game okay but is it multiplayer or with AI enemies making this in single player relatively easy making it multiplayer a bit more complex uh but implementing AI that shoot and move through the platforms is doable in how much time without experience I mean if you literally mean no experience then it is going to be a bit of a challenge uh because you do need to learn quite a lot of things uh so yeah how much time I don't know 3 months it really depends on what you mean by without experience it is not based on the screenshots cuz I I'm not familiar with the game but a s scrolling shoot them up it is is not necessarily super complex but if you have zero experience then even making something like flightboard is going to be relatively complex so yeah maybe a few months but yeah definitely a a by looking at the screenshots definitely a doable project so yeah sounds like a a fun nice uh start project yeah P physics is Stu any ideas for how to do that mechanic for Port the big issue is not necessarily the physics that part should actually not be too difficult so you just have to see okay when this Cube or this sphere goes inside the portal just spawn it on the other place and apply the correct opposing physics the issue with uh making a portal game the bigger issue is with rendering like you have a portal and you have to render like half a cube over here and then on the other portal you have to run the other half of the cube so that is really tricky yeah Sebastian lag pretty sure he does have a video on that so yeah if you're if you're going that approach portal here pretty sure I remember seeing yeah this one yeah that's exactly it so yeah handling the visuals that is a really tricky thing because you have to render essentially two objects so yeah that part becomes really tricky very very complex very quickly yeah being able to move between the portals and being able to see the correct perspective from the correct angles then being able to move an object from here to there and so so yeah portal is one of those things that sounds relatively simple in theory it's really just a hole connect to another hole but in reality it's a lot more complex so yeah it's definitely one of those deceptively simple looking games that is actually very complex which by itself means that it is a great uh game mechanic to work as a sord challenge look at that that's fun nice take a look at ninja remix on Steam and suggest some Chang as we do let's see Ninja remix okay the particles look nice they look interesting the levels seem a bit oh Master unique Jus oh that that sounds like a a fun concept build your Clan with diverse ninjas and dive into multiplayer PVP battles or progress through the story all set to a cool Funk beat I have no idea what is a funk beat but I don't have a right now so I'm hoping it sounds nice uh but yeah I like the particles the particles do look really cool and the hand signs those also look really cool nice yeah basically how to make a Naruto game without Naruto IP uh so yeah I mean without sound just looking at the trailer it does seem nice I would only say that the visuals over here seem a bit too basic like this area seems way too empty so like I really like the particles but it's seems like the area is may be way too basic but the particles look good so maybe that can actually and I do like that one about the player being pushed upwards I think it makes it very clear what the game is about so in terms of mechanics I actually think it's really awesome I think maybe the visuals just need a little bit of a Polish over here but but I don't know that's just a minor nitpick so in general just looking at the visuals it does uh seem pretty nice and the particles and the screenshots uh I guess you could maybe have a little bit of variety cuz like these three screenshots all look pretty much exactly the same so there's a character doing something on top of grass so I guess I guess I would spend some time building some different biomes yeah the grass looks too even yeah it looks like this has literally the same height at all points so maybe that is why it looks so basic because yeah because the grass all looks just one uniform thing as opposed to having I don't know some flowers here and there something like that so yeah I would build a different biome one on like Desert Snow something like that yeah having some hills or different height and yeah this screenshot is a bit strange I'm guessing it's showing this character but yeah um remix I really like this image that is nice for game more strategy creativity and bit of nonchalance can make you a legend stepping into ninja remix build your Clan mess your Jus and claim your place at the top this is single player and PVP nice make hand sign called jutus that sounds nice yeah I do like the idea of mixing hand signs like one of my favorite games growing up was Magicka so the idea of Magicka plus ninjas I'm already interested in it so yeah that sounds nice creat your clan that's a nice screenshot that is cool me could be animated but just by itself looks pretty cool and G oh look at that you've got an interesting uh little biome over here why don't you have one of those screenshots kind of like this biome being standing on rocks like this reminds of like a DBZ screenshot something like that so that could be cool man ninika that would be nice yeah uh Community Driven epic yeah that sounds uh nice so hly in general I do think it is pretty good I do think the the uh capsule image definitely does require something uh I would say this definitely looks way too basic so I would hire an artist something like that to make a proper capsule because the capsule does mean quite a lot it matters a ton and this capsule does look extremely basic like like essentially this looks like something that I would do me with zero art skills that's basically what I would do just pick up uh an image of the character pick up the Logo put some blurry thing on the background I would do so that's what I would do but I'm not an artist so that that means not necessarily very good so I'll definitely hire a proper artist to make a proper capsule and yeah in terms of the uh description over here sounds nice sounds cool uh me personally as someone who likes ninjas Naruto yeah that is cool so yeah then I would modify a few of those things but in general pretty nice yeah now let me see cdb doino let me see Ninja remix so this one has 12 followers so about 100 wish list so yeah definitely do those changes and then start doing some marketing start posting some gifts on Twitter uh something like that cuz I do think the cream D jutus that is an interesting one so if you come up with an interesting title and make an interesting uh gift showing a bunch of images like a mini fight and someone I do think that could do well on Twitter Reddit maybe even on Tik Tok and something like that so yeah that could be that's what I would try to try to get a bit more visibility wish list and so on but yeah so far it looks really cool so yeah uh congrats on that yeah nice hit Subs but a lot of users want for mobile yeah yeah for this kind of game yeah it's uh yeah I guess some of those W one for PC so yeah it's always it's always tricky to get that like I'm making a PC game but people are ask for mobile but it's not really possible and so on so yeah but yeah I would say you're on the uh right path so yeah definitely do keep going cuz yeah that looks quite nice look at Castle yards step into the role of medieval Lord in Castle yard a captivating Castle Management game where your strategic decisions shape the fate of your realm manage resources train Knights and navigate the intricate politics of your court to lead your people to Prosperity okay that sounds like an interesting uh thing although it seems like the trailer is way too slow so in like 25 seconds we've seen just basally two images so isn't like a text Adventure sort of thing that does make it a bit hard to make a more compelling uh trailer so you got a bunch of resources then you go out side so you manage a bunch of things okay we got a nice jousting mini game that's fun nice but yeah the beginning is definitely way too slow again I'm I don't have sound so I don't know like I don't have headphones right now so I can hear but yeah does seem like so it takes like 10 seconds there you go 10 11 12 13 14 so almost 20 seconds before we see something a little bit different like in the beginning yeah it does look like a visual novel which I guess but is it cuz on this uh description I see it more as like a Castle Management game so like uh I don't know Kingdom kingdoms and castles so I'm imagining something top down managing a castle building things and so on whereas yeah the trailer definitely gives the vibe of being much more of a visual novel so so I would say definitely trailer seems a bit too a bit too slow for the screenshots sure they all look nice they have nice variety I would just say the over here this one seems a bit too basic so I would maybe add some icons over here for each of these so come up with an icon so it's not just text on a Col background have some kind of icon to make it a little bit more interesting so I would probably do that to make this pop out a little bit more uh for the font looks nice and the background art that does look nice and yeah icons help with localization too yeah that's also a very good tip very nice how will you roll the font is a little bit hard to read but it does match with the theme so I don't think that's necessarily uh B thing s r of medieval Lord and Castle yard an immersive RPG management game where you strategic decisions shape the fate of your castle and realm man resources train Knights and navigate the intricate politics of your court to lead your people to Prosperity yeah that's uh that is a uh nice one your choice matter you've got indepth management and exciting tournaments so got nice little J boom there goes little uh Shield um so yeah although over here I would say you need to add some kind of bone letters some kind of uh okay you got Bonet points but I definitely add some bone letters over here at some point just because the text is too too bland basically just being like this just being normal text I'll definitely put some things like the cleard in bold or adjusting tournaments in bold something like that so I would add a little bit of uh different hey prer games hey how's it going uh so I definitely add that to make a little bit more different uh but yeah the images the gifts I do like those so yeah and the the thing over here I think maybe the text is a bit too small I do like how it is like really under the castle and he couldn't really increase the size of the castle without hiding the rest of this so I do think the background image is nice although the text does seem a bit hard to read a bit too tiny so very beautiful image but yeah definitely having uh being a little bit hard to so maybe I would experiment with that maybe experiment with some Shadows some thickness something like that but in general the image behind it is definitely definitely awesome so it could be a bit larger if you move it a little bit down here yeah maybe little bit like that uh could be an interesting one miss our important Saturday stream was on vacation yeah that's cool I I hope you enjoyed your vacation nice yeah yeah the definitely best of luck with uh the game Gary spell weer it or this one I guess in terms of visuals it does seem quite nice point and click puzzle game oh I got to say I'm not good with I'm not good at point point and clicks uh start with six based elements and combine them together oh so it's kind of like that crafting game something like that oh is this I don't know if this is messes up the stream or not so let me just put that if I put it in full screen I think it's going to mess up a bunch of things new game Heather buttons to spawn elements coning elements cost points drag and drop elements to combine them lock new elements on recycling bin or trash to clear them trash Lo point recycles funds most of them try unlock so right away my advice would be okay this seems like way too much text so I would definitely split this into parts and I would be like okay when I interact with this part teach me what this does then after a while teach me what this does then after a while teach me what this does instead of uh a prewall of text I would say uh yeah show don't tell definitely uh spawn them okay so if I and is the tool tip meant to be that big I'm guessing this this is some kind of issue possibly an issue with being in full screen or not or maybe I guess just the thing like that um oh you just click on it and then you mix them together where are their spiders am I supposed to kill the spiders I pick up their blood we got some water some water and crystals makes a sapphire apparently and burn Sapphire what does it do doesn't do anything so burn some dark thing and create smoke then smoke in air does do something nope doesn't do anything uh oh wasn't I supposed to see smoke up here uh so Dark Crystal with a spider can I merge with the spider no I can't okay the spider is eating my stuff let's make it dark Crystal amethyst that's nice amethyst and Earth does it do anything nope doesn't do anything yeah I supposed to get a bunch of things added up there uh we've got Earth and light makes the crystals light and Fire doesn't do anything oh it does a ruby nice there you go why why do some of them get out of the pier and some don't I'm not sure I understand that one and what are the the uh I guess they give you spell points something like that so I made clouds can I make rain clouds yeah I can make rain and what do they do do with rain going to Earth nope can't do anything with Earth and rain so about Earth and light does that give me nope I want to make like plants or something so let me burn some Mak lava okay that's fun and lava plus air doesn't do anything okay so let me make a cloud of lava nope so take lava and let's burn a ruby nope what can I do with lava let's burn something nope lav in more fire I guess yeah doesn't do anything okay some more Earth on lava nope we got rain oh how about if I take lava and add some water okay got some clouds rain and Ruby nope okay some dark dark fire that already try that okay make Smoke Smoke and Things nope yeah cuz some of them recycle the entire board oh it just takes out all of those gives me some kind of thing I can destroy elements I can see hints Earth with Crystal oh that's nice I do like having a nice hint system so I can make an emerald dark with lava didn't I try that and didn't work oh obsidian nice can I mix two gems no catalog so all the recipes W 16 out of 400 uh oh it's scrolling up and down so this would be nice to have some kind of uh bar just to be able to see okay have I scroll down enough am I not okay not sure but yeah I do like the the uh the uh hint system just because I always suck so let me try putting fire and water makes alcohol really Fire and Water okay I guess uh an Earth with dark what is that going to do it's going to make some Stones nice only had two weeks of making yeah I mean this is really awesome for for two weeks or even more than two weeks uh it does does have quite a lot of content I mean with 400 recipes I'm guessing you'd def find all of these things using scripal objects and all the recipes using scripal objects so it's really one of those games that is very content heavy trying to do quite a lot of things fire water yeah uh so yeah I'm guessing this one of those games that the mechanics themselves I'm guessing you probably made those relatively quickly but then trying to work quite a lot at building all the recipes all the possible combinations make them in a way that makes sense makes interesting but yeah it's definitely definitely a a fun interesting game so yeah congrats on building this for the for the uh uh game Jam did this get like uh submission page so did it finish already I don't know the uh so like does it have a score yeah a bunch of people really liked it extremely well made for game Jam yeah really awesome yeah that is definitely judging is still going on oh okay nice all right but yeah definitely looks like a good one I have no idea what the what the theme was what was the theme the uh theme shadows and anemy okay so yeah definitely does make sense so it does indeed match up with the theme so yeah nice yeah yeah I I hope the voting does well it's cool find recipes in Google Sheets and Export to Json then automated script objects using ASD Creator now that is awesome that is a really cool uh usage of uh external tools and then building your own tools to help you develop your game that is definitely really awesome so yeah yeah congrats it does look like a really nice game especially for being built in two weeks that is definitely really cool so yeah congrats on the game really nice um okay so yeah song rating oh wow it's almost seven oh I didn't know it was so late so yeah my dogs are walking around as you can probably hear so yeah uh going to go and do something and so on by the way for those of you who are channel members I do the oh um uh I got the oh that's what I didn't even know what I was looking for but yeah for those who are channel members I do have the the uh live streams every Saturday so I'll be doing that tomorrow so if you do then check the uh members Discord and you'll find the link for the live stream for tomorrow so yeah basically I've been doing those consistently and I do hope to be able to do some more uh of these public live streams uh in the future uh so yeah should be fun should be interesting and yeah if you're interested in seeing up to date definitely check out the Game Dev report I should put uh publish another one on Sunday I've been pushing that out so yeah if you want to read the news definitely look into that sign up and yeah it's a fun way to stay up to dat start new Project Unity and found the fastest version is 2019.4 wow really that is pretty old I would say 2019.4 isn't even efficiently supported so I would definitely use something a bit later but yeah I mean I guess if that one is the fastest version I guess depends on what you're doing I would not release a game on that version just because it seems like it's way too old that's like 5 years old now so that might have issues with compatibility but you could definitely build the entire game like that and then one month before release then upgrade to the LTS version and be pretty nice so yeah roughly that's what I would do okay um oh there's some all right okay so oh yeah and if you want speed then using the hot reload asset that can definitely help out quite a little bit uh okay so let me put this like that and so on and it should be fun let me pop this back how do I pop this back there you go like that uh all right so yeah thank you all for being here and I hope you have a great rest of your day weekend and if you remember then I will see you all tomorrow all right so yeah have a great rest of your day and I'll see you next time all right bye everyone for
