hello and welcome I'm your code monkeying and after you started a second free expansion to my turnbased strategy course it's all about taking the game built in the course and any support for multiple floors with this addition you can make much more complex levels with some interesting vertical layouts this was the second most request stopped by students the first free expansion is already out and that one was on adding hex grids this second multiforms expansion works on both grid types so you can add it to either square or hexes in these nine lectures we will refactor a bunch of code to support not just one but multiple grid systems at different televisions thanks to the quality of the code this change is actually pretty simple the more complex part is on handling the pathfinding but even that is just a basic refactor we're going to modify to enable the units to move between the grids but we also don't want to make the move in any position so we're going to hand on creating some pathfinding links and we're even going to make a nice and simple editor script to make those links easier to create then we're going to handle the visuals make it so that we can add whatever visual we want when the unit is going up or down now I'm not an animator so I went with a Super Bass music jump and drop but you could very easily replace it with a proper leather clamp animation without changing any of the code and finally we're going to set up some visible logic so we can zoom in the camera and have the object size themselves so we can still play with all the folders underneath with all that we're going to have another really awesome feature added to this already awesome turnbased strategy game and once again thanks to how all the code in the course is written in a nice clean way this is going to be a super easy addition just like the hex suspension we don't need to touch the AI the visual studio detection system or anything like that because all the code is really clean with as few dependencies as possible this Edition doesn't really require changing many files so this expansion is yet another great example of the power of writing good clean code now if you're already on the course then this is a free expansion so you already have access to it it's at the end of all the lectures right after the hex expansion and if you don't yet on the course you can get it to the link in the description it's a really awesome course that will help you take your skills from beginner to Advanced reviews have been extremely positive so I'm really happy with how it came out throughout the home course I'm constantly talking about writing good clean code and focusing on keeping a good code architecture because of that the final state of the course is very adaptable and easily Expendable so don't let me know what other mechanics and systems you'd like to see in future expansions alright so I hope you enjoy this second free expansion thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
