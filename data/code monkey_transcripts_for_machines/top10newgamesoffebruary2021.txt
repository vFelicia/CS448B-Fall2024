hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for february 2021 my going with these videos is to highlight what can be done with the engine so you know the only limit is really just your own imagination all of these games are uniquely impressive and showcase the power of the engine in tons of different scenarios so this list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also there's links in the description for the games those are affiliate links so if you use them it's the same for icu and you'll also be supporting the channel alright so let's go starting off at number 10 here is rustler this one was actually being promoted under a slightly different name it was named grand theft horse i'm guessing they changed it to avoid potential copyright issues but that name says everything about what this game tries to do think grand theft auto but in a different world that's definitely a very appealing concept they lean into the absurdity of the concept with lots of pop culture references crazy characters and silly quests so you can ride horses use medieval weapons escape the medieval cops fighting tournaments and so on visually it doesn't look very good it features a topdown perspective with some really good looking assets and lighting effects as i said it's a really compelling concept however the reviews are barely hanging on between mixed and mostly positive but the game is in early access so i really hope they managed to build upon this base and improve it it does have a free demo if you want to try it out next up we have fights in tight spaces this is a really stylish action deck building turnbased fighting game right away you see a very unique look the player character and the enemies are easily identifiable you have to position yourself correctly and use the right moves you have at your disposal customize your deck with all kinds of cards and actions you can take select the ones you want and upgrade them as you go along features daily challenges and leaderboards for you to try to beat also i love the name it's really very descriptive i've had my eye on this one for a while i quite like the concept of a turnbased melee combat game with cards and the visuals are perfect for standing out in today's world i'm thinking i might pick this one up as my next game design lessons video i haven't played a card game in a long time so i'm interested in learning more about the genre by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks then for something a bit more chill here is tastemaker restaurant simulator as the name implies you manage a restaurant start with a small empty plot of land and start building a simple restaurant then as you make more cash you can buy more land to expand and grow your restaurant you can create a custom menu to offer to your guests just make sure you pick the right dishes at the right price or you won't suffer the consequences your guests also want more than just food so make sure you decorate your restaurant accordingly and of course hygiene is of the utmost importance if you don't clean up then rats may appear which will definitely make your guests very unhappy it's getting great reviews so if you're looking for a management game on a tight scale then check this one out then for some vr here is revolver 3 it's a really great name it's a single and multiplayer game staged in a robotic version of the wild west socialize with friends in the saloon play some minigames and participate in death matches against other players or some bots play russian roulette or play shoot the bottle it features simple controls easy to pick up and play encourages a ton of movement crouching and taking cover it's got short actionpacked matches in different levels and of course constantly reload your revolver meet up with your friends find new ones or play solo in this fascinating robot western world and at number 6 we have hellish quartz this one is really interesting it's a physics based realistic sword fighting dueling game set in the 17th century the focus is really on physically accurate actions the swords actually clash using physics and the characters move using super realistic motion captured fencing techniques all the damage is calculated based on where the sword actually lands to win you must use proper timing measure technique speed and widths just like fencing in the real world the characters also look great lots of physically accurate clothes and hair swaying around it really is a very unique concept and based on the overwhelmingly positive number of reviews then it seems like it's very well executed i'd love to try this one out just to see how they implemented all these controls if you're looking for some mysterious story then here is nuts visually you can tell right away it has a very striking look flat collars with some nice outlines you definitely can't mistake this game for something else it's a single player surveillance mystery game so your goal is to place down cameras record the squirrels and see what they're up to then over time you uncover a mystery and find out what is really going on in the forest if you're a fan of story based games similar to the likes of firewatch then this seems like an interesting new one next up at number 4 we have hot brass now if you've seen my gamedev journey video then you know that for my very first steam game i actually wanted to make a swat type of game in the end my skills at the time weren't good enough so i went with a zombie theme instead but i'm still a huge fan of this theme and this looks like a great new entry in the genre it's got some high quality realistic visuals combined with simple icons for the characters your focus is on arresting bad guys and saving lives it really emphasizes tactics while being played in real time gear up with all kinds of equipment like flashbangs night vision tasers breaching charges and more choose your point of entry and master each mission from hostage rescue missions to arresting a gang boss or stopping a casino heist remember that you are swat your goal is to save lives so always think before you shoot features local and online play where you can play with up to 4 friends or give it a try being solo if you're looking for some survival strategy then over here is b castle it's all about building and defending your castle in this fantastical world build up during the day gather some resources construct defenses and train your army then at night the moon warriors come out and it's time to defend and survive the night if you manage to survive then you have to expand your castle and defenses to ensure you survive the next one it's got great visuals and lighting effects that really emphasize the day and night times it's a simple concept but based on the number of very positive reviews it seems like it's very well made then for something that just came out after a successful year in early access here is the curse of the dead gods you seek untold riches eternal life and divine powers it leads you into this cursed temple which is a seemingly infinite labyrinth of bottomless pits deadly traps and monsters it's a skill roguelike where you explore a cruel temple and search for treasure use weapons the environment your brains and skills in order to defeat the temple unique curses influence each attempt putting a twist on every run you can use light and fire in order to fight the shadows features dozens of enemies and deadly bosses to challenge all of your skills as i said this one had a successful one year in early access and based on the reviews it has done very well and finally at number one here is my personal pick for this month you might have guessed this one it's valheim this is a viking inspired open world game focused on free exploration and emerging gameplay it features survival crafting mechanics set in a procedurally generated world fight through this world alone or play with up to 10 friends and conquer valhalla together you are dropped off on this brand new world and begin harvesting simple resources and fighting small enemies then you craft some better tools continue gathering more resources and explore the world until you find the perfect spot for your very first base the game features a robust building system it's adaptable to any terrain so you can build anywhere place down some walls put up a ceiling make a nice fire and sleep through the night visually the game has a very unique look it blends modern techniques with some low resolution textures the lighting effects make it look gorgeous and combined with the pixelated textures really gives it a unique look you can definitely spend a ton of time just enjoying the sights either from a mountain or relaxing sailing in the sea if you're into survival crafting open world exploration games then this is an excellent new entry in the genre i said you might have heard of it because in just 4 weeks in early access they already blew past 4 million sales so this is yet another massive success and it's made with unity i already made a game design analysis on this game go check that out if you want to learn why this game is so successful alright so there you
