hello and welcome I'm your code monkey hello and welcome you know what I'm tired of programming I'm tired of making games let's do something different hello and welcome I'm your C Monkey and this is now cooking channel we're going to make a very simple very tasty meal so I've got a bunch of chicken breast right here then two sweet potatoes an onion some salt and some herbs so first wash the potatoes then slice them with a nice knife cut the onion in half and then into tiny pieces heat up the pan with a little bit of olive oil and throw some chicken on there then season it with some salt or whatever else you want flip them over after a while then throw the potatoes in the onion just keep it moving around and finally throw it on the plate and there it is a nice and nutritious tasty meal and of course eat something as well all right that was delicious although a bit of a problem I really only know how to cook about three or four things so probably not enough to make an entire YouTube channel huh let's try something else all right so this is now a car review Channel I've got a Renault Cleo from 2017 it's a manual 1.5 with 110 horsepower and with a gtline trim interior it's a preenter car but it's pretty fun all right this is now a running Channel running is actually the simplest sa size of all you don't really need any equipment or anything at all just go out the door and start running super simple just take it slow at the start don't overdo it basally just start by running a couple hundred M then run a 1K 5K 10K eventually a half marathon and finally full Marathon one of the things that I love about running is how it's pretty much on autopilot so once you start running you just keep running it's all super simple so personally for me I love to listen the tons of podcast while running and 2 hours really just flies by all right this is now an Electronics channel so over here I've got an Arduino and I've got a Raspberry Pi with these two you can really build pretty much anything you can imagine if you want you can make something like a simple light switch or you can make a pull on theonomous robot now one question that a lot of people have is what exactly is the difference between these two well the Arduino this one is actually a microcontroller whereas the Raspberry Pi this is basically a full on computer so the Arduino has a bunch of pins that you can control with some simple code and the pi has a complete operating system so it's got a connection to connect all kinds of USB all kinds of ethernet ports you can connect HDMI mini USB you can connect some audio tons of stuff although like I said you can build literally anything you want with either of them really but in general you want nardino for simple cases like simple control simple servos and simple sensors and you want a raspberry piie for anything that involves some kind of really complex logic all right so this is now a do train Channel and training dog is actually quite simple all you need is two things you need a dog and you need some treats all right so this is now a reading channel so here are five books that I highly recommend starting off with code complete this is a really awesome really detailed code book look at this really super thick reading through this entire thing and absolutely learning it that one massively improved my quality of my code so if you're a programmer I highly recommend it next up we have the daily stoic it's a really great book to read every single day basically there's a single passage for each day so is really all about focusing on things you can control and not worrying about things you can control I read one page every single day in the morning it's a great way to get the brain set up next here is the Dragon Ball Manga now this is a classic it's really a 10 out of 10 look at that it's really awesome really perfect so it's really super cool that's really it really awesome really cool next up is the millionaire fast lane I've read a bunch of Entrepreneurship books and this definitely my favorite one it is really great for learning a different mindset if you're interested in becoming something of an entrepreneur and finally How to Win Friends and Influence People this is one where the title sounds a bit nefarious but it's really a very positive book it's all about learning to listen to others and focus on others more than you do on yourself so have five books I highly recommend all right so this is now a fitness channel lifting is actually pretty much a video game it's pretty much just an RPG basically by every rep you make you gain a little bit of experience so it's really that simple you just keep repping out rep after rep and eventually after a while you gain enough experience and you'll level up then you pick up something heavier and just keep grinding out more exp the best thing is how there's no level cap so you can just keep grinding out keep leveling up until the end of your life all right this is now a weather report channel so as you can see Lisbon has a maximum of 15Â° and it's actually going to be quite rainy then up towards PTO it's a little bit colder definitely make sure you wear a jacket and down towards Al also quite a bit cool all right this is now a figurines channel so starting off with a really awesome mini Goku and mini Frieza really just the Classic figurines both of them look really awesome then here is a really impressive Vegeta standing very tall very strong extreme amounts of detail in the hair all the muscles and everything really perfect and then here we have a Super Saiyan 4 Goku I got to say Super Saiyan 4 is one of my favorite designs look at that it's really so awesome even if you're one of the people who's not a fan of GT you have to admit this is one of the coolest designs ever then for something different here's a little tiny NOS yet now that really awesome character design looks really cool or here is a super cool ringoku it's quite amazing how a character can have such a little time on screen become a favorite for pretty much anyone and not really figurines but here are some pretty nice Lambos so here's a really nice Huracan and a really nice Aventador wait a minute what day is it today oh well that makes a lot of sense sense
