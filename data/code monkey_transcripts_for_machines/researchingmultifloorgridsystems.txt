foreign foreign foreign hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here all right all right great all right hey everyone okay let me set this up all right so basically the goal here is lately I've been working on a free expansion to my turnbased strategy course trying to add multilevel support and right now I'm still in the research phase and the one thing that I need to research right now is basically how am I going to handle the pathfinding links for the various Wars as well as how to handle the visibility so that's pretty much my my going for this live stream I need to do this research so I might as well do it live so all right thank you for being here and let's get to it and I'll try to answer as many questions as I can all right okay so first of all just trying it out and yep okay so here is the game pretty basic and basically I implemented can I hide that one okay apparently I hide though uh yeah so I basically just implemented some nice links so this character can go up to the second floor or down to the first one really great all right except the issue right now is that the link is pretty much fixed so that's the first thing that I want to handle I want to be able to but why was that one invisible did I modify that all right I I was testing out the former visibility right that's that's why so let me actually disable this for now I'll work on the visibility afterwards for now I don't want that for now I first just want to handle the pathfinding links so and then when I click I can go up and there you go jumps up and he jumps down okay great uh all right so the first thing that I want is to handle the pathfinding links and for that for some learning to make multiplayer oh that's awesome hey I'm glad you're enjoying it yeah multiplayer used to be so tricky but nowadays thanks to all these awesome tools multiplayer is super easy nowadays well as easy as can be that's it multiplayer is always it's always tricking but thanks to the tools now it is much easier all right watching your videos for I don't know how many years now oh nice thank you thanks for being here for so long but until you're awesome ah thank you hey I'm glad you liked the videos I hope the videos have been very helpful in those so many years all right okay hey and a custom character hey chillies hey nice thanks uh okay right so let me first of all remember how I was handling the pathfinding links so where's my script uh here it is and I had yeah right I made the pathfinding links where I've got the a b and I just made it manually right yep exactly pretty much I got a list of pathfinding links and I just manually created them okay so now I would want uh some way to show this in the editor so let me actually I gotta make it serializable right yeah but let's make first a easy sharp script for the path finding link and call it mono Behavior so that it shows up as a component so that's like ultimate character controller uh personally I normally stick with simpler assets so I prefer assets that do just one tiny thing and do it very well so I'm not necessarily personally I don't really tend to use super complex character controllers that do a billion things but that's just me that really depends some people really like having some premade things with tons and tons of features so if you're like that then by all means go ahead and use it so it pretty much depends on do you like doing things from scrunch or do you need something extremely Advanced because if you do something extremely Advanced that is going to take you several months to build then yeah picking up a readymade tool will definitely helps so yeah basically the answer is depends on you maybe for you it's great or maybe it might be best to build it from scratch so sorry but yeah there's no objective answer uh right so if you're here let me make a serialized film of type pathfinding link for the path training link and I need to mark this as serializable so serialize the bone all right and just with this if there's a screen yeah nice thanks for answering yeah of course uh go to gym yeah of course I love it uh all right so let me try making a simple empty game object for ah crap I press Ctrl P instead of shift p uh for a path finding link and let me add the pathfinding not this one not this one the mono Behavior okay uh oh right is it because it's the it's got grid positions oh right so I need to make the grid position serializable as well all right that's interesting or actually no uh okay that's an interesting question hmm be careful this in dark mode sorry no I can't dark mode burns my eyes if I look at it for more than a second my eyes start to bleed so sorry nope can't do it um right so the issue here is I would like to make a editor tool in order to be able to visualize the grid position links except should I be using great positions I probably shouldn't so you know let me actually modify this so instead of having a puffing link I think I should probably have effective three for the link position a another one for line position B so have this instead of that one and yep now I got two Vector Threes And basically now I'm going to position them okay so this might be best and then I convert those into grid positions and hopefully that should work but okay all right so let's try this and then maybe I will see perhaps the great position works best so anyways just researching so start with this and then we'll see okay so now the thing is I gotta refer to my own tutorial in order to remember how do I add the position handles and apparently I have to use unseen GUI and then use handles.position handle all right so let's try this out but does this have to be in an editor script that's my question private on scene GUI does this one only exist in the editor this is going to throw an error I'm not sure yeah actually editor tools one of those things that haven't really worked with it too much yeah isn't that good considered best solution for a multiplayer I mean what about Photon mirror I've only used netcode so I can only say that one is great depending on the types of games that you want to make but from what I've heard pretty much all of them are excellent so yeah I would say oh why am I playing the game there's no need to play uh yeah pretty much all of those Tunes are excellent nowadays so just pick whatever you want okay so for this one to work I think it does need to so really oh nice awesome hey that's awesome it's actually it's a it's not insanely difficult but it is a very nice challenge yeah working on this expansion has been quite fun uh okay so I think I need an editor and inside I'm going to need the pathfinding mono Behavior editor script and I think like this it should work I just need to make sure using Unity editor and now I need to once again go rewatch my script that's a goal yeah is this course free the turnbased strategy course no that one is paid although I did make a a free tutorial on the first version on the Prototype that I made so if you'd like to see the original prototype that I made before making the entire course you can see that and you can download the project files for that one but yeah the phone stepbystep course that one is a regular paid course uh okay so uh right so I need to watch my own video to remember how do you do the custom editors I don't remember the syntax in the beginning oh is it on the on drug gizmos no I don't think so that's where the jawline that's not what I want nope uh what's the name ah there you go all right so I've got to extend editor and do custom editors all right so let's see syntax that I was looking for so make this of type editor and let's use the not this custom editor of type of and the type is the path finding link mono Behavior all right yep I think it's like this and now I think I should be able to do on scene GUI now this one debug.log if I do a log now I should be able to see the log stripy and Trigger path oh nice that was a fun system yeah it's actually something that is surprisingly easy to do so that's fun yeah I like this and yep there you go got the Unseen okay great uh all right so let me uh okay so I had the Onsen GUI and really the only thing that I needed was yep that's that's the thing the himmel dot position himmel and then I just need to be able to get all right let's see Target okay so let me try to figure out how this works so first of all I grab the Target and the target this is a type object so I'm going to convert this into a path finding link mono Behavior so that's this guy and now with this one I should be able to go is it himmels dot position handle and this one takes a position and a rotation so the position is going to be the pathfinding length Model Behavior Dot uh position a what did I call it all right because uh yeah for editor tools I probably should make these private instead of public just so I can access them from there so over here for the link position a puttering dot identity okay so in theory that should show that one let's see so trying to mess with it from when the multiplayer expansion won't drop uh I don't know I've started researching research I've started writing the beginning parts of it and I've done quite a lot of research so I really just need to handle the length and the visibility then I still gotta write a lot of things so hopefully before the end this month that's pretty much as far as I can say so perhaps in two weeks something like that that's the hope uh okay right so now I do have a second position handle and now I just need to see all right that's the thing I need to do a begin change check this one gives me the new position so effective three this is going to be the new link position a and I need to do what is an editor GUI in order to do a begin change check and then editor GUI dot end change check and this one returns in Boolean if something changes so if something changes let me go into the Pathfinder link Model Behavior the link position a and set it to the new link position a all right I think that's really it do I need to serialize the object I'm not sure specific reason not to use VAR instead of phone class name personally just because I don't like VAR I think I find that VAR tends to obscure the code more than helps so personally I don't really like it I like being extremely explicit but there's nothing inherently wrong with it so if you don't like it then yep by all means go ahead and use it so yeah personally I don't like it but that's just personal preference uh all right okay so this working I can modify this position handle and it shows down so that's great now the one thing is I would like to know how to hide the default pathfinding link position the default game object because that one is pretty useless so I'll have to do some research on how to hide that one but at least this one is working so then I just need to do uh can I do the same thing for the second one so for the pathfinding link position B uh and then I put the B on the new B like this I should be able to change both of them except for that one to move I just need that one to be offset in order to be able to move it and I can move it so now I can put a link over there and put this link roughly over there so I know the Y needs to be on three and then I can position a rough like that so this one is on 6 3 14. 6 something and 12. and there you go okay that's the links all right so that's great only from when yeah all right hi thanks for being here all right instead of calling handle why not use an interface I'm not sure what you mean by that what interface does the editor use I'm not sure can convert the URL to MP3 but doesn't seem to work in YouTube links uh I have no idea I mean YouTube links when you access YouTube link it doesn't actually give you a video so you have to somehow seek through the video in order to download on the bytes yeah I don't know for for dealing with HTTP requests I've only done things where I grabbed the entire thing right away so things that have to do with streaming yeah for that sorry I have no idea how down would be handled that is quite tricky uh okay right so okay so that's pretty much all that I need in order to get the editor working hey Desmond says hi hi Desmond uh all right so now that I have this working the next question is how do I put the pathfinding links and I think perhaps a good way is when we go into oh let me actually make a nice function so a public going to return a pathfinding link no not the editor it's not the one that I want the amount of behavior so this one doesn't need the answer going so this one at finding link get pathfinding link and this one going to return going to create a new Pathfinder link and the grid position a level Grid dot instance dot get the grid position on the link position a so I do this same thing for the grid position B and yep that's pretty much it so this Returns the Pathfinder link must stream slightly cool yeah I'm definitely trying to do them a bit more whenever I have to do some research I might as well do it live and try to answer some questions do some things so it's always a bit more fun rather than working alone all the time it's a bit of a different hey greetings from India nice there's links you're making for stairs and such yep these links can be whatever you want so it can be stairs and letters something like that pretty much just connects a position on a grid position on Circle 4 to another position then visually that can be whatever you want to be yeah a good way to deal with an after image what do you mean by after image so I'm only thinking about Dragon Ball where you got like and after image where they move really quickly so that would be more of a visual effect so something using the VFX ref so I'm not sure what you mean by that an after image with a permanent mesh I guess maybe you could duplicate a mesh is that what you mean definitely get a mesh and make it kind of like a transparent like the character Trails behind when moving fast yeah I guess that would be one way to do it as the character is moving around you pretty much just copy the mesh you instantiate a new mesh using that mesh data I assume you're working with a skin mesh render and I believe you can work with the with the skin measure and the vertices so yeah I guess that would be it make a simple full timer so every x amount of seconds it just copies the mesh and just creates that mesh on that position as the as the skin mesh really continues going so pretty much just instantiate the brand new fix mesh yeah that would be a funny fact that sounds interesting um uh okay what was I doing uh right so I've got the editor okay so I've got the pathfinding link Model Behavior and basically I just need to let me go into the pathfinding and I think the best way is Let's Make a transform and call it pathfinding link container something like this so then I'm going to go pathfinding link list pathfinding light not the container pathfinding link list annual list okay then for each for each transform pathfinding link transform in the pathfliner link container I cycle through all the children then the pathfinding link transform in order to get the component or try and get components that's probably for the best out of path finding link mono Behavior so out on the final link Model Behavior so I try to do a trigger component on that then I take the pathfinding link mono behavior and I get the pathfinding link and go into the pathfinding link list in order to add this new one and that way I no longer need anything like that all right great okay so this should actually be working very well already now I can easily create all kinds of links okay you keep yourself up to date with new ENT features Yeah by trying I try to read their blog keep up to date with all the news watch various Unity YouTube channels do all kinds of things so yeah I try to keep up to date and of course I got uh contact with the UNT team itself so every time they do something new a lot of times they send me updates directly so yep I try to keep up to date as much as possible mentioning a project with 100 devs who is trying to do that that is definitely tricky yeah that is a whole nother skill set how do you manage a massive team with tons of people doing all kinds of things that is definitely one skill set that I do not have so yeah if you're trying to do that best of luck uh okay so let's make one link there and another one in there so let's put this one on position one and let me make it quite a bit smaller so on the size of four okay let's put a link there and another one there so for that all right I need to make an empty game object for the pathfind thing ah crap I can't write link container let's reset this and now inside I put on the pathway link so I got this one and I'm going to have another one in there and in there so on zero and zero okay so now I've got the super funny links so the character should be able to jump right through here or through here and everything should work okay so my team why is burning while watching oh sorry but the same thing happened to me with dark mode dark mode really burns my eye so that is why I cannot use it uh and obviously as usual I forgot to drag a reference that always happens so let me just drag the container reference and try it out again all right see what GDC conferences yeah so there were I watched a bunch of the unity ones but yeah there are I actually do have a GDC pass with access to the GDC volt so yeah I I've been trying to find the time but hopefully when I do find Tom I can watch some of those awesome talks and look at that it did work right so some of you might not know the importance of what just happened but let me tell you it is quite amazing yeah so essentially I've managed to create pathfinding links let me actually add because I got I keep testing this one with uh where did I add the the things I don't even know yeah the action points let me put it on 10 just so I don't have to test quite a lot all right because yeah this is actually quite amazing so I can take this character and I can jump up to the second floor I can go through here and I can jump down or jump up through this one so yep I've got a nice connection between both of them let's create some more links just to verify that yep everything is indeed working perfectly so where's the pivot on this one let me go down and say yep I want to make another link on that one so put this one on 10 let me duplicate this wall put another one on this 25 and stretch it out a little bit all right so let me just make another pathfinding link and this one I'm gonna fall in there and go up roughly around there so let me put the position so this one's on 8 and 25. oh did I catch it in the middle or no maybe not yeah I think it's 24 yeah I think this one might be a little bit too big it's okay uh 24 and on 10. so on this one let me just yeah this one apparently should be a tiny bit smaller is it 9.5 I don't know I guess we shouldn't see it let's test all right give us a link a little graphic at least yeah sure I mean I'm only working on the on the uh functionality of it right now hey and look at that it does work so I can go and now I can jump down through that one and yeah there you go so basically just working on getting the functionality working and yep then obviously you would put some kind of ladder in here instead of the instead of the animation being just a falling down animation you'd have a proper leather climb animation and so on but yep all the logic is indeed working all right great next version of your great tutorial on your site seems like it's missing a step around when you add the TMP debug prefab uh it's been a while since I wrote that so yeah okay sure thanks for the tip on I'll keep that in mind let me write a note here all right I'll keep that in mind thanks okay how'd you make it so each person is watching the video has their character on screen well that's a simple connection with the YouTube API I've got a bunch of tutorials related to that so on this page it's the page where you can customize your character but on the bottom over here I also got links to various tutorials that I made so a tutorials for how I made this transparent DNT window another one for how I made the mesh based animations then how I made an HTTP request from Unity so that's how I'm contacting the YouTube API in order to get the messages and finally these characters these are the ones that I use in my game Battle Royal Tycoon so that's pretty much how I made that okay all right so here I created the links and all of them work so adding new links to this level is super easy just need to add them over here and everything works perfectly all right great you're awesome hey you too nice um right so let me think what else was I trying to do so I got the links right now okay right so another thing that I want is just to make sure that everything does work let me make yet another four so let me duplicate the floor put it up on 6.001 just so there's no is that fighting I'll even put it something like this so on 3 31 about 31 32. uh is that it always a bit confused I don't remember when I made the what is the origin right it needs to be on an odd number so yeah this one's actually on 31 I think 31.5 either way just a visual I'll worry about that in a bit so like this okay so pretty much got a second floor there let me just add some more walls so put them on nine enough six all right another one over there so minus minus 1.5 yep something like this and definitely get this one put it on six all right so I got a nice third floor and let's also put a wall just so it makes a bit more sense as to how the character is jumping so perhaps on 25 something like that okay let's put it like this just playing around the visuals a little bit all right okay great I think going on dots and ECS uh I think the plan is selling to hit 1.0 by the time that that the LTS version comes out which should be sometime soon I hope they said a few weeks in in um GDC which was quite a while ago so yeah I'm guessing the LTS version should be around anytime now and when it happens yep I think dots 1.0 should be coming out so yep as far as I know everything that is on the plan so it's only works as far as I know it's not a Bend or anything like that all right so so I don't know I need to do is go into my level Grid and instead of being two floors let's put and say this more or less threefourths and for the link let me make another link and this one lets it connect from there and go up go up on two four six I think let me go and just make sure yep so on 4 24 4 26. all right so got another link so I should be able to go up there so let's see all right okay so let me pick this one up and I can jump onto this link that's great and if there you go I can go there and I can go into this link and I can go into the third form all right that's pretty awesome all right yeah this has been a a fun thing to work on being able to add multiple fours really increase the amount of level complexity that you can build so that is really nice no kitchen chaos mobile controls come uh the answer is whenever I have time that's that's the answer to so many of my projects yep it's definitely on my list so I don't know when but hopefully soon all right okay so the multifloors did work all right that's great now the next thing that I want to research is how am I going to handle the visibility that is tricky so if you don't have the wall there uh without the wall is just a vision so if I hide this one the link is still there so all that matters is that there's a pathfinding link between these two positions so that's pretty much the only thing that matters so while we're in a wall that's just a visual so you could add a proper uh leather over here you could add a proper leather animation so pretty much just the main thing that I'm working on is just making sure that the logic works and yep then it's up to you up to anyone who wants to implement any kind of visuals on top so it can be whatever you want can be a basic jump animation that's that's what I'm using here just because I don't know how to make animations so yeah that is why over here I just made a super basic animation just jumping up falling down but this animation can be whatever you want so yep so when it comes to climbing Leathers jumping falling down that's really just a visual so it's very easy to add the visuals on top of the logic attention I'm logic so much Ah that's awesome I'm glad the videos have been helpful to you give them jet packs yep you can definitely you could definitely apply some jetpack logic some flying logic pretty much all of that is possible yeah show what it looks like without the wall yeah the wall doesn't doesn't matter so if I disable this one the one object is no longer there but yep it can still go because the link is there so the link is commonly separate from the wall so it has nothing to do with any visuals so I can go and it doesn't have any more action points ah crap now they're going to shoot me oh boy they're gonna take 10 10 steps all right but yeah the wall is just visual so yeah uh okay right so the other thing that I want to research is how am I going to handle the visibility because the issue is there's a floor down here except when I'm up here it's really hard to work with this one so I got to figure out some way of hiding these visuals as the camera Zooms in and zooms out so let's see that all right not a cartoon monkey nope I'm a regular human just like you uh okay right so for that one I was thinking about some kind of floor visibility script that says what floor it is and then in order to either show or hide this one so probably void show in order to make these basic Shore height functions I'm going to work with the game object renders so one just shows one just hides yeah right just the renderer right yeah so yeah the thing that I need to remember is how was I handling the the camera that was tricking one of the few YouTubers you can understand without subtitles so really wow that's awesome sometimes I'm a bit selfconscious about my weird accent but hey if you can understand that's awesome I'm glad you I'm glad you can understand it yeah uh right curiosity do you plan to do tutorial on how to make Rhythm games one day that's a very Niche genre so yeah I don't know about that I definitely enjoy playing them I used to enjoy what was it called Step Mania that was it right yeah that was a really awesome game I was really addicted to that for quite a while so yeah it was that many yeah really awesome so yeah I was really addicted to this playing just with my fingers instead of with the feet but yeah this was really awesome so yeah Rhythm games they are fun but yeah covering them in the tutorial I'm not sure that's a a bit way too Niche that's the thing about YouTube whenever I dedicate some time to a video and the videos always say quite a lot of time several hours so if I'm going to make something I need to I need to choose things that might do well although sometimes I can definitely afford to do some videos that doesn't don't get that many views just for fun but yeah who knows maybe one day I'll uncover that genre I mean if I had infinite time I would love to cover pretty much every genre in existence but yeah suddenly I don't have a time machine so yeah I wish that were possible but not really uh right 2D uh the issue yeah the issue is that unity's nav mesh component that is really made just for 3D so yeah if you're working on 2D nav meshes then really my advice to you is to use the astar path finding finding so that's my advice pretty much is get the astar pathfinding asset which actually only they do have the astar pathfinding project they actually do have a free version that's pretty much how I started when I was first of reverse Bay yeah when I was first working on my first steam game Survivor Squad and obviously I had no money so when I started I was actually using the free version and I only upgraded to the pro version just when I had pretty much the game commonly done so yeah if you're working in 2D pathfinding I would highly encourage you to look into either this one or some other pathfinding solution because yeah as far as I know unity's navmesh really is not built for pathfinding I think they do have uh I think there are some extras that make it support 2D but yeah for the most part yeah I would recommend something like this instead of trying to get down to work uh uh okay so for shooting and hiding basically I just need to remember how was I handling the camera because I don't remember that how did I handle the camera was the camera controller perhaps uh right because this one has the zoom the zoom Target follow offset yep that's what I'm using right yep okay right so I need to access the camera so let me make a public static camera controller for the instance where they get any private set and let's make your prize wide awake and on the way except the instance of this and now I'm going to need a function uh uh float let's say get camera height and I'm going to return the target file offset.y okay so this and now on this one let me go into the camera controller access the instance in order to get the camera height so let's see float for the camera height and now basically on this one I need to Define how am I going to show it but it can't be based just on the floor height yeah because the camera is under no if it is hmm uh because I got what do I do do I do well let me just do a debug download just to see what the camera height doesn't like and then see about other engines compared to Unity I think nowadays as developers we are really spawned for choice because pretty much every single engine is excellent so yeah personally I love unity I keep using Unity because it's an excellent engine can do anything that I want to do but thankfully nowadays pretty much all the engines are great so pretty much just pick one and start learning it okay why is this not updating or is it zoomed up okay it's it was zoomed in uh right so essentially uh yeah do I do it plus one so when it's on four I want to hide these visuals is that what I'm going to do uh uh all right okay so let's define a float for the show height and basically I'm going to show if the camera height it is bigger than what's going to level Grid and get the four Heights plus some offsets is that what I do yeah I think yeah float for the uh for height offset something like this so won't show height if that one is above that one so if you'll hide then I'm going to show and if not then I'm going to hide okay all right so let's try it out and see if this works position on a 3D pathfinding solution oh that's what do you mean by 3D do you mean like grids like voxel grids or 3D terrain because rain is essentially flat the question is do you have positions above other or other positions because terrain we're just going up then essentially you just need a a flat pathfinding solution so that one pretty much anything works I mean either way I would always recommend the Acer pathwaying project I was telling you about that a while ago so either way that's the main one that I would recommend for pathfinding for super simple things yeah sure I would use uh unity's builtin navmesh but for anything more complex for pathfinding that's pretty much what I would do Rhythm games are more than just DDR equipment yeah I yeah beat saber is definitely some that I love I spend a lot of time so yeah it's another one those things where if I had a time machine I would love to be able to have infinite time in order to spend some time researching VR and yep I'd love to make some kind of beat saber clone to really see how it works so yeah that's another one of those things that is permanently on my todo list and hopefully one day I should I will hopefully be able to get it someday maybe uh okay so if I go in if there go at some point that one disappears all right okay so I think yeah pretty much just play around the offset but at least the logic is right there so now the question is do I apply this yeah I think that's kind of the issues that I have to manually apply this component to every single object yeah that's the that's the only downside of this I think now that I need to manually add this to every single one so I paste component as new so all of these are on the first floor this one is also on the first floor and now this one up here this one is going to be on the second floor now let me copy this component and on this one this one in this one these are also on the second floor right oh did I add to this one already no that one you don't have a two let me remove this one that one is on two that one is also on two why did I add to this one oh then I add to the base one okay that I don't work oh right because I split down I think anyways all right so yeah the components are a bit on it's a bit manual but let's see if this works all right so time to learn how to juggle with a pen well I learned that like 15 years ago that is why I pretty much just know two tricks but yeah that's not something that I've learned recently integrate manager that holds on four references yep definitely right now I'm just focused on trying to get it working and then I'll worry about making it performing but yep so far so here is the third floor and as I zoom in and all right because this one's on the second floor but is that one okay that one should be hiding but it's not hiding let me put the scene view side by side or to be able to see what is happening yeah why is that one not yeah they all vanish at once why did I not put it on too I did put oh never mind I didn't multiply it right so the four height times the what did I quality for and pause the offset okay that is why the second one wasn't working all right tried using UI token I've done some research on it and it does seem uh it was already very stable very much production ready when I first saw it when I first saw when I last saw it which was several months ago so yeah by now I would say that one is probably very close to production ready so yeah I won't that's another one of those things as soon as I have the time yep I definitely want to make a tutorial in order to figure out how it actually works okay so I think I should increase the think about a little bit otherwise it's a bit too hard but yeah only four height offset let's put it on 2f and I just need to on the camera controller also make it zoom out by a little bit more so instead of tovaf let's put it 15f okay programming is so interesting yes it is that's why I love it it's a neverending challenge you can do anything you can build anything as long as you have the skills for it anything goes that is really awesome had a chance to play Tears against them yet nope I did go ahead and pick it up actually got it here got a nice where's my camera yeah nice so yeah when to pick up the copy earlier this morning but yeah still trying to get a bunch of work done so that I can then go play a little bit so yeah hopefully in a little bit after this live stream yep that's the plan try to do it see what it does I really love playing breath of wild so yeah this year was my my switch was essentially dead because I hadn't uh I mean the last time I used it was when was it yeah Pokemon let's go Pikachu was that the one which wasn't like three years ago yeah that was the last time that I used my switch so yeah pretty much just played breath one Mario and that Pokemon game yeah so so yeah because that my switch was essentially dead I was trying to get it alive while ago and yep in a little bit I want to go play uh right so yep the visibility isn't it working so I can see everything happening on the third floor I can zoom in in order to see everything happening on this one and zoom down and I see everything happening on this one all right that's pretty great you see making an RPG game is worth it nowadays sure I mean RPG means a ton of things so yeah it really depends on what you mean by that but in general yep RPG can definitely still be I mean depends on your target platform it really depends on what you mean but yeah there are plenty of very successful RPGs if you ask about Platformers then at that point I would say probably not because that's really difficult but RPGs RPGs usually kind of like a subgenre or like a secondary genre so yeah you can apply RPG mechanics to tons of other genres so yeah video on how you quickly navigate around visual script yeah or not visual script visual studio uh yeah I thought about making a video on the most used shortcuts but yeah for the most part uh actually most things aren't really Visual Studio like just move instead of moving the cursor one one character at a time you press Ctrl and it goes by the entire word so this alone is super useful so that and shift that is really useful for selecting a bunch of things then just knowing you how to select and and so on then I've got a an extension which actually helps me move the cursor up and down by about five lines so this is really good for quickly moving up or quick one moving down then what else being able to have control Dash in order to open up something else so path finding and there you go I can open up the pathfinding script then what else control tab in order to swap between them uh you can do control RR in order to rename things so yeah I definitely would like to do a video on a bunch of those shortcuts because yeah learning how to use your IDE properly that definitely helps you in your uh and becoming a lot more efficient so yeah that's definitely something quite uh quite useful to know all right uh this become an update for turnbased strategy course yep that's exactly it so I'm pretty much just researching in order to be able to do the next free course expansion so yep the engine is good for selfexpression system create for independent developers yeah I mean it's amazing that you can do pretty much anything with unity and with any game engine that is actually quite amazing do you have any thoughts on Visual Studio versus jetbrains uh I don't know I don't have any I've heard great things about chat brings writer but personally I haven't tried it because simply because I mean uh Visual Studio already does everything that I want to do so that is why I pretty much have no reason to try to switch because I mean pretty much is I just use the IDE mostly just for writing code I don't use any special features or abilities or something like that so yeah for the most part I've only used Visual Studio but I have heard great things from writer so if you don't like it then yep go ahead and use it okay dude those guys walking on the motor party screen that's just interaction with the YouTube API so if you go on to this page down here at the bottom I've got the various tutorials where I cover the various things so it's a transparent TNT window the characters are some mesh based animation and they're just interacting with YouTube API with an HTTP request that's pretty much it uh all right so honestly these two tasks were pretty much the only things that I want to do for this live stream so I guess I could see yeah I guess I could see okay so what is the best way for me to handle this see that's actually an interesting question with regards to uh performance is this a concern or not how long actually let's oh why don't I try finding out let's open up the analysis the profiler and let me put on the Deep profile to make it so instead of making them invisible you just lower that opacity uh for that basically you would need to work with the with the material and actually I was thinking of not doing that because it's a bit too complicated but honestly it might not be as complicated and let me just see if I can easily access yeah that's the issue because this one doesn't take that one into account yeah that's a problem basically the way you do it would be by modifying the alpha but yeah this Shader that that I use over here this Shader does not support changing the alpha so that is kind of the issue basically the way you do it you wouldn't lure the alpha in order to make it a lot more transparent but yeah if this one does not support the iPhone because yeah it doesn't so suddenly yeah that makes it quite a bit more tricky yeah oh it's super chat name thank you thanks so much thermal vibration or using a tune sound Shader with the latest couple with the latest couple LTS after a bigger project I keep getting GPU Timeout on a 40 series GPU timeout what do you mean by that when doing uh light map baking is that it I mean that's going to depend on how big is your world but yeah yeah I'm using the the uh there's the asset store oh actually I got it or no because I didn't yeah I didn't make a thing on it but yeah I'm using quimly or squiggly quickly so yep that's the asset then I was using pregrade stylized Shader so if you want to make things nice and size then this Shader is pretty great has tons of options so yeah and if you're having issues with yeah GPU timeout swap chain yeah I'm pretty sure I've seen that error that's annoying uh but yeah if the issues with like baking then the answer is start off on the lowest settings possible and then slowly increase them pretty much otherwise I'm not sure what you mean by GPU timeout can you please explain the gaps between unity and real I mean those are different engines gaps I don't know I don't know enough about unreal to know what it lacks I know that Unity is a bit behind on the super highend things CNT is currently working on some pretty amazing the uh what what did I call the Adaptive Pro volumes so they're working on a not crap they're working on something to essentially compete with Lumen and this one does seem quite impressive so yeah that's that would be one gap which is how unreal already has Lumen whereas Unity is only beginning to work on it but at least the things that they are working it does seem quite impressive there was a gift with everything working in action right here on this one you can play around yeah you can do a bunch of things so yeah this one is Stone development but it looks really great yeah I can't wait for this signal to come out to to the um to urp right now it's already available on the egrp but for me I use Erp for the most part so that is why oh that's super chat thank you uh with flat kid heavy GPU swap chain air with uplines okay I'm not sure I've never seen that error I mean it will have some workload depending on how many objects how many outlines you're adding but yeah with the flat kit yeah I haven't used that one but as far as I know that one is supposed to also be pretty good isn't it yeah it's this one yeah I haven't used this one I've only used quimly and pixelizer and a bunch of others so I haven't used this one specifically but I would assume they have some optimizations in order to make it work on just uh on just one dracon so yeah I'm not sure I've never used it so yeah I don't know if it has any issues with heavy work mode Unity repent and crashes yeah that's on because this one has tons of positive reviews so I don't know maybe try contacting the developer I don't know something like that um Okay so all right so I was thinking so should I upgrade this or not because I like the all right that's what I was doing I forgot to get a bit distracted for a while but yeah essentially I wanted to open up the analysis the profiler in order to enable the profile let's not record and let's head on play hey good morning uh uh let's just start playing all right let me select this one and let's now hit on record yeah right now they shouldn't oh crap something went wrong or did I pause oh I just like it once all right so I pick one and uh that's the thing does this have yeah it does have a search okay good so I was trying to see okay how am I going to find my script just in case this one isn't too intense because right away I'm looking at times in milliseconds right away it does not seem to be intense at all but let's see so the four visibility yeah it is literally taking 0.0 so yeah so this kind of I guess this is a good example as to when should you worry about updating something and when you shouldn't because basically this script this script that I wrote here this one is technically it's technically not very performant because running this script on every update on every single object that has one of those components attached so supposedly this isn't super performant but at the same time as you can see it is literally taking 0.00 milliseconds so whilst technically this isn't very performant well secondly you could definitely optimize this as you can see if it is on 0.0 then probably there's no reason why you should waste time optimizing so yeah uh all right so let me actually open up something else since this one was actually easier than I thought let me actually go into the ugc project in order to see a bunch of things want to learn in real engine can I suggest some coursework no sorry I only know about Unity so yeah this is the wrong channel to ask about in real stuff uh right but how would you optimize it I mean you would basically have just one manager component where it would cycle through all of them and pretty much you would only grab the camera height once it would only do the calculations for the floor height ones you would only call the show if it was actually hidden it would only come to hide if it was shown so yeah there are plenty plenty of ways to pretty much optimize this to make sure that all of these things don't run tons and tons of times and only run as many times as needed so yeah tons of things you could do to really improve upon this so much oh crap let's uh open up the project on the other one send one video on how to connect Dynamic utilities like the conveyor belts Dynamic utility I mean the issue with that is that it's a very specific thing meaning that it's very specific to a specific game so making something generic about how to connect a power system to a conveyor belt system yeah that's kind of the issue that's always that's one of the problems with making tutorials is how do I make it appealing to not just one type of person but many people how do I make it useful to several people so yeah that's a that's the tricky part but yeah for the most part it's really you just got a list of items and you somehow interact with that list by doing something like having power consumers and Power emitters something like that so yeah that's a it's a fun system to make I definitely enjoyed making it but yeah making a tutorial on that is quite a bit tricky to manage to get the modding stuff working yep I didn't uh the main thing that was missing was just the how do I unload the the things showing how to build connections between the nodes I mean for the most part that is really just a list of no day node B each node has a position and then visually you draw a list so you draw a line between them so the visual part or the in logic part is around just a list and the visual part can be whatever you want so yeah it's a trying to figure out a nice way to present that in a tutorial that is a bit of the tricky part um yeah sure so I was working on the on the modding and it did work quite well so basically end up the main issue was with the with the meshes and now I don't remember how I was doing it right uh uh yeah because I don't like this yeah so I got the save and then I got the load and it does actually work right yeah I come into this one out hey good morning um Yeah so basically the way that I made work was by using I try to look into how it was possible to unload an uh obj at runtime and the only way that I could find was using a free the obj Importer what was it called yeah I think it was this one it was right uh yeah right it was this one so yeah apparently Unity does not have a builtin way of working but apparently with that asset I can essentially take a path for some kind of mesh obj data and I can take down I can load it import it convert it into a mesh then on that mesh I can grab the mesh status so the versus triangles and UVS and then with that mesh data I can convert that into Json then that Json I convert them to bytes so obviously this is not the most uh optimized way of doing it but it does work convert that into a bytes and save the whole thing so basically on my demo here so let me actually stop this one or this one and on this one it actually did work hey once again thanks for the super chant sorry I couldn't be more helpful but yeah try to contact the dev that is probably the best thing you can do um right so here if I go what about materials and shaders and stuff uh basically for this type of mudding I'm just using textures so there you go open up and here I have a nice little uh what was it a battery right yeah so I added this battery component and it worked perfectly basically just got the battery and then I've got the texture and I pretty much just take both those and I convert those into this my mod file or not this one this one byte save so this is pretty much the mod file so just 1.7 megabytes which contains this contains the recipe that's on and so on so yeah this actually worked out pretty well so the ugc uh research did go quite well uh yep it does simplify quite a bit so this is actually quite good all right so yeah the ugc video hopefully that should be out soon I still need to talk with the ugc ugc team in order to figure out if it does work and yeah for the turn based strategy This research was actually quite helpful so I did manage to do that now I just need to write some notes in order to start writing the lectures for the course and then the free update should be out sometime before the end of this month but yeah this was quite fun hey thanks for the Super Chat blender to UNT portal is great experimental with this experiment there's a package blender to Unity what is the blender TNT portal blender to Unity portal is that a thing or are you just saying about about importing things Oh you mean it exports directly from blender into Unity right but for modding basically what I need is I need a a file and you have an okay so yeah yeah basically for modding I just need a separate file just to have the mesh data that I need to dynamically be able to unload that file in order to create the mod so that other people can load that so yeah that's the tricky part is making it work without having blender or any kind of 3D modeling in the mix all right can we see your dog when you're done working I mean they're asleep so I don't think so but yeah I gotta I gotta figure out a way to have multiple cameras and yeah then I could point one at them and that would be a fun second live stream camera uh all right so yeah so over here the multiform wars expansion it is working quite well even though yeah the uh yeah in terms of performance adding a third level really does make it quite a bit slower yeah that's kind of the issue so perhaps it won't be a third expansion perhaps working on some performance improvements because yeah on this one yeah you can see a little a little sluggish whenever the character moves a different grid position it definitely slows down by quite a bit and that's just basically because over here look at all these game objects of the grid system visual yeah this really should be a mesh so yeah definitely need to figure out how to optimize that quite a bit but yeah the logic for having multiple fours isn't it working so here I have a third form I can even zoom in zoom out oh right I need to sort that out oh that's actually a good question I guess so I put them on the characters themselves because I can take this character and I can go all the way over there right so I can move oh on the floor I also need to okay all right so okay trying to think how do I handle this because then I use a mesh render let me actually so I thought this one was yeah I guess right I need the renderer so I think this one is actually already should already be working so if I take the unit inside I take the character not the character but the uh actual skin mesh render and over here I add the other one so what did I add what did I called I don't remember the name D4 visibility so ah crap where's the the floor visibility okay let me just update this just to make another one so bull Dynamic for position all right new super chant oh hey thanks again it's called Mish sync Works vice versa in real time so that's for what let's say blender mesh sink oh it's a yinty thing wow that looks interesting synchronizing meshes and models wait so you can edit it inside Unity oh I guess it goes both ways is that the thing create a server and connects to it okay that seems interesting okay yeah I have no I have no experience with or I don't have much experience with blender 3D modeling those kinds of things so yeah I can't tell exactly what is impressive but yep it doesn't look great to be able to essentially animate and be able to see all the key points all of them positioned perfectly yeah that does sound quite interesting nice okay KD 3 might be handy here yep in order to handle that visibility but actually the issue is not quite so much with finding the things to show and hide the issue is basically that right now on the grid positions on the floor all of them are instantiated so that is why that is the thing that takes the most amount of time is that it actually has like a thousand individual game objects of them being shown hidden and so on it's personal to somehow open the file manager in unity and get it to work in the exportable uh maybe you can work with the uh with the windows API maybe if you work with that directly it might be able to work but yeah I'm not entirely sure usually for a file manager inside your game you really have to build it yourself so you have to use the regular csharp things in order to grab the folders grab the files and show them somewhere in the game but technically using the the windows API might work so that's pretty much the same thing as how I create the characters down here so the transparency window overlay this one works by interacting directly with the windows API so yeah yes that's what it where I would try to see how that works so you've turned the link transforms into Vector 3 points on a singling the issue isn't the link transforms it's with the the line Transformers they're not causing any issues the issue with the Slowdown is run just the the visuals because all of these visuals they are all individual game objects so as I select all of these these are all individual game objects and that is obviously very costly to have thousands of these so as I got three forwards I essentially got can I enable them yeah I can show them out once but yeah pretty much all these positions up here let me see where's this one yeah there you go that position is in there in there and so on look at all of these tons and tons of them so this one for example which is on a place where it doesn't even exist but all right let's see red white it's the mesh render yeah look at this one that one isn't even a position that has reachable but the way that it works right now it's not even testing for anything so one quick optimization would be to only create the visuals on external walkable positions so that would work but the main thing is really just convert all these Visions onto a tile map so it's kind of what I did when I made the town map quite a long time ago uh Yep this one the custom tile map so on this one pretty much all of these positions make up just a single mesh so that's pretty much how we do it if I wanted to improve the performance on this one pretty much just convert them all into a single mesh and that would be quite a lot more performance and to only create them when the character is selected Maybe sure if you use the object pulling then instantiating just these ones that could work but uh yeah uh anyway so let me just fix this my voice is already messed up so I'm gonna go in a bit let me just quickly try to get this to work so that when I have a character and I go up there and over here as I zoom it hides the walls but it does not hide that player so I want to hide that player so over here can we do Dynamic pathfinding is in real time I don't know what you mean by that because pathfinding is always in real time so I'm not internally sure what you mean by that do you mean modifying the pathfinding because that's kind of what I'm this game already has that so of these all of these positions these are unwalkable because there's something on it without baking navmesh well then you so you're talking about actually modifying the padlock for example over here this position is not walkable but if I throw grenade over there that one is destroyed and yep no this position is now wonkable so that's just updating the actual word position so that depends on what Pathfinder you're using if you're using navmesh then if you have to rebake the position wherever things change and if you're using something like I'm using here so a grid pathfinding system that that depends on how you handle the Grid in this case it is really as simple as the um path node is that what I called it the path node just swapping his Wonka bone from fonsi 2 and yep there you go it becomes walkable alright so let me just quickly sort this out so on the floor visibility I've got the dynamic 4 position so if this one is true if so then let's go into four level Grid instance dot get floor I think just like this it should work that this transformed that position So based on like this if that one is on that one you have video on this grid navigation system yep I mean I have a step by step ah stepbystep thing in the phone course but if you want just the pathfinding then yep I've covered the Asar pathway algorithm and how it works it's a very fascinating algorithm takes a while to click but yeah then it's really powerful Yep this is using a star yep uh right so let's see if this modification changes once again thanks so so much for the super channel for the nice tool hint that was nice all right so jump into that one and as I go and no oh right because wait three no because he is hiding but he only hides oh wait no that makes no sense why is this one uh I guess depends on the transformed opposition yeah what position does this one have that's the question okay let me try this out or maybe I just didn't change it yeah probably just yeah of course I just forgot to tell the bullion that would do it all right so let me go up there and as I zoom in if they go it hides the walls and also the player now I just need to apply it over there to that one but yep that's pretty much it and yeah I guess I also need a Tylenol for because right now I would not be able to click underneath because the clicks would be blocked right so if I go there now I try to walk on that lower floor and right now if I zoom in I can't see it but I cannot click on it because I'm actually clicking on top of that so I need to go underneath and now it works all right so I just need another one so did I call it dynamic dynamic uh so just another one for disable Collider this one is set as false and I'll rename that so on the disable Collider let me get a private collider game object Collider so if I want to disable this Collider if so then on the game object calendar equals get component of type con later so I get this one and then down here on the high if disable game object calendar if so set this one that enabled equals false right because I want to hide it and if not put it on true okay so now on this one well first of all let me modify just the unit okay so on the unit itself on the skin mesh render uh then in for position okay and then on this one on this one let's disable this collider and now I should be able to walk when that one is invisible okay let's see What type of game I make if you're a beginner I would recommend you start with super basic games I actually have a really interesting video that I made a long time ago which is still very much valid nowadays which is this one and basically my advice is start with super simple games so things like Flappy Bird maybe Space Invaders maybe snake start off with those those will really give you quite a bit of starting knowledge and if you can do those then you should be able to do more complex ones okay so basically the issue is that as I click it was clicking on the second floor even as the visuals were hidden but now the visuals should be hiding also the calendar now as I click and there you go it does move all right awesome so now I can move around on the other floor and on this one I can go into the first one and there you go I got units above units below any of everything works with multiple grids and everything works right okay great all right so I've always already messed up but some of this was quite successful tried procedural development sorry I'm not sure what you mean by that I've done a bunch of procedural REI but yeah I don't know um will this be uploaded Yep this will have a VOD so yeah is there a way to build my own programming language in unity uh you can build visual it's actually just a while ago uh uh oh crap what was it called the graph view I think that's the one the unity graph view API so yep you can build your own your own kind of trees using the UI Builder and graph View so yeah if you want to do those kinds of things go ahead and use that one use YouTube live chat API for getting that yep that's exactly it I am using that API I'm doing a basic HTTP request from Unity so I've got the tutorial on the end of that page pretty much just using that in order to contact the YouTube API in order to show it over here uh display RPG course yep that's exactly the goal so right now I'm still in the research phase and I've got to write the entire expansion and in the end Yep this won't come out as a free expansion all right okay okay so that's gonna be it my voice is already messed up I can barely Tonk but some of this was nice this was productive I did manage to do everything that I want to do so I mentioned to do a bunch of research now I just need to record in lectures uh write record edit them and so on so yeah still quite a bit of work but yeah this was productive all right so nice okay so I think that's gonna be it so thank you all so much for joining me let me just set everything up let me just go into that one and all right okay so that's going to be it for me so I hope you have a pleasant day I'm gonna try to play a little bit of Zelda that should be fun so I'm going to try to enjoy that alright so yeah thank you all so much for being here and I'll see you next time alright bye everyone yeah foreign foreign foreign
