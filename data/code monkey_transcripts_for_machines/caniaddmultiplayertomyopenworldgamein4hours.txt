hello and welcome I'm your code monkeying okay so a few days ago I made a really interesting video on seeing if I can make an open world game using a bunch of really useful tools then in the comments someone asked could you take this game and convert it into multiplayer in a few weeks I was pretty confident that this could be done in a few hours not a few weeks once again thanks to using some really awesome very helpful tools I'm actually currently working on my own steam game dinky Guardians and it is using network frame objects which is unity's multiplayer Solutions so I'm quite familiar with it by the way go ahead and add the game to your wishlist so I figured rather than just entering that comment I would actually try to do it and see if it really is as easy as I thought here's how that went and by the way the tools that I use in making that open world game those are only on sale for two more days so if you need anything get it quickly so I open up the project and started off by installing the Neko for game objects package then based on how the tune works I installed the simple network manager then I added a client Network transform on the player in order to synchronize the movement I also set up a network animator on the player visual in order to synchronize the animations then I set up the player prefab to spawn it automatically I added to the player script in order to ignore any logic not from the owner also added the same logic to disable the camera on objects that were not the owner I added some basic testing netcode buttons to start host and start client then I made the build and look at that in just a few minutes I got multiplayer working perfectly awesome the players don't look quite a bit silly with just their arms that's why in first person multiplayer games usually you have to have both a first person perspective as well as a third person visual animation but for this quick prototype making it look quite silly it's actually a plus just like the other video this once again shows the power of using awesome tools making multiplayer games used to be insanely difficult personally I really remember trying to add multiplayer to my very first scene Game Survivor Squad adding that was really difficult I remember suffering quite a lot trying to get that working whereas right now in literally just a few minutes I get the basics fully working but at the same time that is really just the absolute Basics only the basic movement is being synchronized so basically we still need to synchronize all the other data sorry off with one of the important mechanics that I made for that game which was the spawning of the plane in the single player version I made the plane and the player as separate game objects but in multiplayer spawning two player objects that is a little bit tricky it can be done but it is a bit tricky to manage so in order to simplify I just included the plane directly inside of the player prefab that way I only need to enable or disabled game objects there's no need to spawn anything else for thinking the movement is the same thing as the player on foot just add a client Network transform and everything already Works once again I made it to only run the logic on the owner I added some logic to synchronize the spawning and the despawning of the various visuals and with a quick test yep there's the plane already working perfectly one player can spawn a plane and the rest one can see it perfectly okay so far so good by the way here you can see a fun thing of how Game Dev is really all about smoke and mirrors look how the plane seems to be insanely fast from the point of view of the pilot but from the point of view of the player sitting on the floor for that one it doesn't really seem like the plane is actually moving that fast the super simple trick to make something look really fast is just to use a really wide fov just that one change alone really gives it a really nice sense of speed so that's just a simple tip if you're making some speed based games it's the exact same trick that I use in my own drag racing minigame anyway so with that the plane is synchronized perfectly another thing we need to sync are the projectiles again this is really simple and the projectiles are really just prefabs so all it takes is really just making a server RPC in order to spawn them since again only server can spawn objects then I modified the prefab to once again add a simple Network transform component I also synchronize the hit particles once again the same thing just a server RPC in order to spawn them on the server and with that yep everything already works so all the players can fire projectiles all of the other ones can see it and all of the particles everything works perfectly it generally is really impressive just how simple it is to synchronize things in multiplayer nowadays you just had a few components right on a little bit of code and everything already works perfectly so the next task was synchronizing the enemies these are once again pretty simple it just requires adding a network transform to synchronize the transform a network animator for the animations I edited the enemy script in order to make it only run the logic on the host and once again just without everything already works I can log from the client look at the host and there it is the host walking around attacking and being attacked by the enemy then for synchronizing the castle heart since he projectiles are already only running on the server everything is already perfectly synchronized the heart is already taking damage from any player anywhere in the world surreal level takes is just a server and client RPC in order to trigger when the castle dies just doing that in order to trigger the animation on all the coins and yep there it is everything works alright so here I've got the game and I've got four players connected and yep as you can see everything works so I've got all the players so all of them are synchronized all of them are seeing the projections being fired I can shoot with this one and yep they all see those projectiles now I can try spawning a plane and jump into it and there you go I'm on the plane and yep the other players are also seeing my plane so wish going right through there yep everything is perfect now I have to say it is quite difficult to control four players at once but yep everything isn't it working finally just attacked the castle heart and if there go all of them play the animation and the castle heart is destroyed on all of them so yep there it is everything works everything's synchronized once again the answer to the question of the title is exactly the same one as it was in the previous video using all of the awesome tools that exists nowadays yep it is indeed possible for a solo in developer to make both a open world game and make it multiplayer I think in the end this took me maybe four to five hours so definitely not weeks and most of the time was actually not necessarily spent on the multiplayer just based on rearchitecting the single player since when I made the single player version I made some assumptions that only existed one player so I used a bunch of Singletons and a bunch of things that always assumed only one player exists so I had to refactor a bunch of code regarding that in terms of adding the multiplier itself that part was really super quick although Again part of the reason why it was super fast is because I'm extremely familiar with the stone set it's what I'm using for my upcoming Sim game so I'm used to working with this tool set every single day if you want to learn how to make multiple games check out my free complete course it's a 7 hour course which covers how to use this tool net code for game objects and goes through the making of an entire game in quite a lot of detail learn how to use Network variables custom Network behaviors how to send and receive server and client rpcs how to synchronize custom data and so on I'm really pleased with how the course came out it won't really teach you how to make multiplayer games and also the assets that I use to make my open world game those are still on sale for just two more days and same thing on the Senti store if you need some low poly assets this sale is also ending on Wednesday so if you need anything from DCU go ahead and check it out quickly alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
