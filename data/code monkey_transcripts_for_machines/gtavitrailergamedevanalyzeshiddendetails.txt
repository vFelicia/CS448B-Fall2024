hello and welcome I'm your kmy so after so long it finally happened we finally have a look at GTA 6 possibly the most anticipated game of all time as usual Rockstar trailers are full of tiny details I went through the trailer frame by frame and here's what I saw do you know why you're here bad luck I guess right away the most impressive shot of the trailer for me is this one right here most people probably can't even tell why this is so impressive essentially we finally have realtime hair physics this is something that has been a holy grail for quite a long time that's why game characters usually have short hair or it's all tied up it's because hair physics is insanely difficult and in this one and various other shots we can definitely see how that is definitely something they are focusing on it's really awesome to see that machines nowadays finally have enough power to render this in real time as far as I know GTA always uses in engine real time cut scenes as far as I know they're not prerendered so this appears to be runtime if it was prerendered then I'm guessing they would easily erase all of this aling so the fact that it looks really awesome but not perfect that leads me to believe this is definitely real time which is an insane achievement obviously the question is how many characters will have this kind of hair system whatever performance optimization they did it still a very expensive thing to do so I would assume only a handful of characters are actually going to have some hair like this another great piece of tack is this part right here it's really subtle but you can definitely see it right here if you look you can see that these buildings actually have some Interiors so this is an technique called interior mapping famously used by SpiderMan in order to make the buildings feel much more lived in in reality there's no geometry this just a really nice shaded trick if you want to know how that works the channel gev guide has an excellent tutorial on making this effect something also really impressive is the different shape of all the various NPCs they are all pretty much unique in this shot the main thing you can see is how all the NPCs they all seem to have very different body shapes this is something you can build yourself using some blend shapes there are some assets that come with characters with blend shapes these usually have some kind of sled that you can modify all kinds of various body parts something also extremely impressive are the water physics making some gorgeous looking water just like this one is really difficult there are all kinds of tiny details that make this look so good there's all kinds of foam all kinds of ripples tons of noise Maps slapped on top of one another not to mention all the CICS and how the light refraction changes based on being underwater if you want to learn about that Acera has an excellent video on that topic then I also went through the trailer frame by frame in order to see if they are reusing R Trace Reflections or not and in this shot right here that does appear to be the case right here as the truck goes by there's literally just one frame where we can see it right there there's a puddle on the floor and the truck is actually blocking the top of the gas station but we can still see it in reflection so this does imply something like R Trace Reflections as opposed to some like screen space if it was screen space we wouldn't be able to see this if the truck was blocking it also shown throughout pretty much the entire trailer is the gorgeous lighting the game really looks extremely beautiful we can see some really gorgeous volumetric lighting especially over here on this shot then on this shot of the alligator going inside this store we can see some really high quality indirect lighting now that leads to some speculation are they using some system kind of like Lumen if I had to guess I would say probably not I would say they're probably using something similar to unity's Adaptive proo volumes the reason why I say that is because the game already looks so good and literally everything else that I really don't think they have the frame budget to do something really intense like Lumen Lumen does look gorgeous but being in real time that makes it extremely performance intensive whereas baked lights that is something that is a tried and true method on this drifting shot right here we can also see some really nice volumetric fog note how the light actually impacts the fog in different ways so the fog has actual volume it's not just a billboard on this chart we see what appears to be some kind of car meet and we see lots of customization on the cars this definitely one of those fan favorite features so I really hope this is really car modding if you want to learn how to do something like that you can see pretty much the same logic in my character customization video or perhaps even my weapon attachment video moding a car or weapon is really the same thing speaking of characters there's also this shot with this character with ton of tattoos now this character doesn't seem to be insanely hod Delan like the two main characters so this leads me to believe that this is some kind of custom character I would assume from some kind of GTA 6 online mode so that will probably have extensive character customization including I'm assuming all of these unique tattoos one fun way to enable pretty much some infinite customization is to allow the player to actually draw some tattoos it would be fun if they had a system like that you could build something like it like I covered in the Rover mechanic simulator video where it can basically paint directly on top of a texture we can also see all kinds of post rting facts throughout the entire trailer in this intro shot right here we see a nice effect right behind the glass so it's just a simple seethrough Shader I did something kind of like this in my zoom Shader effect there's also some nice depth of feel post ressing here how the cars are all fully focused and the background is all unfocused and on this shot with a bunch of mod we can see as the girl moves in towards the camera that it actually changes the focus I wonder if this is just a cut scene or if the actual ingame effect also has some kind of autofocus mechanic another very subtle thing is right here on this shot we can see the plain exhaust this one actually applies some Distortion to the background again this is really all about these super tiny details but when you put them all together everything looks excellent speaking of tiny details as this character jumps on that table note how the bottom actually break right here as this bottom falls to the ground it really looks like as soon as it hits it suddenly turns into multiple pieces if you want to learn how to do this actually cover the simple destruction system it's actually pretty simple you pretty much just slice a mesh and then as soon as it touches the floor as soon as you want to break it as soon as it does you simply just spawn the prefab with the mesh split into multiple parts then another tiny effect is simply as the car is flipping around really fast you can see how the leaves actually blow over again it's all these details that really make a huge difference that's pretty much my takea away from watching this entire thing just the insane amount of detail personally I think red that Redemption 2 is the most detailed most technologically impressive game that I've ever seen and this one is definitely up there definitely in the same level of quality just looking at the scale over here of this opening shot just this part alone is really insanely impressive I mean just look at the amount of buildings over over there on the background the amount of foliage over here and even the amount of NPCs and just regular objects on here on the beach just on this scene there's an insane amount of polygons insane amount of detail and density and what's perhaps even more impressive is how all this is apparently running on current gen devices meaning the Xbox series X and the PS5 strangely enough there's no mention of PC for that I'm guessing they're actually going to do the same thing that they did with GTA5 which is first release on consoles and then basically one year after release an addition on PC some people will definitely end up buying two copies so that's an easy way for them to sell even more copies I mean that's a pretty big part on how GTA 5 is one of the most successful games of all time out of those 150 million copies chances are at least a couple million were people that bought it for the second or even third time the end screen was a bit surprising with saying coming in 2025 my initial thought was the end of 2025 cuz big games usually tend to come out at the end of the year right before the Chistmas sales black Fridays and so on but looking at the parent company take two interactive results they're expecting to to make $8 billion in fiscal 2025 just in case you don't know the financial year that actually ends in March of 2025 so if I had to yes yep the release date is probably going to be either February or early March of 2025 the main thing that isn't really shown this trailer is pretty much a straightup gameplay but with pretty much a year and a half until release chances are we're going to see plenty of trailers over the next 16 months oh well look who's back so that's the trailer it's really crazy to think how it's been 10 years since GTA 5 has come out personally I'm always a big fan of all the GTA games they're pretty much the perfect open world games I remember being in middle school and playing gta1 on the school computer that definitely felt magical to be able to drive and walk and shoot and do all kinds of things and it's really impressive how throughout all of these entries they've pretty much never had a bad game at least personally I've always enjoyed them and looking at this trailer looking at the amount of detail they put into these games it seems they are still very much pushing for the quality to the max so let me know what did you find most interesting from this TR thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
