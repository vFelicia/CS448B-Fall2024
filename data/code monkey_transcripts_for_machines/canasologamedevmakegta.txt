hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey so here's a question that sounds obviously dumb but actually has quite an interesting amount of nuance can an experienced solo Dev make GTA now your initial reaction might be of course not and the reason why you might be thinking that is probably because you're thinking about GTA 5 or 6 and for those yep the answer isn't obvious of course not however there have been many many games in the GTA Series so for example what about GTA 1 honestly I think that nowadays with the awesome tools that exist building GTA 1 is indeed doable nowadays by solv this was a topown game where you could walk around you could drive shoot you could interact with objects and do all kinds of quests it had some light 3D elements really just e buildings everything else are just flat Tod Sprites this is a game that came out in 1997 it had about a 2 and 1 half year death cycle also fun fact did you know that GTA the original name used to be called raceing Chase I think this is actually a fun tidbit of information specifically regards to marketing I generally don't think that GTA V would have sold 150 million copies if it was called racing Chase 5 but anyway so yep it had about a 2 and 1 half years death cycle it's hard to tell the team size there's no specific mention and looking at the official game credits these have about 80 people although not all of those would have been involved in the core game team working on this all this time a lot of these are actually under additional art additional sound and so on so I assume that means something like temporary freelance contractors so let's take yes and say that the core team was about 30 people a team of that size for two and a half years was definitely not cheap this was definitely not a bedroom coders game this was a multimillion dollar production so I guess the question is are the tool so much better nowadays 25 years after this this are the tools so much better nowadays that a solid developer can build what previously used to take a team of 30 people and millions of dollars have the tools really improved that much can one person do the work at 30 and can someone do something for free they used to take millions of dollars and Y honestly I generally believe the answer is yes I mean definitely not for a beginner not for someone who is just getting started with game development of course not at that point really no matter how good the tools are if you are a complete beginner then even making some like fling bird won't be a challenge however if you are an experience developer kind of like myself I've been making games for over 10 years and programming for over 25 I believe with the tools and the asset that you can get nowadays with that a game on the scale of GTA 1 can indeed be done by a solo game developer now it's been a year since I played this game so I might be misremembering in terms of scale just how big the game was but at least in terms of tech building a top down game a 2d top down game where you can drive cars shoot enemies and do all kinds of things so you have driving shooting there's the cop ey The Wanted system the gang AI destroying a bunch of objects and doing all kinds of things all that I do believe can be done by an experience all developer nowadays in fact I would actually say that my last game dinky Gardians was more complex than that it's an automation management defense game it's got tons of Interlocking Systems and I made that game by myself over the course of about 7 months and I did that while also continuing to make regular videos over here on this channel so I was working kind of parttime so I do believe that a game on the scale of GTA 1 can definitely be done by a Sol Dev nowadays and if you still don't believe me if you still think that I'm crazy and I'll point you to a game kind of like sard Valley obviously this was made by an extremely talented developer and took many many years to make but it does showcase what to these tools can do in the hands of someone who is very skilled or perhaps for another example look at kenchi this is a game with a truly insane scope you can do pretty much anything and be pretty much anyone in this world it's an insane game in terms of systems and content and this was also made by a small developer through the course of about 10 years and these two games these are actually relatively old by nowadays meaning the tools keep improving so if these developers start these games nowadays it would take them less time to build all of this and if GTA 1 can be done then same thing for GTA London is pretty much the same game just with different visuals and same thing for GTA 2 which if I'm remembering correctly was pretty much just more of the same more of the same game visually it looks a lot better and has a ton more content but in terms of tech it is still roughly the same type of game so I do believe this is still doable by Sol Dev nowadays especially because nowadays not only do you have access to excellent engines kind of like in real Unity or gdau but you also have access to the assur with tons and tons of assets to build pretty much any game you can imagine so even a solid Dev like myself with no art skills at all I can still build pretty awesome 2D and 3D games thanks to all these assets and in fact my last game d Guardians it's a systems heavy game it's programming heavy since that is my main strength and then I use the asset story in order to bring my vision to life and nowadays in 2024 there are even some awesome AI tools making 3D models is still a little bit rough but simple Sprites like GTA 1 GTA 2 those can definitely be generating and AI could also be useful in order to speed up the writing process to generate all these different quests different characters and so on obviously you still need humans in order to analyze everything that the a has built but for speeding up process that is a very helpful tool if you put all that together then I do believe that nowadays a soul developer can do what 25 years ago took a team of 30 people and millions of dollars and now at this point you might be thinking okay if you're so confident why don't you do it honestly if I had a time machine if I could stop time for about 6 months I would love to make a game kind of like GTA that sounds like a really fun project however other than time the main reason why I don't do that and why I also would not encourage you to do it the reason is simply because top down shoot at driving games those really don't sell very well you can browse around the top down shooter tag on Steam and you can see how quite a lot of them don't really have that many reviews always remember that just because you can build something just because you put a ton of effort into it that does not mean that it won't find Commercial Success although if you're doing it as a hobby just for fun then absolutely go ahead and try making your own GTA so I would say both GTA 1 and GTA 2 those can definitely be done by Sol devs nowadays but then when it comes to GTA 3 that one is definitely on the edge the big jump in this one is obviously going from 2D to 3D back then this was a huge deal I was completely amazed when I first played it it really felt impossible like how is it possible that a game can look this good just the first mission doing the prison escape and then driving a car back then this felt like complete magic however nowadays thanks to once again awesome tools and assets that change isn't actually that drastic making a 2d or a 3D game is really not that different the main difference is in terms of the assets but again nowadays the asset s has mountains and mountains of really awesome assets in fact there's actually more 3D stuff than there is 2D so in terms of General game tech building the core game mechanics yep I do still believe that this one can still be done by solo game developer nowadays however GTA 3 that one also took a huge leap in pretty much everything outside the core game mechanics the world map is huge every character is animated all the cut scenes they've got animations and some excellent voice acting now there are some AI animation tools those can definitely help but probably not good enough nowadays same thing for the voice acting in this one I believe all the characters are voice acted all except the player but unless you are a skilled voice impression is you could definitely not do the voices for every single character and again on that one nowadays there are some AI tools that can definitely help they still sound quite a bit robotic so it still requires a few months maybe a few years and quite simly just the fact that the game is really massive even with the help of tons of awesome tools it would be really tricky to build this entire world and fill up with interesting stories interesting props everywhere all this at some point no matter how good the tools are there is some limit to it so in terms of the core game mechanics like the shooting the driving the various AI for the various things all the gangs and all that stuff all that I still believe could be done by solo Game Dev however in terms of building the entire game itself building all the story the entire world all of that doing all of that yeah that part would be impossible and then of course after that point becomes even more impossible GTA 4 is yet another massively forward it's got really high quality assets and a massive amount of them D is absolutely huge so even if a Sol Dev got access to all these assets it would still take you a lifetime to build this entire world it also has even more cutcenes more voice acting more animations all of that there's more cars NPCs weapons all of that then GTA 5 is impossible no matter how good your tools are this game had a team size of over a thousand people it's an insane game on an insane scale and got actually insane results it's literally one of the bestselling games of all time and in the future there's GTA 6 who knows how many people I've worked on this game probably several thousand throughout the entire decade it is supposedly one of the most expensive games ever made over $300 million these games have a scale that is utterly impossible to even comprehend but going back to the original question can you build GTA GTA 1 GTA 2 and even GTA 3 I do think that with the awesome tools that exist nowadays and with a very skill developer with that yep projects that would require previously 30 people or 50 people and millions of dollars nowadays those same projects can be built by a solo developer and pretty much for free like I said I would not recommend it if you're trying to find financial success with your games just because this genre top down shooting games this isn't really a very marketable genre nowadays but as a hobby if you want to test on your own skills then perhaps go ahead and build your own GTA 1 and if you aren't yet an experienced Game Dev and you want to become one if so then check out my complete C course Link in the description I include my 10 years of C knowledge in this one course it features over 50 video lectures starting
