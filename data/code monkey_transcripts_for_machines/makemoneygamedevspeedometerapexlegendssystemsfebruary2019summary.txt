hello and welcome I'm your code man in this video we're going to review all the videos published in February 2019 let's begin so February had a bunch of really great videos one of the coolest video was creating a speedometer this is a really great UI element and essential for anyone looking to make a car game there's a background a speed needle and very speed indicators these indicators are a completely dynamic so by changing the code we can change the max speed and how many segments we have they need on rotates around as you would expect and the whole element works quite nice there were two indepth videos covering systems from apex legends the game has been very successful so it's always good to learn why that is there was a video on the health system it is pointing to a health bar and a shield bar the number of shield segments is dependent on the quality of the armor the player has equipped the health only goes down when the shield is plated and then we have various items that we can use to replenish either just the health or just a shield or both we have a nice damage effect that displays the amount of damage our help took with unless attack and also a very nice flashing warning when very low on health the other system from apex legends that we covered was the pink system which is one of the main reasons why the game has been so successful the pink system is very contact sensitive and with just a single button we can spawn a multitude of things to give different information to our teammates all the pings display their distance and have a secondary indicator for when they go outside of the screen we have the ability to do a normal move ping by just pressing somewhere with our ping button then by double clicking on the ping button we can spawn a enemy spotted ping by holding down the pink button we get a nice ping wheel that contains even more unique ping types and by using the ping button on top of an item we get a special ping highlighting that item again on pings display their distance and the direction towards them so you can see how versatile this system is despite only using a single button adding even more ping types is extremely simple due to the way that the code is setup so again a great element very versatile and very contact sensitive which makes it very easy to use whilst being extremely useful we had two more general talking advice videos the first one we looked into five price tiers that you can use for your indie game it ranges from free to more than $20 in the video I give my thoughts on what a player expects for each price point along with my own experiences if you're just starting out I recommend you value feedback more than money since experiences everything in game development then there was a video covering 5 ways to make money in game development I think this is a great video because it really shows you how there's a multitude of ways you can work in games the various options range from very stable to very risky you can be very stable working in a regular game studio however that means you don't have much say in to what you're going to create or you can have complete creative freedom by doing in any game and sacrificing stability so again a great video that shows various avenues that you can find success whilst working in games on there was also a video on a really cool meta bar with a animated texture it's a very simple bar but we polished it to make it look quite nice so we first created the base bar along with the code to handle spending and replenishing our mana then we took that bar and replace the basic solid color with a cone texture we animated that texture through code making point very nice we then at the border and an extra effect on the edge of the bar that is only visible whilst the bar is filling out the result is a very nice animated mana bar that would look great in any game we had the completion of the snake series this is a great series for a beginner since it goes from absolutely nothing to a completed game and the snake game design is very simple which makes it perfect for learning so this month we continue the series first by adding body corners to our sprites that way the snake looks much better when doing 90degree turns then we added snake that by causing a game over when the head of the snake hits any part of its money we also had the ability for the snake to wrap around the level so when we go past the right edge the snake shows up on the left side after that we worked on creating the UI first we set up the UI canvas with a camera to display it and then we add a simple text field to display the current score we then created a class to handle loading of our scene so by adding a scene reload and a testing button we were able to retry playing the game whenever the snake dance then we convert that testing button into a proper game / window with all of that we have to work on creating a simple main menu we set up some buttons and a title text we have a button to play the game which loads our game scene a button to learn her play which shows a window that teaches the player the rules of the game and the quit button which quits the desktop then it was time to finally add some sound to our game so you got to work on creating a sound manager to handle pulling all of our sounds and we added sounds for snake move eat die and also for all of our buttons finally we set up the high score with saving and loading and display that only you want when the player beats the highscore he gets a congratulation message in the game / window and a new high score is safe so that's the snake series complete I plan to still make a video polishing up the final result but you can now go through the entire series and see the game being created from absolutely nothing until a very nice game there was a video covering how to make a high score table with saving and loading this is a pretty simple thing to do but very useful to almost any game we set up the window in the UI along with a template for our high score entries then we create our class to hold a list of high scores and display them on the table each entry contains the score and the name of the player we added saving and loading to our table using Jason and player prefs so all that is persistent between runs finally we polished our table with trophies for our top three players as well as highlighting the number one player we had the summary of the tooltip series this was a great series that teaches you how to make a tooltip which is an essential element if your game is UI having the first video starts off extremely simple with just basic tanta being shown and the background resized to match the text then we made sure our tooltip is always on screen and add the ability to update it in real time we then duplicate our class to make a separate on tip warning that flashes in red and is great for giving important warning information to the player and finally we were used on a lot of our tooltip code to turn it into an stats to tip that choose a image of the item on with the description and it stands again great element for giving information to the player and pretty much essential if your game is UI heavy there were two quick tip videos first covering how to view custom classes in the inspector by default you can only see the default data types in the inspector unlike inte boom in ohms and so on however by adding the serialize bone attribute you can make your custom classes show up as well this is right for example for showing a custom spawn positions class that contains a vector three a nth and whatever else that way everything is nice and grouped when you go into the editor then there was a video covering how to use debug that drawn line for testing it's a great tool to be used alongside debug log but instead of text we can draw a line in our world you can show or hide lines by enabling or disabling gizmos this is a great tool for example for debugging a pathfinding system you can draw the lines to see what path was calculated we also have the completion of the modular sprite sheets as used for guests in battleground tycoon first we added body primary and secondary colors this video teaches you how to make a texture which acts as a mask for several separate areas so using the same masks we can define where we want to tint a primary color and where to tint a secondary cone finally in the last video of the series we covered saving and loading of the exact same sprite so we can generate a completely random sprite using all the parameters we covered then we put that sprite information in a save object and we save it that way we can always load the exact same sprite every single time so that was it for the completed series covering how guest frets work in been around that good the game is on Steam so you can pick it up to see this system being used in a real game so that was it for the month of February 2019 I hope you found the videos helpful and learned something along the way if you have any questions regarding any of the videos feel free to post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time you
