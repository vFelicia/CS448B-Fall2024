hi there this is a quick tip for how to modify components while playing and paste their values so let's say you're testing your game trying to get some values just right so for example here is the scene where I have a player character and a bunch of crates and I want to push these crates around with my character so that means I need to add a box Collider to my character so I can exit the game go here select my character and here I add the box Collider however my animation system only runs when the game is running so right now the player isn't visible so that means in order to set the correct values in here I have to pretty much guess just how tall the player is so I set these values now I play the scene now the player is visible so I can pause the scene and see that my families are way too small so we can now stop now increase it a bit more and try again and see if the values are better if not try again so that's one way to do it essentially by trial and error now another way we can do it is pause the scene now in here we set the correct values so drag this about this this about there push it a bit down okay so these are the values I would like to put and now I can either memorize this or take a screenshot of these values then stop the scene and put them back in so that's another approach or we have a third approach which is the best one which is we play the scene here's the player now we pause it and now here in the inspector I can see the box on either I can modify them to match the perfect values just like that and now I rightclick in here I click copy component then I stop the scene rightclick and paste component values and just like that there you go the correct values have been pasting now you can play and everything should work perfectly fine so yeah here is the character with the correct box weather and now I can move and now you indeed everything works exactly as intended so this way you can do all your testing while playing the game and balance the values accordingly this works with any component so if you have for example a enemy spawner script you can change this to whatever values fit your game as you're testing then you go in here again copy component stop it and paste component values in there you go you paste in alder so extremely useful when you have something with a lot of components anyone to test for the correct balance and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
