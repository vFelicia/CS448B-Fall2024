all right hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here all right okay let me make sure everything is working make sure the steam is working all right I forgot one thing uh crap forgot this uh all right just okay I think it's working all right okay great all right okay so I was just missing this window all right okay so hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here at 4 pm in the afternoon or whatever it is your time just minimize everything and okay all right okay right so basically I'm gonna be working on the game trying to make a bit of progress trying to make the next update for the demo and yeah at the same time trying to answer some questions something so let's see wait is this might oh right it's just my my thing wasn't live okay yeah I think everything is good okay great all right what is your OS I'm on Windows pretty much always use Windows I've never actually used the Mac I've only used it like for five minutes trying to make a a iOS build for something yeah yeah pretty much always using Windows okay so basically the main thing that I would like to do is something that it's still not implemented in the demo which is over here the goal so basically I need to add a bunch of logic to track all of the various gongs so clone 30 dinkies build the rocket fully automate The Colony and keep the colony safe so pretty much automating those goals that is kind of thing that I'm going to want to do all right happy birthday okay happy birthday koyan hey that's nice I hope that helps all right okay okay so let me get to this so first thing I'm going to need some kind of goal manager all right let me make an empty game object for the gold manager and uh just wait for it to compile nice pen Springs I pretty much only know one or two tricks by now most of them I've kind of Forgotten with the ears but yeah it's fun to keep the brain occupied or rather keep the hands occupied instead of the thing use the unity only why do you mean yeah I'm using regular Yin Ty I'm not using UI toolkit so that one as far as I know actually I haven't kept up with the updates on that one for quite a while but I think that by now it is still only uh editor only or maybe it already has I'm not sure but yeah I am using just regular Unity so all of these these are all of my UI windows for demo so all of them separated and all these are basically just images buttons all of it super basic when will the new Dodge theorem be available uh I don't know I still have to go research that so hopefully sometime next month that's kind of the it's kind of gone that's what I'm going to try to do okay so uh for the gold manager all right so I'm going to okay so first thing let me actually keep track of the dinky amount uh so update visual actually do I go with the visual maybe not Jiffy is a measurement of time is it all right so fast in writing code I mean that's just spending many many years uh typing things that kind of that kind of has that effect okay uh right so I'm trying to think because I should probably have a visual and one so how am I going to have I guess it's I have like a private end for the denki amount uh gone do I call it go maybe so kind of like this equals 30. um red ball has built rocket well for the uh is Colony for the automated and let's get going for actually I'm trying to Define these but I should probably just yeah first thing I need to actually okay so let me think how am I how am I going to do this finish the signal player kitchen course in one hour you finish it in one hour you watch a 10 hour video in one hour okay I mean that's impressive so all right okay so up here I think I'm going to listen to my time tick system and pretty much on every second I'm going to try to get these things learning your turnbased strategy course 58 done oh it's awesome learn about something ah nice when should I use Singletons there are some rules internet opinions vary uh yeah it depends on for me as a general rule basically if there is something of which there's only one thing then by all means go ahead and make it a sentence so over here on this project I've got tons of Singletons like for example over here the tutorial manager this one handles the tutorial there's only one tutorial manager so it makes perfect sense for this one to be a Singleton then on the other hand for dinkies I've got tons of dinkies so it makes no sense for the dinky itself to be a Singleton uh on the player kind of the same thing so there are multiple players but at the same time there's only one local player so I do have a Singleton reference for the local instance so yeah pretty much for anything that you have just a single one of by all means go ahead and make it a Singleton as long as there's only one exists then that's a perfect thing I know there are lots of people who really hate the Singleton pattern never actually want to use it but for me I find to be super useful if there's anything where just exists just one thing then yep it should definitely be a single thing okay so let me try to think a little about this so basically the first thing is I want to do actually for dinky Mount I can go to dinky because I'm pretty sure yeah I already got a get ink amount so I can just do debug.hog on dinky amount and put in the dinky amount then I guess debug.log in order to test for the house bumpy rocket and for the rocket let's think how am I going to do I think the best thing is kind of how I was handling the uh my save system which I pretty much just did a query a physics query to find all the objects in the world pretty sure that's what I did right um yep that's pretty much it so just doing a basic physics querying so over here don't let me try to do pretty much these same things so uh all right so I'm going to go to the entire world size and so on unlike total Liberation more than 10 yards well I mean the good news is that game is not canceled that one is just post one for next year so yeah definitely stay tuned for next year are you using tune [ __ ] in this project yep I'm using what is called the Quigley asset so if I can just go into the asset store it's a really nice one I've mentioned it a bunch of times there it has been part of a bunch of bundles so yeah this is the one that I'm using it's a really nice Shader with tons and tons of options so over here in the game yeah actually I haven't actually played the game hey super Chad Tracy hunt hey thanks so much thanks for being here I'm glad you liked the videos thank you so much the first Super Chat oh that's cool thanks for using your first super channel on me all right thank you so much uh uh okay what was I saying all right the uh the assets yeah I'm basically using equivalently okay let me pick a bigger one with a bunch more things so my big save with a nice big machine so yeah pretty much I'm using the equivalent Shader to make all of these assets and look quite a bit more cartoony because these are actually the uh scifi worlds pack ah crap yes the SciFi worlds yeah basically this is the pack that I'm using for most of these assets so see that little round thing that is pretty much over here the HQ and you can see how it looks quite different because it's using quite a different uh shaders so if you want to make your assets look quite a bit different I would definitely recommend using an interesting Shader if you apply an interesting shade and everything kind of looks like it fits so it looks pretty good so so yeah and basically the way that I was saying uh yeah I'm using the equivalently Shader asset and I'm using just modifying the color of the outline in order to select Which object is actually selected and that has been quite useful pretty much just go into the materials so I've got a ton of materials using all kinds of things for example over here for the food material so I've got the food texture map and over here I've got a black outline and then I swap out for one that has the white outline and that's pretty much how I'm handling the visuals for the object solution so pretty basic and it works pretty well I think it changes the outline which I think makes everything look quite nice it's super easy to see what object is selected so everything looks pretty good okay all right okay let me just continue with the goals here so for the although actually for the rocket I was thinking about doing this but yeah once again a while ago we were talking about Singletons and for example the rocket is only ever going to have a single rocket so I can actually make this a Singleton so an instance with a get a private set and then down here on the awake all right boy the way just instance equals this since the rocket is only going to have this one so for the gold manager for this one to test if it has a rocket just debug the hog has rocket and I can just go into the rocket base and the instance if it is not known then I do have rocket if not then I don't have a rocket okay so that's the other goal and then fully automate The Colony so no dinky's working and for that I actually also have a dinky get the dinking list so this one returns only so dinky for the banking list so I can get that one and do a four inch uh Dinky Dinky in the dinky list I can cycle through all of those and thank you dot do I have an is item is I don't think we have okay great all right so I already have this function so that actually simplifies things quite a bit so if one of them is not idle so uh hint uh dinky is working then dinky's working plus was if it is not I don't then think he's working so debug.log for for the dinkies working and just put the link is working okay so that's the other gun and for the other one so if only automate The Colony so none of them can be working then keep the colony safe okay this is the one that is going to be a bit tricky your PC configuration uh I have no idea I've got a a 380 and a uh CPU is a 5950x I think it's like three years old but it's still pretty good to use blender in your 3D software I've used it a little bit I've tried learning blender actually made a video because I I followed the course and I did manage to learn quite a bit so if you want to see what I managed to build in about 10 hours and this was a fun video you can actually learn quite a bit even if you're I mean I'm definitely not a blender Pro but I did manage to build some pretty nice things over here let me just go ah crap I can see uh yeah the final the final thing actually looks pretty good I made all these models after following a course for about 10 hours I think something like that so yeah yeah if you're interested in 3D modeling definitely I would recommend you give it a shot because it's not as difficult as it seems pretty much uh right uh okay so oh crap this is messing up my save that's okay keep the it's gonna be there uh okay so I'm gonna have to figure out how do I keep the colony safe and then launch into space okay but for these ones I think the logic for these goals should be working so let me just quickly test it out all right you know asset Forge by Kenny I've never I'm familiar with Kenny's assets but I've never used acid Forge that's his like 3D modeling program something like that which does does seem quite interesting from what I see of his uh gifs posted on Twitter it does seem quite interesting so yeah I've never used it myself but yeah if you want to make some simple things then that can be quite useful okay where's my console uh okay so apparently two dinkies are working is that correct okay this one is working so I put this one on idle uh any more dinkies that are working and there's one over here picking up objects no not this one nope not this one which one that one why is this one picking up objects okay I don't know but set it on I don't okay so I think he's working zero and true for the rocket really do I have a rocket here uh I don't think I want a rocket in this map did I okay that's a bit strange because I don't think I've done the rocket all right did I build the rocket anywhere no or did I put it yeah different from no okay are you planning to add features to the character on like a face or hat or something uh yep the asset pack that I chose for the characters has a a ton of customization options so yep I will definitely be adding those in the future right now the only thing that I have is just just changing the colors but yep in the final version it will indeed have tons of things that you can use to customize a character to make them look quite a bit interesting okay so seriously I alright so now I'm a bit confused did I add it to the wrong thing uh nope I added it over here the rocket base this is some okay I'm not sure why this one is doing this because this one should be known right yeah has Rockets let me just print out this then that how to make my name like yours with the black background the outline these are the members so yeah Timber Jones here is a member of the channel so thank you so much yeah uh uh okay tutorials on planning out code for game uh I'm almost finished with your build defender course and there is so many scripts that link together I wonder how do you plan for that uh as with so many things the answer usually comes down to experience so that's one answer but the other answer is it really depends on a person by person based like some people like to make all kinds of diagrams and really uh really draw a bunch of pictures that say this system connects to this one this one and so on some people like to do that for me I don't really do that all that much I just do it a tiny bit and for the most part yeah I already have enough experience that I know when I think about some kind of system that I want to build I already know how it's going to connect what kind of other systems do I need to interact with those systems something like that okay so that's even more strange did I change something okay so this is one of those things that quite confused me because a while ago it was saying true that I perhaps not save it don't you need to reset the Singleton between the games nope because the Singleton just gets destroyed so as soon as I change scenes the objects that I'm over here because for The Singletons I'm not using these uh static classes these are for example over here they go manager this is an actual regular amount of behavior which is attached to a regular game object on the scene so as soon as I change scene that game object is going to be destroyed so the instance gets cleaned up automatically so nope you don't need to do that the only place where I do need to reset is my yeah I've got a reset static data mono Behavior just a nice class that exists on the main menu to restart to reset a bunch of things and I'm pretty much just using it for example over here I've got a static list so this is not going to be cleared up automatically so for this one I do need to manually clear it up and the most important thing is for all the events so I've got a bunch of static events like for this one when any carry vehicle opens UI or when any gets destroyed static events they don't get destroyed automatically so for this yep I do need to reset them manually but for just Singleton static instances for those you don't really need to worry too much how many games have you made I think it's eight yeah I think this is going to be my ninth game so yeah it has already been quite a lot although that is in the context of uh 2012 so yeah about 10 years 9 games so yeah roughly something like that okay so I'm a bit confused as to why this was I have no idea did I forget to save a while ago I don't know but was because I didn't have the parentheses that it was doing something strange with the okay I'm not entirely sure but anyway so now the logic is working that one does say false because the rocket does not exist because of course does not exist let me just actually try to make a rocket do I have to actually yeah this is the one thing that I really need to change and let me use my debug menu just to automatically complete uh the research so let me do okay take out the that bot just finish the research for the rocket and actually I'm going to need to spawn the rocket button might as well see a the rocket is actually not this one the optimization is in here because it's looking smooth actually no actually right now everything is pretty much uh well I wouldn't say unoptimize I mean I didn't try to make sure that the code was decent but no I did not think uh too much about optimization I haven't done that so yeah but it is working quite decently if I'm working the analysis profiler and uh okay so let's see a random frame so what is it doing okay so a bunch of thing on the render pipeline and a bunch of squirts here I do got a quite a bit of garbage okay look at that the chase mine yeah no it's not the overall apps here but something on the chase mine is taking a bunch of garbage what is it yeah because basically for uh for actually doing optimization I haven't worried too much about it as long as it's playable right now I very much uh won't the game be free you know the final game is going to be a regular paid game but the demo is free so if you want go ahead go on to steam right now and play the free demo foreign so this one is actually generating garbage why is that well first of all if I were to optimize this the first thing I would do would be not to look for a Target on every single update I'm pretty sure I did do uh like for example on the uh gather resources on the dinky behavior for dinkies Gathering resources yep for here over here I use a basic timer just make sure that it doesn't test on every single thing so I'm just doing it overlaps here but only doing it every x amount of time so that is if I were to optimize over here Chase mine that's what I would do instead of looking for Target on every single update I would make it all look at most five times per second that is more than enough so yeah because over here he's constantly doing that the array yeah this one is it's probably over here that it's generating all that garbage so I got a whole bunch of Chase mines so all those are generating the garbage because they're all constantly grabbing a collateral array on every single update so yep I will definitely uh play around this try to fix things but yeah for a for a regular hey your answer hey how's it going uh yeah so for a demo I'm mostly focused on actually implementing things and not oh and Jason Wyman as well hey Jason how's it going nice uh right okay let me just kill the the zombies just make sure that they don't actually wipe out my entire base because I don't have to get a different saving that would be tricky uh all right okay what was I doing uh I need to spawn what do I need to spawn uh all right that's the other thing that I need to work on afterwards right let me just go into the HQ and I wanted to spawn the rocket okay so I guess now I might as well yeah try to get all of these fun watching all the code oh it's awesome are you working on the RPG hey best of luck with that I hope it's going well nice where they use a tick system uh I've got a Time Tech system it's just a super helpful basic class that just triggers the take on every 0.2 seconds so just five times so any logic that I have that I want to do instead of being on every update instead of having to do instead of having to manually handle a timer I can just listen to one of these events and do something on this on tick for example what am I doing like for example over here on the tutorial manager in order to complete this tutorial I'm going for Gather Five Stone instead of checking on every single update to check if that crate container has five Zone instead of that it's really just listening to that only on the time Tech system so on the time tick so pretty much just five times per second instead of doing it on every update it doesn't overlap sphere to find that one and so on so yeah the time take system is super useful in terms of performance and really just not wasting things and actually that is something that I that script the time take system that is actually something that I did in a video a very long time ago so here it is authentic system I made two videos on it this was in 2018 and before that on many of my Steam games I also use this so yeah that's the one great example about writing some good code you can then reuse it on tons of things or intensive things many years in the future so that is super useful all right uh okay so let me just get back to work on Little Bits all right uh okay what was I doing okay let me just try to make a thing so let's see what do I need to get I'm going to need some tier two some microchips some greenium I think I've got some regular greenium okay so I can use this one right here let me just place okay I've got way too many mod way too many objects on this testing scene that actually makes things quite a bit tricky so let me just place a bunch more of these because yeah this definitely yeah that is one thing that I do need to improve for the final game is come up with some things to like encourage the player to spread out the bass a bit more because over here this is way too busy there are way too many things oh look at that did I just encounter a bug Maybe huh was it because the saves okay so I'll have to figure that out what happened to the okay that's interesting so because I had one of these Bots was over here interacting and feeding things into storage but apparently the bot got tired and decided that it didn't want to do so I'm not sure oh because it's all right anyways I'm not sure what happened here maybe an issue of the save so I'll have to look into that okay so again I get distracted way too much so I need to get some tier two ingots some microchips some purple let me use my debug menu to spawn some some purple crystals some tier 2 ingots let me just Place those so not you you place it in there some tier two and just need what else uh greenium purple just the microchips so let me grab some microchips how can I use the line renderer in a network variable uh the answer is you don't use well could you use the Line Runner no I don't think so uh yeah basically the answer is the online render is really just a list of vector threes so you would simply synchronize a networking list of vector 3. so you can just do the same amount of behavior so this is not the one this one is also not abundant Behavior okay so I need one yeah so you can make a private network list of vector three so you can do that for the what you call line renderer Point list so you can pretty much just see this just synchronize that list and then on the online renderer you can actually set those I think I use that then I use that on the uh it was a recent video what oh right the track your path over here I'm pretty sure that I use the online renderer for the for calculating the thing for the pad position list then web online rendering yes I'm pretty sure the online render does work with alist yep there you go you set the position count then you call set positions and so on so basically you would synchronize a list of vector threes and then just call and set positions and you would do it just like that so remember you don't have to synchronize the entire component you can just break down the component into into the components that make up that component and just synchronize that data instead of the components itself so yep that's what I would do yeah so let's say it's really cluttered yeah yeah the computer doesn't even throw yeah that's uh it definitely still needs optimization work but yeah honestly I'm surprised that right now without having to focus too much on optimization everything is looking pretty good so yeah I'm pretty pretty impressed pretty pleased with the current performance of the demo so that's nice all right how many dollars will the game cost I don't know maybe five maybe ten maybe 12 I don't know that is something that I still haven't figured out exactly what it's going to be uh okay so the last thing that I needed was just see microchip so let me just get those uh get those where's the microchips oh Electronics that's it uh where did it spawn there it is it's right here places in there so let me just link those so I'll link that one link that one put that one and that one and craft and there you go it does work is this your biggest game yet uh no no actually I just I just did a a short a while ago so I don't know how many of you watch shorts but actually just did a pretty fun chart which was on the on how many lines of code I wrote in two weeks which was the two weeks leading up to this and the answer was about sixteen thousand which is quite a lot in two weeks that's about a thousand lines of code per day so that's a ton of work a ton of stuff but yeah definitely not my I'm pretty sure that uh Battleground Tycoon my previous game was like I don't know I'm pretty sure it was over a hundred thousand so yeah that one I would say is still quite a bit more more complex so yeah but this one is still only them yeah it's over nine thousand definitely it's uh yeah so but this is just them so who knows by the time the the game is complete Maybe by then this will indeed be my most complex am yet I'm not sure we'll see in Sim sets are correct it says you have 165 followers that means 151600 wishlist uh nope the wish lists are a bit better than that they are currently on 2300 I think or 2400 something like that one of those two so yeah it is going pretty decently I mean my goal is to uh get up to about um at least five thousand by the release date and release date is in about two months maybe so yeah the goal was to be able to get up to five thousand all the time which hopefully should be doable so let's see so far development is going good wish lists are going pretty decent so yep definitely keeping up all right all right which one the rocket cost uh actually cause is something that I still don't know read my comment what comment sorry I'm trying to keep up but yeah I don't see any comment from you make an open world Street Racing hack and slash first person third person with what okay I mean if you're a beginner and you're asking that question I would say definitely limit your scope open world Street Racing hack and slash first second third person ball time I mean technically that is possible uh but yeah as a solo Dev especially if you're not very experienced I would definitely encourage you to limit your your ideas to something a bit more manageable uh okay uh I'm quite a bit distracted I have to say but all right uh okay so that one so I was doing all that just to be able to see if the logic for beyond the rocket it is true and it is indeed working okay someone has X number of things I think how much will the game cost uh like I said so I'm not sure perhaps five dollars perhaps 10 I'm not sure can you show the save system yep the save system is actually super simple I mean it's very verbose because right now I'm I'm storing a ton of stuff but yeah pretty much all this is just copy paste for different types of things so it's really just I got a save object or a list of save objects and then I just initialize those lists and I just do a basic physics overlaps here on the entire world just an easy way to cycle through every single object in the world then I try to get the component of a bunch of things I go into that object and I get a save object out of it so for example over here the carry object these are the vehicles that move back and forth over here this one has a save object so this one just saves uh if this one is carrying anything and it saves the position so pretty much very simple and basically just creates a save object which in turn is converting to Json and then for unloading the spawn back together that once again gets the same save object then just instantiates the object and so on so the save system is actually something that I covered quite a long time ago and it's still exactly the same thing that I use nowadays so saving and loading to a file using Json so this video from 2018 this is still exactly how I do things nowadays so pretty much just create a safe object of something like for example here the dinky the dinky has a save object it's going to store the position the hunger Mount whatever dinky behavior is currently active as well as which house spawned on this linking and pretty much just converts that into a save object which in turn the save system takes all of that converts all of that into Json then saves that into a path so let's open just for fun let's look at a a save object so let me go it's on the other side these saves let me see a big one all right so there you go this is the save object which as you can see it's also not optimized so it's storing a ton of wasteful data but still this is only 36 kilobytes so this is all pretty basic uh yeah this is the save object this is what saves on that so everything that you saw on that game over there it's all in here did you Cipher it nope this is a single player game or a Coop multiplayer game so yeah I don't I don't really care if you go up here and you cheat like for example here is the hunger Mount so some random dinky has 134 hunger I don't really care if you come up here and you say 999 so that it never gets hungry if that's what you want to do by all means go ahead so yeah everything is stored here everything in nice plain text doesn't really matter so yep the safe system is pretty basic so if you want to see definitely go watch that video it's from 2018 but everything everything that I do nowadays don't pretty much exactly the same uh all right so basically what I was doing is I was just figuring out on the goal manager and once again Tracy on thanks so much for the Super Chat thank you uh Sunday gold managers over here so I'm tracking the thing came out I'm tracking the rocket amount uh I'm tracking how many denkis are working so what else do I need I need to keep the colony safe so yeah that is the one that is going to be quite tricky because I gotta figure out how do I Define uh uh was a zombie spawner what did I call it the zombie spawner uh uh I guess I could have like a like a private float last time attack I could have something like this and then up here on this one I could do a set last time attack and then I could do last time attack equals time dot time all right so then I could go on to the zombie and when the zombie attacks something so moving to attack dinky and whenever the U attack a dinky go into Terry dinky and the deal damage so up here I could go into zombie spawner did I Make an instance I did so let's call the uh set last time attack so with that that would okay so yeah I do think like this it would work so that defines the last time attack all right then a public float get time since last attack oh great make a course yeah I've got plenty of courses and I'd love to make another one but I'd love to make another one at the same time I'd love to work on this game so there are so many things that I'd love to do if only I could find the time so yeah okay get the time because time dot time oh this is the beginning of this Frame so this is not what I want uh it's the real time since startup yeah that's what I want uh all right so I get the time since last attack and this I think is going to be in seconds so let me go into the goal manager and let's go into the zombie spawner instance get time since last attack load for the time since last attack and I get that one just see we debug don't log on the time okay all the time since the last attack just get this one okay won't that continue even when paused actually that's a good question because I don't know if time Dot that's actually a very good question because I don't know if this one stops on because I thought there were two of them yeah I thought one was on Dante time and one was not okay so let's figure that out that is actually super simple to figure out so let me just go yeah just over here and let's go on to the time tag so just do a debug the hug on the time real time some syrup and let's see if that one where's my thing real time will continue time will pause yeah but the time was so what kind of times you have real time since syrup yeah but the time oh the time at the beginning of this Frame okay yeah oh it was the unscale time okay that's what I was thinking okay so that's what I was thinking so yeah I do think real time might stop so I do think it should probably be uh okay so over here it's actually not spawning so let me just continue uh let's see that one okay 32 33 34 and I pause right it's not but now if I unpause that code is going to run yeah 38 okay so that one does not get impacted so I cannot use that one but yeah so I think I was I was correct in the beginning so it is time.time so without it should actually say now that one should stop since apparently it's the unscaled time that's the one that I was confusing when all right uh so let's go there continue and let's see okay three seconds four seconds oh actually yeah that is something that I yeah I definitely need to update that on start otherwise it's going to be messed up again anyway okay so pause on 14 wait a few seconds wait a few seconds unpause and now it's in size 15. okay awesome cool all right so that works test message yeah test successful all right okay so that work love your videos Ah that's awesome I'm glad you're watching them why don't you don't like them hey there hey Paul how's it going uh all right so basically I just need to set oh right yeah I was thinking about setting this on the beginning but no I also gotta I also gotta save this hmm all right so I was thinking I mean I can probably put it over here on the awake just to fix things a little bit but right yeah anyway so I do think this does work so okay let me just uh see if the time since the last attack if that one is working which should be working so let's ignore the time.time over there because sometimes I say but the character didn't update uh that part has a manual thing so let me just let me just manually try to see if there's any new characters uh okay right let me try to see that one if there's any characters that one takes a little bit um right all of those are validated there's another one let me validate it anymore uh right there was one that was validated but who was saying that oh boy I've got way too many way too many tabs artem uh uh right uh I do see yours and yours is validated but you need to go into the user account page and you need to link your YouTube account otherwise the overlay over here doesn't know uh which account belongs to you so basically you need to go onto your user page on the website and you need to click over here in order to link your YouTube account then the uh overlay over here won't be able to know which character blocks you and then it will apply the custom thing so yeah just go ahead and do that and it should work game looks amazing oh it's awesome thank you I hope you like it yeah so far things have been quite interesting all right okay so let me see the time since last attack so let me go into single player and uh yeah continue and all right so let's see so that one is going to start from zero okay I'm going to need to save that sure but yeah all right so time since last attack let me spawn a zombie just to see if this is going to work actually I'm probably going to need to spawn multiple zombie or let me just just throw one dinky directly onto the zombie that's a bit sadistic I don't know sorry but yeah just for testing you're gonna be sacrificed okay I'm sorry but yep it did work so it was over there on 26 and as soon as he had he reset the timer okay so that's good so that's basically how I'm going to keep the colony safe so if it goes for I don't know maybe three minutes seven videos for three minutes without a single attack then continues uh then considers that the colony is indeed safe all right okay so with that honestly the guns are pretty much on working I think so let me just make a vision for that so let's see if it works okay so let's make a nice gold visual I'm just going to 2D mode 350 RTX isn't good for Unity uh as always when it comes to Hardware the answer is depends on what kinds of games you want to make if you want to make simple games then pretty much anything is going to work so yeah 30 50 if you're trying to make a giant open world game with super high quality textures then maybe it won't be enough but if you're making a regular game then it probably won't be enough uh for the goals UI why did I is this inside something it isn't inside anything right nope okay so I'm not sure just put them like oh crap uh okay so for all these let me just put them all just like that because I don't want you to scale and let me scale down that goes kind of for okay exactly that's what I want and let me also add my super useful component to reset the position on the UI so this is why I have all my UI Windows all spread over the place visually I can position them and this way I can easily move around and interact with any of these windows and all of them have this component which pretty much just goes and resets the anchor position and the size Delta so pretty much it sets all of these values on zero so as soon as the game starts all of them going to the canvas so just super useful for actually developing the game so I can move things to the side and I can easily play with them alright so on this one on the gonzi Y uh it's going to be a bit tricky how am I going to how am I going to fit such information over here that's the part that's going to be quite tricky uh trying to think uh do I do a text based okay yeah I think the easiest way is we're only just do it text based and then maybe I'll swap for something a bit more visually interesting so for now okay so for now let me just make the basic for the goals UI something like that always a pain when you have one on top the other yep it is and it's because that pain that annoyance that annoyed me for so long that I finally decided okay I need something something better and that's how I come up with this method of move them to the side and during run time put them back where they should so yeah uh all right so over here I'm going to crack my my todoneless over there uh so I'm going to need a serialized film for a private text mesh Pro ugly for the text mesh just something like that uh all right so I'm going to pretty much just right so it's this one right so this one is the the uh title text this one goes text this one just text yet that doesn't matter all right so let's put the goals text did I not how to resize direct transform by dragging the button by dragging the button what button you mean click and drag for that you need to do a bunch of math so I did a uh uh what do I do on the drag and drop yeah basically you need to do yeah drag and drop windows so basically you need to capture the you need to put a button on the corner something that you want to click and then drag so basically you need to listen to a click on that then need to be able to do some math in order to figure out what position how you're going to modify the width and height and so on so look into that video to see how you can click on something and then for the map the math for resizing you can look at the tooltip which just so happens this the only tip that I made in this tutorial in 2020 I'm actually using this in the game so for the various uh totally I'm actually using quite a lot of things that I've covered in a bunch of videos which is it's always fun so yeah if I go into the main menu and if I continue if I go into one of these look at that that tone tip over there that one that automatically scales depending on what text there is Yep this tooltip is exactly the same thing that I covered in this video in 2020 so here I am uh what is it three years later reusing the exact same code in a game so that is really awesome so yeah that is the the power frame good clean code and doing tons of things is that you can then easily reuse them in lots of different places uh all right so let me get my guns over there and okay so I've got the gold text mesh that I'm not going to do it on update but for now let's go text mesh.txt and I need to figure out how am I going to okay so I need a clone then the dinky amount by dinky so I'm going to need to ask the goal manager okay so on this one let's make a goal manager a instance where they get any private sets and up here on price void awake let's set instance equals this okay so then here go manager the instance and I'm going to need to ask so amount and a public end get dinky amount total total you can save on something on canvas instead of making a custom script Staples uh all right so for thank you amount yeah I'm just going to return the denki amount so just return that one total let's return 30 so this is going to be whatever is the funnel goal on the demo then what are the things am I going to need so is rocket build support is rocket built you need to ask this one for all this so is rocket don't it's really just yeah just going to test if that one is not no so just return that one okay the other goal so uh Heavenly uh int get dinky working amount and basically I'm just going to get to the linking list and figure out which ones are working and then I'm going to return this right here so that Returns the dinkies working and is Colony safe so if only if we'll get last uh attack timer return go into the zombie spawner instance get last get time since the last attack okay so I think with that I've got a bunch of these time is time is double because time won't be overflown if you play for several days I don't think anyone's gonna I mean because technically that is true technically that will overflow but what is default Maxim isn't like four billion so how how much are four billion seconds so four billion seconds in days 46 000 days okay am I wrong is not for billing because that seems way too big but yeah either way the maximum float in terms of seconds that is going to be huge so so yeah I don't think time is definitely going to be a necessity but yeah maybe I'll add it just because I mean storing a double or a float doesn't really matter too much uh but yeah their black point at the left bottom of your screen there's a black point not my point all right uh in this two billion 40 is the same boat with floating points yeah yeah it looks accuracy but I mean if it's something oh you're talking about the microphone over here yeah this is the microphone yeah the tiny Point dot yeah uh uh yeah it's more expert it loses Precision but difference between I don't know 0.1 and 0.9 seconds that really does not does not worry too much you need to wait to cancel actions yep there is a way there is a way why no dark mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it uh all right okay so over here so let me go so clone uh the 30 dinky so I'm going to oh because I'm using that one right uh right so Pierre was that one dot get the dinky amount close get the dinky amount total okay so that is going to be the thing yeah in the end I'm not going to end up doing this in with text but yeah for now text should be fine so let me just see that okay so then then build rockets and then I can go into the goal manager instance so is rocket built if so then I'm going to return done if not then I'm going to return nothing okay and then a new line I need to put this inside a something okay so the next one is the fully automated Colony so if only automate The Colony and then let me go into the goal manager instance get the dinky working amount ah okay so this is going to be tricky zoom out would be nice yep camera controls are definitely uh something that I wouldn't like yeah that is definitely something that I want to implement just didn't get time to do it over here but yep kind of approach would you use for storing multiple game object wrong position Json a good idea from lots of game objects uh yeah sure I mean it all depends on what you're trying to say but over here for my for my dinkies for example all of them they're storing the position so I can have up to like 50 denkis or however and yeah it's not just storing a vector three that stores perfectly fine in a thing a while ago I I showed the uh the uh the save file which has all of those positions so if I go into saves I open up one of these and they're gonna look at that position here is the X here is the Y and here's the set so here's a vector three converted into Json so yep you can definitely store as many of these as you want I mean this looks like a pretty big file and it is a pretty big game quite a bit of that but in reality it's only 30 kilobytes and of course you could obviously optimize this by quite a lot but yeah uh right now 30 count by bites Force I found that is really not something that I'm worried about but yeah uh so yeah if you want to store positions yep Json works perfectly fine for starting quite a lot of them uh okay so over here let me actually uh I'm trying to think of how am I going to do this um do a string fully automate colony something like this it's going to be a bit better because on the dinky amount this one if this one is bigger than zero then what's going to this one and plus equals slash in and say five I think he's working so that should not be like that okay so that is going to be the only automated colony then in your line and finally the last one is just keep Colony safe and then I'm going to go into that one yeah let's do a screen gun so keep keep the colony safe yeah working with strings here not very good but for now just get it working so keep Colony save then let me go into the goal manager the instance and get the what did I call the last attack timer uh I'm trying to think the logic should not be over here on the UI how can you fit all those physics objects we don't like I mean I haven't done anything specific so it's really just uh Unity rigid bodies and the way their physics system works so yeah it could definitely be optimized quite a lot but yeah for now like that should make how to customize buttons you want to like resize or change position on the screen like mobile player have the option to change the button I mean that is mostly just it's really just modifying the the scale of the object so you can access the rec transform you can modify the position the anchor the width so you can modify the size down so that was what I was doing a while ago on this script the reset position script this grow goes into the direct transform and grabs the anchor position and the size Delta so yeah that's pretty much what you would do in terms of logic it's not complex it's just a ton of work you'd have to Define like like for example so you would have like a switch on some kind of private enum for the UI UI size UI size you have small small medium and large you would have something like this and then you do a UI size UI size something like this and you would do a switch on the UI size in case it is UI size dot small okay this you would go into the right transform and set the size Delta to I don't know something like maybe on small you've got 30 by 30 then on something like a medium you would have perhaps 50 by 50 and this one you would have 100 by 100 so that's pretty much what you would do you just Define the sizes then just going to rec transform modified size Delta maybe also modify the anchored position so yeah in terms of logic it is pretty simple it's just quite uh quite verbose right on this code so I would probably make a mono Behavior component something to hold on data so for saying Okay so this component when it's small it should be on this size when it's medium should be on this one this one so on so for that you could actually just make a serialized field of a private Vector 2 for the small size and medium size and so on then you could set this in the editor something like that so yeah so in terms of doing that it's uh pretty simple just takes quite a bit of work here all right uh okay uh right so what I was doing uh I was on the on the girls UI okay get the last type of timer so public boom is Colony safe uh so private operate mode okay maybe a Content I don't know put it here so private mode so Colony save timer so get the colony save timer and let's say the colony is safe after 10 seconds just make it easier to test is Colony saves so return get the last attack timer if it is bigger then is called then the get Colony save timer if so then the colony is safe uh okay so we're here so for the keep the colony safe okay so is Colony safe so if it is safe then let's go into this one and just use equals safe uh if not then I'm going to go into that one and add actually let me add a new line last attack then go into the goal manager instance get the last attack timer and this one is going to need a two string and I always forget the format for the two string is it pound two no I think it's N2 or F2 yeah I think it's F2 or no because that's actually I don't want that yeah now that I'm thinking about it yeah I really just round to end I've got round to end yeah that is going to be enough so let's check on something and then I print so keep Colony safe just print down okay so I think that is going to be the basic text okay and then launch into the space okay let me just add that one so just over here just drop launch into space okay uh all right so I do think the logic should be working all right uh okay so this one should be updating that one the only thing is this one was moving quite a bit wasn't it I think it was okay that's a bit strange the position of the UI because it was maybe four instead of round two tomorrow yeah I I guess uh why is this one showing up in there did I how did I mess up the okay now that's a bit confusing oh never mind because of scale right yeah I modified the scale because it was way too big yeah with skin like that it's going to overlap the control so I'm going to need to modify the controls a little bit yeah why don't you use string formatting with the string interpolation thing uh the answer is simply just because uh by the time that I learned about that one I'm already so used to using just the uh regular plus adding something so yeah the answer is really just just uh being way too used uh just using that for way too long that is really the only answer so if you like that by all means you string interpolation because it is quite a bit easier uh okay so I'm trying to figure ah crap yeah never mind about that ah now I'm clicking everywhere uh all right so that is way too big but I don't care let's just see if it is working okay so let's go back outside let's go in let's continue and let's see all right clone 730 build rocket done fully automate colony and it is apparently fully automated but if I turn one of these to feed some dinkies so let's go do something start the other and there you go one thing key is working okay so the logic is working which is only matters I'm going to obviously need to modify the actual uh logic that's not supposed to be in text but yep that is pretty much it so for the let's just add some colors just for fun uh so red green blue is the color and color and over here for color equals uh let me get an orange so let me figure out some color over here we go into one of these just pick up some kind of like an orange red yeah something like this is a good color okay so let's put down so let's see Conway 40 and less attack color and for dinky's working let me do the same thing so if there are I think he's working you do that and uh if not let me just yeah because I want to put see right because yeah I'm doing that one was equals the done safe done something so fully automate the quality just uh yep just like that so keep the colony safe so keep it safe build the rocket and so on and get the denki amount Stone and build the rocket and done let me just just do that just putting some color just a bit of fun just in case some of you don't know you can use tags in your text which is a nice and easy way to add a little bit of Polish to the text without having to make anything special you can just see include Rich Text tags and everything works and a super Channel thank you Rafael hey thank you have you seen the game captains of industry uh I'm pretty sure I've seen of it but I haven't uh I haven't played it but yeah I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure I saw that one in one of my one of my oh look at that there's my is that my stream yeah there it is so it is working that's great uh yeah is that the one with pixels or something yeah I'm pretty sure I saw this one oh it's this one okay yeah I thought it was another one that has a bunch of voxels and things yeah oh yeah this is the one where you can mine everywhere yeah I remember seeing this one when it came out 31 of May 22 Yeah quite a while ago uh they have very interesting terrain mechanics that I can't figure out uh well for that it's really going to depend on what kind of terrain system you're using I do know that unity's ring system has quite a few limitations so yeah only now I noticed that apparently my camera is yeah only now I noticed that the camera over here the green screen isn't all right yeah only now I noticed that but anyways sure fine stone is still a little bit like that uh anyways uh yeah so that is going to very much depend on what kind of terrain system you're using because yeah they dig all of this because yeah digging to rain in real time that is actually something that is quite complex so yeah I would assume they're using something custom rather than the builtin Unity because I'm pretty sure this is the ENT game but yeah yeah for that it even looks like they've got some kind of voxel grid based terrain the way the terrain is adding in and decreasing seems to be voxel based so yeah maybe that's it maybe you make a Vox on less terrain and pretty much just destroy each chunk at a time so yeah that's definitely one yeah look at that all the levels are very much individualized so they're not very much analog they're either got a home or don't have a home that's pretty much it so but yeah that that is pretty much going to depend on what kind of yeah because even the even the buildings seem to be on like a 3D Vauxhall grid so yeah if I had to guess I would say that I would say the terrain and the entire world has some kind of 3D grid which you can either put some dirt or put nothing on it so yep that pretty much seems to be like that so yeah that that's where I would start my research is how to make some voxel uh terrain thing with quite a bit of with some very good performance which actually right now with dots having just hit 1.0 that would be the perfect thing for doing something like this I mean if you've got a large World using dots using a data oriented approach for storing the the terrain being able to cut it down and build it up that would definitely be my Approach so yeah yeah who knows I mean I would love to do some research on on dots and doing a Terrain system kind of like this could be a fun challenge so yeah thanks for the tip that is really interesting yeah yeah that's part of the reason why I don't like to uh keep doing my series on trying to find uh interesting new releases made with unity it's really just to see what can be done with the engine only that a zombie just spawn look at that that one is terrifying because um yeah so basically checking those checking new releases probably great to be able to see what other people have done with the engine ah crap you go okay just punch them all uh all right so yeah that one is working so build the rocket done fully automate keep the colony safe and yeah I guess the only thing is yeah right for the keep the colony safe uh for that one if my game make a hundred they didn't take 30 dollars Unity doesn't take uh Commission on anything so are you asking about steam because yes in that case yes if you make a hundred bucks of gross revenue on Steam then seem does indeed take 30 percent but Yount doesn't take anything so you can make whatever you want and you know oh yeah I mentioned that dots 1.0 has memory leak really well that's tricky that is definitely going to erase any performance benefits yeah that would be quite tricky then C sharp series I mean if you want Advanced my turnbased strategy course I'm really proud of that course I really think it's a great one really goes for more intermediate users so if you're more on the intermittent level I would say definitely look into that one because yeah in terms of C sharp I don't have anything just on C sharp but yeah C sharp coupled with the game that would be my advice the new input system and Odin in your games I do use the new input system although I do it just like I covered in my in my free course which is first I start by just using the input measure which is exactly what I'm using here over here this game which is right now in the alpha demo Sage this one is still just using the input manager then at some point I'm going to refactor into using the new input system so yep I start with the input manager then eventually I I move up and in terms of Odin uh on this game I haven't really had a reason to use it because it doesn't really have way too much that needs I just made a simple editor's work just once but yeah for the most part on this one doesn't really I've got tons of sort of modules so maybe it would be useful to use Odin to make a tune to like make them but even though I've got a ton of script and objects these were all very much made slowly over time so there never was a point when I'm like okay so I need to build like 50 scriptable objects so yeah that didn't really happen so I didn't really have a need for a tool to make that part super easy to add so yeah right now I'm using the input Venture but I won't be using the input system in terms of Odin I don't know maybe if I get to a point where I need a where I need to do a ton of things maybe but yeah all right uh Okay so Yeah so basically just with this it is working just on the keep Colony safe the one thing that I do want to uh check is keep Colony save is meant to be safe automatically it is not meant to be so let me just pause this just so this doesn't save anything um so the thing with this one is that it's meant to be automatic because basically over here I'm testing for the time since the last attack but but I want to make sure that the defense is automatic that's basically what I want to do I want to to encourage the player to make the colony fully selfsustainable including with the fence so the player is not meant to actually attack anything so I need to keep track of hmm okay so let me think uh so I need like a yeah I guess I just need another one so I got the last time attack uh so this is the last zombie time attack and then I've got another one for the last player time attack okay then on this one second last Zoom be time attack okay and then I'm going to have one for the set last for the player time attack so the last player time attack because basically I need oh no that's sectionally tricky because the player can actually attack with quite a bit of things no with the factory pattern I'm familiar with it but I always forget about it so yeah I don't know it off top of my head for creating instances of classical objects seem similar better than the basic Constructor uh yeah I know of the factory pattern but I've never actually used it uh and nowadays I really don't normally use the base Constructor so for script margin like for example like carry object so uh where's the definition so here it is I just make a certain object with a create asset menu so I don't even use any I don't use anything special for creating it so I just go over here into one of these going to create and here are all my scribbling objects so if I want to make a tune carry object I just make one of these if I want to make a new text so this is the research I just did one of these our new crafting recipe and so on so yeah I've never really used the factory pattern I know it's interesting and sometimes useful but yeah stream dying is it dying it's saying excellent connection so apparently it's what is dying is my throat so yeah that's normal and I'm running out of water so yeah okay let me just uh try to see this I'm quite a bit the strike today I have to say doing live streams is fun but it definitely is quite physically demanding and it does take uh does make me quite a bit less productive what network SDK are you using I'm using netcode for game objects so basically the idea why I started making this game was because I was making my free multiplayer course where I use net code for game objects to make a multiplayer game and I really enjoyed it so that is why I decided to make this game I really wanted to make something in multiplayer so yep and so far it has been very good I've been using it and I had a few strange very random issues but for the most part it has been very good very nice yeah complaining unit of course on kitchen chaos hey good luck yeah that's awesome yeah I hope you'll learn a lot yeah that course has been really nice a lot of people have really enjoyed it so yeah I'm glad people are enjoying it pop your head with water yeah that's a I really prefer this bottle as opposed to a twisty thing so that is so much more efficient super easy to open and close real nice okay so the player on last time attack so basically I just need to go and once again thanks so much for the Super Chat I hope my answer helped so look into voxels perhaps with dots and that's basically how I would try it I think that would be pretty good Unity company isn't near you I'm pretty sure Unity does not have offices over here in Portugal so nope I wonder what is the closest one do they have one in Spain I don't think so so I think the closest would probably be their offices in either London or Berlin not sure which one is is closer so yeah and unite is going to be in Amsterdam this year so that's going to be fun yeah I hope they don't be able to attend so that should be that should be interesting uh all right okay so uh now I'm just trying to figure out how do I okay so that's actually on the zombie I'm trying to remember how do I handle the damage it's over here so for taking damage yeah because I got a damage but I don't have oh right it's on the Canon tract so on try interact this is the one that is going to all right because this is one of the first ones okay then cut a stream yeah a random stream let's be Portuguese yep I mean I'm right here born here so yep even though honestly my brain works more in English and does important she is but yeah I do I pretty much only use Portuguese when when in real life so like going to gym talking to someone talking to a friend yeah that's pretty much the only time that I use Portuguese everything else always with English uh okay so on the try to interact I'm just trying to see am I going to do it here or on the other one and I guess this is always going to run on the server so put on the server I don't have that okay so this is a bit tricky hmm okay so that's a bit tricky but actually no because yeah I'm trying to think okay so I interact in order to deal on damage to the zombies but yeah right the only one that ever uses this the dinkies are never going to attack the zombies and the automated Bots those are also not going to attack the zombie so yeah sure so I think in here on the server I've seen I can just go into the zombie spawner the instance and set the last player time attack because this one is only ever going to be called for the thing shout out please you want me to shout I don't think my voice can handle shouting universe or Mainland I'm in Mainland you're in Lisbon so yeah are you planning to finance your game in the long term can happen that the TNT Services costs eat up your income at some point uh not really I mean so far the demo has gone pretty decently I think I've had like 1500 people playing the demo something like that and basically it is still well within the uh three tiers so yeah so far with a bunch of people playing on relay a bunch of people using the lobby and uh I'm still on the on the free tier so I still don't have to pay one cent so I don't think that is going to be an issue the free tiers on the Unity gaming Services tools those three tiers are I would say pregen uh pretty generous so yep that is so yeah basically I'm not too worried about it I'm going to keep using them and I do think they won't work quite well okay so set the last player time attack okay yet time since the last Zoom be attack and then I needed another one for get time since the last player attack so the last player attack and basically on the goals on the goal manager so the last so so in order to Define if the colony is safe I need to see both of them right so get the last zombie attack timer if it is bigger than that one and the get the last player attack timer and this one is going to be pretty much the exact same thing so get the last player attack timer so get time since last player attack so if that one is also under the get Colony save time or not others that one is above if so then that means it has been more than 10 seconds since either a zombie attack or a player attacked the zombie so if I do that then yeah I do think that's Logic for getting the colony safe okay great been enjoying tears of the Kingdom I was until I until like four weeks ago when I started really uh sprinting to get the demo done in time and since then I haven't touched the game yet so yeah now now that the festival is over which should be over right now at 6 PM is it over uh where's my where's my thing store.steampower.com is the festival over okay so apparently the festival is already over so yeah now that the festival is over the Sprint pretty much ends so hopefully for the rest of this week I can get back to uh doing it a bit more calm and look at that the only stream is on there that's one uh yeah oh and by the way I'm not uh removing the demo so if you want to see the updates that I've been seeing I'm going to try to push another update today so yeah if you want to see that uh definitely I'm going to leave the demo up so feel free to download it and go ahead and add it to your wish list because that really does help uh all right so let me just quickly uh test out what I was doing so let's say okay so one two three four five seconds six seven eight nine and ten any up now the colony is safe okay so now let me spawn a zombie so let me spawn a Zoomy and once again let me sacrifice one of these linkies so sorry about that but okay so let's go find the zombie there it is throw them there okay so let's see that one still safe now let's attack in one second okay so now it's going to go like that okay now if I punch him it should actually reset that so if I reset and nope oh no but yes yeah exactly because now it's going above 10 12. so now it's going to say safe okay now it says save and I'll punch him and still says that okay so I just gotta update the timer but yeah pretty much that does work don't have any Minds I need to make some Minds uh okay so yeah if I attack him okay that's good that means that reset the timer which is good so right now I've gotten logic in order to be able to ensure that the colony is some sustaining so if I attack a zombie it becomes unsafe if a zombie attacks a denki it becomes unsafe so that's great that's his own logic that I want uh just need to go there on the uh I'm going to go and see why it's on the keep Colony safe uh unless attack do I pick the smallest or the biggest the smallest right yeah I think it is a small so math F dot Min pick the smallest between the get last zombie attack timer and get the last player attack timer so pick the smallest of those and yep that's time all right so that's the logic working all right I'm out of water so just gonna be a little bit are there classes for dinkies in the game uh you mean like different abilities uh not really although uh they all do different things so I can expect they I can tell them to do all kinds of things so I can tell dinky to follow me which I think is a a pretty fun thing so like for example if I wanted to make a new thing I can go up tell them hey carry some apples and let's go and build a brand new Outpost over on the side so I can tell them to follow me which is pretty fun I can tell them to fit some dinkies add power interact with machines get resource notes grab objects or move some crates so yep they can do quite a lot of things so not really classes they're all just one dinky but they can do all kinds of things and look at that one thank you working because they cannot be following me so let's put this one back into idle any of them now the colony is fully automated okay C sharp string interpolation yeah I know I just never I just never got used to that so I just do close at the points that just feels uh very automatic premium very automatic to me by now yeah does the player take damage from enemies like in factorio uh nope for uh I really wanted to focus more on actually damaging dinky so you don't like have to protect them but I don't know that's when those design questions that really the answer only comes after play testing so who knows maybe didn't I have some Minds over here no no no no no go away all right so yeah it's the combat that obviously still needs quite a bit of work I still need to make uh actual spawn points for where the zombies are going to come from I think that is going to be much better in order to make it okay like for example lets you keep the colony safe so if I make a bunch of let me spawn a few uh let me spawn a bunch of Chase mines and let me also spawn a zombie sorry for example that one says save so if I punch that one it is going to suddenly become unsafe but if I take a mine and if he gets killed either with the mine or with the tower the one should not reset so there it goes boom any up it does now reset all right awesome so the logic does work okay so I just need to figure out play around with the visual as well a little bit but yep multiple courses which one do you recommend most for someone that wants to make type of games you are making uh that really depends on your skill set where you are but I would recommend starting with my free complete course so this one is completely free you can watch it on YouTube it's 10 hours long so if you're a beginner I would say start with that one and if you're more of an advanced user I would recommend the turn based strategy course this one goes on making quite a bit more complex game so it covers lots of more advanced things so it's a game kind of like XCOM so you start you play in a grid you do all kinds of things you've got all kinds of actions you've got enemies grenades things ragdolls it's a prefun game definitely involves quite a lot more complexity so if you're a more advanced user maybe look into this course but if you're a beginner then just start with my free course just that one will teach you quite a lot okay what time are we doing Emoji rates the rest of my text doesn't you mean over here on my overlay because yeah the uh the thing over here text mesh Pro this one probably does not recognize emojis so yeah which one of your workout monkey oh that's awesome start my own gaming company and build games that is cool nice let's see you have a webcam now yeah always imagining this little monkey talking super fast yep I am human I am indeed human all right thanks for being here thanks for watching the video so I'm glad I'm glad they've been useful to you uh okay so let me just figure out just the visuals in that and actually the rocket that one is not done only now I realize how to make the dark outlines and all the objects that is I'm using the equivali anime shaders and tools so if you want this is the exact asset that I'm using in the game in order to make it look quite interesting and this asset also has a bunch of outlines yeah went through your turnbased strategy course it was a huge help on the card game based off the grid system oh nice a lot of ideas and Implement oh that's awesome hey congrats on completing the course and using it to make something original yeah congrats that it's really awesome nice and she get me and my entire friend group into game development ah that is awesome that is really cool I love seeing those kinds of comments yeah that's awesome what the video sound uh all right okay so let me just let me just visually work on that and yeah then it's probably gonna be it because my voice only quite a bit messed up it's already past 6 p.m so I still got to clean up a bunch of things so yeah uh okay so let me just let me go figure that out and just play with the visual little bits let me go into the goal and see why so I gotta scale it down by a little bit yeah this is actually going to be quite tricky yeah because I was making it 70 by 70. uh well actually for the because can I move the next I got the controls over here but the controls can definitely move a little bit okay so I think I just moved the controls a little bit just over here if it's on 20 is this still readable yeah it's still readable all right so yeah let's put just on 18 okay right now obviously I'm going to come up with a proper thing but for now okay so for now put it to the 18 let me just well let me first just copy the controls UI so copy this component stop playing let me go into the control c y let me paste this component values and for the other one for the goals UI for the guns text let's put it whether I put 18 something like that put check marks in front yeah that's that's good I do think text mesh Pro does support some emojis but I don't know how many so yeah we'll see but um you know let me just make it just a little bit smaller on that one and yeah okay but actually I still need to figure out how am I going to because that one says don't rock it but that is actually not true yeah the rocket is still one part that is not fully built because I still I made all the logic but I haven't yet handled all the costs of the all the various things uh but the stage yeah that's it he goes I do think that it already works but uh okay so let's go here's the public boom is rocket only built just return if the stage equals the the Nikon stage what the record I called it Sage try not save the stage stage dot done try not oh right because I put it stage it's a network variable ah crap let's go down uh the stage dot value if that one is done so the rocket is fully built so on the goal manager so is rocket build down if that one is not known and rocket go in the rocket base rocketbase dot instance that is the rocket form we don't if so it is fully Bond if not then I need to build it okay all right so yeah that should be working except yeah the rocket Stone does not have any cost so I still need to add the one UI and so on horizontal grid layout to Auto size for your UI uh yeah I am using those in quite a few places but yeah uh right now for the UI I'm really just looking for the most basic thing possible right now polishing DUI isn't really something that I'm worried too much about I'm just first of all focus on getting everything working and then I'll focus on actually polishing things okay so build rocket now that one does not say that it's done because it's not done and I need to once again the UI this needs to be updated because right now it doesn't say what are the costs for the rocket so I'm going to need to play around with that by quite a lot so let me pick up some of these create containers and just put a bunch of them okay so let's just see if this works it should be working for single player same time for multiplayer yep everything here is working both in single player and multiplier yeah thanks to using netcode for game objects this is actually surprisingly easy I mean you just make something work you just create a local instance and it automatically works just in single player okay none of them have green crystals let me grab some green cursors there's a ton of them over here so let's go I think this one has five things none of them have some food so let's put some food all right so I need to show these costs but yeah oh I put a progress bar I forgot about that that's good okay yeah so I think this one is let me actually just inspect the rocket the rocket based loan let me put this on debug View so on the rocket base here are the costs so then just yeah I put just one gem green so right now it's on oh interesting the stage that one stores as an INT instead of the text so that's fun that is interesting uh so yeah it is on internal value 2 which means that it can still go one more so I think this is the enlistment so zero one two three yeah I think that one so as soon as I finish that one the build rocket that one should say done did I do that I think I did that and nope so we got one more okay stage three so if I go to the end this one it should go into stage four which is done and that one should be done and there you go done all right awesome so internal value done okay so actually just named it easily that because that one says the done and done so yeah I named zero one two three all right yep okay so yeah that logic works all right so I do need to somehow show the cost I need to do some design work in order to come up with some proper cause for all these so that is going to be question that I need to do and show those cards to the players so they know what to build and with that then I just need to clone the rest of dinkies once those are done then all the goals will be done then just interact this in order to go outside yep sometimes get lost between all the lines and codes in your scripts uh sometimes but over here in Visual Studio something really useful is a shortcut control and comma and over here you can search for all kinds of things for example I don't remember when is uh when am I spawning some zombies so just search for Zoomy and then look and over again I see okay I've got a zombie class then I've got some zombie events and I've got a zombie spawners and be Visual and so on I can then search for dinky and see all the references where I'm referencing denki so tons of things tons of events dinky Network managers on lots of things so yeah so this search bar over here if you ever forget something that is really really useful so that's control comma if you're on Visual Studio it is super useful okay I'm out of water and my mouth is messed up so okay so I think that's gonna be it so I did a little bit of work not as much as I would like but still it was all right so I just gotta finish this up in order to make another in order to make another update and then that should be interesting but yep at least right now logic done done so getting all those goals that did indeed work so this was indeed correct so the time take that did work correctly okay all right so that's gonna be it that was fun that was interesting I need to drink some more and so on okay so let me just enable the background and just do that all right uh it's your birthday it's in May and can we see doggo I mean they're both asleep so nope sorry that doesn't work uh all right I wish you would get some feedback as to your game yep I definitely I definitely want to but yes still haven't had the time there are so many things that I'm trying to do so yeah so for now if you've got some feedback you can just post on these theme forums or in my YouTube comments and I'll make sure to see it and thank you so much for the feedback all right uh okay so that's gonna be it I need drink some water and do a bunch of stuff so yeah once again thank you all so much for joining me on this random live stream in the middle of the week I hope you've been playing the demo I hope you've been enjoying it uh if not go ahead and make sure you add the game to your wish list give demo a try and let me know what you think let me know your feedback all right so yeah uh thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you next time alright bye everyone thanks
