hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the SSR is full of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for April 23. even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great to unlock them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these asks is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is only separed ass and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and best tones and systems as always there's links in the apps in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now there's a sale on the cinti store all of their packs are discounted covering every theme and every genre you can think of I talked about lots of potential game ideas you could make with all of these in the same video and right now there's also a humble with a bunch of Game Dev TV courses on making all kinds of RPG elements I remember going through the inventory course and I quite liked it so at least these four are really good using some nice lean code you can get all of these scores for just 25 bucks oh and a while ago I worked with the SSR team to make a really nice landing page if you'd like to see my most recommended assets in some related videos then definitely check it out everything is linked in the description alright so starting off with a really awesome animation pack this one is some Stanley charger animations really impactful really flashy so you can see this being great for some kind of action game like Devil May Cry next for something quite a bit more calm here is a lookout tower it's very realistic great models great textures looking at this first thing it reminds me of is the tower in days gone for some really nice stylized effects here is a great pack it features in total 100 prefabs all of them look really nice there are some projectiles some explosions a bunch of Sparks auras whirlwinds and tons more if you need an environment here is a junk Town very interesting asset I could see this being some kind of outpost and some open world game maybe something like Fallout it's pretty big and the buildings are modular so you can build endless variety next for a super detailed character here is a samurai warrior this one is made by Maxim this dev has tons of super high quality characters it works on all of the render pipelines and also has a humanoid rig for something quite a bit more fantastic on here is a nice mimic Treasure Chest if you're working on some kind of Diablo like or dark sounds like then something like this is a musthave it looks just like a regular chest and then all of a sudden a bunch of tentacles pop out for a realistic environment here is a calm Autumn Forest this one is egrp only it features some very high quality trees and bushes if you need some stylized action props here is a great pack all of them look really nice very bubbly very friendly they share the same material so you have just one dracon features everything from some hightech weapons some swords helmets TNT and even some money for some spell casting check out this projectile VFX it includes 10 projectiles with lots of different colors also includes 10 hit effects and 10 flash effects if you already have the effects and you just need an environment then here is a stylized fantasy Town it looks really nice I just recently watched the Zombie Trailer and this could be taken straight from that game features some very inviting colors everything looks really relaxing maybe you're working on something inspired by retro games if so then this effects pack would be perfect features 8 unique effects you can make your game look like VHS make it pixelated or asking make it imitate a spectrum or perhaps a Game Boy then how about a really cute dog here is a bolt area with a bunch of animations it's a really cute art style the number of animations actually quite insane features almost 300 animations and if you like this style then this dev has tons more different dogs perhaps you have a game with some liquids if so and you want to make them look good then check out this one it's a Shader effect where you can place these liquids on just about any shape it can be used in 3D scenes or 2D UI demos features a dozen ready prefabs easily fill it up or drain it up up next here's a giant pack with tons of 2D weapons it's pretty cheap considering it has 100 weapons there's lots of variety tons of pistols rifles launchers knives and a bunch more then here's a fun one some magical hands seems like this one is more than just the visuals it also includes a FPS player controller with some code to shoot projectiles directly out of the hands so you can see this being really useful as a starting point for some kind of Wizard game next if you want several gorgeous looking real only sequence and check out this bundle personally I dislike the task of World building so I'm a huge fan of these kinds of packs with some prebuilt gorgeous scenes this one includes a winter World a Terrain Mediterranean and some Caverns then for some pixel art here are a bunch of spell books this pack is really nice because it actually has multiple sizes going from extremely pixelated to just a tiny bit so it can match many different pixel art styles it includes 70 spell books in total or maybe you need some nice and inviting UI here is a magical one it features a very nice casual style some very block visuals this would fit great on a game kind of like stardew Valley or perhaps you're working on a card game if you need a way to build tons of cars then this pack looks great easily build cars from over 300 images so you have lots of shapes elements and a bunch of backgrounds if you're more into scifi then here is a nice space station looking at this I could immediately see this as being very useful for some kind of Mars City Builder or some kind of management game it includes two demo scenes and almost 400 assets alright so those are my top 20 new
