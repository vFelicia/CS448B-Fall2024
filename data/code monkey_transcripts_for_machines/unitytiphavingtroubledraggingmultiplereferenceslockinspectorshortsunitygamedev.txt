here's a quick unity tip let's say you have a certain script with a list or array that you want to fill so i want to fill in this item list with all of my items now one approach is to drag them all one by one so just click and drag and so on that's not very efficient especially if you have a ton of items so instead you can use shift click to select a bunch of items but now the inspector has changed so you can no longer drag it so here's a tip select your object with the script then there's this nice lock button click on it and now even if you select another object it will keep this one in the inspector now you can select all the items and drag them all at once click once again to unlock okay subscribe for more tips
