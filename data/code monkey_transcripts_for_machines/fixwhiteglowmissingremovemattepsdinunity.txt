in this video we're going to learn how to fix the missing PSD remove math option when importing Photoshop files we're going to learn why sprites have a white glow and the various ways we can solve it let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with enough tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing so this is a pretty quick video about a really frustrating change in unity and I hope this helped someone out recently unity start adding this message to imported PSD files PSD Zara Photoshop files it says that this option has been deprecated and will probably be removed now for me I normally use PS DS while I'm making my game since I can just open Photoshop modify textures save it and it's automatically updated it's very simple and very quick and works fine since unity automatically creates the alpha Channel however it seems on one of the 2018 versions they did remove it with regards to newly added funds so this file in here was present before the change and as you can see still has the remove map option however this file in here was added after that version and as you can see that option is nowhere to be seen this is pretty terrible because without it as you can see the sprite looks all messed up so let's drag it in here and there you go you see that white color that's exactly what happens whereas on the Apple texture in here it's perfect without a white cloud essentially this is an issue with the Alpha Channel that that option automatically creates so you have three ways to fix this issue now number one you can manually add the option back so for that we can open the textures folder here it is my project files textures folder as you can see I have the Apple PSD medkit PSD and each one has its own meta file you can open the meta file with any text editor you have this is all the information that unity uses with regards to this file and if you scroll down into the bottom here you can see these two options PSE remove math and show remove math option we can manually save this into one save the file close it and now if we go back into unity as you can see the white color disappeared and the option is now in there so this is great and it works but since they say in here that it is deprecated I have no idea how long this fix will work so let's look at up number two you can still keep using PS DS but you must create an alpha Channel so here is that texture opened in Photoshop so I can add a new layer let's paint it in black now select this layer so it's unlike all the pictures that have color now go up here into select and save selection and name this the Alpha Channel here in the channels as you can see it now has an alpha Channel which contains our texture now we save this and if we go back into unity you can see that it's not using the unity option to remove the matte and it no longer has the glow so again the issue with the glow is always because of the alpha Channel so if your texture is very simple just like this and you only have one layer then this is quite simple however every time you modify your texture and let's say I wanted to add a simple pixel in here on the side if I want this to show up I can save it go back in here and as you can see it doesn't show because the Alpha Channel needs to be updated so once again you gotta come in here save again a new Alpha Channel don't like the old one and I go and now it does update the texture so as you can see it's very much Boreas to work without that helpful unity feature and the more layers you have the more complicated this process gets you need to duplicate merge layers and save the Alpha Channel now I'm not a Photoshop expert so I could be missing something here so if you know what an easier way to upload an alpha Channel in a file with lots of layers please let me know so that's your second option to manually create the Alpha Channel now for option number three you can simply use PNG s in here if I remove the Alpha Channel and also remove the black background and I save it as a PNG here is my medkit PNG here is the medkit PSD and the PNG in here and if I drag the PNG as you can see there's no white glow and it works perfectly fine whereas for the PSD say without a background as you can see there's the white glow back again now the big issue with this method is that every time you want to modify something you would need to go into Photoshop in here and modify your text and then save it again as a PNG and then it would update in here that also means that all of your textures won't be duplicated with one PNG and one PSD so these are three options you have for the only way the entities we're decision to remove this feature I really hope they don't completely remove it since there doesn't seem to be any benefit whatsoever I usually keep my texture as always as PSD is while I'm developing my game so this change is pretty bad and quite disruptive to my workflow if they completely remove this feature it won't force me to manually create alpha channels or render everything in PNG s either option will add unnecessary complexity to my workflow so I really hope they don't completely remove it in 2019 anyways I hope this helps out someone if you're missing the option or your sprites have white clothes now you know why that is and what you can do about if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
