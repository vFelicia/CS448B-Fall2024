hello and welcome I'm your code monkey miniseries were making snake in unity in this video we're going to set up the UI so we can display our score let's begin okay so here is our game so far we can move around with a snake there is food being spawn which we can eat which makes the snake grow and we can also go into the size and these snake wraps around to the other side of the unlevel so now we want to display the current score in the UI so here in the editor let's go inside the game handler game object not to keep our scene nice and organized and now in here let's make a new game object and we're going to call this the UI and here you can leave it on any position but personally I'd like to put it to the side so let's put it on a thousand on the X and a thousand on the Z so just like that this is our UI on the side and our scene is in there okay this way in the scene view the UI is not blocking the origin of our game scene all right so this game object is a container for the you are so inside let's create a canvas and as you can see the event system was automatically created so let's drag it inside there and now here in the options for our canvas let's change the render mode from screen space overlay into screen space camera this allows you to assign a camera that will display the UI which is what we're going to do so let's create that camera create a new camera let's call this the UI camera make it a orthographic camera to be in 2d and give it a size of a hundred and now drag that camera onto our canvas so just like that we've got a camera that is displaying everything that is in do you want seen here for example I can create a UI image there is in the game scene we have an image being displayed okay also on our camera options make sure you change the clear flags to don't clear that way our main camera is still visible behind the u1 back in the canvas on the canvas scaler for the scale mode let's select scale with screen size this resizes the UI elements to fit the screen and resolution and the reference resolution is the main resolution for your UI if the color resolution is smaller everything will be scaled down and if it's bigger it won't be scaled up so when developing for desktop I don't like to set it to 720p so 1280 by 720 and for the match mode and let's fully match with the height so for example if I go in here and I change the aspect ratio you can see that the square was not sighs it maintains the same size but if I drag the window and make it smaller on the vertical axis then you can see that the square is correctly being resized so with you I set up like this you can place everything vertically and only have to worry about horizontal movement and the reference pixels per unit leave it at 100 okay so now our UI is correctly set up now inside the canvas is where we're going to put any UI objects so let's create a game object for the score window and inside our score window we're going to need a text object to display the current score so a new UI text object this will be our score text okay so just like that we have a nice text field to display our current score so now let's make a script to handle it so in our scripts folder make a new C sharp script this will be our spore window now in here let's set up a private Boyd awake where we're going to grab the reference for our text object so here okay so we now have a reference to our score text which we can change to have the actual score so now we actually need to deal with creating the score so we're going to do that on the game handler so in here let's go all the way down here and we're going to store it as static so we can easily grab it from our UI window so first let's go up here make a private static game handler in order to store a instance and we're going to set it on our private void awake and then let's have the private static int to store our score and down here let's make some functions to manage our scores in here so we have a nice function to return the score and let's also make one in order to add score so we similarly increase the score by 100 okay so this is very simple and we now have a nice score in a static variable in our game hammer so we can now go into our score window and here make a private void update and on our update let's set these score text dot text to be from the game handler dot get score so we ask the game hammer to get the score and we update our score text so very quickly let's see if it says zero when we run our code and yep there's the score text being updated in order to say zero okay so now obviously we need to actually call our game hammer that score so we're going to increase score every time we eat some food so let's go into the unleavened bread and here we have the snake trying to eat some food and if it does successfully eat the food we destroy the food game objects but another one and let's also tell the game hammer that we need to add some score so now let's see if our score updates whenever we eat some food there's the snake currently got a score zero and if I eat this and yep there you go now you have a score of 100 in another one and 200 and 300 and so on so we now have a very nice UI element to display our current score so there you have it we set up the UI canvas and add a text field to display the current score in the next video we're going to set up loading so we can reload the game when we done as always you can download the project files in utilities from unity karma Keep Calm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time you
