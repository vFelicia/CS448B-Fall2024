hello and welcome i'm your code monkey in this channel i normally cover tutorials for how you can build your own games in unity but in this video instead of doing it ourselves let's take some time to look at some great games that showcase the power and versatility of the unity engine this is actually the second video so if your favorites aren't here then maybe they're in the first one alright so when i watched the previous top 10 video most of the comments were saying where is hollow knight so here it is this is one of the biggest platformers of recent years it's got a look that stands out with an interesting unique world full of buglike creatures and the most important thing of all is it's got some excellent very tight controls whether you fail or succeed is entirely up to you if you're a fan of platformers then this is without a doubt one of the best in the genre the upcoming sequel hollow knight song song is one of the most anticipated games and it is currently number four on this team's most wanted list again this is an indie game but it's fighting toetoe with some of the biggest aaa titles and succeeding that's very inspiring for something hyper realistic you've got escape from tarkov another game that people are surprised to hear that it's made with unity this is a gorgeous looking hardcore survival multiplayer shooter you go on raids loot items and try to survive if you're into some high stakes pvp then this is just for you it came out in closed beta quite a while ago and it's been very successful on twitch since then it is still in that closed beta and in development with constant updates and it is also currently not available on steam so all this time they've been selling the game directly on their website so it's an excellent example of how with a really solid game you can still find success without seeing it's obviously extremely difficult but it can be done by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks next up we've got super hot you can describe this game in one sentence and it's immediately appealing time only moves when you move that's it that's a very appealing concept combine that with the visuals that send out right away and you have yet another in the mega hit this one actually started off life as a game jam game so that's some excellent inspiration for you to take your own game jam games and see if maybe you can flash them out into a complete game game jams are usually great for coming up with some very unique concepts so if you do manage to come up with something really interesting then it might be worth it to push it forward also for this game you have not just the normal desktop version but also a vr version it is without a doubt one of the best vr games that you can buy if you are still skeptical about vr then all you need to do is play super hot vr and the second that you dodge a bullet like in the matrix you won't become a believer punching enemies slicing bolts in half and throwing bottles are such simple actions but so very satisfying if you have vr headset then you definitely need to try it before we see the rest of this list

supporting the channel then here's the game that seemed to surprise everyone with how good it is genchin impact a lot of people were surprised with how this game that features such a massive open world is being made with yinti it is also an interesting game in that the initial reception went into its first revealed in a trailer that reception was somewhat negative with people saying it borrowed too much from breath of the wild to the point that it looked like a clone however as soon as it came out it sounds all of those criticisms that assume the game was just an uninspired clone instead what it is is definitely a game that takes great inspirations from other awesome games like worth the while but it uses those mechanics as a jumping off point and expands upon them in different ways the end result is a great game that has been very well received on both consoles pc and mobile it's very tricky to get all of those platforms right but they did do it it is also a free to play game which usually comes with a negative stigma but in this case people seem to find the monetization very well implement then if you're the kind of person who loves boss fights then you need to play fury it's a boss rush game just boss fight after boss fight every battle is unique and every boss has lots of different stages for you to learn and finally defeat features very tight controls and very satisfying combat mechanics timing is definitely key you must learn the patterns dodge incoming attacks and counter at the perfect time also features an interesting unique story in a mysterious world with some very good voice acting and an excellent soundtrack next up here is another huge recent mega hit among us it's a deception game you play with others and one person is the imposter you must do a bunch of tasks and either identify the imposter or if it's you then you need to eliminate everyone else it makes for some really interesting social gameplay and part of the fun is just talking to others and convincing them that you're not the imposter in the previous video like this one i highlighted the untitled goose game that's a game that found massive success in terms of marketing and among us is another example of how success can happen nowadays the game actually came out on the way back in 2018. it was doing alright but nothing too special then in 2020 it started getting picked up by some youtubers and getting really popular on twitch and all of a sudden the game took over the world also the developers are very smart when the game started blowing up they immediately canceled plans for a separate sequel that they were already working on and instead focus on their efforts to continually update this game and keep the momentum going finding success as an indie developer is very difficult so if you do manage to find it then make sure you grab it as hard as you can and don't let go for something that looks very inviting here is hitman go it's a hitman game where you play on a series of gorgeous looking dioramas it takes the head man formally you know and love and scales it down into a simple but effective turn based puzzle game so you still have disguises distractions sniper rifles and even the iconic silver ballers lots of enemy types with unique behaviors and different ways for completing each level either soundly or with force it's a great example of how you can take something and give it a twist to come up with something that is simultaneously familiar and still it feels fresh then a game made by a massive studio that decided to use unity for a side project here is gwent it's made by cd projekt red the makers of the witcher and cyberpunk it's a really awesome card game it first showed up as a mini game inside the witcher 3 and people loved it so much that they expand upon it and made a standalone version you draw cards with various units and place them on separate positions on the battlefield i've never actually played the standalone version but it was always one of the best things that i loved in the witcher 3. i really like the design of the game even though usually i'm not into card games it's free to play and has received tons of updates since it first came out 4 years ago it's available on both pc and mobile then if you want to see something that pushes unity to its limits in terms of complexity then check out carbon space program it's a simulation game where your main goal is to build a spaceship that can actually fly they use proper realistic physics so not only is it fun to play but it's also educational and all of those series simulation mechanics are combined with some very similar characters so the vibe of the game is really enjoyable you build spaceships rockets and vehicles with tons of parts at your disposal each with their own function that will affect the way your spacecraft behaves construct space stations massive starships and bases on new planets it's a sandbox where you can spend hundreds of hours just tinkering with your creations originally came out in 2015 and it's got tons and tons of updates since then the last one was three months ago there's currently a sequel in development it's also using unity and promises to expand upon it in every way possible for something that suddenly became very popular thanks to recent events here is plagiance it's a strategy game where you create a pathogen and attempt to take over the world you choose from multiple types like viruses bacteria parasites and more each of them has their pros and cons to suit your preferred playstyle as you expand you gain skunk points to spend in mutations that have all kinds of effects it's a very unique concept and very well executed and because of those recent world events they made a free dlc that flips the game on its head it's named the cure and just like name implies your goal is to eliminate the virus and heal the world if you're into turnbased tactical games like xcom then phoenix point is a great new entry in the genre and it's made with unity you fight tactical battles on procedurally generated maps against a foe that adapts to your tactics manage diplomacy and economy on a global scale you must research explore and overcome your obstacles in order to succeed it's from the studio formed by the creator of the original xcom games it's a pretty complex game manage your action points carefully target the correct body parts and bring your soldiers back in life victory is not easy but it is satisfying alright so there you have it 11 more super awesome games that showcase the power of the unity engine you can really build anything that you can think of you can build small focused games like hitman go or massive worlds unlike engine impact you can make games with simple visuals like super hot or you can go hyper realistic like escape from tarkov so i hope these games serve to inspire you in your own game development journey the only limit is your
