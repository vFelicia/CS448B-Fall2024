bra is is back while you should create the same game over and over again one of the most anticipated games of all time has released H divers 2 completely imploded and then recovered and more here's the most important news in Game Dev Tekken gaming today is the 13th of May of 2024 and you're watching The Game Dev report starting off with some quick Unity news Unity has found a new CEO his name is Matthew Bromberg and right away people were a little bit concerned when they saw that he came from EA and Zinga so people feared that Unity might go back to the Rick Del era and lose its focus again however Matthew was at EA specifically at BioWare during their Heyday and Zinga regardless of whether you like mobile games or not they are a very successful company he was also the CEO of Major League Gaming back in the day so he definitely does have a strong gaming background I haven't heard too much on the vibe inside Unity itself it seems that no one knows too much about them there's just a vague message from will who has been at Unity for 20 years whereas when Jim White Hurst became the interim CEO the sentiment inside and outside the company was positive right away I did actually have a quick meeting with Jim and some other y insiders when he became the interim CEO and I told him how my concern would be that he makes all these nice positive changes of refocusing on the core of the engine which is awesome but then the next CEO would come in and completely change things back that was my concern and his answer was that he's confident that if he manages to turn the ship around if he does that and gets the company refocused then whoever comes afterwards won't complain destroy all of that from what I can see Jim was involved in picking new CEO and Jim is staying on board so hopefully that means this direction of refocusing on the core game engine is continuing there are some interviews with Matthew and it sounds like he's of the same mindset as Jim being player and Community Focus so hopefully this trend won't continue the unite conference later in September this year should be an interesting time then in some pretty huge game that news brais is back this was definitely an unexpected surprise in case you don't know brais was by far the biggest game to have channel for a long time specifically for Unity millions of views and 1.7 million subscribers he made lots of tutorials mostly beginner focus with an excellent presentation I've certainly learned a lot myself on how to better present my tutorials by watching his videos he retired from YouTube three years ago and now suddenly out of nowhere he came back and the big thing is how he came back to make tutorials on gdau instead of unity the gdau community is obviously ecstatic about this he already put out his first video a 1our video covering the basics and making a nice simple platform game I watch it myself to see an overview for how good works so what is a node how components are attached how they use physics how the to Maps work and so on the video is really great excellent presented so if you are a g developer or if you're a Unity or unreal Dev and just want to see how the engine works then definitely go ahead and watch it in more Unity news Unity 6 preview is out right now now this is important because this is the last version before the LTS release and this version contains all the same features as the LDS mainly it's all of those awesome graphical features that make your game run super fast with a single button click alongside of course tons of other improvements now personally I don't normally use beta versions so I haven't really touched un6 at all but now this is the main version that I'm going to be using going forward if your game is about to release then definitely stick with the LTS version you're using but if you are six plus months away from release then maybe look into this version also on that quick video where I talked about this release there were some comments asking what about the whole thing with the runtime fee I talked about it in detail in the last video during that whole Saga but the ldr is quite simply the fee does exist but the fee only applies after 1 million copies sold and $1 million in rep so if you are needed kind of like me you're never really going to hit those massive fresh ons so there's really no changes and if you do hit the lottery and you make a mega hit any game if so then the fee caps out at 2.5% that's it and I was also waiting for this Unity 6 version for one specific thing to finally start working on my upcoming Unity do scor that's something that people have been asking me to do for ages and I also really want to explore using Unity dos in a complete game myself I was waiting for Unity 6 in order to make the video as up to date for as long as possible so now that this version is out I have started doing some research on it it won't be an RTS game with defense elements kind of like the game they are billions I'm still very much in the early stages I only have a basic prototype up and running but if you are interested in learning about thoughts or if you're interested in learning how to make an RTS if so then check the link in the description I've set up a page for the course it's mostly empty but it has a place to sign up with your email if you're interested now I have no idea when the course will be done but when it is I'll send you an email then here's a game that got 30,000 wish lists in two weeks and how exactly they did it now the game is called dungeon clawler so right away the name is very clever the main hook is how it's a Dungeon Crawler but you get your skills by using a claw machine you pick up some objects and then your character does the actions I think this is another example of just how important it is nowadays that you have a very clear very interesting hook as soon as you see this game you probably think oh that sounds really interesting if you do want to find success and that's really the exact kind of feeling your game has to invoke in the player's Minds they've got lots of Interest especially from Japan where apparently clubw machines are really popular alongside the announcement they released a demo right away which they promoted on their older games then a few days after the announcement the scene their fast tarting since the game is great it got pushed to the top of the festival demo list and it just continued building from there but remember how it all starts from an interesting compelling game hook if you want to make successful games and definitely spend some time picking the right hook before going into production go watch my video on how to learn ingame marketing from some sources where you can learn exactly what makes a good hook and now a quick word from our sponsor which is me if you want to learn how to make games or make websites learn about robotics Electronics iot or just about anything if so then learning C is a super useful skill and you can learn that for free right here on YouTube with my C course I put my 10 years of C knowledge into this one course you can watch the free videos over here on YouTube or you can get the premium version which includes a compenent project with interactive exercise and a ton of other bonuses to help you learn by doing so check it out with the link in the description or if you need any visuals for games and there's actually a sale happening right now on the cint store it features their classic low style they have a mountain of unique packs no matter what game ideas you're trying to make you can definitely find a pack perfect for it next year's an interesting idea why you should create the same game over and over again now this is something that a lot of Indies probably have an aversion to for a lot of Indies creativity is key so making 20 Battlefield games or 50 Sims DLCs probably does not appeal to them but there is value in doing the same thing over and over again this article is from the game discover code newsletter which by the way this is a great newsletter for learning about the games Market in general I highly recommend this is the next Ser from a book that talks about how you gain quite a lot of knowledge by building a project especially if that project is successful so if you do find success with something why not make something similar but better in all the ways that you learned with that project instead of saring completely from scratch personally I think that this concept has a lot of value however I don't necessarily think you need to make the exact same game over and over again I don't think you need to make like 50 seems DLCs or 50 direct sequels but I do think there's a lot of value in making multiple games in a similar genre now for me I like playing and making Tycoon games my last one was batt Tycoon it is by far the most complex management gem I've done there's tons of interconnected systems but before that I made game cor DX I made blueprint Tycoon and ninja Tycoon I think it is because I made those first that I was then able to make a very complex game afterwards I definitely gained a lot of Knowledge from making multiple games in the same genre so maybe don't make exact direct sequels if you don't want to do that but it's probably wise to take advantage of what you learned with your last game and then use it to make the next game in the same genre even better instead of always jumping from genre to genre making something completely new every time okay now let's move on to the tech news starting off with some probably expected news apple is reportedly cutting Vision Pro production due to demand apparently they were expecting to sell 700,000 units and now only 400,000 I would say the hype has definitely died down which is expected but I don't think I've seen a single Vision Pro video since shortly after launch so it seems that the hype has died down a lot more than they were anticipating on the one hand I love how Apple pushed Tech to the Max and made probably the best headset out there with no regards to cost from all the reviews that I've seen the screen is excellent the pass through is nearly perfect the anchoring is Flawless and everything works really well but VR and AR is both about hardware and software with such a small install base it's hard to see many people developing forign so now my next question is will Apple stay committed to this device will they pour money into Developers for making software and make future cheaper iterations or is this really going to be it I would guess they are committed for long term but selling half the number of units might put that commitment into question so I guess we won't see in the future at least meta is currently trying to push that area forward speaking of meta they open up their ecosystem to anyone who wants to make advice for it it does feel a bit strange to see Meta pushing so hard for openness but that is really a great thing this means that Hardware makers can now make their own devices that use the same OS you can find in a meta quest Quest headset hopefully this means more devices that exist and also hopefully this makes it easier for developers to make multiplatform apps that run on pretty much any device but of course this can also lead to fragmentation John carck who you might know as one of the founders of It software and was also the CTO of oculus he made a nice post sharing his thoughts on this news he mentions how this probably does not mean cheaper headsets meta is already pretty much selling them at cost The Meta Quest 2 recently got a permanent price top to 200 bucks it's hard to see a company with a much smaller scale being able to somehow manufacture a headset for cheaper however what this might do is encourage companies to make hypers specific headsets that are perfect for one specific Niche so for example you might get a headset that has maximum resolution and frame rate another one that goes for maximum comfort and low weight you might get another one specifically for VR Fitness One for being a second monitor for watching movies and so on so that could be interesting but it could also lead to a lot of fragmentation there's already three third party headset announced one is from Asus RG one from Lenovo and a limited edition one related to Xbox so hopefully this is good news for VR in general Marquez has tried out the secret Disney holot this is a 360 treadmill that looks quite interesting there have been a few of these around for a while but usually they unlock you in place this one does not lock you at all it's composed of a ton of tiny discs and those disc rot St they are at an angle so your feet really only touches a tiny part and as you move forward they basically push you back to the center allowing you to move for Infinity one key benefit of this is how you can also have multiple people using the exact same threadmill at once and each person is walking in their own spot and also since these are tiny Motors they can also be used to just move objects now this looks really awesome really perfect for VR immersion however this is very much a research thing it's not an exal product you can buy or try anywhere but it is getting us one step closer to having a complete immersive experience personally I can't wait to have one of these in my home 10 years from now and go for a run on a virtual world the US has passed a law that forces Tik Tok to sell itself to a US company or get banned they have just nine months to find a buyer and if they can't or don't want to then technically Tik Tok could be banned in the US next year now personally I don't really use Tik Tok but I do know that it is massive especially for indie game marketing these past few years one of the ways that lots of games have found success has been through Tik Tok which just a single viral video you can get tens of thousands of wish lists if the ban does come to pass I wonder what will happen so well all those people move on to reals or YouTube shorts or will they stay on the non us Tik Tok from what I've read it seems that Tik Tok will really never sell its algorithm that's their secret sauce Tik Tok is really all about the algorithm and without it I'm not sure how much this company is worth but what I've also read is how in the US the law is really all about money and Tik Tok does have tons of money to fight this in court they've already sued the US government to block this Tik Tok can certainly afford an army of lawyers to either block this for sale or just delay it for years and years now let's move on to some gaming news H divers 2 which is a game that people were healing as a contender for Game of the Year suddenly imploded and then recovered although not totally now this is one of the biggest hits of this year both commercially and critically people Lov the game and bought tons of copies and then Sony for some reason months after release decided to throw all that away by forcing people to make a PlayStation account if they wanted to keep playing and that also had a terrible side effect players in countries where PSN is not supported suddenly cannot buy the game naturally people were very upset about such a drastic change month months after release and the tons of positive reviews for the game suddenly turned complain negative now the S Saga really is the definition of the term snatching de feed from the ja of Victory they had a game that everyone loved and sold millions of copies then they decided to voluntarily shoot themselves in the foot now the good news is that all of this negative reaction from players did have a result they did walk back the changes and they say that PSN accounts are not going to be required after all however this isn't back to normal even though there's no PSN link required right now the game is still unavailable to buy in tons of countries now it this seems strange to intentionally not sell the game even though there are no restrictions the CEO of the studio says they are talking with PlayStation so hopefully this w't be fixed soon also a fun positive fact that I just found out while researching this topic the devs behind hell divers Arrowhead studios are the exact same devs that made the excellent Magi up back in the day I love that game I always wonder why there hasn't been new Magi game in ages it was such a fun unique design and I guess this answers it I guess they wanted to move on to some different genres one of the most anticipated games of all time has just come out man and Lords this is a city Builder strategy Survival game it was one of the most wish list games on Steam over 3 million wish list that's an insane amount it very quickly sold over a million copies and hit Peak and current players of 173,000 that is much higher than any other city or Colony Builder that's Double D Peak for Rim world and city skylines so this is really a huge hit one of the main selling points is just how good the game looks it's made inre with some very high quality models and textures this has been development for seven years and the other main talking point about this game is how it's supposedly a solo developed game now I did some research and I made an entire video on that whole topic now technically it is Solo in the sense that there's just one employee of the studio working on it but that one employee is managing a small army of contractors so the question of what counts as a solid da is actually quite interesting since there's really no objective definition the comment section on my video has some really excellent discussion on what different people consider to be solo Game Dev and another highly anticipated game is Hades Su which has just launched into Early Access now the first one is one of my favorite games of all time I'm usually not much of a fan of fast character action games usually because I suck at them but I definitely loved Hades it's got really excellent combat excellent story in presentation and this one Hades 2 is very much more of the same so there's a new characters there's new spells new bosses new worlds it is out now in Early Access and has already hit 20,000 reviews at 94% positive personally I can't wait to check it out next year once it hits 1.0 another Hally successful game that just came out is russy's retirement now this is a nice itol farming game where the M Hook is how you play at the bottom of your screen so definitely an ingenious idea perfect for this genre people clearly love this the game sold over 100,000 copies in just 5 days and there's actually a really funny thing about this game I actually mentioned this exact same game in My Last Game Dev report video and the developer is apparently viewer on this channel and wrote a comment on how the game ideas start from watching my transparent Unity tutorial video in there I talk about how you can make Unity transparent and put it above anywhere so you could for example make something that only occupies the bottom of the screen now this is really awesome I love love hearing stories of how people learn something from my videos and then use that knowledge to bring their Vision to life so to the developer of this game congrats on making something awesome that a lot of people love and to all of you watching I hope you too following the same path of learning various things from my videos and then using that knowledge to build your own awesome games and now let's go over to the quick F round here's a Reddit post with some numbers on what results you can get with a steam daily deal basically within those 48 Hours the game sold more than in the past 6 months combined naturally the hard part is actually getting the D Spot this one is manually curated by Valve the rough metric is your game needs to get at least 250,000 in gross revenue to even be considered now related to this topic are actually two excellent blog posts by Chris zakowski from hmarket game.com I high recommend you sign up to his newsletter I've learned a lot from it myself one post is on some more stats on what a daily deal gets you another one is on the Weekend Deal which is even harder to get there are fewer weakens and that one has the potential to get 10 extra results basically if you manage to get any of these slots you are going to sell a mountain of copies although at the same time in order to be considered for these sales you need to have already sold a ton now I've never had one of my games hit these thresholds but hopefully one day next here's a nice post on Twitter talking about how GTA 3 handled World streaming now I'm sure development of this game was fascinating from a technical standpoint doing so many things that have never been done before GTA 3 was really the first big open world 3D game with the unlimited Hardware at the time both in terms of PCS and also the PlayStation 2 the fact that they got it working in such limited Tech is really a Marvel of engineering he mentions how they had to put the data on the DVD physically together in order to make it a little bit more performant now in case you don't know how DVDs work they are constantly spinning and the data is read by a tiny head that reads just tiny bumps or flats in desk those bumps or flats correspond to either zeros or once so if you position data physically together it reduces how much the head needs to move in order to read them when dealing with such limited Hardware you need every trick to get you that tiny bit of extra performance then for something educational and funny here's a website that I just found out it's HTT p. dog it's a really great way to learn all of the HTTP codes and what exactly they represent I'm guessing you already know that 404 means not phone you might also know that 200 means okay but do you know that 41 means unauthorized 308 means permanent redirect 400 means B request 402 means payment required and there's actually more websites just like this there's one with cats goats ducks or pizza so this is a really nice and fun way to learn about all of the HTTP codes and to end on a positive note here's a funny meme post where I actually learned something new so do you know what happens if you round 1.5 or 2.5 now I would think that it would round to two and three respectively but nope they both round to two and apparently this is a thing known as even rounding or Bankers rounding which apparently is more numerically stable so instead of always rounding up for so 0. five always goes up instead of that it always rounds to the nearest even number now I've been programming for 25 years I've rounded tons of numbers but this is the first time that I'm hearing about this so it's a great example of how life is is really a neverending Learning Journey and that's the Game Dev report for today all the stories are linked in the description by the way if you need awesome low poly assets there's a sale on the CN store right now or if you want to learn all about C from beginner to advance check out my course all right thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
