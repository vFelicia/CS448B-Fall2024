hello and welcome I'm your a code monkey and this is a quick video announcing the code monkey steam app this is something I've been thinking about doing for a long time and I think it's a really exciting idea the store page is live so check the link in the description to add it to your wish list and phone doing so really helps out in getting some visibility on Steam and when it comes out you won't be notified and the app will also be free so the goal with this is to have a nice simple app containing all the completed games I've made for this channel so for example the build of doom that I made recently the wash your hands video game the topdown shooter flappy bird snake and minesweeper all of those won't easily be playable through the app it will also have a bunch of interactive tutorials for learning game design and programming I'm still a terrain on how to present those but they should be very interesting and provide a different new way of learning and it will also obviously contain a nice list of all the videos and update as new videos get added so I plan to keep adding more and more things to this app as time goes on so it's meant to be a continuously updated app as I continue making videos and more interesting projects having a steam app also opens up a lot of possibilities with regards to what kind of cool projects I can make in the future so for example I could make some multiplayer tutorials and update the steam build so all you have to do is get it and we can all play around with some interesting cool minigames or I can also make it usable as an interface for some livestream games or simply have an easy way to keep adding all the completely and projects I make in one easy place so this opens up a lot of really cool possibilities for some interesting projects and interacting more with avi so again like I mentioned in the videos where I give advice to in developers wish lists are extremely important so please go to the link in description add it to your wishlist and phone doing so really helps in getting some visibility on Steam and when it comes out you won't be notified then the app won't be free alright so thanks again for watching all the videos I hope you continue enjoying them and I hope this exciting project won't be very successful alright I'll see you next time
