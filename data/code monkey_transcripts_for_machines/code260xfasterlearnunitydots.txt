hello and welcome I'm your Cod Mak it's finally here I've been hard work on my unity doour and I'm happy to announce it is now available in Early Access there's already 30 lectures released with 10 hours of content where you'll learn a massive amount about how dots works and how to build an RTS game now this technology is insanely powerful if you learn it you will have gain an awesome new tool that will help you in making all kinds of better more interesting games if you don't know what is Nott and it is simply a really awesome tool stack that can give you literally 100x performance improvements that's not a mistake it can generally make your recode 100 X faster we're going to see a practical example in one of the lectures that's basally all achieved by some very clever use of memory by writing some super efficient multithread code with the job system and using the magical burst compiler also using dots does not mean your game has to be internally dots you can absolutely combine dots and game objects in fact that's what you should do and that's what we're going to do in this course so even if you plan to keep on making games mostly just with game objects even so it is still very valuable to learn this skill like I said dots is insanely powerful and can definitely help you fix performance buttom so you can make better more complex games so a bit about the Early Access initially I was planning to launch a course only when it was fully complete but actually ended up being quite a bit longer and more complex than I thought thanks to the complex genre and actually using this interesting Tech I think in the end this will actually end up being one of the biggest course that I've done right now there's already 10 hours of content I think that's roughly only about a third maybe a fourth of the entire thing which is awesome it means lots of content for you to learn from but it doesn't mean that it takes a while to build all of this dot is pretty complex it involves lots of things and I want to make sure that I teach everything as thly as possible so you can learn how to use this awesome tool in your own games in the best way possible the lectures that I've already done already contain a mountain of useful information that's is already production ready and I'm sure that some of you are just waiting for some learning content like this course to start learning so that's why I'm watching the course in Early Access instead of having to wait a few more months for me to finish all of the remaining lectures instead of that you can start learning right now the third lectures that are already out they already teach a massive amount so here's a quick overview of an entire course okay so we're going to start off with lecture mostly focus on the theory behind dots so what exactly is it what are all the components to it like ECS job system and burst and just basically get a nice overview of the whole tool set before we start using it then we're going to start the section for creating and setting up our project first create the project and install all the packages then we're going to set up our un layout after that set up our Visual Studio then import the first batch of visual assets that we're going to use after that set up the post processing and lighting and with that done we will have our complete setup and in order for you to follow everything exactly the same as I have in this course this is the part where I will tell you to download the project files use so this way use the exact same project as me with everything using the exact same versions that way there is no confusion then we start actually building our game so first learning about do subscene baking what is it and how do we convert game objects into entities next we're going to create our first super simple component components s some data so we're going to do that and set up our unit structure again all while using normal game objects and the baking system with that done we're then going to create our very first system it's going to be the unit mover system which like name implies will move our unit meaning that at this point we all have seen the basics of entities components and systems then we take that movement system and we're going to refactor it to use dots physics instead of moving the object transform this is super easy to do thanks to the dots baking system we're going to work with normal physics components and everything just works then since this is an RTS game we're going to need the mouse run position so we're going to to calculate that this is also a super important lecture because it will teach us that not every system needs to be dots we can and we will have normal monob behavior scripts and do scripts both them working together then with the mouse position we're going to use that logic to tell the unit to move to the mouse and then here is another super important lecture we're going to refactor our movement code to turn it into a super fast job using the job system we're going to see the actual numbers behind normal main thread code and super fast Burst enabled multithread code the difference is literally 100x next we're going to handle unit selection first just setting up the component to select just one unit and then we're going to be selecting multiple units this means we're going to set up our UI and do some math to be able to draw a selection area and select multiple units this is another great example of interacting with the dots worldl from a normal monab behavior script next we're going to handle selecting a single unit by clicking on it this is another fun lecture because it requires us to learn about dots physics and how to do a dots recast then we're going to generate some move positions for a unit to go to that way they don't all go to the exact same spot this is basically where we can draw our own unit formations next we're going to have a very important lecture learning how to do events in dots this is actually really tricky because normally events require objects and delegates so finding a data oriented approach for events is a really interesting challenge then we're finally going to create some zombies to play with create the enemies and Define what is the concept of a faction after that we're going to build our fine Target system so this system with the concept of factions won't work for both zombies and friendly units it won't work for both for finding units of the opposing faction and this also requires us to work with dots physics to find nearby potential targets then we're going to implement the concept of Health create a component to Source some data and systems to handle that then create a visual bullet that we're going to fire set up the component and system to make a move towards the Target and damage next is another really important lecture where we're going to learn all about entity spawning this has some interesting implications with regards to the concept of structural changes after that we're going to polish some things in our shoot logic then set up a simple component in system for spawning zombies then we're going to make them randomly walk around this requires us to learn how to use a random class that is burst compatible which works in quite a different way than you might be used to next setting up a visual health bar this also requires an interesting setup to make sure that the bar is rendered using the dots renderer and is scaled correctly then we're going to polish up the shooting with some nice light so this one is a great example of how we can use dots companion game objects after that we're going to implement melee attacks so our zombies will be able to approach our soldiers and damage them then we're going to implement a move override logic this will let us have full control of our units even while they are trying to attack an enemy and all of that will conclude the first part of the course so yep those are the lectures that are out right now and coming in the future are many more lectures to build a final polish game so we're going to learn how to create flowfield pathf finding how to do fog of War create a minim map we're going to learn how to have multiple buildings multiple unit types how to do resource Gathering massive zombie hordes we're going to learn how to do some dots and Mission which is actually a very interesting topic and again all of this while focusing on mixing dots and game objects so we can use the right tool for the right job and would have use of the baking system to work like you're already used to if you don't know what that means the baking system basically lets you keep using Game objects and then automatically convert them into entities so all these topics all these will be coming in updates of the course over the next weeks or months and all this is built step by step in the course so there is no code that is written off screen all the lectures also have downloadable project files so if you get lost at any point you can just download the exact project files from that lecture and continue from there and as usual I'm always available in the course comments to answer any questions you may have now importantly on the topic of who this courses for right away this is not a beginner level course if you are a beginner then do not worry about dots at all dots is really awesome it has some insane benefits it is absolutely a super powerful tool that you should know but you should only know that after learning the basics so if you are a beginner then definitely just stick with normal game objects until you get the basics down you can go watch my free catch and Chaos course or my C course to learn the basics and get your skills up now if you are in the intermediate or Advanced stage then I absolutely do recommend you learn about dots like I said it's an insanely powerful tool having this tool at your disposal will enable you to build so many more interesting games even if you are not interested in this particular genre in RTS or games with tons of units even still I high recommend you go through it and learn about Dots Dots is really really awesome tool stack it is not limited to any specific genre here we're going to build an RTS to learn how to use it but you can absolutely take the knowledge of dots and apply to any game you want you can use in an FPS RPG whatever you want to make it's really just a different way of writing some code and if you follow a bunch of simple rules you can get some massive benefits which again can be used in pretty much any game you can imagine also like I've said many times I'm a big believer in education and specifically free education I've made tons of free tutorials and free courses I always want to make sure that even people who don't have any money can still learn basically I always picture myself back when I was a kid back when I wanted to learn but I had absolutely no money I want people like myself of way back then I want those people to have access to high quality education whether or not they can afford it so right now the Early Access course is paid only but my goal is when the course is fully complete for the final version it will have a normal paid course and then it will also have a free video over here on YouTube containing about the first of the course so about a 10hour free course that's why I intentionally structured the course to include many of the dots Basics and how to start using it in the first few lectures so that even people who have no money can still learn how to use this awesome technology in that completely free video and then the people who can't afford it or who want to see the entirity of this project those can pick up the premium version I just want to be very upfront about what is my plan so you can make your informed decision if you want to wait for the free 10hour version then that's fine I'm hoping it will be out in let's say late August or September and if you want to start learning right now you can go ahead and pick up the course with the link in the description the first thir lectures are already available which will teach you a lot definitely more than enough to start using it in your own projects and over time I'll be updating the course adding more lectures as I make them dot is a really fascinating technology and I can't wait for all of you to learn it I've been really excited about this technology since it was first announced back in 2018 now it's finally production ready and I can't wait to have you learn and see exactly what you're all going to build as always I'm available in the course comments to answer any questions you have this technology is still very new so I'm definitely very curious to see how you use it and what questions you have so go ahead and check it out to the link in the description thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
