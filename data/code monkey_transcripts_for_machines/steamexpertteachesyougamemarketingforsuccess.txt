for having me Hugo my name is Chris Zukowski I run a site called how to Market a game and basically every single week I write a quick blog post studying the steam Marketplace to see what is actually helping people Market their games I look at games that have succeeded and I break down their strategy step by step these are real stories these aren't theories or anything I also do broadbased surveys and data analysis where I like scrape data from steam or I go to data that has been scraped by somebody else and I just kind of look at market trends and see what's going on so that you can actually Market your game get it seen get it sold and actually do this for a fulltime living all right yeah that's awesome I mean I have to say that I'm myself I've learned quite a lot by reading your blog by reading the newsletter I've been reading it for many years and a lot of what I know about marketing came from uh reading you so thanks for doing that uh all right so yeah so I guess uh we're going to start off with a quick presentation like a high level overview on the things must know about steam game marketing and then I'll ask a bunch of follow questions so yep go ahead sounds great yeah so um as Hugo mentioned um I do this uh professionally and I teach others and the way I do that is I I create this course this online course called how to Market a game wish list and visibility Master Class um we've probably got a link down below for this thing um but um as part of this uh what I teach is really how to Market your game and the way that it works is a lot of Indies get frustrated because they're always like tweeting tweeting Tweeting or they always post on Reddit and it goes nowhere like it's like what else do I need to do and really what a lot of Indies don't understand or it's not as apparently visible is the real strategy for how you do this and and and I'll kind of break it down is basically the underlying thing is you by yourself just tweeting out into the void is not enough to actually just Market the game like not enough people can see your tweets or your Reddit posts or whatever platform you do you need somebody else to help you boost that up and the primary way that actually works to actually get visibility on your game are couple ways the first is online festivals these are festivals where you apply they feature your game on the front page of steam because steam features these all the time and then all these people are going going through Steam they see this big banner that says hey like City build Builder festival and you're making a city Builder and you click and you go in and you have your game right there on the top now these festivals run all the time and my community U manages a list where we find these festivals people come to me people are starting to come to me who organize these festivals and say hey Chris can you feature this Festival we're doing this type of festival and so what you do is you just track it you you subscribe my newsletter or my Discord I guess we'll put a link down below and you just get notified when a new and if it applies to your game and your situation you know you just apply for it hopefully get in that is a huge way to get wish lists the second way is from streamers just like Hugo but mostly the um General audience that you know makes that plays games and sends those to the general audience Hugo you're you're great but it's more for developers um we're talking let's players and know big ones are like splatter cat Northern lion iron pineapple if you're making a Souls like game these streamers bring in so much traffic and sometimes people trip up with the term streamer I just mean somebody who plays games online that could be YouTube or twitch but YouTube really provides more traffic I find and so basically you take your game you give it to them and they play it and then you get tons of wish lists it doesn't necessarily lead directly to sales a lot of people think that streamers once your game goes on sale is going to lead to a big cash influx it does not typically what happens is you give it to them you get a ton of wish wish list and then the next time your game goes on discount then all those a lot of those wish lists will convert about 20% of those wish lists if it's a good streamer so the combination of those two things are the primary way that most games get visibility on Steam it is not you just sending out little tiny tweets here and there um it really takes these big efforts um and so it's about um you know just knowing where these places are how to apply and what to get what you need to do to get that visibility and um oh somebody always asks too with streamers hey how do I get streamers to play my game it's very simple if your game is interesting you have to have a good steam page with great graphics looking good a good thumbnail that you did not do yourself don't make your own thumbnail because you need a professional illustrator to make something interesting because YouTubers live or die by their thumbnail I'm sure Hugo knows that if your thumbnail is not good people don't click and watch your video so streamers need good graphics for that thumbnail and if your page has a great thumbnail streamers are more likely to play your game because they say ah that looks like a great thumbnail all I have to do is copy that put that in put my face on it and then we're good to go but if you have an ugly thumbnail now the streamer is like oh God I gotta go find somebody to make a thumbnail for me out of a screenshot they have to do more work they want good graphics good thumbnails then two what you got to do is put up your demo now this is an important thing too many people skip this step you want a nice demo that's really fun and you keep it up and all you do is you message the streamer and you say hey I'm making this game you play this type of game uh I think you're going to like this you grab your thumbnail say here's my thumbnail you grab a link to your demo say Demo's live now you can play it right now and you send that off to the streamer if they like your game they will play it now a lot of people say Chris I tried all this and nobody uh nobody responded uh it must be going to spam it did not go to spam it's just that streamers don't have enough time to play every game that comes across their desk so they don't write no not because they hate you or they're afraid to tell you no it's just it it's just a list that they have of games that they're kind of interested in playing and if a hot one comes in it just cuts in front of you in line because the stream is like oh I got to play this new game and yours just gets bumped down so it's not that they don't like your game it's just that you're not as exciting as the other games that came in that's why they don't say no to you and say oh I'm not going to cover this nobody says no it's just if you've been up sending out the emails and you're not getting responses maybe it's time to either up the the steam page make it look a little bit more exciting tighten your pitch tighten your demo and then you'll start to get those responses from streamers so that's the big things that I would say that you really need to get going is get a demo out and the earlier the possible to get that demo out because you need those streamers to play it not at launch not when you're launching your game you want those streamers to play it nice and early because that'll increase your wish list influx you'll also have more chances at getting into festivals and a lot of streamers look at festivals for finding games that they play on stream so the combination of those two is really how most games get their visibility and take off that is what it takes to Market your game on Steam so Hugo I'm I'm here to answer any questions you might have all right yeah that was awesome that was a great high level overview of how marketing Works how I mean marketing is really basically just the study of attention how to get people to pay attention to your game because basically what I always say is it makes no sense to spend so much effort on your game and spend no effort on actually trying to Market it so I feel that is especially nowadays with so much uh so many games coming out everything is so crowded if you're going to put in so much effort into making something really special then I think it also makes sense put in a ton of effort making people actually know that your awesome thing exists all right so yeah I definitely do have a bunch of awesome questions and it's awesome how you mention a bunch of things like festivals and demos I definitely want to get to those but before let's actually start off with the simplest one of all which is how many wish lists should I have before release yeah minimum absolutely minimum I say is 7,000 and the reason I say this is the way steam's visibility algorithms work all these algorithms is it's kind of like a ladder if each step gets you enough visibility to qualify you for the next step and the next step and the next step and the way the team works just by happen stance their first kind of rung in that ladder is what we call uh popular upcoming so about a week before you release steam looks at all the games that have somewhere around 7,000 I've seen some games games get in with 5,000 it depends on how many other games they're launching some games with 6,000 and if they see they just pull that list they say one week out the algorithm just goes out oh these are all the games that have 6,000 7,000 wish list thereabouts here let's put them in a list and they just rank you based on your exact time that you release so if you say 1201 a on this day well you're going to be at the top of the list and then it it goes down from that so that list there's 10 games in that popular upcoming and they show up and then as new games are reaching after new G release they pop off the list and the next game in the list pops up so it just is a constant flowing list of games in that popular upcoming and it gives you a ton of visibility uh by a lot of measures we see that games that are on there get about a thousand wish lists a day and so if you time it right you can end up in there four days five days if you play the game right um so then that's the week just before launch and then from there if you convert those wish list and a lot of people buy the next step on the ladder is what we call new and trending and so you have to sell a bunch of game sell a bunch of copies within a short period of time just based on the research that I've done it's about selling $8,000 gross revenue this is the pre steam cut pretax is just raw $88,000 earned that's usually pretty competitive to end up on new and trending and just like popular on upcoming your game just stays on there until more games pop it off you know as games release and sell $8,000 within a short period of time they start bumping you off um and you just stay on there there and so that combo those are the first two steps of the ladder and there's other things like um Discovery que that if you convert well and you have a ton of visibility they will give you a spot in this widget called Discovery queue so those combination of those three kind of are the start of the visibility ramp on Steam on once you launch your game now if you miss that like you don't get that 7,000 then it just it's really hard to climb that ladder so if you don't get enough wish list at that time you're not on popular upcoming and then it's really hard to get those you know those last minute wish lists those 1,000 per day you don't get those and then it's hard to convert enough of those wish lists show up on new and trending so you see you can just see the ladder start just going away if you don't start making those steps up the ladder so that's why I say 7,000 minimum to get in there now yeah so that number is not not necessarily set in stone right it's uh like you were saying it depends on what other games are coming out around that time so it might be 7,000 5,000 so B there's no magic number written directly in the algorithm saying if above 7,000 go here if not go there yeah and it's it's a little bit wobbly so one thing that I like to to recommend people is look at your game go to steamdb on your on your game um and you'll see a ranking if if you're ranked and usually the ranking happens right around 7,000 wish list see it's all relative to all the other games on Steam what steam's actually doing is they're just pulling the most wishlisted games that release that that week okay and so when you look on steamdb if you have enough wish list right around 5,000 7,000 it'll say rank number and it'll say like you are number 5,000 in wish list that means of all the games on Steam and it's usually like the first 2,000 is when you get the number assigned to you because there's so many games on Steam that the top 2,000 games that have not yet released get a rank number if you have a rank number that means you're a pretty good shot of getting on uh new and trending or popular upcoming I should say popular upcoming because I think the algorithm actually just says how many games show me all the ranked games that have a release date within the next week that's I think what the algorithm does so sometimes if there aren't a lot of games that are out there you can get in that ranked number with fewer wishless that's the kind of why we're saying there's no full number it's kind of like you're everybody's running in a race together and they just pick the top front of that race all right yeah so so yeah basically roughly have 7,000 in order to get on that basically start the ball rolling and then steam basically you got to kick off the steam algorithm and once it starts then it starts basically working for you but you have to first get that initial thing so yeah that's a a great one let me just put one more let me just say one more caveat to that now this is one thing that I often hear because I talked to a lot of Indies so I hear a lot of the comments some people might say well I heard about 30,000 wish list or 50,000 wish list some people say that now what this is coming from is typically Publishers if you sign with a publisher your publisher really wants you to get to 30,000 or 50,000 somewhere in that range depending on the publisher the reason that is is because remember I said there was that new and trending where you have to get $8,000 within like the first 24 hours like within a short period of time well Publishers have been around enough and they know that to get to 8,000 sales your wish lists have to convert enough wish list have to convert and they want that kind of buffer so if you're con you could convert at 20% like all your wish lists convert at 20% 20% of all the wish lists you earned convert that's awesome but some games have a little softer they only convert at like 5% or 1% I've seen games that do all those range anywhere between 1 to 30% I've seen and so if it turns out by whatever Factor your game is a low converter like 1,000 when you have 30,000 or 50,000 wish list that just gives you a a bigger margin of error so that those 1% of 30,000 will give you enough sales to get you into new and trending so see there's no line in the algorithm says if you do this you do that it's more they just kind of look at conversion rates and that because um uh it really just you need that buffer to earn that money and that's why Publishers will say oh you need 50,000 or 30,000 not because that's a solid number in the algorithm just because that is more likely to give you enough sales and enough dollar earned to rank on new and trending so it's complicated but it's not yeah yeah I mean that's uh great uh extra information yeah definitely uh basically the idea of a buffer zone and conversion rate yeah that is definitely also important uh so yeah second very important question when should I start marketing my game yeah I personally like to do it IM mediately so what as soon as I've got a game idea or need to have something visible here's here's what I recommend is I've got uh three sometimes four depending on if I ate breakfast that day uh recommendations of when you're ready for to start marketing your game um and by marketing your game I'm specifically talking about putting up a steam page that says wish list now and here's kind of my rules one you definitely know what type of game it is you're like you know sometimes maybe you're like well maybe it's going to be an action RPG maybe it's going to be a Rog likee maybe it's just going to be a linear narrative game you know all of those could be like a 2d game or a Metroid Vania or a Rog like action Rog like once you know sometimes that kind of changes during development when you are sure you're like this is definitely a Metroid Vania there's no doubt about it I'm making a Metroid Vania that's first step second step is your graphic style has to be decided and by decided I mean you know like oh we're definitely going cartoony we're going to look it's going to have big Blobby features you know all that kind of stuff or you're like I'm going to go Grim dark everything's going to be black and white and covered in blood whatever it is you've picked the actual art style that you're going to go with okay third thing you need is I recommend four different environments four different biomes four different you know just scenes so that it looks unique the main thing that I see that the problem that Indies when they first throw up their first steam page is I can tell you made one environment and you just shifted the camera around and I could see everything in the background's the same you know like there's a tower in the back and I can tell in one screenshot the tower's over here then the same Tower's over here then the tow is here I can tell you just kind of like Pan the camera around the same one office or the one you know like level area that's not going to cut it with steam you need different environments different levels like snow biome uh fire biome uh you know the forest you want different things now I know you're still in development you can mock this up they're just screenshots um so I recommend you you know you just make the art in the right art style and you stage it up like in unity or whatever you're using so it looks like a different scene it doesn't have to function if it could be like I just run through the tree and there no it just doesn't clip or you know the enemies are just like still they're posed it's like it's just a screenshot they we they don't need to know that there's no AI or the thing's not coded you just have to Stage it don't lie but just stage it so it looks unique and then from there the last thing that I always recommend is a trailer you really should have a trailer because it means you're serious the other reason I say you need a trailer when you kind of do this announce is a big marketing beat remember how I said you need external people streamers Festival goers sometimes the Press YouTubers a big marketing beat when you kick off your game is your announce trailer so you make a trailer you title it announce trailer and you put it out there and you reach out to like IGN and streamers and and the press and say Here's my announce trailer just saying announce trailer makes people stand up and go I must cover this game so that's why I say you should also have a trailer so those four things a known genre you know what your genre is you know what the art style is you've made enough screenshots for four environments and you have a trailer those are the four things to actually start marketing your game okay that's that's interesting so so basically you you would say it's not necessarily recommended to just basically have just screenshots no Trail just a rough idea just you know what the game is going to be but you haven't yet made a nice polished trailer so you would say better to wait for it and really kick off with a like you said a nice marketing beat as opposed to just just make this coming soon Page live you would say wait for a proper marketing beat yes don't just fart your page out there don't just like n it's a Thursday I'm going to put it live do it no it has to be a big moment so you start working with uh either content creators like on Tik Tok or maybe you reach out to IGN find IGN say we have a secret trailer we are getting ready to announce our game do you want to have exclusive access and you send them their trailer and they're like this trailer is good like you do this like a month before you're going to announce or or you know how I said those festivals you reach out to the festival organizers you look at my website how tomarket game.com festivals is the festival list you look at that festival list and you see what's coming up and you start applying to festivals even though you don't have a steam page yet with your trailer and you say we're getting ready to announce this game can we get into the TR into your Festival you would get the announce of our game in your festival and then the organizers are like we get this special moment where we to announce this person's game we're definitely going to feature them in the thing so again you see how you're using the fact that you nobody's heard about you and then all of a sudden something will be heard as a special ticket and you're you're going around to a bunch of people and saying do you want to cash this ticket you get to cash it who wants to cash it and then somebody says I do if you just fart your page out you just put it up for no reason you don't have a trailer you just took that ticket and you just crumpled it up and threw it on the ground you know what I mean so use that ticket it's given to you okay so yeah so basically the announcement should be a nice important thing to kick things off nicely uh so yeah I mean you spoke about Festival so just a quick question should you participate in a steam Festival I mean nowadays things are quite a bit more crud but do you still think it's a good idea and basically when should you participate yeah so there's several types of festivals and I'll just qu clarify this the big big one is Steam nextfest and and there's nothing special about steam nextfest it's actually very crowded right now the main reason people always talk about steam nextfest is it's one that you everybody's guaranteed every everybody who has a steam page can do one and only one steam next test and you get to choose when you want to do it it's like having one bullet that you get to fire everybody gets to fire their one bullet but you can only do it February October and June I don't know why I did them in that order but that's that's not the order but there's three of them per year February June October those are the three dayses and so you get to pick which one of those three you want to do now um it is crowded definitely is and I just published a blog post if you go to how tomarket game.com blog you can see my latest one it's about um ziv Nelson Jr and what they did was they basically said we're going to do our steam next test right off that and what they did was they knew they were getting a huge Boost from being in a game show like Jeff Key's festival and they just paired it with steam nextfest see because he knows when he can fire that bullet he said I'm gonna I'm going to use it strategically and use my one time to pair it with this big Festival announce and he announced this game so he was basically firing three bullets at the same time all the other festivals that I list at how tomarket game.com festivals all those festivals are just random you don't know if you're going to get to them you apply and you get in they might like your game they might not so that's why we spend extra time talking about steam nextfest but all the other festivals change sometimes the festivals have nobody else in them it's like 50 games get in it's a very exclusive Festival some games is like everybody gets in it's like there's 2,000 games in the festival it just depends and there's also themed festivals there's like cozy games and if you're in a cozy game it's usually smaller and the audience is like very dedicated they love every cozy game they wish list every single one they buy every single one there's like narrative game festivals like n Ludo naron if you're writing a a um Adventure game or a visual novel those do very well because again that audience is very tuned in but if it's a general Festival like I don't know action games H that's so Broad and there's so many different types of people that those don't convert as well but here's the thing I still even if the W Festival only got you a 100 wish lists and they convert poorly hey that's 100 wish lists and a poorly converting wish list that you didn't have at the beginning there's no downside to participating in a festival other than maybe the time to kind of like manage you know the upload and applying and maybe if you did a custom demo for them um some of them do have a little bit of a cost it's usually not too much it's usually like in hundred to ,000 but the visibility they give you is very good so anywhere in that range there's really no big downside to a participating in a Fest okay yeah festivals do seem to be a big part of marketing games nowadays so yeah that was definitely very helpful now one question that I really want to ask you which is actually something that I saw on a blog post that you made uh quite a while ago is how how uh basically it was a graph of how many games a studio makes and how like so many studios make one game very few Studios make the second third and so on so basically my question is would you recommend someone spends let's say five years working on just one game trying to make like one huge Masterpiece or in those same five years make five different games which one would you recommend you go you you're man at my heart okay so I my basic complaint for all Indies out there is that you spend way too long working on your first game or any game um and I know it sounds easy it's easy for me just to say you spending too long on it um what we found was about 75% of Studios will release one game and then nothing else I don't know what happens to them some of them go off and make a second Studio or something but this is data that I scrape from stream the number of Studios who have released two games is very very small after that it's like 7,000 so I think it's like um you know down to like 10% of Studios will actually make two games and then it goes down even further like 0 1% or something release three games uh just even further and further um but here's the thing most of your success happens in your second and your third and your fourth because games roll forward so even if your first game didn't do very well there's still a lot of people who bought it who are wishlisting it and there's some people that love you they like man this is my one of my favorite games I know it didn't sell well but I love this game so what you do is you take this audience because every day your game is on sto on the store getting viewed by people when you release even if it wasn't a big seller still getting views and when you release your second game you take that that audience and you put it on there and then all of a sudden your second game is starting at about here and then you're building on top of that and then it's a third game and the fourth game and so they just stack and I find that most success comes fourth fifth game now knowing that this should change your strategy if you were thinking I'm going to make the perfect game my first game you will never finish it or you're just going to die basically so what I recommend is don't make your dream game your first game just don't I know a lot of people I get a lot of emails I'm working on my dream game this is my I've always wanted to make this game I say I know it's hard but tuck it away you're not ready for your first game okay you got to make smaller first games that hey you you like you're interested in but they're not your dream game and so what you do is you level up and you grow an ability to get to your dream game like your fourth or fifth release and then you've got a lot of codebase you know how to make games you know like every game has a setting screen work on your setting screen your first game and then just use the same setting screen basically for all your future games saves you Dev time um all that kind of stuff and your audience will grow over time it's just so much it is impossible to have your first game succeed and even if you're like well what about this game most of the time if you look back they've been releasing games for decades it is very very very hard to make your first game of success so with that in mind structure your studio structure your Dev time to release a lot of small games and each one gets a little bit bigger until you get to your dream game okay that's my recommendation for Indies out there yeah that's awesome I mean what you're saying really resonates with me because I definitely do believe in the same way make multiple games as opposed to just one huge game and specifically what you mentioned about reusing things I mean for me something that I always talk about my channel is all about writing good clean code so that you can reuse it on many things like for example I've got my animation system that I made and reused in like four or five games so yeah that is definitely something that I very much believe in yeah and I do think that is the best approach okay so a bit of a potentially similar question so what are the best genres on Steam I mean I know steam is huge but should I make a cozy game should I make a dark and Moody game should I make a survival crafting game a city Builder what what does the team audience generally prefer okay I'm gonna kind of pair these with the previous one because I say hey make small games just make a quick small game and then he's like what the hell I I can't make a small game what you want me to Crunch no you pick genres that are smaller okay so your first game I'm sorry folks should not be an RPG because there's those games just have so much content they're so deep you just won't be able to finish it in time I'm sorry you just can't okay um and so what you do is in the interest of building up a code base and learning how games are designed because that's a big thing too just just knowing the design of games like what how hard should the game be what's how do you tutorial lifee that's all things you have to learn by making games so there are some genres that are pretty simple to make um are they do very well on Steam relatively and they give you that kind of experience and they could build up to the final game because really like if you think about it an RPG is really a lot of genres stacked together it's like you know you've got experience like incremental experience and spending it on upgrades you've got a narrative just typing the story you know writing out a story as a game you've got um kind of the battle whatever your battle whether it's real time or you know turnbased you've got a battle system you have like an exploration where you're like exploring the Overworld so that's like four or five games just for an RPG this is why you should not make an RPG for your first game because it's actually like six games duct taped together and present it to you so what I recommend is there is I study the market all the time and that's what I write about hard to Market game.com free is how to sign up for that but um all those genres um there are a lot of genres that are very small and actually are pieces that show up in like an RPG or some other genres and I'll let me list them out real quick so the small genres that I recommend Indies start out with is one like an incremental like an increment idle game sometimes call those do very well on Steam now you might say oh there's so many garbage ones if they're good they go up and I know banana yeah yeah yeah but um it's there's other ones that I'd recommend that you check out like chill quarium is one um micro civilization is another one Loi beats I think it's called Loi beats uh yeah the one that is the something like that yeah yeah it's it's it it's not actually ly girl I think she's featured in there um but it's an incremental game where if you just idle if you just concentrate you do work your numbers tick up and then you can buy upgrades for your thing those are those Idol games research that genre look at the top sellers if you do them right very Pro very um very positive effect oh another one is Rusty's retirement but the good thing about those increments is they teach you how XP grows how to buy upgrades in an interesting way because you need to do the loop interesting so it's a very selfcontained small game that teaches you the fundamentals and doesn't take as long as a big RPG that's your dream game but a lot of the code that you use in your increment can be adapted for your RPG down the line and so you might learn like your first incremental game people like God this game sucks it's it's too slow and you're like oh okay I got to tune this up so you learn in your second game maybe make a second idler and you're like oh I changed the progression so that you earn xp faster oh man and people like that's great you did it good job then you take those Lessons Learned and you apply it to your RPG dream game later on that's just an example another genre that's really big are um Auto Battlers you B basically upgrade a bunch of little units and you say go get them and then you just you don't control it you just push a button that says go and then they those little units that you've upgraded go and they attack some monsters and there's some number system that determines who's the winner that's an auto battler very hot genre again you can do it in small bits and it's like a piece of an RPG remember how we talked about battle systems the lessons that you learn building an auto battler can be applied to an RPG third one narrative games are hard but there are a couple genres that actually do pretty well one is a horror game now most of the time I say that your game has to be deep and systematic horror games are games that should be um very small like two hours Max and it's usually just a camera rolling around in a spooky dungeon or something and there's some monster chasing you it's a great way to learn animation just how to work a camera system a little bit of narrative like they click something and it tells a little story on there but it's like dark and brooding those are excellent games f Master development time and people love horror games especially if your Monster's really gross and like their head is sideways or they're a girl dressed in white and she has black eyes and she screams at you people people love those that's like an instant like uh good way to do a horror game um I know I'm seeing it sounds fake and cynical but this is what the steam audience wants are those type of games um and the other genres that uh do pretty well that are pretty uh good is one is um what I call they don't really have a genre they're called like the St stacking games and there these little cards stack lands is one uh the one that invented it is called cultist simulator look those up and they're basically games where you take cards and you stack these cards and the way you stack them kind of as like building a a city or it's like your your crafting things again this is code that you learn here that can be applied to a bigger game so these are all genres that are very good and I recommend um stay away from Platformers Platformers just don't sell very well especially PL puzzle Platformers those sell very very poorly um and I for some reason Indies think that that's their first I don't know where that message got out but they just sell so poorly because people don't like getting stuck in puzzle games and so really watch out for those I know you're probably watching this and you're like I just making a puzzle platformer I know it's hard I made I made some my first games were puzzle platforms they didn't sell well it's just the nature of it people just don't like them on Steam those previous genres that I I mentioned do much better so if you're making a puzzle platform just don't throw it away don't blow up your computer just put a just like do a do your last commit start a new one you know if you're like man I worked three years on this thing I'm so sick of it hey just put it aside take a little vacation from your game and and make an idler or something they they're just so much more popular I see it it's like night and day popularity between those games and and you're going to love Game Dev again if you start making a genre that Ste Lov yeah I was going to say my my next question was going to be so many Indies start with Platformers so should I do a platformer so apparently the answer is no but yeah a lot of a lot of Indies definitely do start start with that and yeah it's a very tricky and another thing that I've al already heard you say several times is how horror is supposedly a great genre because it's very simple to make something and it really just needs something a little bit interesting as long as it has a little hook something that is slightly different it doesn't have to be super complex and yeah definitely personally I have to say for me horror is not the kind of games that I don't like to play I get scared way too easily but you your uh comments on the genre definitely made me slightly convinced that I should probably give it a try because yeah it seems like a seems like can be a good genre here here's here's one thing a lot of people wonder about I don't like horror horror sells so well so well and you don't even have to be a fan to make a horror game and let me let me explain um I'm I'm a big film buff I love movies I'm always I'm always reading about film and stuff like that um I love movies um one of the best horror films ever made The Shining made by Stanley cubrick that guy didn't even like horror movies he only made The Shining because his previous movie that he made was a total flop nobody liked it he's like God these horror movies are always hits I need a hit I'm gonna make the best horror movie ever I don't even like him and so he read all these horror books and he's like I hate this book I hate this book and then he found The Shining he's like this is a good story and he decided to make The Shining this classic horror film just because he wanted a hit and like this is very similar to Indies they're like I'm sick of making these puzzle Platformers that never sell I'm sick of it fine I'm just gonna make a horror game and they do amazingly well you don't have to be like the biggest horror fan but one thing I do recommend is play a couple horror games I know it might be scary but put on your designer hat like I'm not scared I'm just investigating the design and look at really how horror games are built like why they work now I know a lot of Indies they try and make a horror game but they like bring in this like game designer brain where they're like well it's not actually a horror game it's more of a card battler where your systems are the horror and and they add all these extra systems no no no no no just make it a straightup horror game where it's like I'm just a dude running through some dark corridors and there's a girl dressed all in White and her eyes are black and like bleeding and she screams at me like just make a freaking horror game that's like a real horror game don't try and like over complicate it with all these game Design Systems that don't belong in a horror game it just got to be scary just make it scary okay yeah maybe I should try that uh okay so yeah in terms of uh let's say that I'm prototyping I'm trying to figure out so I'm trying to follow your guide on uh trying to choose a genre that is good for Steam and trying to wait a little bit before making my Big Marketing push announcing the game so in between that point in between making a prototype until I'm sure that I know my idea how should I validate that idea should I like post gifts on Twitter something like that how do I how do I test do I know okay this genre this idea is potentially viable so I'm going to push through it yeah yeah so what I um uh search on my blog hadark game.com um search genre I've done a lot of genre reports um also um because we're doing this as part of the summer sale if you click the link down below I do this every year I do this uh lecture Series where I look at the previous year and I look at the genres that are hot and I track it every time because one thing any time I talk about a genre that's hot people are like well it's hot this year was it hot last year what's changing it doesn't change that much that's that's a big myth that a lot of Indies fall for they get too scared of they think oh well the genres change so fast they don't actually change too fast because the biggest genres are strategy games um horror games Civilization like forx style games firstperson Shooters those genres have been popular since way back in my when I was like 16 years old city I used to play so many city builders strategy games and firstperson shooters guess what they're still hot um but anyway so I talk about um in that in that class it's called game marketing ideas you'll see the last two years of lectures where I go by straight down the line of what genres are selling on Steam so that's one resource and and Hugo you and I have collaborated if you buy it Hugo gets a nice little um present for for helping do that so you're supporting Hugo by doing by picking up game marketing ideas um but in general it's it's hard and this is why I do what I do it's it's hard you can you can kind of lie to yourself that a genre is hot when you look at the data because you'll find one that succeeds and what I really try and do and it's I I try and look at the medians of several genres and compare them and I look across so many different things like um streamers so it's it is you can do it I just recommend that you don't look at just the winners because every genre has one game that succeeds the difference is genres have a huge range of sales some sell very well some don't and so what I recommend is really looking across the time and that's kind of why I I do the writing so if you search my blog for genre you'll see what I recommend of the top genres and then from within that data that I've presented you can kind of pick games that are um the games that speak to you because this is games it should still be fun for you so if there's genres that you just absolutely absolutely don't like or actually are like kind of interested in you're like oh yeah that does sound interesting then you can try those and see if you actually they make a good fit for you so that's kind of how I'd recommend picking a game now to your question Hugo about how do you validate one way to validate yes is share it on Twitter like say hey here here's my monster and show a picture of your monster and see what it is um you can do the trailer but here's the problem is for the most part 99% of games don't impress just with their visuals most of them impress with their gameplay so it's kind of a hard thing I recommend you make a demo much earlier than most people expect so you try with some screenshots and some video uh you know of the game being played most of the time you won't get any good data out of that because it has to be a very very very goodlooking game to go viral on social media it's not until people play it and you give it to streamers and you enter into festivals with that demo do you start to see oh yeah this is getting some numbers I've seen a lot of games that did poorly on Twitter but as soon as they put out the the demo it the the the wish list skyrocketed and everybody loved the game so it's hard to do that early validation and not convince yourself it's a bad idea it's it's hard so I would just recommend make a lot of games make them quickly and learn that way interesting yeah I mean play testing is extremely important I mean at the end of the day we're making games so yeah if the game looks great but doesn't play great then it's not very it's not a very good game so yeah focusing on the play test making sure that the game design actually works yeah that is definitely very important so let's say that I've published my game or I'm about to publish my game should I go with Early Access or not or are there specific genres that should go into Early Access and some that shouldn't in general if you just to ask me Chris should I do early access I'd say no I don't know why somewhere it's kind of like Platformers Indies were just Inception like some brain wave came and they said I've got to make an early access puzzle platformer I don't know where that came in but so many Indies make puzzle games and so many Indies do Early Access in general I don't like Early Access because it's I consider it high risk High reward the way early access goes is if it goes well it goes very well and if it goes poorly it goes very poorly and the reason is um Early Access if you don't sell very much in the in the beginning I did some analysis if you search my blog for Early Access I found that if you get under a 100 reviews you have like a 1% chance of actually like getting enough sales to justify the game's presence on Steam um it's very hard to work yourself out of a hole in Early Access and so the reason I say it's high risk High reward is if you flub The Early Access launch a lot of IND treat Early Access like I just want to get a little I just want to get some feedback I'm just going to put it out on Early Access see what people think and if it it does well then I'll keep working on because a lot of times when you just put it out there early that's your launch that as soon as somebody can spend money on your game that is your launch and you need that seven you know how I said you need 7,000 wish list you need that for your Early Access launch and a lot of Indies think oh I don't have 7,000 I'm just going to put it out in Early Access see what people think then I'm going to try for the 7,000 you need that 7,000 your Early Access launch this is why I think Early Access is so hard is because you've never if if this is your first game you need to provide enough content to the game to make it like interesting for people to do early access for somebody to buy and say yeah this was a good purchase but not so much content that you spend so long working on it that you're missing out on that time of Early Access development it's like you're like threading the needle between two things and it's so hard games alone are hard to make it's much harder to like thread it between the too early but not too early type of thing no that's why I say just your first game just just try and get it out there um because if you fail on your Early Access launch it's dead and then what happens with Early Access because Early Access is like hey come build it with us you'll get some people on there that are really mean to you they're like You released this early access game and I paid money for it and I want updates every single month and and they believe that they that you owe constant updates and so now you're sitting on a game that launched poorly and you got this weird guy on the internet yelling at you because you're not doing enough in updates that is just a recipe for hating your life um so don't do that that's why I always recommend your first couple games don't do Early Access but if you were looking to see like what should my numbers be like am I ready for Early Access I talked to a couple developers up um one of the interviews that I did for my blog was with deep rock Galactic survivors they do nothing but Early Access games games that studio and they always recommend doing stuff um you need at least 10 to 20 hours of content for your Early Access launch so the type of games that do well in Early Access are these systems driven procedurally generated games that can just quickly do 10 to 20 hours and then over the course of Early Access by the time of your 1.0 launch you've got like 30 hours of content that is the scale of game that does well in Early Access so if you're making a puzzle platformer with like one hour of content and you're trying to do Early Access launch you're going to have poor sales and there's going to be an internet man who yells at you every day I don't think you want that that's why I say just put it out on 1.0 just skip the whole Early Access thing does that make sense yeah yeah that does Mak sense and actually from that I you don't want the internet man to yell at you internet man is the worst uh so yeah I guess uh a follow up related to the very first question which is so you're talking about how in Early Access if the Early Access launch doesn't do very well it's very hard to uh kind of go back to it and have a successful 1.0 launch in the in the beginning you were talking about how steam is like a success letter so you got to get 7,000 wish list to get on the popular upcoming to then get on new and trending to kind of kick off the algorithm so basically I guess the question is if I have a bad Early Access launch what are the odds that I can turn around make it a successful launch what are the odds that I can actually kick the algorithm in order to hopefully have a successful 1.0 it is very rare I don't know the number is right off the top of my head I can actually send you a link Hugo after that to put down below to this article but it is so if you get let let let me tell you the upper end I found that if you have 250 reviews by your launch like if you do Early Access and in the first month you get 250 reviews you have about a 30% chance of having a thousand reviews by your One auto launch okay so so 1,000 reviews by the way there's nothing in the algorithm that's just kind of my Eng that hey your game did well it's just a number I picked out thought 1,000's a good number that's a good sign so even if you do very well get 250 reviews in your first month of being in Early Access you have a 30% chance of succeeding with a thousand reviews that is how risky it is so it is very and then it goes down sharply after that under that 250 so if you don't get 250 reviews in your first month on Steam the numbers are even worse it's like 1% chance of getting to a th000 inters but check that blog you'll see the graph that I made and I got this graph by I scraped data from every game that had an early access launch and then went to 1.0 and I just compared the one month of Early Access launch to the one month of that 1.0 and compared to see what the differences were and saw how many games actually improved it is very rare I think I found like six games that beat the odds and had a poor Early Access launch and then had a good 1.0 it was like six games since like 2016 so it is very very very very hard to succeed after an early access launch I am sorry that's just the way it is yeah so basically it sounds like Early Access very risky and definitely should not be a decision taken lightly definitely should focus very hard I wish steam would call it something different than Early Access I wish they would call it like hard mode like do you want to do hard mode check the box and you're like yeah I would I'll do it but when it sounds Early Access it just sounds so nice you're like oh ACC early what's so bad about it no it's they should call it hard mode all right so yeah that was awesome all those are interesting questions those are a great aners so I hope a lot of people found this uh quite useful so yeah Chris you're currently running a summer sale on all of your courses so where can people go if they want to learn a bit more dive deeper into the world of marketing and how to increase their ODS of finding success on Steam yeah like I said every single one of my courses is on sale and I'm partnering with Hugo because youo I love your videos you do the best development videos I love watching them and a lot of people that you uh teach come back to my courses my community and say hey Chris we we heard about you from Hugo and he's great and I I agree so I partner with Hugo so if you buy the courses with the links below Hugo and I are like sharing we're just gonna we're like sharing stuff like like kids on a playground um so you
