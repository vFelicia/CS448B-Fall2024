hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so a while ago I came across this video titled I used AI to make a game with zero coding experience it's a great video very interesting specifically is the point where he mentions how several people have already done something just like this but they always have some coding knowledge that allows them to correct the AI output I talked about exactly this in my chat gbt video how the output that it generates is functional but definitely has some sneaky issues that you need some experience to identify so in this video his goal was to really put that to the test can he make a game with no cutting knowledge and just using what the AR outputs I'd encourage you to watch a phone video it's definitely very interesting and Matt's whole channel is really great if you want to follow the AI space there are tons of tools that I've only heard through his channel anyway so the video is great and basically spawn alert he did manage to build the game using nothing but AI I don't think he ever manually fixed any of the scripts he just on the air there were some problems and over time it eventually fixed them for example the player was not jumping it did produce a code to make it move left to right now at first there were some bugs like it was not erasing the screen but by conversing with the AI and telling it what was wrong over time it did manage to fix those issues however for jumping that one did take quite a while to finally fix he tried many times and the year I was returning new code but not really fixing anything he even tried pasting the entire code and the air refactored it but still did not fix the issue after 4 hours of back and forth with the AI he decided to stop recording and continue off screen I don't think he mentioned how long in total it took to get to the final game but he did manage to use another AI to generate some graphics and then asked chatgpt how to implement them in the game he added some coin pickups and a game over condition so in the end he did have a functional working game the player can move can jump can pick up coins keep a high score and die so it is a working game with that let's address the questions in the tunnel of this video first can you make an AI with zero coding experience and the answer is yes yes you can it's a very basic game but still it is possible and the second question our game developers out of a job for that the answer is no while this is technically doable it's not really practical as the game became more complex it became harder and harder to implement features and modify the code he mentioned how several times he came across the token limit on chechi PT you can't really Pace a code base of a thousand lines of code onto it so you can't really make it have the context of an entire code base and this game is still extremely simple as you can imagine once you start adding things like for example enemy AI an inventory system maybe a safe system with all those things it would be very hard to manage since you can't give the AI the entire code base as context to me the most important takeaway from this video is what I mentioned right at the end how he started with zero coding knowledge and by doing this experiment by asking the AI to write some code and telling it what was wrong over time he did start to understand Logic for how the code actually works honestly I believe this is one of the best use cases for AI as a sort of private tutor where you can ask it questions and get an immediate response now as you can see it doesn't always get it right but still being able to bounce ideas off of someone or something can be really helpful for example I try to always answer questions posted in the comments in my videos I try to answer them every day but even so it can be 24 or 48 hours before I answer them whereas chat GPT is instant so that speed and getting feedback really helps the learning process now with that said there's a question if you had fun with a regular tutorial would he have gotten much further faster or not it's really hard to tell I would guess the answer that really depends on a per person basis some people like learning from tutorials watching something and then trying to apply it for example that's how I learn but other people prefer more back and forth style of learning where you go step by step and ask questions rather than trying to figure out by yourself honestly the answer is probably somewhere in the middle for example if he had followed my recently released free complete course it would have taken them longer than this game but the end game in there is much more complex and you would have gained much more knowledge as to how the code actually works so if someone really wants to learn and not just produce something I would still highly recommend them to follow a proper tutorial or some course and just keep chat GPT open on the site to ask some general questions in the end my thoughts on AI are still the same as what I covered when chechi PT first came out it's a great tool for you as a Game Dev to use to help you be more productive and efficient rather than a tool that will replace you with the recent Unity announcement there were some comments that were concerned at the time they spent learning Game Dev was wayson minds of that is we are still very far from being able to ask an AI to build a complete game and it actually builds a compelling experience game development informs a ton of different skills and the AI is great at some of those but still very far from putting them all together into one complete cohesive experience so it cannot do everything but it can definitely do some things so absolutely take the time to learn how to use it yourself use it to help yourself become better rather than to replace you personally I don't really use it for generating code for example I could build a game just like this much faster by myself than by asking chechi PT to write some code code and then fixing the issues but I have used it quite a bit for helping me brainstorm titles for videos or for using it to generate part of the thumbnail or maybe generate some metaphors for some mini games the age of AI is definitely here and the developers that learn how to use it alongside them will definitely surpass the ones I refuse to learn it so spend some time figuring out how AI can help you in your daytoday Game Dev tasks alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
