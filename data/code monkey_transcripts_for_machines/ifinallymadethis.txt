hello and welcome I'm your codm and I finally made something that I've wanted to do for a real long time now if you've been following the channel for a while you might have seen me post some of these questions these are some interesting multichoice questions that every once in a while I would post on the community time I think this is an easy fun way to learn and I definitely would like to do some more of these by answering some questions and then reading the detailed answer with all the links by doing that you can really learn in a really nice fun way so I've always wanted to make this a more regular thing but when I post these this was all just an entire men ual process and considering how always so busy working on so many things at the same time I really couldn't find the time to constantly post this so the goal that I've had for literally years at this point was to Simply automate this process and lately I finally found some time and I've been exactly working on this project on my website I made a really nice system where every 3 days a new question is selected automatically this is picked randomly from the list of questions so it's also fun for me since I wrote a ton of questions and I don't remember half of them questions like for example over here what is the equivalent to input get mouse button down on new input system package so is it input system. getet Mouse button down or is it mouse. current. left button was presses frame or is it player input. Mouse read value of bone so if you want to answer take a few seconds and try to answer so in my case I'm pretty sure I know the answer and I'm pretty sure that it's this one and yep I was thankfully correct like it says here the new input system is awesome and a lot more capable although that comes at the cost of increased complexity so doing something like a simple button check that is super easy in the input manager but not many people know you can also very easily do it in new input system here's another interesting question so can you modify the transform. for directly in order to rotate a transform so yes or no in my case I do know the answer is yes because this is my preferred method for rotating a transform so let's vote and yep I am indeed correct you can modify transform forward in order to rotate a transform the simplest way is really just calulate a direction to your Target and then set it to that direction that will make the transform Point directly towards your target alternatively you can also modify the transform. up to match a collision normal this is exactly what I use in the video on how I made the Scout probe launcher from other Wells basically how that Scout probe is thrown and then it attaches to a place and gets pointed to the opposite of where it lands or alternatively one working in 2D it can be super useful for some kind of top down shooter here's another fun one so what is the difference between action float and Funk float so are they both the same does Action take a float parameter and Funk return a float or does Funk float take a float parameter and action float return float so which one is it I'm going to take a random guess and let's say that it's a third one and no this is actually incorrect cor so the correct answer was B so action float takes a float parameter and fun float returns a float both these are types of delegates actions are delegates that return void and can have multiple parameters or none of them whereas funks they are delegates that return a specific type delegates are super awesome I definitely encourage you to learn about them I covered them in detail here and I've used them in tons of places like for example in the video where I talked about how to make an HTTP request from directly inside unity in doing this class I made a really nice callback so it actually gets the output back into a deleg or alternatively for interacting with all kinds of cloud providers usually that is done through an HTTP request so again you would use a delegate in order to not have the game freeze up whilst waiting for a response and a secondary thing related to this question is the type inside the angle brackets this is a generic which I also have a video on and it's also another Super useful thing so as you can see these are fun interesting questions related to C Unity or game development in general if you'd like to set up a habit of getting these I made an automated email notification you can go to the website and then log in then go into your user page then here you can manage your email notifications and there's a new one so you can receive every question of the day like I said these are all automatically generate so every 3 days there's a brand new question or alternatively you can just see it on the website I made it over here right underneath the last three videos I think this is an interesting way to increase your knowledge by answering some interesting questions every few days one thing that I always say is that it's much better to learn something regularly as opposed to making a huge Sprint and then not touching anything for an entire week so making a habit of answering a question every 3 days that should hopefully help you learn better and as you saw regardless if you get the answer right or wrong I made sure to include lots of extra details in the actual answer alongside links to any helpful videos that I've already done so whether you get it wrong or you already know the answer either way you might still learn something new this is something that I've wanted to make for a long time and I finally made it so I really hope you enjoy it thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
