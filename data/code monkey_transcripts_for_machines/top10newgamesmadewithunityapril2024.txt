hello and welcome I'm your Cod Mak and here let's check out the top new games made with un launch in April 24 this was an interesting month there were maybe about 30 or 40 games that I found quite interesting but also a surprising amount of them actually had some issues and had mixed reviews although even without those it was still tricky to pick just 10 for this list there were plenty that looked interesting and were well made the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the gamees shown here really puts us to the test all these games are inly impressive so the list in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month and actually before we begin just an honorable mention one of the most and thisp game of the past few years is finally out manner Lords this one had 3 million wish lists that's more than most triaa games this is another mention simply just because it's not made with unity it's an unreal game but it looks like a very well made game it already has over 20,000 very positive views so it's definitely living up to the hype it's a city Builder medieval game with an insane amount of interconnected systems and the most impressive thing of all this was made sort of by a s Dev over the course of s years I say sort of because while it did start as a s Dev after a while when he got an epic me brand he used that money to hire all sorts of contractors so the final game is not really Soul made but still really impressive to guide and build such a massive project involving so many people over so many years this definitely likely going to end up one of the biggest hits of the Year by the way the response to my Game Dev report video format has been very positive those videos take a ton of work to make so I can't really produce that kind of video very regularly but what I can do more regularly is write some text so I've set up a newsletter you can sign up and I'll keep you up to date with the latest in Game Dev Tekken gaming also I should mention a really great bundle that just started right now you can get a mountain of awesome asses for just 25 bucks it has everything from weapons a bunch of survival things you've got boats terrains cities there's Wild West modern lots of melee weapons a bunch of food and so on so this is a really great model you can make an infinite amount of games with these assets all for just 25 bucks or alternatively if you want specifically C the assets they also have a sale in their store right now so check out everything with the links in the description all right so starting off the unity games list at number 10 here we have content warning this was technically an April Fool's game but it is generally great the goal is to use a camera to film you and your friends doing scary things to get tons of views on spook tube you go onto to an abandoned building explore with your trusty camera and flashlight try to film as many scary things as possible without dying and without running out of oxygen or battery then if you survive you upload your footage to Spook tube and hope it gets tons of views with the add revenue from the video you can buy upgrades and equipment to be able to make a better video next time this is a really fun concept and it's the perfect streamer bait kind of game also very interesting is how they launched this game it came out on apron fools and was free for that one day then afterwards became a $10 paid game so even though they technically launch a game for free I'm guessing they still made a ton of money from it basically by making it free for one day and having a great game it got tons of players and tons of positive reviews which then boosts the game in the algorithm even after it goes paid definitely a very interesting marketing strategy I would not necessarily recommend you follow this because of how difficult it is to pull off but in this case clearly they found tons of success next up here is an awesome tactics game no plan B I'm pretty sure that I covered this one when it first came out into Early Access and now it's been fully released it's a tactics game where you control a team of SWAT and literally draw out your plans you tell the unit exactly where to go and where to aim you set up the timing perfectly in order to throw a flashbang and then do a breach afterwards you can use all the weapons and tools at your disposal to take out all the bad guys and complete the mission without any injuries now one very important thing about this game is you might have noticed these are using some very recognizable cinti assets like I've said many times you should not worry about using assets for fear players won't turn on you players really only want fun games to play regardless of what you use to build them this game is interesting and is fun to play so because of that the reviews are very positive and none of them mention any assets so don't be afraid to use assets to bring your games to life like I said this one is out now in 1.0 and it's out with over 500 very positive reviews this one was almost my personal pick for this month I love the mechanics and I definitely want to find some time to play it then here's a really unique one that a lot of people are talking about Children Of The Sun you play as an assassin and you have a special ability of controlling your bullets from Target to Target so it's actually more of a puzzle game than an action game you need to get the timing in the order right in order to jump from Target to Target until the final real Target you also have just a single bullet so you cannot miss because of that you need to scout the area before you fire your one and only shot visually the game has a very unique style it looks looks very trippy with tons of effects the story is All About escaping and taking revenge on some kind of Nefarious com definitely very strange very unique game people are really enjoying it it's got over 500 very positive reviews next here's a fun one called another crabs treasure this is a soulslike game where you play as a hermit crab these crabs usually have some shell or some object on their back and the game play very much takes that into account you have over 50 shells you can find to protect you in various ways it's got Souls like combat and you've got plenty of powerful abilities to learn to use in your adventure the trailer also has some really nice voice acting for the characters it almost makes it look kind of disneylike it looks like a very Charming game and despite being a ssik it does seem quite approachable it is out now with 1500 very positive views at 94% positive up next we have a gorgeous looking game titled no rest for the wiced right away visually this looks really gorgeous super high quality very dark and Moody which is actually a bit odd considering how this is the same developer that made the excellent Orient the blind Forest it's always interesting when Studios make a hard turn and make something completely different this one is an action RPG a DI like game so you've got lots of action and lots of loot you equip and enchant your Armament to make a character build that fits your play style you can explore this beautiful handcrafted world and rest in a town where you can buy some property and make it your own then venture out and defeat some more enemies you can play at a solo or an online coop it is out now in Early Access and reviews are at mostly positive it seems people love the combat but the loot and inventory management does seem to need some quality of life Improvement since it is in Early Access hopefully they have some time to polish everything before the final release next here's another one that just hit 1.0 the planet crafter this is a survival open world terraforming game you crash land on an inhospitable planet and your goal is to make it habitable for Humanity you gather all kinds of resources and start building build out your base from various modules grow some plants generate some oxygen generate some warmth and pressure in order to create a brand new biosphere the terraforming aspect for this game does look really awesome you start off with a Barren red World completely empty of life and after doing doing a ton of work suddenly the planet is luscious filled with color and lots of water and lots of plants the whole game works either Solo or up to 10 players in Coop which is actually a pretty huge amount this one is already a huge hit in Early Access it is out now in 1.0 with a total of 30,000 overwhelmingly positive reviews at 96% positive that's an insane amount of reviews and insane positive percentage then for some VR here we have convergence it's a single player VR shooter with some horror elements likely it seems like every VR game that comes out is in multiplayer so it's actually great to find a nice single player one one of my favorite VR games of all time is Arizona sunshine and this one seems similar to that you scavenge this Zone fillmed with radiation gather some Loot and fight some Bandits you also have a trusty dog by your side to help you out however be sure to return to base before DUS Falls there's some weird creatures that come out at night the weapon mechanics look really great you can prepare and set up your weapon before going out your inventory also seems to have a nice physical backpack which looks really great one interesting thing is how it's actually in Early Access the game seems more so focused and sandbox which usually is not the kind of thing you see on Early Access but regardless people are really enjoying it it's got almost 300 very positive viws then for something more nice and calming here is Echoes of the Plum Grove this is a farming and life Sim game you can pick up some tools and start farming all kinds of things decide what to plant what to stck for the winter and who to be friend in this nice cozy town but eventually something will go wrong maybe some disease or some Hunger so make sure you grow your family tree so that once you perish you can pick a child and continue playing this like mechanic sounds really interesting it allows you to grow your farm and continue building it for many generations I also always love games with this art sound to the characters in a 3D World I definitely would like to use this style in one of my games someday looks really great this one is out now with 150 very positive reviews at 97% positive then here's also one that has been very anticipated for a long time infection free zone it's a zombie strategy defense game you control units set up buildings and outposts gather resources and build some defenses then at night the zombies come and you have to survive now the gimmick for this one is how you play it anywhere you want in the real world and supposedly it sort of matches so it can be a fun fantasy for defending from some zombie apocalypse in your own Hometown however anytime a game promises this kind of thing it always makes you a bit skeptical simply it's based on the fact that the real world really was not built for compelling game design so because that I'm guessing they manually handb build an interesting experience in the common places like New York Berlin Paris and so on but if you go into a small town in an unknown country I doubt the experience won't be as good but maybe I'm wrong about that maybe the game is indeed great literally anywhere on earth now interestingly enough this game only has mostly positive reviews just barely on the 70% mark this is surprising given how the prologue had 90% positive reviews the main negative seem to be lack of quality of life improvements lots of clicking and repetitive looting but it is only in Early Access and the base does seem solid so maybe when hits 1.0 it won be a really nice experience and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is russy's retirement this is an idle game where you farm and build a nice Town however importantly this sits at the bottom of your screen while you do something else I think this is an awesome gimmick for the ult genre usually when I play ult games I keep it open on my second monitor so putting it on the bottom of the main window is a genius idea it even also works on super wi resolutions like 21 by9 or even in vertical mode you can grow crops you can produce some biofuel automate it with robots and just enjoy watching your characters and your robots live their life and then something that actually was surprising to me I actually mentioned this game in a previous video of mine they say how the game actually got started when they saw my Unity transparent tutorial this makes me really happy I love seeing how people learn things from my tutorials and then build some awesome games like this one and find tons of success the game is out now and people really love it it's already got over, 1500 overwhelmingly positive views at 97% positive that's really awesome all right so that's 10 awesome new games made with un launch in April 24 I hope this list helped you see how the UN engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just your own skills and Imagination check out my own game than Guardians and I hope you enjoy playing it
