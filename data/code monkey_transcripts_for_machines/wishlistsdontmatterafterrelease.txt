hello and welcome I'm your KMI I saw this post on Reddit and I felt really important to make this video to clarify something that is indeed extremely important so the post is our horror game went somewhat viral but it was disappointing so what went wrong now this is a sad result when some kind of game doesn't get enough sales it's a sad result but suddenly it is not uncommon basically they released a horror game onto Early Access based on a local radio show from Indonesia and apparently the game went prev viral it reached number seven on trending in the gaming carard on YouTube that's definitely super high that's definitely very impressive countless Youtubers with millions of subscribers played our game and the feedback was mostly positive however the result an underwhelming number of wish lists and sales despite good publicity this is really the part that stood out to me right away and why I had to make this video despite right here underwhelming number of wish lists specifically this person is talking about wish lists after release looking at the game over here on cdb we can scroll down and we can see that just before release they had only 19 followers so we can guesstimate roughly around 220 wish lists one of the comments asked what kind of marketing did you do for your game and developer answered that they basically didn't really do anything just did some local things with a local radio station the steam page really on launched a few weeks prior to release so apparently their plan was to quickly launch the game and then after launch get a bunch of wish list and get a bunch of sales to then hopefully have a successful 1.0 release now here I want to warn you to not do this because this does not work wish list matter a lot I made a video talking about how the same algorithm works and that video is based on an act video posted by steam themselves the basic idea is wish list matter a lot before release the goal is to build up a massive wish list amount so that when the game finally releases all those wish lists get an email and hopefully buy your game then hopefully those that do buy the game they enjoy it which leads to more visibility on seam and starts the ball rolling that is really the main purpose behind wish list but after the game is out after release wish lists don't really matter much the game did get millions of views in coverage we can look for it and see yep here's one video getting 2 million views that's an insane amount and it's a 57 minute videos so it's really detailed then there's a bunch more 300K views another one with 1.2 million almost 1 million so this game did get a ton of coverage but again importantly all of that coverage all of that came after release so this one on November 28th and November 28th that was way after the game actually released so we can see over here a bump so a bunch of people did see it thanks to those videos so it appears that here maybe it gained about a th000 wish lists and if this was before release this would be quite useful but after release these amount of wish listes don't really matter too much so my goal in this video is simply to tell you that wish list matter a ton but they matter before release after release don't worry about wish list after release really the only thing that matters are just sales and this is actually also a really interesting case study on the power of influencers or rather how sometimes they have a lot of power and sometimes not so much getting covered by influencers is not an automatic win it depends a lot on what influencer it is and perhaps more importantly on what gen it is then another topic is the game is actually launched into Early Access which by itself Early Access for horror games that is usually not a very good option Early Access is really more meant for systems based games whereas things like horror which I'm guessing is more of a story focused game for these kinds of games Early Access usually doesn't help too much but perhaps more broadly over here we can see approximately how long will this game be in early access and the goal is to be just approximately 3 months so on this I also want to caution you not to do this if you do go into Early Access First of all have a game that works with Early Access but then secondly make sure you go into Early Access if you have a plan for it for at least one year Early Access is really tricky it's really difficult to get right if you want to see some tips for it there's some really great articles over here on the H Market game blog there's on should you do Early Access another one all about the launch numbers but in general Early Access is not a quick thing so if you are just 3 months away from the final release I would say only launch your game onto 1.0 straight away because basically by doing it into Early Access by doing this you're actually going to sell quite a lot less during early access and the only way that the 1.0 will work well is if the 1.0 is dressy different from the Early Access so that is why I say pretty much only going to Early Access if you have at least one year of development ahead of you and yet another thing related specifically to Early Access on the original post Dev says from this lesson we're trying to revamp the game at the moment for the phone release doing an overhaul of the scenarios mechanics visuals and everything hopefully we can do better this time around and on this one I would say suddenly this is probably not going to work out very well usually if your game flops during Early Access if so then it's really difficult to get back on some kind of 1.0 release usually for the most part you only have one launch that is either your normal launch or your Early Access launch and if that one fumbles like this one sort of did if so then it is highly highly likely you get massive exposure on the 1.0 release chances are that when this game comes out of Early Access when it does a 1.0 when that happens it will probably sell maybe 10% more copies but certainly not 10 times more if you do decide to do Early Access keep in mind that it is highrisk high reward the games that do find success they find massive success but those are extremely rare most of the games if they flop during the Early Access release if they do so they will also flop during the 1.0 release so sadly statistically speaking it is highly likely that this game will turn around for the 1.0 release but I hope I'm wrong I hope this Dev manag just to turn it around and I hope that by watching this video you now know what not to do mainly remember how wish lists really only matter before release there's an excellent hble Bund right now with a M neset all for just 25 bucks if you don't yet have a mega pack like this one then I highly recommend you pick this up anytime you have an idea for a game it is really useful to have a bunch of assets you can easily pick up and use with all these assets you can make tons of really interesting games and if you want to stay up to date with the latest news on Game Dev Tech and gaming then sign up for my Game Dev report newsletter if you've seen in my videos
