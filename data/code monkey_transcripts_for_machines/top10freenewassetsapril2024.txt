hello and welcome I'm your KMI the asseta is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for April 24 in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid ass and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also quick update on my C course I'm currently editing the first few lectures for the advance section which will be out soon and the free YouTube video with the intermediate section that one w't be out on next Monday also course students and channel members get access to the private community Discord as well as the QA and live streams that happen every Saturday so if you have any questions join the live stream and ask and I'll do my best to help all right so on to the top 10 list starting off with a fun one all about generating gears you can Define how many gears you want then how many teeth per Gear and where exactly does the chain connect it's all precedently generated so it looks really great you can apply and move all kinds of Gears with all kinds of teeth and it all makes sense honestly this looks quite complex for a free asset I just recently got into cycling and whenever I get into something I go on YouTube and watch tons of videos on that topic and in this case I just watched some videos on how bicycle gears work now as fascinating So based on that if you'd like to make some kind of Simulator game involving gears and this asset is perfect next if you need a low poly character check out this one it's a pretty nice original design so if you're tired of the standard low poly sort of cinti style if so then this looks like a great alternative it is low poly but clearly a different style this one kind of reminds me of the game absolver it's a humanoid character so you can combine it with any animations then then here's a bit of a strange one it's a warehouse this is an asset officially made by unity apparently it's what they use for their digital twin tools it's a complete Warehouse so you have all kinds of shelves cargo equipment and a bunch of workers this is technically meant for making a virtual Warehouse just like you would have in real life and then you can do something like train an AI robot to learn how to walk around this warehouse and do all kinds of tasks and after training it you can then place that robot in Real Life and it will know how to navigate that real world environment I'm a say the concept of digital twins is something that does fascinate me in an alternate universe where I hadn't gotten into game development if so I think I would have gotten into robotics working on these kinds of systems then for a nice tool here is hierarchy designer the default Unity hierarchy is super basic there's really no way to organize things which can make it quite tricky when you have a complex scene setup whereas with a tool like this you can make it much more organized by applying a bunch of folders or you can make some things much more visible with some icons or some colors this one looks quite impressive impressive really capable and all in all it's a free tool next for some fun visuals here are some loading screen VFX this is the kind of thing you can see during various cutcenes in a SciFi game where the character is interacting with some screen or maybe for example instead of a cut scene you could use this just in regular gameplay so in some game kind of like that space where you control a character whenever the player interacts with some computer you could show this kind of loading screen it looks very good very satified perfectly matches that aspect you've got several colors to choose which one you prefer or maybe inste you need a tool to highlight some object or character if so check out this one it's a post procing effect to highlight characters or some object on screen this is really excellent for doing things like tutorials where you really want to guide the players to look at one very specific spot this one includes lots of effects for different ways you can highlight objects some are pixelated some are just a round circle so you can apply this in various ways this is a very useful tool for all kinds of scenarios or if you want you can just download and inspect it to learn how to make some custom post Crossing effects and then here's a fun pack with a bunch of ships and planes every time I see a pack like this with a bunch of vehicles I always say the same thing I really wish I had the time to build a complete RTS game as a kid I spent a lot of time playing Age of Empires and Command and Conquer for making those kinds of games all you really need is just a pack like this one just a bunch of things with some Vehicles some planes boats cars and so on you just need those and just make different colors and suddenly you have multiple factions you can control or maybe with the same pack you could make one of those arcade helicopter Gam just fly a helicopter around some kind of base and shoot down cars and vehicles then for another nice visual tool here is mini Shadow this one lets you cast a shadow on an imaginary plane meaning it's not an actual Shadow it's not controlled by any lights it's not based on having a lit material or anything like that it's really a fake Shadow and you can cast Shadows from either 2D or 3D objects then you can play around with various settings modify the intensity or the attenuation of the mask and then if you need to upgrade your game's visuals one of the best ways to do that is with a Sky Box like this one this one is a pack with 15 super high resolution Sky boxes they all look really nice and stylized you've got lots of variation between some blue clear skies or some gorgeous sunsets or if instead you need some kind of weird monster creature check out this one it's really weird a very unique design very flashlike it's got all kinds of weird appendages and also includes some strange animations like swimming and punching while submersed I guess it makes sense for some kind of water creature and it also comes with some really cool strange bone axe weapon so if you wanted you could just take this weapon and use that with some kind of human character all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the UR for April 24 there's links well in the description and also check out my own fre Pedas on store all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more
