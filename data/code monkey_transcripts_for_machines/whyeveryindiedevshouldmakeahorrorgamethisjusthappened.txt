hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey okay so this is pretty interesting a practical example of some advice that I mentioned in a previous video literally just happened it's hly Eerie how the timing is such a coincidence I recorded my interview with Chris on the 18th and literally on the 19th this happened but anyways first just some context on what exactly am I talking about and how does this relate to the title in this video so last week I made a video with Chris sukowski who is a seam marketing expert we talked a lot about how seam Works definitely go ahead and watch that video and the two followups if you haven't seen them yet there's tons of really awesome marketing knowledge so in there I asked him about something that I read in one of his blog posts already heard you say several times is how horror is supposedly a great genre because it's very simple to make something and it really just needs something a little bit interesting as long as it has a little hook something that is slightly different it doesn't have to be super complex personally I have to say for me horror is not the kind of games that I like to play I get scared way too easily but your your uh comments saw in the genre definitely made me slightly convinced that I should probably give it a try because yeah it seems like a seems like can be a good genre here here's here's one thing a lot of people wonder about I don't like horror horror sells so well so well and you don't even have to be a fan to make a horror game and let me let me explain um I'm I'm a big film buff I love movies I'm always I'm always reading about film and stuff like that um I love movies um one of the best horror films ever made The Shining made by Stanley cubrick that guy didn't even like horror movies he only made The Shining because his previous movie that he made was a total flop nobody liked it he's like God these horror movies are always hits I need a hit I'm gonna make the best horror movie ever I don't even like him and so he read all these horror books and he's like I hate this book I hate this book and then he found The Shining he's like this is a good story and he decided to make The Shining this classic horror film just because he wanted a hit and I like this is very similar to Indies they're like I'm sick of making these puzzle Platformers that never sell I'm sick of it fine I'm just going to make a horror game and they do amazingly well and literally the day after I recorded that interview with Chris that literally just happened I read about this on the game discover code newsletter also an excellent source for indie game marketing I high recommend you follow it so an indie studio called Ember spent four years working on their first game it's called straight lights it looks extremely wellmade this is a really gorgeous looking very atmospheric game I love the style the boss fights are really awesome everything is super stylish super well made but despite being such a cool looking game and despite actually receiving quite a lot of positive reviews from critics despite that didn't actually sell very well at all on see it has 190 reviews they're at 84% positive which means that people do like it but in terms of numbers the game really only sold about 7,000 copies so after taking away steams cut after taking away taxes chargebacks returns and so on after all that this is left with maybe $50,000 now that's really not much for four years of work and on an indie Studio that appears to have about eight people so sadly this P looking really cool this is probably not a financially successful game I can imagine that at this point this studio definitely need the hit and they need it quickly in order to say a flat so they spent the next few months working on a horror game it's called murky drivers it just came out and already has more than double the amount of reviews and as all of this despite the fact that it's only been out for a week this is very much a coop horror game very much in the stound that is quite popular nowadays there are tons of streamers playing the game some of them with 500,000 views then there's over here 70,000 views 500k views another one with a million views and so on so this game that was made in under one year so very quickly this one already hit an alltime peak of 1,700 players as opposed to the really awesome game that they spent four years making that peaked at just 87 so this really appears to be the exact same thing that Chris mentioned in that SLE cubric story these Dev spent years working on a really awesome game very wellmade but sadly did not sound very well they really need the hit so they turned on to a horror game and they finally found that hit now naturally this isn't some kind of super secret guaranteed cheat code it's not like every single horror game finds success there are lots of successful ones and lots of unsuccessful ones you don't really get default success just by being a horror game but this very clear example does show how there is a huge audience for horror games and it's also a genre that you can make relatively quickly so even though personally I'm not a fan of horror I don't enjoy playing horror games I don't enjoy watching horror movies but after reading Chris's advice and seeing all this play out in real life at this point I'm getting more and more convinced that at some point in the future I should probably give this idea try and if you yourself are already a fan of horror then this seems like a nobrainer definitely go ahead and give this genre a try you can make the game quickly and there's a huge hungry audience that really likes to playing these games all I need to do is give them something a little bit interesting a little bit unique and they won't definitely go to it I thought this was a really funny coincidence literally the day after I recorded that interview with Chris literally this happened if you want to learn why Chris recommends horror games and learn a lot more about steam game marketing if so definitely go watch my three videos that I made with him tons of information super knowledge and all the videos have time SS for all the questions so definitely go ahead and watch those and if you want to get a ton of marketing knowledge all condens in just a single place definitely go ahead and watch his courses there's a link in the description where you can pick them up this sale is ending just this Sunday so if you're interested definitely get a quickly all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
