here's a quick unity tip did you know that you can right click and open a second inspector here's another tip you can lock one inspector and keep the other one unlocked that way you can select other objects and still see the very first object very helpful for dragging references between them here's an even better tip if you click up here you can select a debug inspector this lets you visualize more data on the selected object like for example you can inspect all of the private fields and see their values so it can be super useful to keep a normal inspector and a debug inspector side by side when you're testing when any issues occur simply pause the game and observe the private fields on the debug inspector alright hope that's useful subscribe for more unity tips
