with the logo and a whole bunch of particles so we just click and it starts to load alright so right away we see a nice intro with a really fun cinematic so there it is a really fun intro now the game itself is an idle auto battler so it's a great way to showcase all these animations and effects so the characters are constantly attacking and over here we see some circular bars constantly growing as soon as they grow they can use a special so this one right here there you go a really awesome special so all these effects look really awesome and i gotta say i really love the sound design here then yep all of them go down and there we go we've got a nice victory so we can go into the next battle all right so now it's a boss fight against a very angry dragon and yep down goes the boss dragon alright so that's a demo as you can see it's a vertical slice that demonstrates tons of awesome 2d tools in action so now let's inspect it and learn to see how all of this works like i said you can download the project files for yourself from the asset store it's completely free this one is meant to be used with unt 2020.2 or the 2020.3 lts version which is what i'm using in here okay so here we are in the editor and right away you see a helm folder and inside there we've got a real nice readme file so here it explains what the demo is about and also has a whole bunch of links to learn some more so you've got a bunch of resources where they say they won't be adding some tutorials based on this demo you've got the previous demo the unlock script which also showcases a ton of gorgeous studio lights then you've got a webinar which went through some of the features on that demo then to the character animation a bunch of tips and so on and of course you can chat with the team directly over on the unt forums alright so here is the first battle scene we can inspect all these objects you can see all these nice gizmos and icons for example this icon that you see everywhere this is a sprite shape this is a really awesome tool for making some custom shapes so for example the main ones you see here is over here this minecart and then over here on the side you want to see the bridge so in terms of texture we can go and look at it and as you can see it's just a normal horizontal texture so this is the bridge texture but when working with sprite shapes we can click in here in order to edit a spline and there you go we see all these points and i can add a new point move it up move it down and so on so it takes a basic texture and creates pretty much any shape you want with it so here is the very weird bridge and the same thing over here for the minecart this is a super useful tool for making some weird shapes based on some standard textures it's handled by this sprite shape controller script and if you click on each point you can even see tons of options by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks so this is one use for sprite shapes but another use is over here these pillars that you see yep look at that this one is also a sprite shape so instead of making this weird shape as a separate texture you just use this and this one showcase how you can have a different film sprite and edge sprite so you can see how the edge is faded which makes it look slightly blurry and if we inspect over here the sprite shape profile we can see how it's set up with a certain film texture which is just a black texture and then a black soft edge which is our edge texture there you go like that and here you can also play around with angles to have different sprites for different shapes you can play around with the offset set the fill or not and so on so that's sprite shape a really awesome tool for easily making some super adaptable shapes another thing you notice right away in this demo are these tiny little green dots these are 2d bones and 2d ik in action so for example if i grab the skeleton sword and i move yep there you go the shoulder and arm moves correctly with it and if you click on the object themselves we can actually see the bones and for example if i grab his pelvis and i just move him around and there you go you can see all the ik in action so all those points those are the target points and it automatically calculates everything needed in order to make the bones hit that position so using 2d ik is super useful for animation then for how all of the body parts are set up this is using another 2d tool it's the psd importer so if we click on it we can see that this character skeleton is a psb file and if we open it here it is the character open up inside of photoshop now usually when making a spreadsheet what you would do would be separate all the body parts and then slice this texture but here as you can see it's set up like a normal character so all the body parts are exactly where they should be so this is the psd important in action it reads all of the separate layers and automatically separates them and use them as body parts so there's no need for you to make some weird spreadsheets with all the body parts separated you just draw your character like normal separate all the layers and then in unity when it imports we can go up here to open up the sprite editor and yep unity automatically splits them up into a proper sprite sheet so you can see how this is super useful for making characters without having to work with all the body parts separate then another 2d feature they're using is normal maps so on the sprite editor you can go here to see some secondary textures and then you can see it's got a normal map and a mass texture and if we click on it yep here is the normal map which then interacts with all of the 2d and lights then over here on the sprite editor another thing we can see is the skinning editor so this is where you can set up all the bones in their area of influence you can see how all of these impact different parts of the sprite so you can see just how many different tools they use in order to bring these characters to life then also the first thing that happened as soon as the battle loads is a nice cutscene so this one is handled by timeline so over here inside cutscenes we've got the timeline intro skeletons if you double click over here on the timeline this opens up the timeline window where you can see all of the events so timeline is another super useful tool that will help you greatly in making cinematics for your game so you've got this bar where you can input all kinds of actions so there you go look at everything happening the intro they go in they move and so on you've got tracks where you can input all the various things so here they're using a track for the ui another one for the camera for some animations audio objects and so on and something which works very well with the timeline is over here the cameras which are using virtual cameras so they're using cinemachine so first starts off with the entrance camera then it goes into the zoom in camera then goes the camera down to the right side then it zooms in and then to the left and then the battle and the ui as well which on the end the ui suddenly pops up and finally when the timeline actually ends so when the cutscene timeline is finished then it goes into this script and calls on this function to actually start the battle so if you've got cutscenes in your game then you should learn how timeline works it can definitely save you a ton of time and of course another thing that this game showcases is very good use of 2d lighting so as you may know there are all kinds of 2d lights you can use for example there's that gem there and it's got a freeform light on top look at that so the light has this shape so it's placed over there in order to really brighten up that gem then you've got a spotlight like this one over here on the entrance so you can play around with all these so these studio lights are really awesome and another interesting thing that they did was to make some lights only affect the background and some only the character so for example over here there's actually two lights placed one on top of the other one so this one as you can see targets for layers this one is only affecting the characters and if i move this you can also see over there the normal maps being impact on the characters so look at that as i move the light it moves where the light actually hits if i select on the lights and just disable them yep you see the difference that it makes then they also use line renderers in some interesting ways so over here you see this thing which seems like a bit of smoke going left and right so this one is just a basic line render so it's using that it's got a certain width the color and so on and then down here it is simply using a material using a custom shader made in shadowgraph so this one is just a basic shader that uses the time node in order to constantly move and change the offset over time then another shadow graph effect you see is over here this little waterfall so that's also handled by a shader and also this one up here which is like a spiderweb waving in the wind this one is also using shadowgraph which again if you want to know how all of these work you can edit and you can see exactly how all these shaders were created then one tool that i'm sure you're already familiar with is the 2d tile map so over here they also used it for the background so like that that's a background setup using tiles i've covered this one in a dedicated video previously if you want to learn more then another element of this demo is the ui interestingly they went with a screen space canvas but using a camera so it matches up perfectly with the scene the ui itself is also some pretty basic stuff so for example the health bars themselves they are just sliders so there you go and for the ring ability it is also just a basic image and over here it's set to filmed radio 360 so then you got the film amount and you just move it and then of course it just has a custom material which really just has an hdr light in order to give it a nice glow so on the ui itself nothing too special just looking great and the last thing that i want to inspect are the effects so here you see all these effects they all look really great and for example let's inspect this one so let's do that one and stop and here we see how they're using the standard particle system so in this case this demo is not using the vfx ref so these are normal standard particles you can see it's on like this got a mission shape color noise renderer and so on there's a whole bunch of really cool effects in this demo so definitely download it and look at them to see how they work and of course there's the dragon scene which features very much of the same thing so tons of sprite shapes studio lights trails effects and then for dragon itself which you set up just like the characters so it's got all kinds of bones it's set up using the psd importer and it's got all these handles with some really nice ik okay so there you have it these sample projects are an excellent way to see how unity themselves use their tools and everything that is possible to make go ahead download the project file and inspect it for yourself depending on what game you're making this can be a great case study to learn how to use these tools and don't forget to check out the asset source spring sale and get some awesome assets at a nice discount alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
