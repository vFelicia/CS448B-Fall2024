hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're going to review all the videos published in March 2019 let's begin March had slightly fewer videos and normal and the reason for that is I have to be focused on the update for been around Tycoon which am VIPs the good news is I took plenty of notes as I was implementing the VIPs and made a nice video showing my process for adding a new feature into the game the VIPs at variety to the game by being special guests with the unique sprites and messages which help keep the game fresh over time it might seem like a somewhat simple system but in order for the final feature to work correctly there are a lot of small things that need to be done so in the video I cover my complete process from starting with a piece of paper until a final implementation of the latest build the game is out on Steam so you can check it out to see the VIPs in action there was a video creating the vitality and posture system from second row shadows die twice this is a really interesting system in the game in that you have essentially two health bars that work in different ways so you have the health bar which is pre normal it goes down with damage and goes up with healing there's also a nice effect to show the amount of damage the player took in the last hit then you have the posture bar which increases as the player Perry's was changing color as it gets full when it gets completely full the posture has been broken and a nice close pride shows up to indicate that it's a very interesting system with the two bars working together and the code is also written in a very clean way by keeping the logic individual separate in a later video we're going to take this system and apply it to some characters while we create the combat system so stay tuned for next month also this last Sunday there was an interesting test with the in live stream it was a interactive life stream which was essentially a test for a game that you can play by typing along in chat I've been thinking about this for quite a while now and this was the first test of what I think could be a really cool thing so many thanks to everyone who showed up to home test out the code now that I know that it does work I can start thinking of more interesting game designs for cool interesting community games so stay tuned to the channel during April for some really cool surprises there were three quick tips videos again these are very short videos that cover a nice tip that you might not know the first one covered how and why you should always use the gnomes for state handling this is one of those things that is extremely important but might be completely unknown to beginners I myself have made the mistake of doing state handling with strings when I was new so in the video I cover actual real problems that happened to me which made me look into a better way of doing things which led me to animus the second video covers another very useful but somewhat hidden feature of unity you can change the number of lines that are displayed in the console per each log entry this is extremely useful for making the console either more compact so you can see a lot of entries at once or make each entry more expanded so you can see more information or the log trace the third quick tip deals with creating game objects specifically the various ways you have of constructing a new game object you can just create one component only default game object using the primary constructor or you can use the optional Constructors to create the game object with a name and pre added components this helps keep your code more clear more compact and also more performing also a summary of the modular sprites as used for guests in battle route thank you this is a great series that teaches you how to copy pixels and tint them in order to create sprites with a lot of variation if you play the game you will see that even with hundreds of guests they are only unique the playlist starts off very simple which is copying basic pixels and through the videos increase in composite so if you want to learn how to manipulate pixels and create modular spreadsheets go check out the full playlist and then pick up the game on Steam there was video covering how to make a shrinking damage circle as used in battle round games this is a prequel element with some interesting logic the circle has a size and a certain position the white circle displays the next size in position which is randomly generated and after some time it starts to shrink towards it everything is completely customizable from the shrink size the random position to the speed of the shrink this script is very versatile and a perfect starting point if you're building a paranoid game then a very interesting video covering something which is very important although not many people talk about it that is learning how the unity transform pivots work and how we can modify them to our advantage by default the pivot point is always in the center which makes some things seem impossible to do like for example a health bar which should scale from one edge instead of from the middle so in this video I cover how the pivots work and how you can be tricky managing transform parents and children to get the pivot exactly where you want it if you are very familiar with how transforms work with the global and local position spaces then you won't be better equipped to create anything in unity one of the videos this month was covering a simple soundmanager so in this video we cover how you can play a sound in the simplest way possible learn how to create a audio source through code and how to manage audio clips in a clean way using anims you can play either 2d or 3d sounds once you know the basics you'll be able to expand upon it by adding more sounds and more features another talking video where I give some game dev advice based on my own experience this one is covering whether you should make a game design document or if it is a waste of time I cover the goal of a game design document and how studios of various scales might have different needs a triplea studio will have very different requirements than a small one or twoperson team in the video I talk about my own experience and how I normally design my games along with how detailed I write my designs before starting to make a simple prototype so that was it for the month of March 2019 I hope you found the videos helpful and learned something along the way if you have any questions regarding any of the videos feel free to post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
