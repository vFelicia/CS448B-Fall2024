hello and welcome i'm your code monkey spring is here and with that comes tons of spring sales if you need anything for the game you're currently working on then check these out right now you have the unity asset source spring sale with 500 of the bestselling assets at up to 80 off then you have the cinti style all of their gorgeous packs at fifty percent off and some at seventy percent off and finally you also have two humble bundles one with tons of sprites and tools and another one with tons of icons the links are affiliate links so if you pick up anything you get some awesome asses for your games and i get a nice commission so here's some quick highlights from all of those sales but before that just a quick mention last week i made a really nice xcomlike prototype and in that video i announced that the reason why i made that prototype is because i'm working on making a full stepbystep course making that game so if you're interested in learning how to make a turnbased strategy game like xcom or final fantasy tactics then check out the link in the description to sign up and i'll let you know when the course is out okay so first up on the unity assessor the main feature on this sale are the flash deals they start off at eighty percent off and then the discount goes lower as more people pick it up the eighty percent off only has a couple hundred copies but the seventy percent off has quite a lot of them as you can see a bunch of the 70 off with thousands left and importantly you can browse all of the upcoming ones so for example as i'm recording this i can see that the painting 3d is going to be 80 off in three and a half hours so if any of these look interesting you know exactly when you need to be here in order to click on the buy now button some of the assets that i can definitely recommend are the ones that i covered in my asset review series all of them are on sale except for the curved worlds so you can go ahead and watch these videos to get an idea for what the assets do and learn how easy they are to use before you actually pick them up you have the astar pathfinding project i highly recommend this one if you need some insanely fast pathfinding or really just more options in the builtin nav mesh it's what i've used in my steam games for example in hyper nights i had at most around 800 units in a single map and the pathfinder itself was still taking just something like 2 milliseconds so it's extremely performant then you have the odin inspector this one is an excellent tool for making tools if you take the time to learn and use it correctly it can greatly improve your productivity then the allinone sprite shader this one is a really awesome tool for easily adding tons of effects it's primarily meant for sprites but even if you have a 3d game you can use it to polish up your ui as i'm recording the video the only one sprite shader is still at 70 off with a thousand copies left up next rayfire this one is a truly impressive destruction system adding this one to your game will definitely make it stand out and it's also insanely performant then there's the quantum console i really loved working with this one it lets you easily add a console to your games and define any commands to do anything you want it's extremely useful while developing your game for easily testing so there's no need for writing some code for some special input for debugging you just add some proper commands to the console really easily and finally there's feel basically polish is one of the most important parts about game development polish is what separates good games from great games so this asset is a collection of tools to easily add tons of polish to your game to make it really satisfying so all of these are discount and i can highly recommend them and again remember that the deeper discounts are over here on the flash sales but despite their name the flash sales don't really end in the flash you've got quite a lot of time quite a lot of thousands of copies to get them at at least at 70 off and of course up here all of the nonflash deals are still awesome they're at half price so the ones that i covered in my review series rayfire feel and a star pathfinding project all these at 50 off this sale has all of the bestselling assets so pretty much everything included here is excellent you've got gaia pro if you want to make some really complex environments final ik if you want some really complex dynamic animations easy save this one has tons and tons of features for adding any kind of save system then here's a really gorgeous animated style stylized shader and you've got a twoone for handling behavior trees and tons more okay so that's the unity astasaur spring sale the next sale happening right now is on the cinti store this one is the official store for cinti studios as you know i'm a huge fan of their style i love their low quality assets on this channel you also have everything at 50 off and then each week there's a bonus at 70 off their packs are all awesome you've got massive packs with literally thousands of assets and some smaller ones for a pretty cheap price the bonus asset for this week is the polygon fantasy kingdom pack at 70 off this is one of the massive ones there's over 2000 detailed prefabs basically if your game has a medieval theme then this one has all the assets you could possibly need over here are the key features so as you can see you've got tons of characters you got a whole bunch of character attachments then tons of various vehicles some modular castles and houses so you can easily build them as you want you got a bunch of precepts that are optimized to be super performant tons of environments props and lots more things so if you're interested in this one definitely get it quickly the 70 off bonus discount ends next monday then the next bonus next week is the kids pack this one is definitely a very unique pack lots of kids lots of characters and in the final week you have the western frontier if your game has convoys and indians perhaps if you're building something inspired by red dead redemption then this one looks like a great pack so those are the special ones but all of their other packs are at half price like i said you have some massive packs with literally thousands of assets and some other smaller ones that are preachy so over here the cipher worlds and apocalypse pack these are some of their biggest ones the sapphire world's pack has a giant amount of acids just looking at the video you can see about five or six different biomes if you're looking for something sort of in the vein of cough deer or battlefield then this military pack looks excellent then if you just need characters you have the fantasy characters pack this one features a massive amount of modular character parts one request that i've received quite a bit is asking for a tutorial on character customization i'm planning on covering that and i'll probably use this pack to demonstrate it with 700 modular pieces you can build a near infinite amount of characters then if you need some low poly particle effects this pack has tons of them all of them look really nice low poly and for a pretty cheap price then down here the icons also looks pretty interesting the war pack if you need something world war one or world war ii if you're working on a zombie game you've got over here a bunch of regular city zombies and then over here some special emboss zombies so if you combine both them you have great variety for your zombie game then the battleground pack i've used this one in terms of my videos it's also pretty cheap especially for the amount of assets that it contains and then you've got tons more you've got pirates office city you've got a bunch of horror night club you've got a heist explorer fantasy characters a really interesting prototype pack really cheap a bunch of mini characters and so on so these last two are on a different style and finally if you want an even more different sound then down here is the simple series these are only much more blocky styles so even more low poly than the polygon series and all of these are preachy pretty small packs but look really nice so if you're working on a hyper casual game or just something from a very far away camera then all of these packs can look really nice alright so that's the scentsy store again i'm recording this in the middle of the week so if you're interested in the fantasy kingdom pack definitely get it quickly while it's at 70 off and finally we have a bunch of bundles over here on humboldt bundle some of these are game that related others are just software as usual these have an insane discount over 95 off this one is about app kit studio i'm not familiar with this one then you've got some video bundle also i'm not sure about this one then if you want to make some music or sound effects for your games then this one can be great after that is this one which might actually be over by the time you watch this video it's a bunch of 2d rpg assets and tools then over here the gamedev toolbox this one has quite a lot of tools i'm also not familiar with these ones but they'll look like they could be useful especially if you're working on a 2d game and beyond that you've got tons of asset packs all of these look excellent if you're going for that old school rpg look and also contains a bunch of audio sound effects music and so on then there's a filmmaker's vfx bundle so maybe this one could be interesting if you need something special for your game trailer and finally down here is a massive icon bundle these kinds of massive icon bundles happen every once in a while i picked one up quite a long ago it's pretty useful to have a massive library of icons this one is pretty cheap you can get it for just 20 bucks and with that you get over 7 000 icons so if you don't have any pack like this one then i would highly recommend you get it it's always nice to add a bit of polish to your pro taps or game jam games as you can see you've got tons of variety so you got a bunch of bags boxes a bunch of scrolls magic lots of weapon and armor some resources potions bunch of fishing hunting forest lots more armor barbarians spell books and so on so as you can see tons and tons of stuff so out of all the humble bundles this one is probably the best one with the most use cases if you don't have any icon pack like this one then i would highly recommend you get it it's pretty cheap and it'll help you on tons of games alright so those are all the sales happening right now basically there's no reason for your projects to be using programmer art like i use in my own projects for so long just using some proper assets will really help all of your games look much more professional regardless of the genre or theme of your game i'm sure you'll find something perfect just for you so check out all of these sales linked in the
