hello and welcome I'm your code monkey So lately there's been a very strange conversation blowing up supposedly a ton of devs are angry because an excellent game came out and gamers are calling them out for being lazy and not making good games on purpose although this whole thing makes me feel like I'm crazy because I don't see anything like that I haven't seen any anger or Penny coming from any devs the only thing I saw from devs when the game came out was people just congratulating them on their success and making an excellent game now maybe that's just me that's just specifically my fiend I'm a solo Indie Dev I'm not part of the AAA industry my Twitter feed is mainly just Unity Indie devs so maybe I'm just sucking my own bubble or maybe this whole thing is really just manufacturers to get a bunch of clicks it all started on this IGN video titled bondage Gate 3 is causing some developers to panic then this blew up and tons of other comments and commentary videos made it sound like there's a large amount of developers that are supposedly angry because layering Studios they just raised the bar by so much which makes other devs look bad now I've done some research to try to find out if this is indeed correct but I could not find much I went on Twitter and I tried searching for bunders Gate 3 devs and there's all kinds of really strange comments kind of disappointing to see AAA devs complain about bonus K3 game devs being angry about bombers E3 is so funny there are game devs who are mad at Bonsai 3 because it's too good originally had no interest involved with j3 but devs panicking that they must do their jobs properly because of it has been tempting me to buy the game some lots of comments on apparently people I'm talking about all kinds of panicky and angry game devs but I really can't find any of those supposed game devs so this whole thing generally makes me feel like I'm taking crazy pills or maybe my Twitter feed is just broken in some way if there are indeed all of these developers supposedly angry or jealous about the game why can't I just find them the closest thing to a negative comment that I can actually find is something like this just some devs who are basically worried that when it came on this massive scale when this finds such success it leads to management pushing for bigger and bigger scale bigger and bigger games which in turn can lead to more and more crunch which is already a big problem in the industry then some more tweets simply pointing out how the game is both awesome and massive again just pointing out the scale and the excellent talent that this team has all this is positive no one is arguing for Worse games just pointing out how some factors that made this game cannot be easily replicated that's really it I really don't see any angry or panicky devs basically after researching all this it seems like this IGN video and this whole controversy just seems to mean like one of those manufactured outrages where you just take a comment from a single person and just twist it in a negative way and just boil it out of proportion the whole thing seems to be based off just a single tweet from a single Dev and not really something related to the entire Game Dev Community not to mention that this tweet isn't even really negative in fact it's actually quite the opposite it's pointing out all of the excellent things that layering Studios did very well that came to this excellent game it also simply also points out the various advantages that they had in making this great game advantages that not necessarily every Studio has access to like in terms of talent and resources which is definitely absolutely true now don't get me wrong the big Studios from Activision and EA they definitely do have enough money but even if you're willing to spend an unlimited amount of time and money on a game there is no guarantee of success or quality basically the controversy seems to be people saying that devs aren't lazy and that is why all games are not as awesome as Ballers gate 3. now here on this channel where the audience is mainly in the devs I always highly advise against spending years and years working on a game sure you could technically spend years end up making a masterpiece like Sardi Valley and sell millions of copies of an excellent game that's technically possible but that is an outlier by definition you should definitely not expect your game to be an outlier you should not risk your own livelihood you should not risk going homeless with the expectation that your game won't be one of the best games ever made maybe it won't be but it probably won't that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try your best you definitely should try your best but despite your best efforts you will likely not make the next Starry Valley the way I see the argument in this tweet is exactly the same thing it is not saying that devs shouldn't aim to make excellent games like bottles of A3 it just means that this game is an outlier both in terms of resources and in terms of success all the other reference Suites of them just say the exact same thing no one is arguing for Worse games they're just pointing out that an outlier is by definition an outlier I believe what he was also trying to say was simply don't expect this insane level of scale and polish coming from every single RPG especially the ones made by indie devs or small to mediumsized teams which definitely do not have 400 people and tens of millions of dollars to spend on making one game over seven years personally as he saw Indie Dev I've been on receiving end of some players with some very harsh demands I've received comments on my three dollar games asking why the game is dead and hasn't received updates despite being several years old also I'm currently working on my upcoming automation game I'm trying my absolute best but I'm pretty certain that my game will not be as good or as successful as some like Factory and if a player were to ask me okay so why should I play your game and not factorium my answer to that is you shouldn't you should go play factorio that game is a masterpiece but I'm guessing you're not going to play just one single game for your internal life so after you're done with factorial maybe give my game a try not every game needs to be a masterpiece there's tons of space in the industry for different games with different scales and different levels of quality the masterpieces should absolutely be celebrating but they are by definition the outliers and this week is pointing out that even for big studios that do have the resources spending that time and money is no guarantee of quality that's really it trying to replicate that process can lead to either the same success or it can kill entire groups of Studios one example is the conclusive protocol that one came out last year they spent a ton of time in money making that game they also had a very experienced very talented team they called it a quantity game but despite all those resources and devs that were definitely very passionate about making the best game possible the director was even the director of the original Dead Space so very talented and tons of funds but despite their best efforts and resources the game did not end up as good as unlike to the point where sadly recently they actually had to do some layoffs that's exactly the point that this tweet is making I really don't see how this tweet can be read as Dev arguing for Worse games or Envy of a successful game or something like that on tweet he literally says I'm deeply excited about what the lovely phones that larion accomplished with bunders gate 3. it is simply pointing out that an outlier is by definition outlier all the other related tweets those are all in agreement that the game is excellent I certainly cannot find a ton of other devs somehow panicking because an excellent game came out maybe there are indeed a ton of devs who for some reason want to make terrible games and this excellent game won't force them to do better and somehow they're angry at that maybe that's the case even though every single Dev that I know they love what they do and they're trying to make the best games possible or maybe given how the video is based off a single tweet and it's intentionally twisting that tweet into a negative light move this whole thing is really not based on reality at all it's all just about getting clicks which has certainly been very successful this IGN video has over 1 million views whereas most of their regular videos they just get 20 to 50K views so if they're going with some manufactured outrage in order to get some clicks then congrats because this strategy was clearly very successful but based on my research it does not seem to be based on reality at all really the only reaction that I can find from devs are people celebrating the fact that an excellent game came out and found massive success that's just objectively good for anyone working in the industry or anyone who loves playing games now do let me know your thoughts in the comments am I somehow some way completely missing a huge loss of devs who are somehow angry at this game I really don't see it but again Twitter is different from everyone and the search does seem to suck quite a bit so I could be missing something definitely do let me know if I'm wrong
