e e e e e e all right hey everyone thanks all for being here on this really nice live stream this should be really interesting oh I just noticed there's a little bit of a actually just a just a second just a just a second okay so hey everyone okay so hey everyone oh I'm still hearing double yeah just some technical things so yeah trying to do this for the uh all right so hello once again uh okay so I think there's no more Echo all right so that should be nice that should be this is obviously a very different format so so yeah uh let's hope that everything goes well correctly okay so yeah so anyways I'm uh here with Chris this is the third video with Chris so we're going to uh be learning all about marketing so how to find success with our games how to get more wish list more sales and all of that uh so yeah I'm guessing all of you I have seen the previous two videos that I already did with Chris so one of them was on the uh kind of like a rough high level overview on how to do marketing on Steam and second one on analyzing various steam pages and what to do what steam pages are doing right what they're doing wrong and what you can improve in order to basically increase your odds of getting more and more wish list to find success uh but yeah just in case you haven't seen it so Chris uh go ahead and give yourself a quick intro on who you are and what you do hey thanks Code Monkey for having me on for so many times we've just been hanging out this been like the Code Monkey week me and Hugo just hanging out uh so I write a blog uh called how tomarket agame.com I do some talks um and yeah so what I do is uh I take a very um kind of scientific almost like Curious look at the market how Steam Works um I don't I don't know anything so I just kind of look at the data to kind of figure out like well what is actually working I interview users people who have Steam games on I interview uh people who shop on Steam so I'm really just trying to figure out like how steam actually works and I publish all my findings on how to Market a game.com so uh I also put together some courses that teach everything I know so I write a weekly blog which you can get at how Market a game.com free uh for that Weekly blog but then it's a lot of content like every week for I don't know I think I've been doing this four or five years it's so much and there's so many things that are like just half thoughts and not full thoughts so I compile them into a course and uh part of the reason I'm talking to Hugo so much this week is they're on sale uh so I put all my courses on sale this uh these this coming two weeks it ends this um this uh it ends on the 30th well basically the 30th is the last day June July 1st is the uh last day of the sale end of the sale so um head over to Hugo's website um I think he's going to post a link down below um but if you uh uh check out any of these courses end up buying one um Hugo gets uh you know Hugo and I are sharing some of the profits just because Hugo's uh great guy he's uh he's kind of like every time he go mentions me I get so many people who subscribe they're like oh Hugo mentioned you and I'm like that Hugo is a really good guy like everybody loves Hugo so uh that's why I'm like hey let's partner up together you've sent so much traffic to my way let's see if we can um kind of help each other out so that's where we are and um I'm here to answer your questions about steam marketing I know it's confusing I know that none this stuff makes sense some things that should make sense the opposite is actually true so that's why I'm here to answer any questions you might have about the courses about how to Market a game on Steam um I don't know any other advice need I might be able to answer gardening tips whatever I'm here for you all yeah that sounds that sounds really good and actually one thing that I wanted to start with is something that I actually didn't cover in the those two videos which I think is actually really awesome it's a page that you have on your website like I said your blog is really awesome like I actually checked my my email list to see when did I start reading your blog and it was like February of 2018 so I've been reading it for like six years so yeah that is that's when can't doing it that long dang yeah it's been quite a while and I've definitely learn a lot from it uh yeah and one of the main pages that I really like is your page about the uh let me just switch the thing it's your page about the benchmarks where you have all kinds of benchmarks and that it shows like how many wish lists you should have like what is organic visibility like the number of wish list how do they convert and so on so can you just go through that page because I think that one is really awesome like it has some really uh excellent information so can you go through that and speak about some takeaways for people absolutely so here's the thing is you can kind of get comparison itis you know um you might hear some game that made a million dollars and you're like God I am nowhere near making a million dollars and so makes people feel bad you know it's like God I'm trying my best here and I'm just not doing the numbers and I I felt the same way I was like well what is normal people always ask me like is this good is this normal I just launched my steam page I got this manyi wish list is that normal so what I did was I started this page um if you go to how Market a game.com benchmarks I do surveys all the time frequently you know like hey how many wish lists did you get or uh you know I just did one just now for the steam Festival steam nextfest the one we just had in June and 40 people responded because I have a big community and I'm very I trust your data so much I don't share anything that you don't want me to share and so I've kind of built this reputation where people can share their data with me and so I've done surveys over years and um I compiled all the different reports in this one site called how Market a game.com Benchmark so I go through kind of the the timeline of when you launch your game so you know when you launch your steam page what is typical wish list numbers and what I do is I base it off of Revenue so I assign um different metals because sometimes and here's the thing um it's okay if you're just a solo Dev making a game and you release it in six months or something your expected revenue is much lower than a uh studio with like1 people AAA Graphics been building for three years you have very different expectations of what's worth your time and so I try not to judge and say this is good or bad I I i' put gold medal silver diamond again I tried to make it as non accusatory as possible because again we're all on a different Journey here and so what I do is I base it off of Revenue um so all these things you might see like oh this is the typical tier so every report that you'll see I Break It Down based off of what's gold silver you know all the all all the range of the metals there so what's organic visibility like if you don't do any marketing steam promotes your game day and day out sometimes it comes from YouTube all these different things so I did a survey of like hey if you got covered by a big streamer don't talk focus on that time pick a week where nothing big was happening just a resting rate it's called a resting wish list rate or organic visibility and I just wanted to find out like what's typical so we did that um we did uh what's this one uh wish list uh deletes like are so paranoid they're like oh my God so many people deleted my thing what's normal so I looked at how many deletes are normal for a typical week um you know what's a a good median playtime because I one of my theories is that the most underreported most under observed um stat that Indies aren't looking at is how long your demo is being played because you can learn a lot about how interesting your game is and so I did a big survey about how long games typically play spoiler alert if your game is 20 25 minutes median not average everybody says what about the average doesn't matter it's the median play time if it's 25 minutes or greater that's a good sign that means your game is engaging um higher up the big top sellers typically have an hour two hour median play time for a demo so uh that's kind of the stats there uh Game launch what how many wish lists do you need for launch and then uh what's an expected conversion rate within a short period of time you know within like first month and some of this data I didn't do it was uh from I link out to other sources like game discover Co I'll link off to their blog because they Simon Carlos has done this research so it's like if he's done it I'm not GNA do it again um and then reviews like um uh how how many sales per reviews typical stuff that so I try and cover at every stage you're at in your marketing and your game development kind of like just benchmarks like oh am I good or not and the way to use this is not to make you feel bad it's kind of I'll be honest not every game's gonna sell well it just that's just the way the world is but I want you to understand this stuff so if you're like man I am everything I try I am on the lower end the lower tier I just want you to have that expectation so that when it's time for you to launch you're not like oh this is gonna be a big seller this's gonna be a big seller and then it kind of doesn't do so well I I just want you to have that expectation the other reason I do this is sometimes it's like people like well I'm gonna delay my game a year and polish it up some more I you know if your numbers aren't good I'd say ship the game start your next one you know I kind of do that just so that it's like I I don't think it's ever wise to delay and spend more time on a game that's just not connecting like if if you're trying all these stats and you look at all these and and your game keeps hitting the kind of lowest tier there's just something that's just not connecting with people and that's fine but just don't spend more time on this keep hoping that you're going to get to those higher te I just typically don't see that happening so with that uh any questions Hugo or anybody from the chat yeah right away on there I would say yeah what you were saying about the the goals yeah it's definitely uh uh like you don't have to get to uh the diamond level in order to find success like it all depends on what's your cost are like for example in my case I'm a solo in developer so for me even the bronze tier or the silver tier is more than enough for me to make a living whereas if I was like a triple indie game with like 30 people working on it then yeah you definitely need the diamond so yeah it's something that I've mentioned many times on my channel which is how basically how the definition of success that's really up to you to Define so some people in success selling a million copies a th000 copies 10,000 copies and some people just publishing something is Success so yeah I would definitely say always always keep that in mind because yeah basically it's up to you to Define what exactly is your goal and what exactly is the definition of success so yeah I mean one thing just to add on to that I hate Reddit for this one fact that like when you look on the Reddit rgame Dev they always talk about my game failed it failed they always use that failed and they always make it all cast with an exclamation point at the end I hate that word because it's like all right so what it's uh you're not failed you You released a that's really hard a lot of what it is is just like hey it's a stepping stone it's like hey this game didn't underperformed my next one might do better it's not a failure it's just like there's a ladder to success and sometimes even if it didn't sell a lot it might be enough based on the amount of time and effort you invested in it so I try never to say failed that's why I like hey everybody gets a medal it's okay yeah I agree and actually uh here's a related question so uh an interesting question by twitz uh I'm finished ing a threemonth little project do I still need to have 7,000 wish lists even though my game is really small am I doomed to fail her if I don't have that 7,000 and for that yeah I would say very much the the same thing which is how like your first projects like a quick project the goal can be just to learn so if you learn it doesn't really matter if you get 7,000 wish list if you find financial success and so on if you just learn quite a lot from it that can in itself be a I would I would call it a success so yeah would you agree with that uh Chris absolutely I mean like one of the things I teach is it's it's a long journey and your first couple games just don't do well that's just natural I don't understand why people expect your first game to do well nobody knows who you are nobody's ever played anything and and just to back this up so this is one of the Articles from the benchmarks page and I looked at when you launch your steam page how many wish lists do you get you know like a two weeks after you push the launch button what's typical wish list to earn that period And what I found was and I grafted here each bar represents a different game the games that had the highest um Spike you know at the beginning those first two weeks are games every bar that is red is a game that had a second like this is a developer second or third or game in other words like this wasn't their first so if there was a previous game I tagged it as a red bar you'll notice that most of the games that get these huge launches of their steam page had previous games and here's the thing is you're you're you're building a little stepping stone for your game so even if this game doesn't do well there are still going to be people who buy it and play it and look at your steam page so you're not starting at zero so when you do your second game all that traffic to your first game will go to your second game and you're just like kind of rolling that snowball bigger and bigger now you you sometimes if you change genre too much it doesn't convert as well if you stick to the same genre of game it it converts better but overall there's it is okay to start small and then your next one gets bigger and bigger and bigger so don't I I like your attitude quick project moving on next one great attitude this is the right attitude to have everybody everybody should have the same attitude yeah I would agree I mean that is definitely one of the things that I've heard you say many times and I fully agree which is how Indies don't make enough games like so many Indies they just make one game and they quit and yeah I mean I think you find so much value by making more and more games like every game you do you're going to learn quite a lot so the next one is likely going to be better and yeah I do think that people possibly underestimate the power of experience they just expect the first game to be a super hit and don't really don't really pay attention to the fact fact that okay your first one might be slightly weak but then your second one is going to be better and like your fifth or sixth one those are going to be really good so yeah I'm a huge fan of making multiple games per Studio I do think that is a really great thing yeah and yeah so here's another uh really interesting question uh oh so this one um uh yeah it's a interesting question about basally the price of the game versus wish list so what is the optimal wish list value for a game under five category so basically do games that are cheaper is that uh a factor in how many wish lists you need like if you need a AAA game like uh you mentioned on the video on how uh for new and training I think you mentioned who was getting $8,000 in gross revenue so technically that would mean that you don't need as many wish lists if your game is more on the expensive side and on the other hand if your game is cheaper you would need more wish lists have you seen any data on that like does price relate to wish list in any way I have haven't um done a specific price to wish just because there's so many factors um Let me let me I'm pulling up a blog post that I did a while ago and I just looked at average price per game and you're kind of right about the price in the wish list so here here's the deal the steam algorithm once you put your game on sale you release your game does not care about wish lists they don't care about wish list conversion they don't care about wishlist you know amount what they care about is dollars earned that's it they don't care how you get there you could if you had one game one copy of your game cost a million dollars like if you if if one person bought it and they spent a million dollars on your game that would look the same in the eyes of the algorithm as a game that was priced a$1 and sold a million copies those those two games would look exactly the same in the eyes of the steam algorithm that's how you have to think about it now those are two very extreme examples but that's what you have to consider and so a lot of genres can price their game higher like forx deep deep strategy games can price their games much higher they can be like 30 or $40 okay it's much harder if you price your game under five doll to sell enough copies at a high enough price and um so with that going in yes um that is why a lot of games um that are top sellers cost more because it's just it's easier to raise the price than it is to find another thousand people to buy your game um and so when I looked at the data um of it's It's a complicated I just read the whole blog post let me see if I can find it um a nice easy way this graph's really tiny I understand but basically what I found was Indies are not raising their price enough okay so AAA games way back like uh 10 years ago most PC um AAA Studios were like ah just dump your game on Steam they they would discount it so low the price was so low and then steam then uh trip blade was like oh you know what uh we can charge more for these games and people will still buy them so they've raised their prices if I I looked every year with the median prices for different games each year tripa raises their price all the time higher and higher prices but Indies are stuck at this low price of like they've even dropped the price they've even over time despite inflation they've still lowered the price of the average indie game so my thought is you should always be trying to increase the price just a little bit based on the previous year so look at all the games that I've released recently that are similar to yours and add 10 to 20% because we should be we as an indie Community should be pushing our prices higher um the top Indie studios are raising their prices but new Indies are their price is very low and this is looking across all the games that have released each year so um just search my blog for price it's it's kind of a complicated blog post but search for price and I I I go into all that so in general raise your price in these bounce yeah price is definitely an interesting point and I guess related to that related to triaa games so here's a question on basically uh when a very large game gets uh revealed gets released or they're going to put out some DLC and something basically when there's a big triaa game release does that affect Indies in any way like should you as an new developer basically try to dodge your release date based on different uh triple League games that might be coming out around that time or does it really not matter no I don't I think this is a game that Indies like to play but it's it's not smart um I'm looking up a blog post um about this so um Indies love to pretend and I think they get this from movies you know um movies like big theater releases if you read those trades those uh you know the news about them they're always like oh we we shifted the date of the release of our movie because we didn't want to conflict with this other movie but these are like Titans fighting okay they're fighting and so I think a lot of Indies and a lot of PR companies if you hire a PR Company they're going to do this too so a lot of Indies and PR companies will do this thing where they're like oh well this game's releasing so we should shift your game we are tiny little bacterium on the back of a Colossus we do not matter they do not affect us um and one of the best things that I've seen is um let me see if I can find it so Starfield launched okay big Starfield launched one of the biggest launches of the year and this little game called chill quum was like we're just going to launch a day after Starfield all right and so what happens is and this is what Indies don't understand is um these these ranking charts are your best visibility steam itself is the best visibility not the Press not streamers steam itself okay and so these widgets like this one popular upcoming is that the one yeah this is popular upcoming um they only pick the top 10 games that are releasing soon now if you are releasing during a triaa launch like chill aquarium was doing small indie game launched with just over 5,000 wish lists here's uh Starfield every other Indie every other game doesn't know what we know which is it doesn't matter if Triple A so all the other Indies were like oh starfields launching let's move our date oh so scared of Starfield and they moved their dates so all these games left the launch window chill quam's like I don't care I'm strong I'm brave I know that it doesn't matter I'm smart about that and so the only two games on popular up coming that week were chil aquarium and Starfield there was a lot of room there's 10 slots so because everybody was so scared and moved out of the chil quarium zone or out of the Starfield Zone uh chil quarium had like front page featuring for a lot longer than if they had picked another week so don't play the game where you're like well this Triple A Game's launching you do not have to worry about that and people don't understand here's the big thing that people don't understand is that even a big AA launch is a tiny drop in the world of steam there are so many people playing games on Steam you don't even conceive of how big this game these games are the you know games in general let me show you I looked and I saw like well how many people were actually playing Starfield right Starfield supposedly the biggest game on Steam in the world right I did the the analysis I looked at what was the peak Starfield play time what how many people are playing Starfield at the peak look at this it's this little tiny blue bar the red this big red circle is everything else on Steam people playing every other type of game only three. 4% of people were playing Starfield and this is supposedly the biggest game that's going to ruin everything for everybody else it doesn't matter it just doesn't matter we are so tiny and steam is so big you cannot like take over steam with a single AAA launch so don't worry about what's launching just do not worry about it at our scale it doesn't matter yeah the the size of steam is definitely something that people seem to forget just how huge steam is I mean I think steam has like 140 million monthly active users so that's an insane amount of people and yeah even if a AAA game comes out and it's a mega hit and sells like I don't know 5 million copies I'm pretty sure that's a mega hit on Steam even so that's 5 million out of 140 million so that's a ton of people who might be playing some other games so yeah it is quite a quite a massive amount it is Tiny how much those AAA games impact steam tiny so don't even worry about it yeah you we are too small to matter okay so here's an interesting question like on the on the video you talked about uh how the announcement is a really important thing it's like your golden ticket and you're basically going around trying to cash in that ticket and how you mentioned how you should basically announce the game with a announcement trailer so here's developer who apparently they're already starting off quite well so with posts on Reddit and Tik Tok getting 15K views and a bunch of members on Discord and now they're planning a kickstar and and in terms of doing some marketing for their first trailer should they uh make a highquality cinematic trailer to launch a campaign or showing gameplay like out of those two which one would you think is best for making basically the announcement trailer gameplay versus cinematic oh um so just to clarify and I'll say make a baby answer while I'm talking this is the first time anybody has ever heard of your game first first I mean they mentioned how the post is already doing well on Reddit and Tik Tok so I think it's already announced I don't know if that's what I don't know it sounds like you've already announced with a trailer I that I don't understand I I think they're talking about the trailer for the kickstarter so I think that is roughly but just in general do you recommend like uh cinematic trailers for Indie devs because I got to say that me personally I'm not a a fan of cinematic trailers I want to see gameplay but I don't know if that is how most uh shoers on seem feel so I don't know yeah here here's here's in general my thought on cinematic trailers I don't like I think they're too expensive they don't people don't like them on Steam they're not great okay so and especially I don't know Kickstarter also preferes I'm not a Kickstarter I I've never studied um I haven't studied kickstar I don't know it in general though my theory on on kickstarters people are suspicious because they've been burned by all these games that go nowhere like they're vaporware and so if you come out with a very strong cinematic trailer that doesn't show gameplay people are like oh they just are really good in making cinematics we want to see gameplay to prove that these are real developers who can really make the game so that's why I don't like cinematic trailers I also don't like cinematic trailers on your steam page because people are like what's the gameplay what's the gameplay because a cinematic trailer could be any genre and what steam players want and gamers in general is they want to know the genre they have genres that they like and they have genres that they don't like and so they're trying to determine is this a game that I like they don't care if there's the seven keys oftler and the king of the land of rega who's the son of sim they don't care about that until they know the genre then when they know the genre they're like now tell me about the seven keys of AMT I want to find out about the seven keys so I find Indies get a little too lore heavy a little too cinematic heavy and people like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah give it to me and if you get an animated trailer or a cinematic trailer it those cost a lot I mean especially if you have to hire somebody else out so I don't like cinematic trailers the one exception for a cinematic trailer that I think worth it is if you get into these shows like summer games Fest by Jeff Keeley or the PC Gamer show those the cinematic trailer might work because that audience is captive they are watching the show and they're like I want to find out new games so they are sitting there they can't fast forward because those shows are typically live broadcast so they're sitting and they're their their attention is locked in that's the one time I say a cinematic trailer is good every other time I say gameplay gameplay gameplay especially within the first 5 Seconds you just straight to gameplay no in a world of the Zs with the seven keys of M2 none of that text business get rid of that stuff also your logo get rid of that stuff nobody cares about the logo BL so right to gameplay put it up front that's my that's my big argument yeah that sounds good and the developer answered on chat so apparently their goal is to do 15sec cinematic and then cut to gameplay which I guess maybe that could be could be no you don't think that's even that good oh swap G oh okay interesting swap it and then slice that 15 seconds into five seconds gamep play five seconds gameplay 5 Seconds G five seconds that could be one way but really people don't people don't like cinematics they really don't okay yeah I gotta say I mean I'm very much the same way every time I go on a scam page and I see cinematics I get really annoyed like skip skip skip trying to find some gameplay so yeah I guess I'm happy to see that I'm not Alan in that uh no I and part of the reason is I studied Shoppers on Steam like I just followed regular ass Gamers on Steam and I was like Hey show me how you shop on Steam and they did that they were like Skip Skip Skip Skip and they skipped through the cinematic trailers that I could tell were so expensive so you're spending thousands of dollars potentially depending if you're doing it yourself or hiring somebody in time you're spending all this time and money on something people are just like ah get out of here get get get so I don't know if you want to do it you can but people are just going to skip over that stuff yeah and uh here's here's a really interesting question from Jason story which actually uh yeah he says how back in the day the advice was them was were bad they killed sales and for me I definitely do uh remember that like I remember back when I like when I started doing uh trying to make games and learning about marketing back in like 2012 2013 back then the advice was indeed demos are bad because there's basically no upset like people play the game and either they get satisfied and they don't play the game or they get unsatisfied and they don't buy it anyway so either way it was always negatives but ever since steam started doing next Fest all of a sudden demos became really popular really useful so yeah do you know when that happened and why that happened was it just steam or was the combination of steam and the influencers doing all kinds of things and bringing more visibility because I'm pretty sure like you said uh demos are extremely important nowadays right it is and here's the main reason um there's two reasons the steam algorithm and streamers um and the fact that we are small Indies before that demo debate that was about AAA games with all the money in the world all the marketing budget everything in the world we are are that so I guess that's a third thing the rise of Indies we we are playing a different game than Triple A and again this is the cinematic trailer debate because a lot of people see Triple A does cinematic trailers that means I got to do a cinematic trailer don't follow the Triple A whatever Triple A is doing I kind of like oh should we do that they are playing a completely different game than we are okay we are playing a game we are unknown 100% unknown we have no money we have no attention we have nothing so we have to play a different game in one of the ways we do that is with these demos and what a demo does is it opens your game up to be played by streamers because um in in in in general this is pre I'm talking prelaunch so your game is not available for sale you're just trying to get attention nice and early okay so at that point streamers can't play screenshots they just don't I mean there's sometimes on Tik Tok there's streamers who will watch a trailer and kind of do some commentary on it a little bit but for the most part a a influencer a streamer a YouTuber whoever needs a game to play and so there's this clever hack where you can give a demo early and then the streamer will play it and they that's something for them to do way before your launch of your game goes on sale so it's like you can get streamer coverage way early that's the hack that we Indies can do now the other thing that's awesome about this is see the YouTube or the stream uh the steam algorithm goes off attention so if you bring a ton of attention to your game in a short period of time the steam algorithm wakes up and it starts doing stuff like putting you in the discovery que putting you in more like this which is this widget at the bottom they start peppering your game in other widgets in the algorithm because of all that wish list attention that was driven to your page and so you know you get this these just what Hugo was saying like well if they play my demo and they don't like it will they buy it will they not will they hate it all that stuff it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter the people who play the demo and wishlist it all that is triggering the algorithm so people will start seeing your game on Steam and they've never watched that streamer play it they've never played the demo all of a sudden it's just like hey this game keeps popping up on my stream this on my screen this must be good it is that second order it is the um the fact that the steam algorithm says oh this is good and they boost it further than even a streamer can get it that is the reason we do the demo because the streamer plays it and then the steam algorithm takes over and that is the specific thing that's different and it's not just a theory I only got to this because we've watch Real Results so this is a game called doe keeper and they did a very traditional Twitter and Reddit Twitter and Reddit Twitter and Reddit and did nothing and then they released the demo and streamers found it and they thought it was awesome and then the steam algorithm took over and you could see the moment they launched the demo it's right here I don't even need to point at it I'm like when do you think they launched the demo it's right here you can just see the inflection point and the Reon is streamers loved that game so much um they got four this is one month after they launched their demo 40,000 wish lists from various spikes from streamers each one of these spikes is a streamer so that's why I think demos are so important is because it allow it unlocks streamers and festivals which are the two biggest boosts to cover to getting your game scen so that's why very related to that is a great topic that I don't think we covered on the original video which is is how like a lot of people talk about about wishless like wishless in total but you've mentioned several times wishless velocity so can you explain exactly why that is because it seems to be extremely powerful with regards to the CM algorithm yeah yeah so there's not there's no like metric of like oh wishless velocity um in general here's the thing forget about wishless forget about everything people need to be excited about your game that's the big thing like if I show this game and say Here's this cool game uh here's a game do you like it if your game is exciting and interesting people like yes that sounds so good I want to buy it and then if people like hey look at this game and people like oh yeah yeah that looks kind of similar yeah I think I played do you want to play it nah no I'm okay I got this other game to play that difference there is just excitement like how excited are people for a game and there's no like metric for like excitement um but what I found in enough data is games that sell well have a ton of wish lists and they convert very well so they have hundreds of thousands of wish lists and they convert those wish lists at a higher percentage games that don't sell well typically never got many wish lists and the conversion rate of those wish lists is even lower so you see how it's like you're four times because it's on two different metrics the the the better selling games work better and the difference is excitement so when people see that game they go that sounds so exciting I want to wish l at and when it goes on sale I want to buy it that's excitement okay they're really excited about that stuff and so when we talk about wish list velocity we can see it all the time like I have in my Discord we have a channel where people participate in a festival and two games are in the same festival and get about the same exposure like they're located in the same widget they'll have different wish list rates in other words we'll say like hey at the end of the festival I got a thousand wish list and then other gamees like at the end of the festival I got 10,000 wish lists you can just tell some games are just more interesting to people I don't know why some games are more interesting they just are and that's what I mean by wishless velocity so you could come to me and say Chris I have 100,000 wish lists and I'm like how long's your steam page been around and you're like oh yeah I've been marketing this game for 10 years I have 100,000 wish lists and so you do the quick math you're like okay 100,000 wish list over 10 years that means 10,000 per year you're like well that's that's pretty good but if you're like Chris I have 100,000 wishes I was like since when you're like well I launched my steam page last week I'm like that's amazing you got 100,000 wish lists in one week I've never seen that before that's amazing that must mean your game is so exciting that people are like telling their friends the Press is covering it YouTube is covering it every YouTuber is talking about that's what I mean by excitement it is so exciting that people are are just wishlisting it and sharing it and it's going viral rdit made it to the front page readd it because everybody's like whoa that's amazing up vote it's just like it's just this excitement and so there's no wish list philos like what's a good wish list philosophy that's not it exactly I mean I Do cover that in in the on the dashboard on that um benchmarks but in general it's just like some games are just exciting to be and some aren't and you can kind of correlate that to this velocity and so there's no specific algorithm on Steam that says what's the wish list velocity there's none of that but it's just in general we can just kind of see it we can sense that we can feel it when a game is doing hot and that means everything's going to go better at sales so it's just the raw number it's also how long it took you to get to that wish list number because you'll see a lot of you'll see some blog posts on on Reddit and they're like I got 70,000 wish list and I sold no copies and then if you dig deeper into the comments you'll typically say yeah I got 7,000 wish I launched with 70,000 wish list but I've been marketing my game for 10 years and then I'm like ah see that you can do the math and you're like well that velocity isn't that very good so that means there isn't much interest in the game which typically means the conversion rate is lower so that's that's typically what I see okay so I got to say that that is really awesome I really love the the uh the parallel of how essentially wish list velocity relates to excitement I got to say I I don't think I've heard that before but that makes a lot of sense I mean yeah the more excited people are the more faster they're going to go wish list and play the game so yeah that that was a really great Point yeah thanks good good yeah excitement is just like in general there's so much stuff out there your game has to be exciting to people yeah and it's hard it's hard to do this and I can't tell you like if somebody comes to me and says is my game exciting I don't know you just have to kind of put it out there and see who knows why some people like One Thing versus the other who knows nobody knows yeah and actually I guess a related question uh so here is someone uh asking G computer asking does Chris offer paid Consulting by chance so resource are extremely uh useful but for a very Niche very unique game could be beneficial to get some advice specifically for a game so cuz I mean uh the advice you mention in your blog obviously it's not really awesome but naturally it's very general broad advice so then it's up to developer to uh to apply that so do you have that kind of service where someone can just get really tailored oneonone advice I don't I don't do oneonone advice just because I don't know I just don't have enough time in the day yeah but again everything I know everything I know I put into these courses this course if you can't if you can't get the oneonone advice really every answer I ever know put in this these and I update them all the time every these updated and when you buy the course it gets updated automatic like in other words like I don't say oh version three is out everybody's got to buy version three nope it's a lifetime thing so everything I know I literally put into this course so I know it's it's that but I I really I don't uh I don't do uh inperson uh oneonone Consulting I'm sorry but um but a couple options for you exactly uh again uh the course has it and then my Discord is really good how tomarket agame.com Discord um we have a I need help or advice uh I've got a feedback channel so those are other ways that aren't oneonone advice that you can get that feedback um so yeah sorry yep so the way the data works is just join my mail end list howar game.com free like honestly that's every that is the center of the wheel if you want to know everything then I'm G to be doing how to Market a game.com free that that that is it you get a free book but anytime I'm like hey I'm doing something like when I did the survey for steam nextfest I just sent out the survey and I uh by the way sorry said apparently I was muted so apparently you could hear me but yeah I forgot to unmute CU my dog was walking around so he makes a lot of noise on the thing so I muted and uh so yeah basically my question was someone asking about uh how to share thata with Chris and because Chris does a lot of analysis like yes for data then analyze how everything works so that was that was a question go ahead Chris sorry yeah sorry um so yes so the um um so the way is how tomarket game.com sfree that's my mailing list that is the center of the wheel that is every everything that you want to know that I'm doing how tomarket game.com free I always share it on the newsletter first everything else H I might do it Discord maybe but the center of the wield is the the the newsletter how Market game.com free so what I do is every week send out a blog post and if I'm doing something where I'm like hey I'm trying to study this I will post it on my newsletter and say hey if you've got a game in nextfest fill out the survey and then there's a link to a survey and people fill it out that's how you share your data and I am militant about not sharing something that I shouldn't be um so I make it very explicit like hey I'm going to be sharing this in aggregate so I'll say like hey send me your data the most you're going to be shown is um in a graph so like uh I've just done one just recently um a new blog post here this one here where I did the survey for Steam nextfest and so the way I do the data is no I I just aggregate so these are all the people who responded to the survey you'll notice that I don't call out the games I just you become a bar if you submit your data to me you become a bar in this chart and so it's never pointed out now sometimes a game may have been like I might pull out the bar that had the biggest and be like what happened with that game and so I will message the the developer if I if I decide to like use this as a case study like oh why did this one game get so much higher than everybody else I will message the developer who sent me that thing and said hey um I saw you have the highest this why what happened and can I mention you explicit and your game and share your data I always ask permission before I personally call out a game just to make sure it's okay um and I'm militant about that so if if you don't want the data shared do you don't share you you can say hey Chris don't share my game um just share the numbers in aggregate this is the aggregate charts so yeah I I respect people's data and I would I would never want to just expose somebody who didn't want to be okay so here's a bit of a simpler question so how much of a priority is localization to Steam games like uh for me as far as I know it is extremely important and depending on your game it might actually be relatively uh easy especially Unity has a localization package which I used in my last game and was actually surprisingly easy to use so for me especially because my game wasn't very uh word heavy so it didn't have a ton of taxt so for me it was definitely a worthwhile thing so yeah can you say about how much does localization impact on Steam yeah it's actually quite a bit um so a lot of the big widgets like popular upcoming new and trending those widgets that give you that visibility boost right at the end those are localized so the popular upcoming of Germany would look different than the popular upcoming of Japan and they only steam will only put you valve the steam algorithm will only put you in those charts for your game if it's localized so um it is huge and uh stuff like China is now there are more Chinese users than there are us users so if you're not localized to Chinese you are missing out on half the audience the half the wish list so if you're like God I'm only at 50,000 wish lists and you're only in English you could potentially double your wish list if you are localized so um it is huge because some algorithms some wishlist algorithm some algorithms on Steam are just aggregate wish list it doesn't matter the country so if you could double your wish list by adding another country it is huge so I really really recommend people localize their game both the steam page and the the game itself and you specify that and you can translate the steam page even if your game is not translated and that helps too because there's a lot of users who can filter you can specify when you're creating your uh Steam account these are the languages that I want to see because a lot of people English is a second language and they can read it they might not be fluent in it but they can at least accept it they might struggle through it and so they might opt in but a lot of people don't so they will never see your game if you're not localized so definitely I highly highly recommend localizing it and typically it's better uh I know some developers who are like oh I'm I'm making my game less wordy for the very specific reason that it's cheaper to localize they're like oh I've been too wordy I've been talking about the seven keys of am tler too much I I did a deep lore dive on that I'm just stripping that stuff out so that I don't have to localize all that stuff and that's smart less words so you don't have to spend as much translating yeah okay great uh so here's another interesting question which is talking about in your opinion is there a better time of the year for release which I think I think the answer to that is doesn't matter too much but I think the second question makes a lot of sense which is like uh timing in terms of joining the uh next Fest how long after that should you launch like doesn't make sense to like uh join the next Fest and then uh launch your game a week after a month after two months after when should you terms of timing think about combining both nextfest in order to get the maximum amount of wish list and then combining that with the release timing great question um so um couple questions there um the first one about releasing for the most part I so in general my thought is Indies spend so little time thinking about the genre they pick and so much time picking the the specific release day and hour I think that's wrong it should be the other way you should spend so much time thinking about what genre What type of game what Graphics all that stuff you spend so much time on that and then quickly spend like half a day figuring out your day that you're gonna release just just a side note I just always find that so funny I get that question all the time like what day which hour which which day of the week challenge it doesn't matter as much as most Indies spend time thinking about it instead take that brain space that you're spending on that apply that to deciding which genre of game you're going to spend that's just a side note um but um most of the time it doesn't matter like time of year um except like November December because you know how I say oh don't launch it doesn't matter if you launch next to a AAA but in November December every AAA is launching at that time and so um if everyone it's mainly that you just want to be one of the there's like 10 slots every day to to get some visibility and if all 10 slots are filled with AAA games then that's not great so in general not November December all the other months are fine it doesn't matter um Simon caros the other guy game discover Co he can look at the hype he he studies hype he looks at several factors of how big is this game that's launching and he did analysis of when things matter and he found that the October November December this red means this is a very bad time to launch a game because like I said all the AAA games launch at that time all of them all the other months it's it does doesn't matter it's like a rounding error so in general these are the months to launch now your next question was What About Steam nextfest and I launch during right after a week after a day after the day of I don't know explicitly I'm going to be actually doing that analysis um after this nextfest just happened because a lot of games are launching during this time period you know in the next two weeks because they're they're doing this but the only reason the most important thing is you just don't want to launch next to a bunch of games it doesn't matter how big the game is it matters how many of those games and every Indie has been asking me this oh I'm going to launch right after nextfest because I'll have all this hype and then I'll be launching into hype I'll do this since everybody's asking me that that makes me think every Indie has the same idea which means you're neg you're all bumping into each other and all these Indies have this clever plan to launch right after nextfest which makes me think you're now blind you're now stuffing each other and you're all running into each other and again remember it's not the size of the game it's how many games are launching so that makes me think it's actually not good to launch after nextfest but I'm going to do some deeper analysis that's my gut feel but I don't have data behind it and I'm gonna look uh I'm gonna I have a couple ideas of how I might look at it in the next couple weeks after next test is over so yeah I have to that's a really interesting point which is how when something is a great opportunity as soon as a ton of Indies learn about that opportunity kind of becomes over cry so kind of becomes a negative as opposed to a positive so yeah that's a really interesting analysis yeah okay so here's another really interesting question like in the developers are usually tied for budget so let's say if you had an extra 500 bucks to spend on your game like should you use it to upgrade like the graphics or the art style or does paying streamers and YouTubers does that make sense and I guess just in general just talking about like paid advertising paid coverage is that something that you've seen have a positive effect or not really yeah well uh I mean if you got extra 500 bucks we run the sale right now you can get get all the courses for just a little over 500 bucks so no I mean I'm joking a little bit but you know the courses really help you not make stupid mistakes because I see a lot of Indies they they go to Early Access when they shouldn't they think that they should move their release date because of AAA games launching that's not that's stupid don't do that stick to your plans there's all these things that you can do wrong that are irreversible big mistakes that you can make and that's why I put the course together is because it's up there now besides that okay now you want to do this here's what I think in order are the most important things to spend money on let's say you have a couple hundred bucks okay one is don't make your own capsule just don't um don't take a screenshot don't make your text and Ms paint and then slap together a capsule hire a professional illustrator to make one for you they range depending on if you're chancing it on fiver they range between like a hundred bucks up to like 500 and then if you go super expensive they can be like thousand or more um but in general you can get a pretty good capsule done for 500s and get the text done to I see a lot of Indies they have beautiful Illustrated capsules and then they they make the text and sometimes that text looks so bad it's like it ruins the thing that they paid money for behind it so get hire somebody to make both the the logo for your game and the picture in the background okay now the next thing you should do is festivals um are the number one way to get wish list and I track those on how tomarket agame.com festivals and a lot of those have entry fees they're like a hundred bucks 200 bucks at the most expensive and typically games get into about four or five festivals during the lifetime of their marketing depending on how long they're marketing the type of game four to five and so you might be spending like maybe 500 600,000 on just entry fees to get into these festivals and it is worth it because those get you thousands and thousands of wish lists and lots of visibility so those festivals are very good um the other thing that I would spend money on is um a trailer um a good trailer that is edited well and is exciting again those trailers can go somewhere like 500 to a th000 and then if you go super extreme very good they're like $10,000 but that's for like the top tier Indie Games spend $110,000 to get a very professional trailer but you can hire somebody in Poland for like5 to ,000 that is worth it because again these are just making your game look expensive that's what you're trying to do um if your game now one of the things you I'm just talking marketing but game development you know if you're just using programmer art definitely get that stuff out get programmer out art out hire either a professional or buy asset packs and use them correctly that's very hard to describe but if your graphics are bad it's very very hard to get over that um and then um could should you spend it on PR you can hire a PR person maybe I don't know if that's as if you're limited for Budget I don't know if that's going to help you as much also paying streamers that's not going to help you as much you can do very well free organic streamers you just reach out to I would say 300 streamers and I'm not making that up 300 make a spreadsheet of um 300 streamers that are close to what your game is who've played those type of games reach out to 300 and that's your goal 300 you don't need to pay for streamers you just need to grind it out and contact all those streamers that in general is what I'd spend money on capsule trailer really good courses that won't screw you over and then maybe um uh paying a PR person but that's way down the list because that's they can get pretty expensive so those are kind of the things I'd spend money on yeah so a bunch of people are asking so essentially where do I hire professional artists and uh Jason story actually asked like like there is Derek Leu which is very famous for making excellent trailers like is there a related name to that and I guess I can perhaps answer from my own point of view on WE Tire a professional artist like for me I've used fiber you can find tons of people on there like for example when I made my uh kitchen chaos course I hired an artist from fivr to make this and when I made my game dinky Guardians I also hired an artist to make the the capsule make the logo and so on so that's how I found it but Chris do you have any other sources for firing artists yeah one thing I do for both trailers and um capsules is just look through games that are similar to yours you know you filter them by tag and stuff find games that are similar to yours similar you know scale Graphics all that kind of stuff and just find those people on Twitter and message that the developer and say hey I love your capsule I'm making a game kind of similar to yours who was your capsule artist how much did you pay for it how'd you do it just talk to people and it's it's all word of mouth and then people are like oh yeah this who I is over there um we do keep track of um some good capsule artists on my Discord so how tomarket agame.com Discord there's a jobs Channel and if you look at the pinned message on jobs there's a spreadsheet where people keep track of all those capsule artists so that's another option we we' know that these are good capsule Arts they're not scammers or anything um but in general that's how I do it just just ask just friendly hey who did your capsule who did your trailer I love your trailer it's great oh you did it are you looking for extra work I'll pay you for you to make my trailer that kind of thing that's what you do yeah I gotta say that's a very very straightforward approach find people who have the sort of art sound that you want and literally just ask them just send them a message and yeah they might be able to give you a really excellent recommendation yeah that's people are nice people are nice I so many people are like is there an app or a website that tracks the best no just ask people you can just be friends with people you just talk to them the best thing just ask just ask okay so here's an interesting uh question which is uh do Indie coop games have a higher chance of success than solo games on the same market so like is it like single player and multiplayer I tend to find that multiplayer games do break out quite a lot like whenever there's one it usually becomes a huge hit but you probably don't really see all the other ones that are multiplayer and complet flop like for example local multiplayer as far as I know that one is really not a good genre to tackle cuz local multiplayer is really difficult but even online multiplayer I don't actually know what are the uh statistics like does is it actually a net positive trying to go for multiplayer versus single player or no I don't know I haven't done this analysis this is a very good question and I should this is a blog post in the making I could do this this is easy to do I could do it stay tuned I will do this at some point but here's my gut feel again this is gut Chris's gut okay um for certain genres I think it is very good for example open world Survivalcraft that is like the best genre right now open world Survivalcraft is the number one genre on just median Revenue the type of games that go viral have that velocity and those games are very popular as Coop because people bring all their friends they all hang out they're like hey I'm building the base why don't you go out and get some resources you know it's a very collaborative Cooperative style genre so those type of games really good all these games where you're kind of hanging out with friends because that is the main way people play on games uh play games on Steam is cooperative it's a it's a way to hang out with friends virtually and I mean I've talked to you know how I always do studies with users you know just random Gamers and I talked to him the guy says I filter out everything that is not a multiplayer game because for this one guy now this is just one data point he says multiplayer is how I play games that's what I do I I play Steam games for the social aspect with my friends because my friends live all around the country and this is how I hang out with them that's very smart so I think if you're making an open world Survivalcraft very important now other genres I don't really like that art Coop are like party games these kind of like kind of um you know like uh some of them do very well like uh what is it called plate up or um overcooked those do well but I feel like those party game kind of Mario Party Coop competitive games are very Hit or Miss they either do super well like played up and overcooked or they do or um uh like um Fall Guys those do very well and then everything else does terribly because Coop style games just don't do like local multiplayer because most PCS don't have a couch in front of them they have like one chair so local coop is very hard to do well on if it's like a party game so that's why I say there's no one answer depends on your genre so if your game is a crafty buildy simulation game yes those do well but if your game's like a competitive party game they don't now the other thing to watch out for is multiplayer firstperson Shooters those are again either super popular or nothing like there's there's very little there's like one or two FPS that do super well in Coop and it's very very very very very very hard to do a multiplayer competitive firstperson shooter that's not Coop because that genre is if you don't get enough people in the servers even if somebody likes your game they're gonna be like when's the server going to fill up I'm waiting for the server to fill up and if you don't have enough players the game dies nobody wants to play this game and they'll give you bad reviews so multiplayer games are very hard where you have to fill a Lobby whereas Coop is not as hard because it's like hey my four friends I don't have to wait for somebody to fill the server it's like I have four friends we're ready to go let's do this the other genre I forgot to mention that's very popular with Coop is horror horror Coop is very popular and I'd highly recommend it I think everybody should make a horror game and if you make a coop horror game that's even better because then it's you and your friends telling ghost stories playing this spooky story you get a scream and cry together it's fun that's fun and so a lot of people do that so I guess my short answer is if you're making open world Survivalcraft or horror definitely anything else I'm like maybe don't I don't know it's really hard so that's that's in a nutshell what I think yeah great takeaway I mean there was another question which you pretty much answer which is basically what are the popular genres now in uh 2024 and yeah I guess the main takeaways definitely do not make a platformer and perhaps try doing a horror game because those usually do quite well and uh and on this question real quick though I'll answer this um and it's not just 2024 it is ever and this is one of the big things I try and tell Indies genres do not shift as fast as people assume um the top genres right now on Steam just top of my head are what I typically call crafty buildy simulation games it's a game where you're in a sandbox there's no real story a little bit of a story but you're just kind of like crafting things you're just building in this environment it's it's openended you can do whatever there's no narrative it's not linear it's just like here's all these parts build it it's like Legos everything that's like digital Legos does very well on Steam and these genres typically the top ones are like I said open world survival craft um city builders strategy games um Auto Battlers um uh let's see Rog likes in general and what I mean by Rog likes are um specifically the these kind of where there's like a very simple arcadey mechanic at the center but then around the ring as you play the game you get some soul point or something that you can spend on permanent upgrades but you die and you keep repeating but there's a metal layer that's very like um simulation games look up any game by play way these are games where it's like you've got a job where you are like managing a store and you've got to a supermarket and you've got to buy stuff for the shells and you got to put it away and all these kind of simulation games no story no nothing you're just building this stuff now the reason I say in 2024 doesn't matter because these games have always been popular on PC like Sim City uh The Sims these kind of big crafty buildy simulation game civilization Forex is Big they've always been big so in general and here's a quick rule of thumb I always say is the safer genre to do is one where you do not control the main character okay in general um these are games where they're menu driven So like um if you're thinking about a city Builder what do you do you control a cursor and you move this cursor around and you move the cursor and you say put a building here put a road here you controlling a cursor not a player now there's some there's a lot of caveats around that but in general my thought is it's safer to be a cursor than it is to control the main character okay uh there's a lot of caveats and I know people let we'll talk about it but in general it's safer to control a menu cursor than it is to control a main character um couple caveats where this doesn't quite apply is horror games you control the main character and it's a very linear horror games are very linear and very um short they're like two hours so do well on Steam that's an exception because everybody loves to be scared that's why that works um in general that's that's generally what happens and then there's another one which is a um a narrative like um a visual novel Style game again you're not controlling main character you're controlling a menu where you select what your choices are of the main character but you're not like moving a person around the the screen um those do well and those are pretty linear narrative but you have to be a very good writer for those to work if you're not a good writer you've never written a novel before much less a v virtual novel you're probably not going to do well on those but those are in general are the genres that I think are good okay very good and I mean a lot of those games are actually games that are very systems having like city builders survival crafting games a lot of those are quite uh systems driven so here's a question which is what if you have a game that has like indepth gameplay but not necessarily the finest art let's say just a programmer like just myself it's just a programmer building some really complex systems some interesting gameplay but without having the best of art how exact L can they do marketing considering how marketing is a visual medium so yeah do you have any tips for that okay yes this is a great point in general and this is my general theory on Steam there's two ways to do well in Steam okay you can either have the most beautiful Graphics very very beautiful graphics and so I think of it as a as a chart who's the most beautiful game the more beautiful you are the better you're going to do think of games like stray manner Lords we talked about that that's a game that's just beautiful it looks like a a photo like medieval times even though how would you get a photo of medieval times but either but it just is beautiful right or you go deep your game's the deepest game whatever the graphics could be awful but the game is like simulating everything and think about like Dwarf Fortress they've they've added an overlay that looks okay but it's not amazing but if you think of Rim World um Dwarf Fortress there's a game called NOA if you know about it it it looks okay but every single Pixel is simulated and so my point is if your graphics aren't great you have like programmer art you have to go straight deep another game to look at is Cosmo tier where you build a spaceship I'm not digging on the graphics they're serviceable but they're kind of programmer art Graphics but you it really simulates building a spaceship and so if you don't have the greatest Graphics you have to go deep deep deep deep deep you have to simulate everything you have to do these things where it's like every cat is simulated and every hair on the cat is simulated and every whisker and every Flea on the back of the hair of the cat is simulated you know you just go deep as possible systems driven those games can do okay they they do well I mean again Rim World Dwarf Fortress I'd even put Minecraft in there Cosmo tier Noel all these games that are not the most prettiest but they're the deepest and how you mark this is with a demo because you can't show a screenshot and say hey this game's deep you have to give it to them and say play it it's deep it's the deepest game you've ever played and demos do fantastic for these typ of games so try and get a demo out asly as possible think about Minecraft or coso tiero they just put the whole game out for free they just put the whole game out for free remember Minecraft the early one it's totally for free and then people get so hooked because the game is infinitely deep and they're just like wow this great and every update you do brings more people in because they tell their friendss like this game's so deep and you just do it through the demo that's how you do it so um I think that's that's it just every time you think you've gone deep enough go deeper add more more complexity more complexity it's a systems driven game that's what I recommend for people who aren't good at Art yeah that's a really great point so basically the weaker the art the stronger the uh the uh gameplay has to be and yeah Cosmo tier is really an excellent example because I believe this game was in the making for like eight years and for like half that time they did have a public demo they were constantly getting a ton of feedback so yeah if you don't have like the perfect gorgeous visuals then the gameplay really needs to be really solid really solid and really complex so it needs to have tons of inter logging systems and yeah there are some games I found quite a lot of success with uh by taking that strategy yeah another game that I forgot to mention in the genres that I think is really good especially for firsttime devs idle games idle games are very good they can be very deep systems driven you control them with a menu remember you like select what you want to upgrade um your graphics don't have to be as great um and they it's a good thing to learn systems driven design they can be endlessly replayable the play times are very long so I highly recommend if you're like I I don't know what type of game it makes first make a systems driven Idol game and some that I recommend are micro civilization chill aquarium which is one I just talked about um let's see Loi beats um I think it's called Spirit City Loi beats try that one these are games where they just kind of idle they sit in the background oh Rusty Retirement Systems driven games lots of upgrades lots of depth try them out yeah the idle genre is definitely definitely an interesting one honestly it's a it's a genre that I very much enjoy playing and definitely one on my todo list of one day to play so yeah this is a because it is a genre that is not necessarily too complex but can be if you have some great design you can get basically a ton of uh a ton of game playay time which you were mentioning how in the very beginning on the benchmarks page on how demos uh really great demos have like uh like 38 minutes and 65 minutes and yeah I guess if you have an idle game it's a little bit easier to get to get that high which then helps boost up the algorithm so yeah idlers are definitely a very great genre that people definitely should not ignore definitely okay so here's another really interesting question which is like is it smart to make your first team game make it free with the goal of basically building a community then the question asks is it fine to make it cost money and I think that either one is fine but what about the specific strategy of make it free not to make money but ready to build a community so is that a viable strategy I don't like that strategy um oh for the reason of okay a couple the steam algorithm again likes money so if you make money it promotes you further and one of the things you do um once you've launched you've launched in your first two weeks is um uh after the first month you can start discounting it and so every time you discount it everybody who wishlisted it gets a gets a notification and says hey the game that you wishlisted is on sale so you have control over the algorithm you can push a button and get visibility and that button is discount and then visibility comes in when your game's free you can't discount it so you don't have this every 30day button that you can push to get more visibility the other thing is it's good to get feedback when it's paid when it's paid people have your money so they have more of an opinion like if it's free people who don't like your game are like it's free who cares and they throw it over their shoulder and they get out of there when they have you when you took their money they're like you took my money I wanted a real game this is not a real game it's not a real game because B and they'll have feedback for you about why they don't like your game which is hard it hurts but it's helpful I find steam reviewers are they're kind of jerks but they also write a lot of the time you know and you can say like well the person's a jerk but they're kind of right uh and it's hard to hear this and it and you have to build up your leather shell your shell of leathery skin uh just like old tough leathery skin it it's good skill build up and so I find a lot of people want to make it free because then they're like well then they won't be so mean to me then you got to toughen up and you got to do it come on let's toughen up get that leather skin it's gonna suck but you're going to get better at it you're going to get the good feedback you're going to make your next game better and um who knows your game could turn out to be a viral hit like a vampire survivors and if it's free that Viral hit doesn't do you anything or it could change your life so you never know that's why I say you should always always ask for money get paid for your time let's do this get your skin tough let's do it yeah that is definitely a very good point both on uh being able to withstand reviews which definitely if the game is paid you're definitely going to get quite a lot and that is definitely a very very useful skill to have I mean for me luckily I started by making for me I started by making Flash games and yeah back then even though the games were free the audience was definitely very uh let's say strict they definitely knew what they wanted and thanks to reading those reviews definitely built up that muscle so when I finally made a steam game I was definitely much more ready to receiving some reviews and a lot of them are actually very uh I was going to say positive but I mean even the negative reviews they are positive in the sense that they teach you something so as long as you don't take as long as you read it for what it is you can see it as feedback and then you can apply that in order to make your next game better so yeah I definitely do believe that being able to gain that muscle to become better at analyzing reviews and taking taking some learnings from it I think that is going to serve you very well on the long run yep yep T toughen up get that get charge money for your game okay and here's actually an interesting question so basically you're saying how making a free game is not a good way of building a community so somewhat related so what is the best way to uh gain a community like one approach is doing devlog specifically on YouTube that's one way that people do it and other people try to post tons of gifts on Twitter or Reddit then a bunch of people also find quite a bunch of success on Tik Tok like on Tik Tok you can get get like a thousand views or 10 million there seems to be like no in between uh a bunch of people find Millions which then leads to hundreds of thousands wish list and just by itself that gains quite a lot of success so what is the rough platform that you've seen be most useful to indid devs yeah yeah so this course right here wish list invisibility master class this is all this course is about and when we say build a community that's that's the way people who think marketing is dirty say how do I get wish list how do I get how do I make money it's like that sounds crass to say that they're like oh I want to build a community no no no no no let's just let's just cut to the chase how do you get wish list how do you get the money so that we can do this fulltime that's all this course is all about um um and we can go uh what this course is and here's the here's the thing is every single lecture tells you and I break it down by the time when to do it here here's the curriculum here I mean I organize it based on what stage you are in the game uh you know in making the game and I just go step by step this is not handwavy like try this this is very actionable steps there's like spreadsheets and stuff to figure this stuff out so the course is built around doing this so the reason I I do this is um it just helped like there's so much handwavy advice out there and I really built this course to help you with that question of like how do I literally get people to my steam page and I T you know like you mentioned Tik Tok I I I have a whole thing on Tik Tok you know see right here Tik Tok it's like right there um I go step byep every single technique how to do it and so in general here's the secret and I'll just tell it to you because we're friends um and uh Hugo's included in the friends circle because if you buy this you you Hugo gets some help too uh in general here's how it works there's two types of games pretty games and fun to play games okay if you are pretty if you're a pretty game you can go viral on to or on Reddit you just post a video and you go viral get thousands of wish lists from that but your game has to be so so so so pretty like you have to be a former graphic designer a former artist at like a AAA company 95% of games are not pretty they just aren't I mean they're goodlooking but they're not like so pretty that it goes viral okay uh Twitter also works uh the other thing that works that with those not just pretty but like cutesy games with creatures with big eyes and and floppy ears those games also do well if you're not one of those types of games okay the next things are here's how you get wish list is how you get visibility festivals applying to festivals remember I said how Market game.com festivals streamers and both of those require demo so what you do is if you're if you're not a pretty game you build a demo as fast as you can and you give it to streamers and you apply to festivals and that's how you do it and that's the technique and you just do that festivals and streamers festivals and streamers festivals and streamers until you want to die and then you release your game that's how it works that's how this works and this I know that was like really simple like how do I reach out to a streamer how do I do that I literally give you letters that you just fill out your Game's name and spreadsheets of how to track which streamer playing your game like I give you all the tools that you need to do to do this stuff it's not like oh just Contex streamers here's a chapter on no it's like okay do this then this then this so that's what this uh this whole course is I hope that answer your question okay yeah great so here's a bit of a simpler question and actually I would love to know the answer to this one so you've talked about a lot about how horror games is a great genre for indie game devs to make so simple question how long should a horror game be like is that something where I'm guessing it's not something where the audience expects like a 100 hours of gameplay so what do people generally prefer in that gen I mean for any of these answers just go go go play a bunch of um horror games you can just click on Steam on the horror tag look at the top sellers click the thing and then when you look at the reviews every review tells the hour how long the person played and a lot of reviewers say stuff like hey this game was two hours and it was great or some people say like it was 20 minutes and it was terrible so you just start tracking that stuff in general what I find is under two hours for a horror game which is why horror games are so awesome uh and there are some subg genres of horror games like Coop horror games like lethal company where they have much longer medium play times because it's Coop multiplayer game but for the most part most horror games are like two hours long um because people don't want to be scared for like 10 hours that sounds horrifying it's like people just want to be scared for like 30 minutes at a time so in general that's why I say two hours but again do your own research go go on the web on Steam and just look at a bunch of games and and keep a little spreadsheet and say this game Medan uh you know the time that people said that it took was two hours this game time play was 30 minutes you know and just kind of keep track of that stuff and then then you get a good judgment and then play the games this is this is the thing go play games I find that not enough people play games I I interviewed one of the top um in one of the things that was um in my blog the game was um Deep Rock Galactic survivors and that studio when they were planning to design their game they downloaded 30 different vampire Survivor likes and they looked and they analyzed and they figured out why each one they they wrote up their own opinions on why this game was Hot or Not 30 of them so go play 30 horror games we got the Steam summer sale coming up so if you're thinking of making a game that's the best time to buy because it'll be on sale um so buy all the horror games you can that are kind of like good sellers buy some that aren't good sellers so you can see what's bad some buy some that are terrible sellers so you know that like oh this is what you don't want to do and then just analyze them write a one sentence summary of why you think that game's good or bad and what they did that was interesting you got to do your research like play the games learn the genre like you are an expert and I find that a lot of Indies don't do that enough they're just like oh I saw one screenshot of a horror game I'm going to make it and the players like what the hell is this it's like this person looked at one screenshot and made a game off of it they know fans of the genre know yeah being able to do research whether it be on on uh Steam Reviews or over here on how long to beat this is actually a great website in order to see just how big a game is so yeah I guess for that question you can just go search for a bunch of horror games put them here see how long and yeah I guess for horror games they really don't require too much so yeah that's one of the reason why it's such a great genre and somewhat related to uh how long the game is here's a great question which is how should I price my game so usually sometimes get a bit annoyed if a game is like I don't know 15 bucks but it's only got two hours other times a game for five bucks and someone will leave a negative review even if it has like 50 hours so yeah this is a really tricky question a while ago you were talking about how Indies should up their price because Indies are constantly devaluing themselves so I feel this is a very tricky question so can you give some sort of an answer how do I price my game well check my blog just search PR price and I think in general the reason people leave bad reviews is if you don't meet the genre expectations okay and here's the thing this is another thing Indies don't do enough of they don't understand their their game is in a genre and it's better in general not to be this weird game that has no genre it's a it's a genre that doesn't exist I invented a genre those don't do as well as the ones like nope I'm firmly in the genre I meet all the expectations of the genre I do it and so uh you know this thing of price versus that what you do is you just go to all the games in your genre buy them play them see what the reviews say find out like hey this game has 50 upgrades okay it's 50 upgrades and this game has 20 upgrades like this game's much deeper you know you start to find out oh the graphics are really good on this one you start to get a sense of what the games are how well they do and what their price is and so just do the research like pull 30 games of the genre that you're making one in list out the price list out what the reviews are what are the reviews saying are they like oh man this game's a great value I get 50 hours for five and you're like oh okay well this game seems to have underpriced itself whereas this game says oh this game is so bad it like they charged $30 and it's got only 10 hours of content then you're like ah okay that's how much I know it's like crash and a lot of people hate on Steam Reviews that say oh only 10 hours of content and it's too expensive and it's like well yeah games cost that's that's just the world we live in that's the way it works um and so um in general that's the way it goes now one thing with price again search my blog for price of how to do this analysis here's the thing if people don't complain about your price you've priced it too low think about it if somebody doesn't complain about the price you have priced your game too low ideally if you know economics and the the supply and demand your game will be too expensive for some people it just will okay so it's good if somebody complains about your price you're like okay well we just found the price you know what it is there's it's going to be too expensive for some people and the thing is with steam you're always discounting the game every time you can you're supposed to Discount the game and eventually the price will be low enough for that person so and then the other review that you'll get which sounds bad but is actually good is people say oh it's not worth it uh you should buy it when it's on sale yeah here's a secret nobody buys games at full price on Steam everybody buys the game on sale so when the guy says oh I wouldn't buy this game and list it was on sale join the club that is all of steam okay so just toughen out again get that leathery skin out good leathery skin read that blog post howar game.com um how tomarket game.com and then search price and there's a whole I've got the I've got the blog post shown here so yeah definitely go ahead and Link I'm actually going to post a link definitely go ahead and watch that and actually you were just talking about uh discount so here's a really related question which is how often should I put my game on discount or I guess specifically uh like what is the discount strategy that you recommend I know for myself a few years ago I definitely used to Discount way too heavily like within like six months to a year I would get my game down to 75% I definitely think I did that way too fast I uh like with my latest game I'm definitely going much slower nowadays I think I've discount like three times and I think I'm only putting it at like 20% just pretty much to trigger the the wish list emails but yeah do you have any advice on specifically uh uh discount strategy and how to do that yep and uh let me just see here I back to the course uh we talk um how post launch you know converting the wish list there's a whole section on how this works and here's um so again I go I cover you from beginning Cradle to grave on your game on how to do this stuff in general though like like um Hugo said it's it's a stair step you should always discount when you can okay because you can do it every 30 days and they have a calendar widget now where you can just program in the the the dates all the time and then you should always do the summer and the winter and the seasonal sales because those do not count to your cool down because you can't discount it every single day there's a cool down you can only do it certain period of time and those um big sales don't count as a cool down okay so you should go ahead and schedule out all of those for the year you should never miss a sale because time moves forward and if you miss that discount you can't do it again and remember I said people only buy games on sale you just missed out forever in all time that month where you did not discount your game so you should always discount every chance you can and you should stair step don't go too deep too fast because there's this thing called historic low and if you discount your game to like 75% right away you missed all the times you could have done it 50% 65% you know like each level down because you're just shaving off users that have different price discrimination like I only buy it when it's 75% off I'll only buy it when it's 90% off if you go too fast too deep you lo you just gave away all that stuff so don't do that be careful but do it all the time always discount yep definitely always take the advantage I'm pretty sure steam is like every six weeks I think so yeah definitely go on to the steam page and yep on the calendar they updated it like a few months ago and like you can set your discounts for like the next year and so on definitely go ahead and definitely take every opportunity you can because I mean anytime discount I notice it with my own games like it's six it's every six weeks so it's pretty much one month you can discount the other month you can't and I very much notice how it's like a 50% difference in revenue between one month and another one so yeah definitely do not miss that one that is a a very important thing and uh I guess speaking sorry go ahead no no I I totally agree you you can tell you can tell you can see when games go on discount based on the review counts oh yeah definitely and uh I guess speaking about money what do you think about crowdfunding I got to say that is one that I haven't really uh followed much but as far as I know Kickstarter nowadays is much much difficult than it was previously I think nowadays you pretty much need like a ton of marketing beats like it's even more intense than just doing a regular uh steam release but yeah that's a one that I haven't followed along much so do you know how difficult it is is it a viable option so I don't know I don't know uh Kickstarter I just don't I don't study that that space I don't I don't study it most people I've talked to they say the other Indies that I talked to they say it's more of a marketing beat than actually funding your game so I don't know yeah kickstar does seem like very much doing game on hard modes really difficult uh so yeah here's another interesting question which is uh if you're going to make a multiplayer game so is it wise to make it free to play and then offer an inapp purchase to unlock the full game or I guess as far as I know I my initial response to this is this probably not good I don't think the steam audience reacts very well to unlocking full game so I guess maybe a more general question would be have you seen any sets for Indie devs trying to go the freeo playay right route with inapp purchases has that ever worked out well I feel like that is a very highrisk High reward thing especially for Indie devs yeah freeo play is very very very hard on Steam and multiplayer is very very very hard on Steam I don't I don't that is the ultimate hard and then if you throw in Early Access you're just I don't know who what kind of masochist you are you are just a crazy person I'm just kidding I'm just kiding but it is so hard to do those um I was talking to somebody who had a successful freet toplay game that has crashed in other words no users on it nobody buys anything after three years he says I don't know of any games really other than like csgo which is run by Valve that after five years is still in operation a a freeo playay game a freeo playay on Steam is just so hard very few games do well um the the typical steam game is paid up front not you know yes multiplayer games do well but for us Indies it multiplayer is so so so so so hard so most Indies find success by being paid UPF front not multiplayer I mean there could be Coop but not like you join a server and you battle on a on an arena that is so hard to do so not a big fan of freeo play it's just so hard it's really hard yeah freeo play really seems like a if Early Access is hard mode then freet to play seems to be like hard mode on steroids really insane really difficult uh mode deadly definitely uh so here's another also very interesting question which is let's say you've launched a game and after a while sales have dropped to basically zero which is normal I mean every game kind of uh drops off so at what point is it worthwhile trying to push new content updates to try to basically get the ball running try to increase sales is that wise or should you really move on to the next one and I guess a second question over here which is how effective are the steam discoverability rounds I got to say I haven't used those in quite a while I do know about but yeah I haven't I I know they were nerfed like three years ago like previously they would get that shown to pretty much everyone whereas nowadays they only get shown to the people who already own the game as far as I know that's how it works so I don't know how much effect that has so yeah do you have any stats on that something yeah and again the course talks about this so um in so much more depth but in general here's here's here's high level what's what's Discovery rounds don't don't matter they don't do anything anymore here's the here's the honest truth folks um steam only cares if your game makes money in my in my opinion um it's based on a lot of clients and you know doing this long enough about 150 if you earn $150,000 within the first six months of your game's release you're you're attractive to steam I call it real steam because really if you reach that kind of tier $150,000 or more within the first six months valve is like this game's got potential and they give you things that you can do you can do daily deals weekend Deals they feature you in festivals they do all kinds of stuff for you popups and all these things they actually promote your game Steam does and it is awesome and that is how you make a living that's how you make a living doing this is you get into real Steam and then steam gives you tools that you can use if you don't make that if you're under $150,000 and it's within the first 6 months steam's like thanks for playing they they don't say it explicitly but they're like thanks for playing better luck next time and you really don't have any tools there's no I mean you can discount your game like I said we said the discount this amount over time but you're never going to achieve those those big numbers it's it's done and so what I typically recommend is yes discount all the time but it's time to move on I say do a couple updates you know if you if if you got somewhere around there maybe do one or two updates fix major bugs show the community that you're a good Dev the worst thing that you can do on Steam is just ghost where you just disappear and then Val and then those steam players are like oh this this Dev abandoned the game Dead game no I mean patch it maybe once every six months fix any gamebreaking bugs definitely if your save file corrupts when you play the game definitely fix that make sure the game is stable and then move on start making your next game a sequel something else like that it's time to move on because really the whole the whole of steam is oriented to promote games that have that that velocity that 160,000 within six months somewhere around there that's what the name of the game is if you're not achieving that steam's not going to do anything for you they're like hey thanks good better luck next time okay it's hard truth um but that's kind of what I I teach in the class is how to get to that level so that steam will promotee you yeah it definitely is uh seems very a very harsh world so yeah you definitely need to put your best foot forward and come out of the gate as strong as possible and if not then it becomes quite difficult to to get out so yeah definitely don't uh neglect your announcement your release definitely make sure everything is as punished as possible and yeah hopefully it finds success and if it doesn't definitely you hopefully learn quite a lot in order to make the the next one quite a bit better uh and a somewhat related question which is let's say that development is going slower than expected and delays the release date so let's say you announce a release date announce it publicly and then you have to push it back is that going to be negative uh or I guess specifically if I have to choose between okay put out a game that is maybe not quite as ready or pushing it back and potentially annoy the people who have already wish listed who were already uh interested in it is that something that can have a potential negative effect personally I would say it's probably better to wait and I mean I guess it's that whole uh mamoto quote about uh uh a bad game is bad whereas a delayed game is eventually good something like that so I I would say it's probably best to uh wait a little bit and make sure the game is as perfect as can be right off the gate but yep uh go ahead yeah I mean I I don't think people care about the delay as much especially at our scale we're so little um um message it and tell them why you're delaying but really look at why you're delaying I mean if it's obvious like it's a gamebreaking bug or something but in general here's the thing I to be honest uh Hugo I don't like that mamoto quote because it leads to Indies spending too long on their game and if it mean if you're delaying like a year or six months or something you're like well I I I want to delay because I want to switch to a new engine or I want to do this I I I want to kind of Polish up the game like for the most most part if you are not having that okay I'm going to go deeper here remember how I talked about wish list velocity if your velocity is not high you're nowhere near reaching the minimum which is 7,000 wish lists if you are nowhere near that or it's like man if I just polish the game one more time if I do one more polishing pass if I just redo this one boss if I just um add a cape to the guy to the main character I think that's going to do it in general if that's the case I don't think that's worth delaying because it is very hard to make up those sales with that extra time that you added okay and I'm just being totally honest it is like is very hard to make enough to justify delaying but the exception is if your game is a hot hot game if your game is like you're sitting on 100,000 wish list you get like 300 wish list a day there's a lot of expectations behind your game and it is hot then I think it makes sense to delay to make sure the game is bulletproof because even if you have a 100,000 wish list and everybody's super excited your game is hot the wish list velocity is off the charts they stuff those benchmarks that I've done if your game disappoints it's not as fun it's janky it's buggy then all that Goodwill that you built up that velocity is going to be lost and people are going be like this game's crap I've seen this before games that have gone in hot but they're buggy or something's wrong with them or janky sales crash that is bad and so if you're high velocity lots of wish lists then it makes sense to delay to really polish it up but if you're barely getting wish lists and you're hoping that if I delay I can get more wish lists I don't think that's the best do your time release it in the best state it can go keep patching it and then move on to your next game because every game you release you get better and better and you get more and more of an audience so that's kind of my recommendation depending on where you are yeah I definitely agree I mean like you said with that mamoto quote yeah I definitely do agree that it has to be dependent on the game being good definitely do not do not keep delaying a game for like three years five years and so on without any proof that the game is actually going to be hit so if you are something like Jason sorry mentioned s song yeah if you are s song with a mountain of people waiting for you then yeah absolutely delaying can indeed make quite a lot of sense so yeah definitely here's the thing remember mamoto is the world's greatest game designer and he works for a publicly traded company that is worth billions of dollars his advice remember how I said there's AAA rules and there's our rules that is kind of a triaa rule you know what I mean where it's like they live in a different world in a different they're playing a different game than we are we are small little specks of bacterium yeah there are definitely multiple worlds and multiple RS to fall here's a here's a really interesting question I'm pretty sure you made a a blog post on this a while ago with which is uh basically have you seen any positive or negative effect on the use of AI games like or or rather using AI to make games like there are a lot of people who think okay these AI tools they really make you really efficient at producing all kinds of visual ass and so on so soon enough steam is going to be flooded with tons of trash I mean I'm pretty sure people have said the exact same thing back when green light was announced back when steam direct was announced and so on so yeah do you have you seen like an increase in let's call it trash games games that aren't really competing for attention like is that something that is happening nowadays thanks to all these uh all these tools that exist nowadays yeah okay so I have no opinions on AI I don't I don't whatever you say always makes one side mad I don't I don't know I don't have an opinion on AI I just don't care um but the side effect the second order effect is what you said like does this is this going to lead to a flood of garbage and that means it's going to be impossible to sell a game on Steam um and so what I did was analysis last year I looked at all the games released and how many games have been released and how well they sold and I kind of broke them down into tears and what I found was this graph right here this called a worm chart um most games on Steam so last year there were about 14, 500 I think somewhere around there games released on Steam and these are over the time so these are the years so this is when steam first opened all the way to now and then how many games were released and then each color is how many reviews those games got so the blue bar is z to 10 reviews less than 10 this orange is 50 to 10 and then all the other tiar so most games are kind of garbage like and I don't mean that pejoratively I just mean that it's like they're firsttime games they don't know they've never made it they've never if you market like the stuff I teach in the course if you do pretty well you're going to get at least 50 reviews so what I say is most of these games are just games that are very amateur they don't know what they're doing they haven't studied the Market that's most of the games the other games have been quite St like steady like the real games there aren't that many new real games on Steam okay and so I have a feeling the AI flood is just going to flood this higher but it doesn't matter these two the orange and the blue bars the steam how I said if your game doesn't sell $160,000 within the first six months steam just Smothers it it suppresses it that's what's Happening Here steam will suppress these games so if next year after the AI flood this blue bar is like twice as high it's not going to matter these games you do not see these games on Steam it is so hard to even see them the only way I see and can count them is I have to go to a scraping site called vgn sites that scrapes every game and I filter for them you will no matter how far you click deep into steam you will never see them steam basically suppresses these games they are never see and so the steam algorithm is very good at this so even if the number of AI games doubles the number you will never see them you will only see these games that do very well and you're like well how how do I become one of these games that's what the course is for I teach you all the steps all the all the things you just have to you just have to really manage your marketing correctly and then you're eligible for this the real competition the thing that keeps people from becoming professionals or like Pro almost professionals is right in this competition between these bars these bars are the ones that are really competing against each other and it is competitive out there but for the most part it's people who are real developers who really study the craft who really understand what they're doing those it is getting competitive but it's within here it's not you're not competing about with these it's the these are like you're not competing against elementary school children you're competing against Real athletes here that's where this competition is and that's what the course kind of teaches you is how to get that advantage to get into this competition I don't care about this this I don't think is matter and I think people are worried about the AI flood there's going to be another article oh 17,000 games were released 100,000 that doesn't matter because most of those games are crap it's these this is what you really have to worry about is this little very consistent number of games that do pretty well but not great okay so that's my theory on the AI flood just just a heads up I gotta I gotta leave at the top of the hour so I can answer maybe one more question very good I can do like maybe one more question really quick I got to end at the top of the hour so can I say one month yeah I there are look up um the developer of cozy games um cozy cozy b games is the name cozy b games she released a game like one month then three months then four months then two months like she released games very quickly in very small amounts she's she's working on a game that's a lot longer but in general Indies are spending way too long on their games they're making the wrong type of game they're making games that are too story based too linear and it's just taking way too long and you in the beginning you need to release very quick games um I think we lost sight of that back in the day when Hugo was making Flash games flash games were put out like once a month for a lot of these steps and I think that's the right attitude now I will be clear those games that you make in one month two months three months are not going to sell well they won't but what you're doing is you were learning how to make games and then after you've done this enough you will start to get good do this for 10 months a game a month for 10 months really work on it or try it for two months make a game every two months but you should be making small games to learn the trade and then after that after your 10th game then you can go to the oneear long games and what you're doing is you're also building on your Tech don't make one game in one genre and then a different genre maybe make a city Builder every month and every month the city Builder becomes more and more complex now again these games won't sell well it takes a long time to make and market a top selling game but the most important thing is you are learning and yes charge money for these games yes put them on Steam but don't worry you won't get a black mark because you're releasing so many games it is good to learn how to make games okay so yeah that is definitely my final thought folks don't give up after your first game and don't make your dream game for your first game for God's sake please don't do that yeah very good and I actually messed up so my my mic was muted but I'm pretty sure people understood from your answer so how long to to make your first game so anyways Chris if people want to continue learning from you learning about marketing how to get more wishless sales how to find more success where can they go
