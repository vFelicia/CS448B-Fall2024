hello and welcome I'm your KMI there's a really interesting discussion happening right now on the topic of stop killing games for context this is an initiative being proposed in the you that is currently Gathering signatures the goal with this initiative is like name implies to stop killing games so make sure the games don't die the main example they talk about is the game The Crew this was a game made by Ubisoft and launch in 2014 it's a game that had both single player and multiplayer elements and earlier this year Ubisoft shut down the game servers and in doing so the game is now completely unplayable so if you bought the game before you cannot play it not even in single player the game is just gone for good so the main goal with this initiative is to make sure that doesn't happen to make sure you can keep playing the games you bought for as long as you want to meaning this would require companies in this case Ubisoft to leave the game in a playable State either by removing all the online checks with a patch or by providing server binary so people can run their own servers now importantly this does not seek to acquire ownership of the games any IP and anything like that it also does not expect the publisher to provide resources for the video game once they discontinue it so the whole goal is really leaving it in a reasonable functional State that's really the general idea and on the there's been a lot of discussion arguing both for and against this initiative on the four side the channel occurs Farms led by Ross is the main one behind it on the against side the main voice against it is sore from Pirate software then primagen also feels this would cause more harm than good and Le Russman also has a very interesting video on this subject he has a unique take given how he was a big driving force behind the right to repair bill so he knows something about the process of proposing something to eventually become law even though that was in the US and stop killing games is in the EU and of course there's the official website which also has a really nice fq with tons of questions answered as well as the official initiative website which has a bunch more detail which by the way this actually really small when I heard about it I thought this was going to be like 80 pages of something but no it literally is just three sentences long so you can read through this entire thing read through the entire fq and everything you can read all that in just a few minutes here I want to share my thoughts on this but definitely also go ahead and research it for yourself go read these pages and watch all those videos to get Thea context I'll link everything in the description now I myself have been a professional solo indie game developer for 10 years now I've got got nine Games published on seam so I feel like can talk a little bit about this topic but at the same time I don't really have any experience with like MMOs life service games and those kinds of things my games are really solo games developed by solo developer so very tiny small games so definitely keep that in mind keep in mind my own perspective as you hear my thoughts like I said there's a lot of discussion happening right now there's some valid counterarguments and some less valid ones one thing that kickstarted this whole discussion is especially because th has a huge audience and he came out so strongly against it now because of that some people are attacking him calling him greedy or out of touch or bias because he's the director of marketing for a publisher I really don't think that's right I think he genuinely does want what's best for the industry and he genuinely does think that this will not be a positive I just think that both him and Prime they are both too hyperfocused on specific hypothetical scenarios where things could go wrong and they are completely ignoring all the other much more likely scenarios where this actually becomes a positive change there's also one very important factor that I feel is being lost in this discourse it is how this is not a law proposal the initiative is literally just these three sentences that's really it so the goal with this is really just to get the conversation started it is not meant to make just these three sentences into law if that were the case then yeah I would agree this is way too vague and needs to be a lot more detailed but again the goal is really just for this to start the conversation you can see the official website for the European citizens initiative you can go ahead and see how it all works so first get started start by launching an initiative then get it registered finally try to get support so try to get 1 million citizens this is the current stage where it's at right now then after that it's going to make sure that all of those votes have been verified then submit it officially after that get an answer then start talking with a bunch of Representatives to explain all the issues in detail and finally after all of that if the commission considers legislation as an appropriate response to your initiative it will start preparing a formal proposal then this can require Preparatory steps like public consultations impact assessments and so on so this is very much just the first step to start the conversation it does not mean this whole thing this tiny thing this is the entire law in reality this is example like game development whenever you design a game you never really get it right the first time you build some kind of system then you find some values and then crucially you play test the game over and over again and constantly iterate upon it so that is literally the exact same process that we have here so this initiative is pretty much just a Bare Bones prototype and then if it passes then it will be iterated upon after a while they will make some kind of Alpha version then a better version and maybe a few years from now it will become some kind of final version now there's also a very strange misconception that both Thor and Prime mentioned in their videos how they think how this is meant to force multiplayer games to be turned into single player games now if that were the case I would agree that would be a monum Al task it would be unreasonable to have a lot to basically Force developers to do that turning a multiplayer game into a functional single player game that basically requires re architecting the entire game which is really not a reasonable ask but I've read through the entire initiative and although I'm not a lawyer I definitely did not interpret it that way at all from what I understand the goal with this initiative is mainly two things so for games that are primarily single player but with some online features like the crew basically just make sure that the single player portion that one does not break when the online servers go down for example the crew had a ton of single player Conta but now none of that content is available you can play it even if you did purchase the game you cannot experience any of that right now and the second thing is for multiplayer games for those to still be playable after the company sees support either by providing the Ser binaries or some source so this proposal is really not requiring developers to make single player games out of a multiplayer game I'm really not sure if I'm missing something but I read through the whole website all the fq the initiative and so on and I really did not interpret it that way at all so I'm really not sure why they mention this as a counterargument then in terms of releasing the multiplayer server binary there are indeed some valid arguments against it like what prime mentioned with regards to malicious compliance how it might be that companies will simply release just a thin layer of code and if you don't have really all of the servers that depend upon to make that work without all of those it really won't work so due to the complexity of multiplayer games nowadays how they use tons of servers on the cloud with some very complex infrastructure with all that I can't see this being a problem and how by releasing this in layer without all the connections to all the code behind it that really won't solve the problem so this definitely EV valid Counterpoint and I really don't know what is the solution for for or there are also cases where the server basically depends on some third party libraries that they do not have the license to describing meaning they legally might not be allowed to just send over the server binary so that would indeed be a problem in that case those developers would be breaking the law really through no fault of their own but like Louis said in this video if that is inde the case that might actually simply be just a sign that more things need to change now for me I spent my childhood playing CounterStrike 1.6 and here in Portugal there were no valve official servers at all so in order to play with decent ping valve basally provide the dedicated binaries and then local people or companies companies like Frank leader they could set up their servers and people could play then the game just had a server browser and you could connect and play on any server just connect directly to the IP and that's it everything works there's really no need for valve to be involved at all at one point I even had my own dedicated server for my clan we basically just rented a Linux dedicated server on a Data Center and just ran the Counterstrike server executable that option is still valid nowadays even though CS 1.6 is no longer supported by Val themselves you can still do that you can still run server play the game connect to it everything works same thing for Quake Battlefield Med of honor and really any multiplayer game from the early 2000s all those games are still playable nowadays none of those games have died because none of them are dependent on support from the actual developer so this initiative is really just proposing turning that into law so that for example 20 years from now we can play the games from now just like right now we can play the games from 20 years ago but again this initiative would require quite a lot of iteration before it becomes low so on some games like the crew I imagine it would be actually relatively simple to keep the game alive at least for the single player portion I imagine it would be relatively straightforward really just write a reer to all the functions that contact the server and before shutting down the official servers just update the game put out one less patch and make sure to remove that server check just do that and at least a single player portion would still work but then of course there are other games like Microsoft flat simulator that one is apparently heavily dependent on the cloud to work so I imagine for that one it would be a much much bigger challenge however at the same time if that game was built from the start with an eventual shutdown plan if so they would probably be able to build that in in such a way that it would be relatively straightforward instead of streaming all data from the cloud they could just include all that map data directly in the game naturally that would have the downside of the game being absolutely massive since it would not depend on the cloud so it would suck to have such a huge game but at least it would be playable if they started development right from the start with this idea in mind if so then technically it wouldn't be a big problem whereas of course forcing retroactive changes that would be a big issue that would be essentially reacting the entire game so that would not be a good thing but from what I understand these laws are usually not retroactive so it would only apply to games releasing in the future and possibly a few years after the law actually comes to pass so this also brings to mind the simple idea of how if you want to make a game if you make it single player and then afterwards try to make it multiplayer that is extremely difficult but if you know you're going to make a multiplayer game if you make it multiplayer right from the start then Things become much much easier so this over here would really be the exact same thing it would just require developers to think about a shutdown plan right from the preproduction stage then Prime also mentioned an important potential issue regarding piracy and hacking basically if companies are required to expose some kind of protocol or basically just give out the Ser binaries if so that would indeed give quite a lot of information to potential hackers so make the hacking problem quite a bit more difficult but again the goal with the initiative is while the game is actively being supported absolutely nothing happens so the whole thing about exposing some kind of protocol releasing the set of binaries all of that only happens after the game ends the support so as long as the company keeps supporting the game as long as they do that then there's really no more issues than right now when it comes to piracy or hacking and afterwards technically those could become issues but the main point of this being that afterwards even with issues the game would still be playable so even if the game died and hackers found easy ways to hack if so you could still just download the server binary yourself build your own server and just play with your friends the important thing being you would be able to play the game people have also mentioned issues with regards to time licenses and issues with having to renegotiate that for example you can see how the crew had just a handful of users before being shut down and in order to make the game they had to license all these cars so they had to contact like Lamborghini and Ferrari in order to be able to show the cars in the game and they probably just had a license to those for about 10 years so with so few users it does make sense for them to not renew the license however that does not mean that they need to kill the game basically without the license that just means they would not be able to sell the game anymore but it should not mean they get to take away the game from people who already own it that right there is really the wrong part for example a game like GTA they usually have tons of license tracks on the radio and those licenses those are also timed if you buy a copy of GTA sandreas right now you won't get the same songs that were there at release but if you have a copy of the game that you bought a long time ago if so you can still go play the game with the exact same songs as it had about 20 years ago then on his second video Thor mentioned a scenario where a malicious actor would basically be incentivized to attack some kind of server for a game attack with Bots exploits and really anything in doing so it would cost a ton of money for the actual developers so technically a malicious actor could make the developer go bankrupt and then if this were law then that bankrupt developer they would have to release the source code or the server binaries or anything like that and then that malicious actor could then take that server make that server online and really just profit off of it so in this scenario this malicious actor could technically make money off of something that they did not build now I think we can all agree that would be a terrible outcome however I think the issue with this hypothetical scenario the issue is basically the assumption that there is only one server basically only the malicious actor only that one can provide the server after the developer dies meaning that if you want to keep playing the game you would have to give your money to this malicious actor but in reality if this were to happen if so there would be dozens or hundreds of regular people just taking the ser binaries and just building them so in this scenario it would not be limited to just a malicious actor having their own servers anyone could make their own server and if this malicious actor does not have a guarantee of being able to profit off of killing some developer then that would kind of sensiz this whole strategy and in terms of Sero complexity people have pointed to an example of world Warcraft and how the back end for that game is likely quite complex but on this both the initiative and LS in his video makes an important distinction about how buying a game is different from renting a game how when you play wow you really have to pay every single month so in that it is somewhat clear how you're actually renting the game you're renting access to their servers and with the Assumption with renting any kind of thing is that techically at any point they can stop the rental so at least that one makes a little bit of sense regardless of being a good or bad thing whereas when you buy a game kind of like the crew you assume you're buying a product not renting it so you assume you won't be able to use it many years in the future so all I really do feel like the criticisms against this they really bring to mind the definition of the saying don't let perfect be the enemy good so yes I do think there are questions about these specifics yes I do think this will require quite a lot of iteration and a lot more deta before it gets to the LW stage but if it doesn't get enough signatures if so then it will never get to that stage so while I do agree that the initiative isn't perfect and doesn't account for all of the possible edge cases even without that I still think this is a very good starting point and I think this topic is very much a conversation worth having now since I am actually European I did go ahead and sign the form if you are also European then definitely go check out the official proposal page and if you do feel this is a conversation worth having then definitely go ahead and sign up they are currently 20% the way to 1 million signatures and you can see all the countries and how many people I voted for all right I hope you found valuable to hear my thoughts on this topic thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
