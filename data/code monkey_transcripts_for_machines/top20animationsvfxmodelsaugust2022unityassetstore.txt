hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the ancesaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for august 22. even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all the kind of games that i could build this one is a list of paid ads and effects i've already made two videos covering the best screen us and best tools and systems as always there's links to the desktop description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code makitantia 10 percent off your order also quick mention there's a humble bundle right now all about sound there's quite a lot of music and sound effects for just about any game any genre looks like a pretty great pack and as usual it's a super deep discount another interesting bundle is this one that just started yesterday it's all about microsoft azure cloud which is a pretty funny coincidence since just this past weekend i spent a bunch of time studying azure and researching how it can be useful for game devs so i'm thinking of getting this one myself and definitely stay tuned for some interesting azure and cloudbased game mechanics tutorials coming soon and finally the unt sale is still going on for a few more days so if you need anything go ahead and browse to see what's on sale alright so starting off with a really awesome animation pack this one is all about nonlethal handtohand counters obviously perfect for any fighting game but also anything where you want to showcase some handtohand fight so maybe that could be in a cutscene or maybe some melee enemies looks really nice all the animations are perfect then for some flashy vfx here's some stylized lightning i love how this one looks the rays and then the particles stay for a bit really nice features 25 effects with several color variations between them up next if you need a super high quality character and look at this sniper really gorgeous model some excellent textures this dev always has some insane high quality models so if you want to push unity to its limits in terms of visual fidelity then definitely use one of these assets for something more stylized here's a nice wolf it comes with a model and also a bunch of color variations and the pack also includes over 30 animations so it's all ready to be used up next if you need a really nice foresty environment check out this one it's really gorgeous i love the colors on this one this is a full map and personally as someone with no level building skills i love it twin packs include a fully prepared demo just like this one for a completely different song here's some pixel monsters this is a pretty massive pack 100 monsters and all of them with some really nice animations they all have some great unique designs all of them very creative next up if you'd like to try making your own red dead redemption check out this one it's a super high quality cowboy model they even have a video showing it working in a prototype game so if you were to combine this model with a nice horse controller you have a really nice red dead prototype if your game needs some shiny crystals check out this one it includes several variations both in terms of color and shape so these would be perfect to populate some kind of cave or maybe act as a material resource next up here's the latest cinti pack this one is all about dogs really nice you have tons of variation from some regular dogs to some zombie or even robot dogs it's in their signature cell and also this pack since it's not humanoid based this one includes all of the animations so it's entirely ready to be used if you need some really nice vfx to make your buildings vanish or appear then look at this one it's a great looking dissolve and spawn effect so this one would be perfect for a game like a tower defense or rts or really anything where you place or destroy buildings and i'm guessing this really works with any mesh so it shouldn't look fun when applied to a character maybe kind of like a teleport effect then here's a cool animation pack this one is all about vampires lately i've been playing v rising i even made a video recreating a really nice mechanic so this pack with vampires pretty much fits what i've been playing you have tons of animations about 60 all of them really nice with some basic ones and some really impressive attacks then here's a modular railway constructor for me one of my favorite games growing up was playing rollercoaster tycoon so this pack immediately makes me want to remake that game although technically this is a railway not a roller coaster so it's more like railroad tycoon which is also an excellent game you have lots of modular pieces for you to build any shape you want then if you're making some kind of streaming tycoon game check out this one it's a really flashy stream setup you've got rgb everywhere several ring lights multiple cameras gamepads and tons more props looking at this it really makes me see how my own setup is so basic pretty much all i have is a microphone but it works just fine up next if you're in need of a giant pack with all kinds of objects look at this one it's a bundle of six packs all containing over 1600 objects so for 30 bucks that comes at about less than two cents per each unique object so if you need tons and tons of objects and this looks like a great pack or maybe you're making an anime game if so here's some characters features five characters very much in the standard anime style they definitely fit the part so if this is a style you're going for then these are great models for something commonly different here's some realistic ocean animals really high quality models this pack contains a dolphin a great white shark a squid sea turtle orca and a well very unique pack up next here's a bunch of low poly weapons these weapons have separate parts so they're ready for animations also all the parts are separated so you can easily recolor them it includes 44 weapons from pistols to rifles shotguns smgs and more also includes attachments like scopes and suppressors perhaps you're making a space game if so here's a giant spaceship really high quality super high poly count i quite like the design on this one lots of tiny things all over the ship definitely very futuristic for something more grounded and a bit strange here's an animal skeleton pack it's definitely a very weird pack maybe you could use these as some kind of skeleton enemies or maybe use it for some kind of archaeology simulator game then if you need an explosion here's a massive one it's a pack with a whole bunch of explosions all of them gorgeous really high quality and this pack is hrp only all right so those are my top 20 new assets on the unt s store for
