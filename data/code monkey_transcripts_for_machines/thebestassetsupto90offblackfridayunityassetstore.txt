this video is sponsored by unity hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and the biggest sale of the year has just started unity is black friday sale with tons of assets up to 90 off let's look at some of the highlights there's tons of interesting tools and some really gorgeous assets but on top of that this sale also has a really exciting feature called lightning deals every day and several times a day there are new deals they start off on a massive 90 discount and slowly the discount goes down as more and more people pick it up so if you get it quickly you get a massive discount the enlightening deals have already started i already managed to pick up this pack myself lots of high quality realistic weapons i refreshed it right away and got it at 95 off so just 25 bucks on the lightning deals page you can see the ones that are currently active and also the ones that are coming up you can look at the timers to see when that deal won't be at 90 off there's a new deal every three hours i will be posting some of them on the youtube community tab i will also be posting on twitter as well as on my mail list i've added an extra option so you can go to your research settings and opt into the sale email so if you want to make sure you don't miss those massive discounts follow me on any of those three places and i'll let you know when deals change and the sale itself has 500 of the best assets on sale so if there's a great asset you've been waiting for then chances are it's already discounted also one quick note on how the sale works if an asset is currently on sale that means that it's part of the regular sale and not the enlightening deal so that means that it's safe to pick it up you don't need to wait until the end of the sale to see if that asset will later on get a deeper discount on your lightning deal basically if it's already on a regular sale then it won't be on enlightening deal on the other hand if something is currently not discounted then there's a chance it won't be part of a future lightning deal with that said let's look at some highlights first up all the assets that i covered in my asset review series those are all excellent and they're all discounted there's the astar pathfinding project which i highly highly recommend it's a pathfinding system that is capable of adapting to pretty much any scenario i've used it myself in pretty much all of my steam games then the odin inspector this one is an excellent tool for making tools it's one of those things that if you take the time to learn it can greatly increase your productivity and the last one i reviewed was the curved orange acid if you want a really unique look for your game then that acid will surely help check out those review videos if you want to learn some more about those assets they're all excellent so if you're interested definitely get them while they're on sale also i'm currently working on some more asset review videos to look at some more interesting assets to see if they're worth it so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss out on those videos while the discounts are still active beyond that let's look at what's on sale if you are a regular viewer on this channel then there's tons of assets that i've used in several videos that are currently on sale i normally post links to the ads in the description so you can find them there if you're a fan of the low poly style like me then there's plenty of synthy assets on sale there's the battle royale pack with a really nice map tons of props weapons and everything there's also the heist pack great for any kind of heist game i've used both these packs in quite a lot of my videos another one really cool is the street racer pack tons of really awesome cars lots of props characters and everything if you want something more fantastical here's the fantasy kingdom pack this one is huge with over 2 000 objects 20 characters a dozen vehicles modular castle and houses and tons of modular weapons so pretty much if you like cinti style just check out their entire publisher page almost everything is on sale something else that is also low poly but not from cinti is this low poly ultimate pack this one is a massive bundle which i picked up myself a couple of sales ago it's very useful when you need some random assets i used a bunch of these in making my racing rts game with so many items included it was super easy to just use the search bar on the project files to find just about anything then for a really awesome destruction tool here is rayfire it's an extremely performant plugin that allows for infinite destruction of any 3d objects during runtime easily shoot explode or even blow objects with wind forces works on regular meshes but also on skin meshes so you could even slice characters kind of like in metal gear rising there's mountains of settings to play with so if you want some destruction in your game then this is perfect and if you have a game with destruction then you probably need to aim and shoot some weapons so here is final ik it's an excellent ik solver with tons of features the most obvious one would be applying it to your weapon in order to aim at the target perfectly whilst keeping all the arms correct you could also use it to correctly place your feet on the ground this developer has tons of videos on youtube both tutorials showing you how to use this tool as well as showcase videos showing what it can do then for a complete game template here is the top down engine this is a fully featured game template so just like the name says it contains all of the features you could possibly need in order to make any kind of top down game works in both 2d and 3d and it includes pretty much anything so character controller inventory system ai camera level parts and even multiplayer if you need to draw any kind of shapes then check out shapes it's an extremely performant extremely adaptable tool for drawing any kind of shape this is a vector graphics levering so you can zoom in and out as much as you want and it will always look great works for generating flat 2d shapes like some simple lines rectangle circles and so on but it also supports 3d shapes so spheres cues 3d lines and more i think this one is an excellent tool to have and if you learn how to use it it will be massively useful whenever you need to display pretty much anything then here's a tool that will certainly give your game a very unique look click sounds it uses voxels to sculpt objects in a way that works kind of like clay you can sculpt in the editor or even during runtime then for games with crafting check out this animation pack i picked this one up in a previous sale tons of really useful animations anything you can think of related to crafting so you have cutting down trees shoveling fishing picking up things and putting them down in total over 100 animations and for a pretty low price so if your game has crafting or gathering of any kind then this one is really useful for example the animation that i used in my squid game video for the characters banging on the walls that was from this pack it's a wall hammer animation just without a hammer next up if you're working on a card game and you want some super realistic physics here's a great asset it has tons of very positive reviews supports just about any vehicle setup so street truck drifting and more it's easy to use just drop a prefab and hit on play features a damaged system which also affects handling and it also includes audio effects everything from engine sounds to tire skid and body impacts then if you need some tuning effects check out this one all of these look great really nice and cartoony lots of smoke explosions hits glow spheres bullets and more and it even includes some emoji effects so if your game is full of color then this one is an excellent way to add that extra bit of polish something that always looks great is volumetric lighting and fog this asset does exactly that with tons of features you can easily change the density height tint quality and much more looks great and works in urp or maybe you're working on a fighting game if so here's a bundle with a ton of animations features multiple fighting styles tons of punches kicks jabs and blocks and naturally it's all humanoid animation so it works with any character perhaps you'd like to make a farming game if so then this one might be a great starting point it has tons of features everything you could possibly need it's got a player controller inventory and crafting system you can hunt you can fish farm for resources and then eat them and up next here's an excellent tool to really take your game's polish to the next level easily add tons of tiny effects that really change the entire feel of your game add some screen shake particles haptics lights and tons more it's got a custom editor so it's super simple to add any effect and iterate upon it to get your game feeling just right another recent video of mine was the squid game remake in there it was pretty crucial to highlight the players and for that i used this asset the highlight plus it's super easy to use and has tons of options to get the highlight working exactly as you want it then if you need some super highend realistic weapons check out this one really high quality all of them feature 4k textures includes 19 weapons and tools so you've got assault rifles smgs and shotguns but then also some more unique ones like a baseball bat flashlight and compass if you like to give a go at animating your characters while they talk this sense it seems great to do that you define the shape for each sound and it automatically lip syncs from the autofiles pretty interesting if you want some weird mesh effects take a look at this one you take any mesh you have and deform it in just about any way you want squeeze stretch warp and twist do anything you want with the 15 modifiers and stack them in any combination for a really awesome terrain tool here is gaia pro this is one of those assets that has been in constant development pretty much since unity has been around this tool helps you save time by easily letting you build massive worlds and look very natural you select your world size and biomes procedurally generate terrain based on the criteria you set you apply textures plants and rocks to your world set up lighting wind and water and easily optimize it to work on desktop or on mobile or maybe you just want a whole ton of visual effects here's a bunch of them lots of effects that can be easily applied to any mesh you've got lightning fire ice nature void and tons more so this one would be great for making your weapons or your character look really special or maybe you want some effects but in top down so this one would be great for any kind of strategy game they all look really excellent you've got basic explosions and then some really creative ones if you want to move your characters and have them interact with the world around them look into this asset it applies physical simulation onto your character so if you step over a rock or bang your head then the character acts accordingly the end result really makes it feel very satisfying just to move around if you're working on a cartoony game and you need a tune shader here's one works on all of the render pipelines looks really great you define how intense you want the shadows set up an outline and it even features refraction through glass eyes or liquids based on the video it looks straight out of an anime a while ago i made the third person shooter video when i needed the rifle animations for the final demo i grabbed the pack kind of like this one these are all humanoid animations so they work with any humanoid character and of course you can combine them with any rifleshaped weapon contains all of the animations you might need basic idle and shooting there's dying throwing grenade and even melee attacks if you need a giant ui pack check out this one it's always useful to have some ui packs for when you need them and this one is great it has a massive amount of icons buttons and sliders for just about everything and it's also in a nice clean art sound so this one would fit just about any game or even any nongame applications that you want to build features thousands of objects and 9 unique themes or maybe you need some textures so here's a massive pack over 600 unique textures in a nice and painted style it has everything you could possibly want so lots of things for floors and walls so dirt bricks and cliffs tons of wood and rock textures and even some weird crystals and patterns for something to help you populate your world with tons of vegetation check out vegetation studio pro it's designed to be an improvement on the standard terrain tree and vegetation system so it's spawned using a flexible set of rules which you can easily customize you can add mass to define where objects can be placed then define specific biomes it uses the job system and burst compiler so that makes it extremely efficient or maybe if you're working on a vr game then picking up an interaction asset like this one can be very useful it supports all of the unity compatible headsets so that's pretty much anything the quest rift index and so on what this does is it helps you easily do all the base things that you need to do in vr so it helps you handle grabbing and throwing objects interact with buttons levers door knobs smooth locomotion and teleport singlehanded and twohanded weapons climbing grappling tracking and lots more features then here's an interesting one if you're making a game kind of like civilization or hearts of iron it's a very
