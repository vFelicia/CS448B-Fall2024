hello and welcome I'm your code monkey okay so here let's analyze what I think will happen next also look at some answers on why this even happened then my advice on some changes that Unity could make and finally my advice to you going forward but first just the quick question in the title will ENT roll back these changes right now A lot of people are wondering if this truly is the platform or if there's a tiny chance for a reversal my quick answer is if you're waiting for a reversal then I would say don't wait if a phone reversal is the absolute only thing that would keep you in unity if so or simply if you film trust is damage Beyond repair then my simple advice is just move on to something else because personally I do not believe a big reversal is coming here are three reasons on why I think that now when I made the second video on this topic which was one day after the announcement and pretty much everything was on fire back then I generally believe there was a potential for a reversal considering the intensity of the backlash but given the recent updates where all they did was clarify what cuts as an insole and basically just to find some exceptions based on that it does seem like a reversal is really not coming at all at best they are willing to do do some compromises like we saw the exception on charity bundles demos and reinstalls but it generally does seem like they are really committed to going down this path basically since then the backlash has continued there's even a Twitter account tracking all these statements from all the various Studios who pretty much have just said they're not going to use int anymore basically the general consensus is there are devs there are in the middle of development and they won't keep using Unity to the end but most of them they feel that this is done irreparable harm and can no longer trust unity and will no longer use it in future projects so basically with that that's another reason why I don't think there will be a reversal basically a lot of people have already made up their minds and they won't quit UNT regardless of what happens so if you were to play Devil's Advocate and look at the Quant hard facts from minty side they basically got two options they can either revert this pricing or they can keep it now if they revert then those people who film this own situation has broken trust Beyond repair those will not return so they've still quit unity and of course by reverting the changes they obviously won't make any revenue from this thing whereas if they keep the new pricing then the have still quite TNT just the same but they do get extra Revenue perhaps the ones that say and pay the fee perhaps it won't be enough to offset the loss of all of these licenses so basically if you play that one's that there's really no benefit on them to go back so that's another reason why I really don't believe there won't be a reversal I think at this point they are really committed to going down this path no matter what and yet another reason is something that they actually themselves say on the various official posts they mentioned how these changes will not affect 90 of customers meaning they only impact the top 10 percent now unt's business is very top heavy they really only make money from a tiny handful of super huge devs those are devs that make things like engine impact and Marvel snap those are the ones that really make the money meaning that looking at all the posts on this Twitter account have gone through pretty much all of them and all I see are Indie devs the reality is unity's customers aren't really Indies like you or me it's the developers making the mega hits so in terms of backlash against these changes those aren't really the only ones that matter and I cannot find any public statements from those big developers although I assume there are some serious discussions happening behind all zores again at this point it really goes back to Simple Math if all of these developers quit but the likes of Marvel snap stays and happily pays the fee if so then it can actually be a net positive for them in terms of shortterm profits so again if you're hoping for a phone reversal I don't believe it won't happen now if you're curious as to why this fee even came to be why this idea was even thought of in the first place there's a great Twitter thread with tons and tons of infos by someone who was there in the very early stages of this discussion which apparently happened one year ago now I highly encourage you to read this home thread if you want to get an inside look on why all this happened basically the core idea is that UNT spends a ton of money making the engine relevant supporting tons of unique platforms that is certainly very expensive and for the most part UNT has not made a profit I believe they only went into the green for these last two quarters and with interest rates rising and investment dollars pretty much drying up they desperately need more Revenue they can't really go back in the red just like it says here 80 of users don't pay anything at all basically it's the ads business that runs the engine now most people see UNT as a game engine that does ads on the side but the business reality is actually on the exact opposite Unity is really in that company with an engine on the side so they desperately need to get more money but ads are based on how many games people play and how much advertisers pay meaning they don't have much control over that what they can directly control is indeed get more revenue from the engine side of the business by introducing as a ref share or just like we saw a per game fee so this is yet another reason why it really does not seem that they are unlikely to go back on this they desperately need to make the company profitable in any way now if they are truly committed to going down this path if a complete reversal is absolutely not in the cards then here are my suggestions for how to make pretty much the best of a bad situation also before I mention my suggestions here is the same disclaimer that I made in my very first video I am a steam pc solo Indie Dev so my suggestions are coming from that one very specific point of view I am not a mobile expert I am not a freetoplay expert so I do hope that Unity won't listen to my suggestions but I also hope that they won't consult experts in all the other areas of game development when deciding what specific changes to implement the industry tree is huge and changes that might be good for one sector might be terrible for another one Unity have mentioned how the spirit of this program is really for them to succeed when developers succeed they have mentioned how it's not their intention to bankrupt anyone but right now just based on these rules just based on this chart it is technically possible for a developer to go bankrupt basically if your Revenue per user is under the fee amount then you're pretty much on the path to bankruptcy or simply just the case that they're talking about revenue and not profit so if your profit margins are so small that you cannot afford the fee then once again you go down to bankruptcy back to this Twitter thread there's actually a nice graph over here with some nice math and this personally shows the problem with the Pern sound model here you can see how some examples of fee is actually pretty fair for example up here Pokemon go they would pay literally 0.1 percent their revenue I think anyone would call 0.1 percent to be perfectly reasonable and also we can see that it is much better when compared to a flight Revenue share model so for Pokemon go making 60k under the parent selfie they would pay 60 bucks whereas under unreal is five percent they would pay three grand so definitely a much better deal however while the view works fine for this one case which is heavily monetizing its users it absolutely completely fails on games like for example over here Among Us in this case the FIFA Among Us would be a whopping 55 or for an even worse result here is a hyper casual game called Bridge race and for this one the fee would actually be 180 now that is obviously completely insane if your fee is higher than your Revenue then you can obviously only end in bankruptcy and over here the following comments will point out exactly the same problem and basically the proposed solution is it would be individually negotiated with UNT so basically as things sent right now basically you would have to trust their intentions you would have to trust that they generally do not wish the bankrupt developers and you would also need to trust that if this scenario were to happen they would actually make an exception and help you not go bankrupt but right now obviously trust is something that UNT lacks so here's my very simple feedback on this issue if the intention is genuinely to merely make money when developers also make money and not bankrupt them if that truly and genuinely is the intention behind this fee then I believe believe that the rules should clearly reflect that meaning my suggestion would be just at a simple Revenue cap something like three percent or five percent so the fee would either be the parent selfie or the revenue royalty whichever one is most so in this example on Pokemon go would pay 60 bucks and then Among Us would pay four bucks again if the goal is indeed to only succeed when developers succeed then I believe that this very simple rule would make that call a reality while keeping developers safe from these insane edge cases now for some more feedback my suggestion regarding the issues with insounds on different devices again in Tia said it is not in the spirit that this program to overcharge the bumpers that's why they want back the fee on green songs and demos but they still confirm that it sounds on different devices those will be charged and the reason for that is because they don't want to track identity across devices that would pretty much break a ton of privacy laws I can understand how it's secondly impossible to track this over multiple devices without breaking those laws so my suggestion to solve this problem is very simple just allow developers to selfreport like for example just allow me to send you a screenshot of my sim stats and do the math based is on copy sold if there's a huge discrepancy between the selfreported numbers and the estimates then sure go ahead and dig deeper but most developers are going to be honest so I do not believe that selfreporting with only two tons of fraud so once again if it truly is your intention to not punish the bumpers if the problem with MultiDevice installs is simply privacy laws then this should be a very simple fix by doing the math based on copy sold and allowing developers to selfreport their stats using that it wouldn't allow developers like me to sell games on Steam and then allow those people to install the game on any advice they own like for example their PC and also on their steam deck without incurring extra fees and the selfreport feature with also some of the Privacy problems instead of trying to detect piracy which is essentially an impossible problem once again just allowed the film port to selfreport and do the math based on those numbers and not whatever method you have for the Technic piracy which again currently developers do not trust unity and so far UNT has responded to the privacy concerns with basically just trust them just trust their super magic algorithm whereas if you don't have selfreporting then there's really no trust needed the developer gives you their real numbers and math is based on that also just another simple suggestion apparently yunty personal now requires an internet connection for three days I don't know if this is new if this was already the case or it changed alongside this fee either way I really don't see why this needs to exist I assume it's to prevent some kind of abuse but I really have no idea on what exactly that abuse could be so maybe there's a good reason for it but I generally cannot see it so unless I'm missing something super important my suggestion would simply be just remove this requirement it's a free version this is for hobbies this is for people who are actually trying to learn making small games there's no reason to force them to have an internet connection and my final suggestion is not really mine but it's actually from Frey and several other people basically make the changes only apply to Unity 2024 and Beyond then also other people have expanded upon this and basically asked for a terms of service that is logged to a specific version that way technically Unity would be legally unable to make changes like this after the fact now while I think these changes would be great personally I really don't expect these to happen and the reason is based on the same analysis on why I don't think they want reverse course the entire Point behind this change is to get money from the likes of Pokemon go and gentian impact those games were launched years ago and they continued to live nowadays so if they were to modify the terms to make it so that the new fee is only applicable to Future games they would simply not get money from those games so that is why well I think this change would generally be great I really don't have much hope of it happening finally here's one very simple suggestion this chart over here really has one very nonsensical part and it's really this entire comment over here for ENT personal there is absolutely no reason why anyone would ever pay 20 cents per install the reason is because apparently the elements update instantly the second you change license so basically if you have a game and it has 200 000 installs and has made a hundred ninety thousand dollars then at that point you would just buy ENT Pro which instantly raised the limit to one mill so basically there's absolutely no logical reason why anyone would pay this fee based on this my very simple advice is just get rid of this entire side just add a revenue threshold on the free version pretty much like it was before if you make over a million dollars then you have to switch to Pro that's really it if you do that then you can completely cut down this column and nothing changes I believe that will really help simplify things since there's absolutely no reason why anyone would ever pay this one specific fee and now that I've given my feedback to Unity let me give you the viewer the unity developer my advice on what to do like I said taking the assumption that these changes are not going to reverse the fee is here to stay so with that assumption let's take some time to look at them as I said you can completely ignore the personal side that makes no sense if you get close to this you just get Unity Pro so let's just worry about this column this meltdown threshold now my advice to you is simply do the exact same thing that I did on the very first video on this topic basically just look at this chart analyze these rules carefully and calmly and decide what do you want to do next like I mentioned my own use case my games will never make a million dollars so my decision is simply I won't keep using Unity because for my specific use case I will never pay anything if your use case is also steam pc in the games if so then chances are you will never go over to this limit so you will never have to pay any fee now if your use case are free to play mobile games where you expect to only be able to monetize each user at under a dollar if so then I would definitely highly advise you against using Unity unless you somehow trust them enough to give you a special deal or yet another thing you can do is as many people I point out for some people the numbers don't matter at all for some people they don't care if the numbers are fair or unfair for some people what matters most is trust and they feel that ENT can never be trusted again if that's you then here my advice is you should probably quit Unity unless you feel there's some way they can regain your trust although again if the only way that they could regain your trust is to revert these changes then I really don't think this will happen and now let me also address some very valid points that people directed at me when I said that I won't keep using Unity because the fees do not apply to me most comments were saying something like okay so the fees right now don't affect you but tomorrow they couldn't lower the limit to a low amount which would affect you and my answer to that is yep that could definitely happen they could change the terms tomorrow and change them to something much much worse however personally I see that's really true of everything I'm right here on YouTube which is also a company that is known for changing crazy things that no one wanted technically I could wake up tomorrow and my channel would be completely demonetized or just outright deleted or another example seem could suddenly decide tomorrow to up their rate from 30 to 90 technically that could happen so personally for this argument I really don't find Productive to panic about all the bad things that definitely could happen instead for me I assume a look at the current reality and just adapt to it if tomorrow Unity changed these terms once more then I will once again read the new terms and come to a new decision that's also the exact same reason why personally I don't consider the trust factor in making my decision I've never really relied on trusting or distrusting Unity for me it is merely a tool it is a tool with certain capabilities and of course a certain cost if the capabilities or the cost changes then I will analyze new reality and once again adapt to it at the end of the day this is really your decision so make your decision on what engine you want to use based on whatever criteria you decide like I said in the previous two videos I'm not trying to change anyone's mind whether you stay or quit Unity either way that's fine by me all I can say is I generally wish you the best of luck in your game Dev Journey regardless of what engine you choose to use alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
