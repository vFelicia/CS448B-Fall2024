hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for march 2021. my goal with these videos is to highlight what can be done with the engine so you know the oil limit is really just your own imagination all these games are uniquely impressive and showcase the power of the engine in tons of different scenarios so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month there's also links in the description for each game those are affiliate links so if you use them it's the same price you and i'll also be supporting the channel alright so let's go starting off at number 10. here is team fight manager it's a simulation game where you are the coach of an esports team it's an interesting concept you manage the team you must manage the players and set them up for matches make the best choices with pick and ban by evaluating the champions and players it's a strategy game in that a smart strategy can make up for a lack of skills watch as the battle unfolds and hope that your players are good enough to win train your players grow your team improve their equipment and lead your team to become the best and win the world championship it's a very interesting concept and based on the number of very positive reviews it seems very well executed they also have an interesting model where they are selling dlcs that don't have any ingame content but instead are meant to work kind of like patreon where you can support the developers so it's an interesting approach essentially to go with a very small price for the base game and pretty much just hope that some people are generous enough to want to support the team it's an interesting model so i wonder if this strategy won't be successful next up here's one that caught my eye as soon as i saw it circuit superstars i really can't quite tell why i love the look of this one so much but i think it just looks great the colors feel very inviting with the whole game having this nice cartooning look it's a topdown racing game on seven unique racing circuits the main focus is on making the driving feel great it's been development for five years and the handling model is their pride and joy race with tons of unique vehicles across various motorsports including rallycross supertrucks gt racing and more prepare your pit's strategy keep track of tire degradation fuel consumption and engine wear also features online multiplayer with up to 11 players on competing for the top spot customize your driver with cars liveries helmets and victory celebrations this is a racing game built by racing fans for racing fans by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks then here's the game that finally had its full release after four years in early access airport ceo it's an airport management game and a very deep one at that you build the airport's infrastructure with everything from runways and taxis gates and aprons you construct terminals with checkin security restaurants and shops manage the business side of the airport by hiring employees and executives making deals with airline companies and making sure that ends meet by keeping an eye on budget and resources the passengers also have their unique personalities so it's up to you to make their experience great always ensure that everything runs smoothly so your passengers catch their flights on time it has over 4 000 positive reviews and most of them have hundreds of hours played so this is the kind of game that you can really get lost in one of my favorite games growing up was airline tycoon so i definitely need to check this one out next up here is a very good looking unique puzzle game maquette it takes you into a world where every building plant and object are simultaneously tiny and staggeringly huge objects essentially change their size depending on where you are so you can grab something huge push it far away and make it tiny this makes for some really interesting puzzles visually it looks great with a castlelike fantasy world and it promises a nice touching love story so if you're into that check this one out for some vr here is warplanes world war one fighters become a pilot during the great war experience aerial combat like never before in this captivating vr experience it features tons of options so if you want you can go for pure simulation or if you just want to have some fun you can go with a more rkd flight mode two campaigns with hundreds of missions set in the personal locations seasons and time of day fly with 18 unique planes everything from light scout planes to some giant bombers i must say that i still haven't tried any of these vr games with tons of automatic movement but there's more and more of them coming out every month so i'm guessing the issues with movement and acceleration have been solved definitely need to try it up next here is scrap knot it's a steampunk themed base building survival game explore the open world take care of your oxygen manage your farms and build your home you venture out into the world to explore and gather some resources bring them back into your base and just start building place down some walls floors doors set up a farming plot and start growing some food you need some power so place down some solar panels and some wind generators connect all the buildings to keep everything running smoothly and of course craft and upgrade your equipment to help you survive against enemies but if they're too strong then running away might just be the better option i think this is the first base building game that i've seen with the steampunk theme so that's certainly unique it just came out in early access but already has quite a bunch of very positive reviews if you're into roguelikes here is dandy ace it's an overthetop action game that follows a fabulous magician seeking to combine and use his magical cards fighting and looting his way to defeat the green eyed illusionist and free himself from a cursed mirror it certainly has a very unique style create your own builds and choose your own gameplay style by combining cards with more than a thousand possibilities features challenging but fair combat you try die and try again with some roguelike permanent upgrades that make your character stronger as you progress through the palace battle your way through bizarre creatures and outrageous bosses while building up your own arsenal of magic the palace is constantly changing it's up to you to survive whatever the game throws at you as you continue on your quest to defeat the final boss and escape the cursed mirror if you're into story heavy games here is the life and suffering of sir branti it's a narrative driven hardcore rpg set in a gritty world ruled by unrelenting gods every choice has a price and a consequence so will you become an inquisitor a judge or conspire against the world order fight for your life and find your own path it's already got over a thousand very positive reviews so if you're into narrative games then it seems like this is a good one then if you just want to chill out here is dwarf romantic i have no idea what the name means but it's a relaxing building strategy puzzle game it's one of those games with a simple concept executed perfectly with tons of polish you get tiles and place them on a hex grid different tiles have different things so some have houses others have a windmill some have quests and so on you continue expanding the world as the seasons change it certainly looks very unique and interestingly in the store page they make an effort to point out which features the game does not have so it does not have any forex strategy trading any resource management there is no combat or violence or any multiplayer it is very intentionally a company relaxing city builder very interesting concept so i might pick it up just to see if it really is that relaxing then at number one for my personal pick of the month here is endzone over on the part it just had its full release coming out of early access after one year of constant updates it's a very interesting city builder where you essentially rebuild after the nuclear apocalypse so that means you have to deal with radiation drought sandstorms and so on you need to build up your colony by giving your people homes to live in set up some supply chains together food and water and of course make sure nothing is contaminated the game features an endless survival mode but also some really unique very interesting scenarios for example in one of them your goal is to find all the seeds in the world another one you start with a completely broken settlement and need to rebuild it and so on if you're into city builders this is a very good one i've definitely enjoyed my time with it and i also made my very first how it's made video where i remake a specific system or mechanic from a game in that one i remade the soil moisture radiation system it's a really cool system and despite looking very complex it's actually quite simple so you could definitely add it to your own games with relative ease that video is a new format i'm trying out so if you haven't seen it yet go give it a watch and let me know what you think of the format
