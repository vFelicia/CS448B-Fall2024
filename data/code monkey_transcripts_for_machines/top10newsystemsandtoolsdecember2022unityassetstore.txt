hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and asks to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for December 22. this month was actually a bit difficult to pick 10 tools I guess it was because of Black Friday not many people wanted to launch new interesting Tunes during this time but still I found a handful of interesting ones this one is only selfpaid systems and tools in the last video I already covered the best three new assets and in the next one I'll be covering top ads and effects as always there's links to the US in the description and as a bonus you can use a coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also here's some excellent news D2 best bundles that I've ever seen that happened a couple of months ago they are back for the holidays there is an excellent tools bundle with all kinds of systems and tools so you've got an engine for making a topdown shooter a tool for setting up some light probes you can set up some weather effects set up some 2D lights a better UI and some really awesome fluid animations so lots of excellent tools on this one and then here is the excellent Earth bundle with tons of visuals and some interesting shaders this one has quite a lot of variety quite a lot of things for example here you have quimly this is an excellent cartoony Shader then a real nice Indie pack a whole bunch of music tons and tons of sound effects you've got some more Shader effects so to pixelize them which looks really interesting we've got some fantasy nature a realistic template a bunch of cute animals tons more animations a bunch of effects and a bunch more so if you've missed these two bundles when they first happened a few months ago then I highly highly recommend you give them a look with the insane 98 off discount the entire bundle is worth it just for a single tool or acid and of course esinte cell is also still happening so you feel like their pack included in that button only you can check out the sale to see everything they do alright so starting off with a nice first person Prototype game engine you just hit play and you already have a really nice character controller with all kinds of unique abilities so things like a hook shot won't run slide projectiles and a bunch more basically if you'd like to build a game similar to Denny's Carlson then this is a great way of quickly getting started it includes many scripts with lots of parameters you can tweak so if you have some kind of first person Parkour game idea then this can help you quickly prototype it next up if you'd like to do character customization here's a tool to do that this one is specifically built with the synthes in mind chances are you already own a bunch of those packs apparently you can just import the supported City packs and it automatically unloads them then you can easily customize tons of things on the characters to get near endless variation you can save the new prefab and easily use it just like you would use any other character so this one looks like a pretty nice tune if you already have tons of Cindy packs and you'll like to create some custom characters next up here is a look script basically it has some ik to help you make your character look where you want it to it works on top of your regular animations so you can Aim Shoot and reload it's also not just about weapons so it also works with hands for some kind of melee Focus game it's got a simple setup so if only one is to make your character then picking up this simultane can be quite helpful then here's an interesting one it's a tool for baking ambient illusion directly into your vertex data this film can be useful for low end devices where running ambient occlusion in real time would be too costly you just run this once you bake the AO directly into the mesh and you just use it at runtime since the effect is stored on the vertex data it won't depend on how many vertices your mesh has four low poly meshes this dev has another tool that does the same thing but makes the resolution onto a texturing set next up here's a fun interesting one it's a QR slash Barcode Scanner and Generator so you can easily generate some valid codes with whatever that you want then you can use the camera to easily scan them and get the data back so this could be fun if you have some sort of game idea that you want to exist both in the real world and in the virtual world so maybe a game where you can scan some physical objects to get some kind of bonus in the digital game so could be fun then here we have a 3D pathfinding tool one thing that is always tricky is handling 3D pathfinding for some flying enemies making pathfinding just in the floors is pretty easy but in the air it's a bit more complex for example the builtin Unity navmash does not support that it can only generate multiple levels on the floor whereas with this you can easily Define an entire 3D area as wonkable or rather flyable and it automatically generates all of the valid positions then you can just feed it a Target point and it calculates the path to get there in the entire 3D space so if you're having trouble with some flying enemies and pathfinding then maybe a tune like this one can be helpful next up if you want to add some more life to your shooting look at this Zone it helps you add Dynamic recoil to your weapons making it Dynamic can help make it feel a bit more natural than just repeating the same animation over and over again it makes a weapon Shake on shoot and keeps the hands in the same position so this one is another simple tool you can use to add a little bit of extra polish to your game then for something a bit more Niche here's the tool to convert from CSV onto a scriptable object this one does exactly what you expect you give it a CSV with whatever that you want and it automatically reads that data onto a scriptable object pretty simple and does examine what you want next for something a bit more interesting here is a noise generated tool you can play around with tons of parameters to generate some noise there's some like 20 noise types to choose from you can even stack multiple modules on top of one another to get some really interesting results and then when you have the final result that you're happy with you can easily generate the final texture either in grayscale or in phone color then you can use a texture in whatever way you want for example it could be a Terrain height map could be a wind map could be some dissolved noise and so on one example of this is the video where I cover the transition effect in Hades that one is a simple Shader just using a nice interesting texture so this is the kind of thing you could use for that and then here we have a tool for helping you manage multiple surface types you can play different sounds handle impacts on a per surface basis and a bunch more this one works pretty simple to add you just add a component choose the surface type and that's it alright so those are my top 10 new tones and systems on the unity s store for December 22
