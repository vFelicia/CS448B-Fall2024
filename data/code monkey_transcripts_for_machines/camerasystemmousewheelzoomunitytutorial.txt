hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to use the camera system we created previously and add the functionality to zoom in and out using the mouse wheel lets get served so we previously created our camera system and made it very easy to move and zoom around a position now in here I have the scene from the previous video where we implemented Mouse edge scroll I can move the camera with the keyboard and I'm moving the mouse to the edges of the screen okay let's go into our code here and in here we set up our camera fall position and we set a fixed value for our zoom let's change that for a variable so go up here and make a private float zoom and that's what we're going to send to our camera phone system now let's first start off by cleaning up our code here and put the movement and edge scrolling to their own functions so copy all this and create something called handle manual movement go down here private boy handle manual movement and we're going to paste this code and Farley Lloyd handle page scrolling and we're going to copy this code okay our code is much more clean right now so let's set up a private void handle zoom and we're going to call this in here so let's start off by modifying our zoom with keyboard buttons so in here if input got get king of Kiko dot keypad was so in here we're going to reduce our zoom the zoom is our orthographic size so the lower the size the more you are zoom then the bigger the size the more you are zoomed out so in order to zoom in let's reduce it by a zoom change a long times time down the time and let's set our zoom change amount in here and we're going to set it to let's say eighty per second and copy/paste the same thing for the keypad except we're going to increase okay let's see if we can now handle our zoom using the keyboard first of all let's set our default value so we don't immediately zoom in to zero so let's set the default to eighty and give it a shot okay so it is automatically going towards eighty and when I press to keep out pause it seems in keypad and it zooms out okay great now in here and let's validate our zoom values so let's do zoom equals method clam and we're going to clamp our zoom between let's say 40 Â°f and 250 F so we don't zoom too much in or too much out okay let's see if we are with invalid values so I can zoom in and there you go that's my maximum zoom in I can zoom out and that's my maximum zoom out okay great everything is working right now let's apply this same logic to the mouse wheel in order to access the mouse wheel we're going to use input dot mouse scroll Delta so in here before we validate our values let's test if input dot mouse scroll which is actually a vector2 but our mouse wheel is only moving vertically so we're going to use the Y if the Y is bigger than zero then we are going to zoom in and if it is less than zero then we are going to zoom out and since this will execute less times than our gate key which is called every frame whereas this one is only called when we're actually moving our wheel let's make the zoom change amount a bit more intense so let's multiply it by ten and see how it is I can zoom in and zoom out all right there you have it very simple to add mouse wheel zoom as always you can download the project files in utilities for free from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them ok see you next time
