hello and welcome I'm your code monkey recently I announced my upcoming steam game dinky Guardians it's a fun Solo or Coop game with some automation based building and some defense mechanics go ahead and add it to your wish list there's a link in the description in the announcement video I talked about the game and what are my hopes and goals for this project I try to be as transparent as possible so you can see exactly how I plan my own professional projects there were a bunch of interesting questions in the comments which I think are also helpful for Indie devs watching this channel questions on Where to get funding am I using AI what else am I using time management marketing logo pricing and a bunch more so here let me answer a bunch of those first off here is an interesting comment here parking app asks how much time a week do you plan to spend it's actually kind of funny how I used to be a fulltime Game Dev making games was my only occupation then over the past five years I devoted more and more time to this channel making videos tutorials and courses to the point where it's been three years since my last steam game so I did kind of the opposite of most people where you started doing it on the side before transitioning into full time so for this project like I mentioned the announcement video my challenge is making this game alongside making videos on the channel in terms of time management my current plan is roughly one week working on Game Dev and one week working on videos which honestly I think this is actually a good thing that makes this game Journey a bit more relatable to most viewers I assume most of you are hobbyists in the game devs meaning people who are doing Game Dev on the side and not full time so me building this game one week on and one week off is kind of similar to having a regular job and doing Game Dev on the weekends I hope that by watching me build this game slowly week by week won't be inspiring to those of you doing Game Dev on site next here young Lucas has an interesting question with regards to funding so are you applying for any government or state funds for your company this is an interesting option that a lot of Indie devs don't know about several countries have this kind of funding for art related projects and video games usually can apply the good news is you might get some funding the bad news is usually this involves a ton of bureaucracy I saw a great video on this topic a few months ago this video showcased the process and how for them it really turned out to be quite an nightmare so going for government funding is definitely tricky but it's good to know at least that that option exists now in my case here in Portugal I doubt that such a thing exists but even if it does thankfully I don't need it one of the things that I mentioned in my Game Dev Journey video is how one of the things that helped me the most in becoming a professional Indie Dev is simply the fact that I'm living in low class of Living Country over here in Portugal I can live pretty cheaply when I first moved out of my parents house I was living on my own for about 750 Euros per month that includes rent food and utilities my first team game Survivor Squad took about one year to develop which means in order to turn the profit I really just had to make about 8 Grand thankfully it made more than that on the first month alone so easily because that and because I generally don't really spend money on many things because that I've always had savings so I have only some fund my own games my sorry would definitely be quite a lot different if instead I lived in San Francisco and I required 10K a month just to get by and nowadays with this Channel with all my over 700 videos and courses this now profitable I was burning through my savings for the first three years of this channel but thankfully now these this is profitable so because of all of that thankfully I have no need for external funding but in case you do definitely go ahead and do some research if your government has some grants that might help you fund your games then here's a funny comment talking about how Chachi PT makes me really productive I don't know if this was intended as a joke or not but I actually did generally use chenchi PT to help me not like I covered in my church EBT video I did not use it for generating code I don't think that's a good use case for that too but I did use it to come up with name of the game I asked it to give me 20 cute sounding words for creatures and gave me a whole bunch of them then I'll look at the list and that's how I came up with name dinky Guardians so yep I'll definitely encourage you to see how you can use some AI in your Game Dev process personally I would not use it for generating code but I do find this very useful for some general brainstorming then over here AJ is asking about the art style of the game and what is the technical term for it any of this is indeed sound shading and specifically I am using the equivalent Shader which I picked up from the s store it has tons of options and looks perfect for the cartooning look that I'm only going for this is also how I'm handling the selection of the objects so as the player approaches an object the outline simply switches from black to white and that is simply just change the outline color on the Shader itself next over here we have sumanth asking pretty much how do you manage time I must say this is a pretty tricky one this is a topic that I'm only struggling with so I'm not sure I'm the right person to give advice on this in terms of General tips I would say consistency is more important than doing some Sprints so try doing just a tiny amount of Game Dev every single day rather than try to work nonstop for a few days straight remember that this is a lifelong journey so take your time and just focus on learning for some more practical tips I covered some of them in my work from home video what I covered there is pretty much still exactly what I do nowadays my two best tips are take breaks from work and work from a list those two things really helped me stay on track next here we have a nice question so are you going to upload a tutorial on this game one thing that people might not know about is the difference in the amount of work between me making something just by myself or making it as a stepbystep course or tutorial know basically for this game what you see in the announcement trailer was on built in roughly about two weeks however if I were to build all those systems as part of a stepbystep course it would have instead taken me probably something like 4 months it really is a huge difference it's a completely different scale so it really is pretty much impossible for me to make such an eternal whilst also working on the game however over the course of development I do plan to do some tutorials or at least some deep Dives on how some of these systems work so stay tuned for that and of course remember that Game Dev systems are very interchangeable meaning you don't need to see how I implemented for example the interaction system in this specific game you can go watch how I handle interactions in my free course the way that I'm doing it in this game is pretty much exactly the same it does a physics query to find the object in front and simply cause a function on an interface for the tower shooting the enemies it is the same fine Target logic that I also covered then the denkis are driven by a super basic state machine so many of the things that I'm using in this game I've already covered in separate videos on this channel next here is an interesting comment and see basically saying that they had a similar idea to mine This is actually a very important topic it only sends me to see comments from someone saying they had some idea but then they gave up because some other game made something similar the truth is that game development is extremely complex if two people have literally the exact same thought and even if they both start from the exact same design document if they both execute that idea I guarantee the final two games will be completely different building a complete game involves thousands or millions of tiny decisions and all of those add up to make up the final game so even if you start from the exact same starting point they won't diverge very quickly so if you have some idea for a cone game and you see someone else working on a similar idea don't let that stop you if you really want to turn that idea into reality then go for it the end result won't be very different next here is an extremely important comment and the guy asks what is the hook for dinky Guardians this is extremely important like I've mentioned previously nowadays if you want to find success you absolutely need to think about marketing from day one so my hope for dinky Guardians is this is a fun Coop action in game mixed with some automation elements and some Base building honestly I would say that is not the absolute best hook it is not something that sends out right away but that is why I made sure to include all those mechanics right in the beginning of the trailer that way it shows right away that it's not just yet another Coop game with nothing else different also I should say that the strength of your hook is directly proportional to the length of development the goal for this game is to build this in about 4 months and for such a short Dev cycle I'm okay with the enlisted seller hook but if I were planning on working on this game for the next three years then I would definitely want a much more impactful hook either way the advice to you is definitely identify your game hook identify why someone would play your game and not something else in my case the answer is basically if someone enjoyed playing overcooked and they want something similar to play with friends and they also enjoyed factorio then I think they will enjoy this game then here is a nice pregnant question from Lee so how do you make your own game logos the answer is that I used to do it myself which was always really difficult I'm really not an artist but nowadays I go on Fiverr and I find an artist that's how I got this stinky Garden logo also the one for turnover Liberation and kitchen chaos front of those I contracted and artists and I'm really happy with the results I think the cost was only about 70 bucks for each of them which is definitely very reasonable and definitely much better than anything I could have drawn by myself again going back to marketing your sim capsule is extremely important so do make sure you have a good looking load then here is a nice comment from maximka talking about wishlisting the game as a thank you let me take this time that yep you should definitely do this not just for my game but for any Dev you follow wish lists matter a ton so if there's a Dev you like or a game that looks interesting definitely go ahead and add it to your wishlist it might not seem like much but it generally does help this is something that also covered in the marketing video wish lists have a very strong correlation with sales numbers so if you want to help some developer go ahead and wishlist their game and right now let me ask you to wishlist thank you Gardens if you haven't already and my advice to you is if you're working on a game then go ahead and ask people to wishlist then also a second question on what models am I using for this I personally suck at 3D modeling I've learned the basics from filming a course quite a while ago but I still can only do some extremely basic stuff so for visuals yep I am absolutely using assets I will cover which ones I'm using in a future video and for those of you who are worried about using ads in your game I would point you to my video covering that question which is should you use assets or are people going to call your game an asset flip I did some research and base cancer is nope it does not matter all that players care about is that the game is good and fun to play so you use whatever assets you can find to bring your vision to life then here's a good one in the video I say that you should never price your games under 10 but here as David points out why do I say that if all of my games are under 10 and the answer is actually very simple it's because I only learned that after launching all those games so that and also the fact that the market changes basically nowadays it's really difficult to reach people and if you price your game at five dollars versus ten dollars then you really need to reach double number of people to get the same revenue and that is really difficult also nowadays there are tons of awesome games so the idea of pressing your game low so as to encourage some impulse purchases that really doesn't work very well nowadays there is also the issue with sales a lot of players only buy games on discount and they only pay attention to the discount percentage and not the actual value so a ton of players will really only buy your game at 50 off regardless if it's 50 of 10 or five dollars so in general based on a lot of research from people much smarter than me in that area the general consensus is you should not charge under 10 although at the same time that just general advice if you're working on your very first game and you have no experience then I would probably encourage you to focus on gaining experience with that project rather than focus on making money and specifically on pricing here's another comment Makoto points out how for a multiplayer game it can be helpful to price higher but also include an extra copy and Yep this is definitely what I'm thinking about although I do believe these kind of special pricing packages these ones need to be manually done by Valve so I'm not entirely sure if they do this for any developer but Yep this is definitely something that I'm planning to pursue just not sure if it's possible then craft bestie asks what about Split Screen Coop and this is something that I hope to do but I'm not entirely sure making it on in local coop shouldn't be too difficult but making it work with players that are online and some that are local making it mixed now that is quite a bit tricky so ideally yes but not entirely sure if it's possible alright so those are my answers to those questions hopefully it's somewhat helpful for you to hear how I think about all of these topics go ahead and add dinky Gardens to your wish list thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
