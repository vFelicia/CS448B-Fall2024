hi there this is a quick tip for how to create game objects so let's say you need to create a game object through code that you need to do something like play a sound you can simply do new game object and use it just like this however if you do it like this the game object will have a default name which will make it very difficult to find in your hierarchy so here as you can see I have ten game objects and they all have the exact same name so if I was trying to debug some error in my code it would be very difficult to find the game object that I'm looking for so whenever you do create a new game object always look at the second constructor which allows you to put a name and just like that each game object now has a unique name and we can easily find it in our scene something else you might want to do is create a game object with various components so again you could do it the normal way game object and then do game object that add component and that whatever you need and again this works perfectly fine but if we see on our game object you can see that we have a third constructor which allows us to specify the components that we want that game object to have so in here we can simply do and give the type of sprite renderer and a type of unit and just like that our game object won't be instantiated with these two components so it is all of our game objects now have the sprite renderer and the unit component and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
