hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights that were released in june 2021 this is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered on the best free new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it and in the next video i will be covering the top assets and effects let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the assets in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order also right now there's two awesome humble bundles about to end one with a massive amount of 2d art characters weapons backgrounds and tons and tons of icons and another bundle with a massive amount of music and sound effects both of them won really deep discounts i bought both of them myself they're ending very soon so check them out quickly those are also affiliate links so if you use them you get some awesome stuff and you help support the channel oh and as usual the asset store summer sale is continuing with new deals every week alright so let's go starting off with the sv anticheat now normally when someone asks me what they should do with regards to cheating i normally say just don't bother if someone wants to cheat in their own single player game then my approach is really just let them but if you really want to try to stop them then maybe pick up an asset like this one instead of trying to handle the security yourself this is a solution for encrypting the variables in ram so they are protected from scanners like cheat engine it's super easy to use all you really need to do is just replace the base types for one of these special types so instead of using a basic end you use a secure end also keep in mind this tool is for securing memory so this has nothing to do with multiplayer cheat prevention then if you need a low poly terrain tool here is a great one it just came out and it's already got tons of five star reviews it's got tons and tons of features easily creates some gorgeous looking massive low poly terrains it supports all of the render pipelines has support for the burst compiler and the job system so it's extremely fast with some instant realtime results also very performant so you can also use it in vr it's compatible with a bunch of other tools you might already have like the world streamer or the vegetation studio pro comes with a bunch of simple assets so some trees grass structures vehicles and so on it really is a massive very capable and very wellknown tomb so if you want to make some lowpoly terrains then check this one out then for something really interesting the magic light map switcher it's a tool for dynamically swapping out light maps and light probes in real time meaning that you can prebake some insanely high quality lighting and then change it during runtime to match some sort of time of day setting making a day night cycle is something i've been meaning to explore for quite a while and the biggest downside with what i had in mind was that the lighting had to be in real time but with something like this i can use some super high quality baked lighting instead of that so if you've ever wondered how do those triple a games have some gorgeous lighting with day night cycles and great performance well this is how they do it another really interesting package here a dodge character controller it's been quite a long time since i last touched dots i really want to get back into it but i haven't had the time it's great to see that dot is already advanced enough that some asset like this is possible although do keep in mind that dots is still in development so this package is in preview just like the official one but based on the positive reviews it does seem like it's very well made so if you want to explore some dots then maybe look into this one to see how it works if you're looking for a complete game pack here is the rpg island tycoon it's an idle dungeon game so your character is constantly moving as enemies get spawned you gain some gold and weapons as you defeat your enemies open up a bunch of chests and level up your character it's a complete game kit so it's perfect for learning you've gotten lots of features pretty much everything you would expect from this genre also has support for easily adding unity ads or ingame purchases for gems and coins check it out and build upon it if you want to interact with any object check out the universal interaction system it's a modular system that can convert any object into an interactable object easily add all kinds of interactions so you can carry an object you can grab and inspect them block a bunch of things with planks chairs and break them make a key lock system and so on a lot of it is made to work within the events so you can easily integrate it into your own games also includes integration with rayfire and the hq fps template if you want to know how your players are playing your game here is the heatmap inputs analyzer this is super useful especially during play testing so it keeps track of where your players click or touch and for how long so you can use it to see if your players are clicking on the wrong place in order to optimize and guide the player to the correct inputs play around with tons of parameters to get it working exactly as you need then generate some gorgeous high quality lighting with the upgen lighting urp asset it creates a more realistic lighting than defaults makes a more natural light especially in darker environments the videos showcase a pretty significant difference especially when you add some ray trace global illumination if you want your game somewhat even better then maybe look into this one this package is for urp but there's other ones for the builtin and hdrp as well then here's another interesting one to solve a problem that perhaps you don't even know about it's the continuous floating origin the issue is that floats are just numbers stored in memory and since your computer has limited memory that means that it has limited precision floats specifically need enough memory to keep both the main number and the decimals which means they are quite a bit more limited in range than ins so as you move further and further away from the origin things start to behave very weirdly if you've never built some massive games you might not have come across this problem well what this asset does is it keeps moving the origin so your floats don't have to turn into monumentally massive numbers specifically the origin is always on top of the player so the collisions happen right near the origin which means no jitter no glitches if you're working on a massive game then a solution like this one is definitely a must and up here is a graph system it's a tool for drawing all kinds of lines add some points anywhere and make some really nice curves change the color visual the online width and so on it seems like this would be a great tool for maybe a multiplayer strategy game for displaying the plan before the mission alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unity asset store for june 2021 there's links to all in the
