some sports cars a truck and a van they are easily customizable you can modify the colors the lights the blinkers there's two different visuals for each car one in perfect condition and one resin it's a really interesting visual style it's pretty much low poly but not too low poly i really like it or maybe you're looking for a nice forest here is a dense coniferous forest you've got a really good looking sample scene 17 unique plant variations 15 trees and 20 rocks textures are all in 4k resolution so really high end stuff all assets are also optimized with leds so this one would make a perfect starting point for a realistic survival game or if you're working on a superhero game here is a great animation pack you've got lots of flying jumping lasers massive punches and smashes it's a really great unique animation pack so if you ever wanted to make your own superman game then this is great for some effects here is a bunch of vhs and glitch effects if you're going for that retro look then this one is perfect make the screen with all kinds of glitches like an old tape or maybe add some roundness to the edges to simulate an oldschool glass display or maybe add some simple scan lights this one is a combo of two packs so alternatively you can also grab each asset individual then for some great massive mountains the mega mountain pack you've got some really high quality height maps all of them very detailed easily customize the visual add some snow on the peaks and some grass on the bottom you can easily merge multiple mountains to make one huge mountainscape ready for mobile and desktop and all render pipelines next up an excellent pack the amazing shaders bundle it includes the curved one package for curving your scene in all kinds of ways or making some round glows a really good looking the solved effect showcase your polygons with the wireframe shader make your scene super detailed with the advanced tessellation shader and render some translucent objects with subsurface scattering it's a really awesome massive fact for some general use case animations check out this interactions animations pack it includes 34 animations for humanoid characters of them with two versions both with root motion and inplace animations you've got tons of interactions with objects so things like climbing jumping letters you can pick up from the ground or pick up from a shelf a bunch more general animations like pointing laughing dancing and so on so it's pretty cheap and it's always great to have some more animations then if you want to add some rain to your game here is a realistic rain effect it's got 11 prefabs at different levels of detail and with different intensities you just drag and drop them to add them to your scene also includes a looping rain sound effect and it can be recolored by changing the vertex color so you could change this to red in order to simulate some blood drops or something like that then for some great citizen models they are cartoony but not the usual low poly style so it's pretty unique you've got tons of body parts and weapons swap them out and create any character you can think of or stick with the premade defaults so you've got a police firefighter soldier nurse cook and so on then here are some more gorgeous effects the stylized elements flashback features 16 different effects everything from some normal explosions to some wind vortexes some creepy acid explosions or just some light all of them looking really nice or maybe you're working on a game where you want to place down some traps check out this deadly dungeons pack it includes 30 high quality prebuilt traps along with particles and sound effects you can also build your own by combining multiple trap parts into your own unique traps beyond that you also have a whole bunch of security props a bunch of cameras touch pads alarms and so on really it's a very unique very inventive asset pack you can check out the interactive demo scene and read the documentation to get it started if all you want is just a single character but in super high detail check out this urban samurai i really love design on this one the mask with blue eyes a weird gun and a bunch of katanas really perfect if you're making something in the cyberpunk genre it's very modular so even though it's technically just one character you can really get some endless variation are you working on some sort of space strategy game then look at these gorgeous lowpoly planets they are really nice with a really cute art style you've got tons of variations to represent anything you want so you can make some barren planets some that are on fire some nice green and luscious you can add some rings add some stars some asteroids i could see a really good scifi trading or an empire building game made with this pack for something a bit more oldschool here's a bunch of cave sprites build some caves using all these sprites all in a nice front topdown perspective kind of like pokemon the zubat cave so if that's the style you're going for then here's a great pack if instead you're working on a steampunk theme check out this steampunk city you've got lots of gears everywhere a really cool car some clocks and some airships just grab the demo scene and easily play around it next up for an icon pack here is one contains over a hundred pixel art style icons includes four different frames so you've got metal gold wood and copper all of them in several sizes from really tiny to 256. then here's an interesting one a pack with some high quality electric motors from some very tiny dc motors to some massive industrial ones it's certainly a very niche pack but if you want some motors well there you go next up here is an interesting shader effect reveal the world in a really cool way maybe if your game involves living in two worlds at once this could be a great effect to add or maybe just use it to show some corruption spreading or something like that and if you want a ton of low poly props to build out some houses here is a great pack you can see on the screenshots just how much variety you can build a total of 480 unique objects also includes a bunch of prebuilt rooms in a house all of it using a single texture so it's extremely performant alright so those are my top 20 new assets on the unity asset store for june 2021 there's
