hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so here's some Unity news there's a pricing change it's a bit complex so there's already a ton of confusion and unanswered questions I'm going to try my best to answer them based on how I understand things basically the tldr is if you are an indie Dev like me making PCR console games then probably nothing is really changing in Mobile the math might be different I'm not familiar with mobile world so I really cannot comment on how this change affects mobile but for PC and console devs it slightly means no difference so here's the full announcement blog post basically starting from next year Unity will introduce a new Unity runtime fee that is based on game installs here it mentions the unity runtime several times basically the UNT runtime is what actually runs you in the game so you have the empty editor that is where you actually make your game then you make a build when you run that build executable that is the unity runtime basically this new fee won't apply when above the thresholds for both revenue and installs now this end over here this one is very important this is one of the main points of confusion so if he only applies if above the revenue in the last 12 months and above the lifetime game installs now one good news from all this is that there is no longer a limit on revenue or funding for using the free version so Unity personal will now be available for anyone regardless of how much revenue they make this is a really good thing because it means that if your game makes for example a million bucks you can still now stay within the free version whereas previously you could only use the free version up to a revenue or funding of 100K if you made more than that then you would need to get the empty plus and if you made more than 200k you would need to get Pro so then down here is the chart for what the fee actually is and how it applies basically you have the three tiers so if you have the unity personals that's the free version Unity Pro and then Enterprise then you've got the revenue thresholds these are all based on the last 12 months then if you have to install threshold so this is number of installs per lifetime then if the installs are above this amount and it's above this revenue on the last 12 months if so then this is the rate that is applied so for the free version when going above 200k installs after that it's 20 cents per install then UNT Pro you've got 15 cents and gets cheaper as you get more our installs and for emerging markets so countries like China India Brazil and so on for these you've got a lower end zone then there's also a fee reduction for using NT Services there's not much detail on this so I don't know how exactly the fee is reduced but apparently this fee goes down if you're using yinty gaming services or ENT level play so this is their ad mediation thing again I'm not very familiar with mobile and then the new services so just a bunch of tools just clarifying some things so all Unity plans won't get the empty centers this is their upcoming machine learning tool which allows you to run machine learning directly on the device this is related to the ml agents package that I covered quite a while ago then ENT personal will apparently get something called DNT asset manager I think this is pretty much just some cloud storage then you've got TNT devops this is related to Version Control and CI and CD and so on then build minutes for making builds in the cloud and so on and like it says here unity plus is being retired for new subscribers you can either drop down to the free version or somehow upgrade to Pro at the castle plus so basically all this this part is on pretty understandable the main confusion really comes over here from the VM chart now the reason as to why my analysis is that nothing is really changing for devs like me making PC and console games the reason for that is because these numbers are really made for mobile in Mobile getting 200k or a million installs that is really pretty standard whereas for a premium PCR console game selling 200 000 copies that is a Monumental Mega hit again keep in mind that I have no experience in Mobile so everything that I'm saying here is from the point of view of a PC on Console Dev I have no idea how reasonable this fee is in the mobile world but in the same world I think it helps to think of a concrete example so for example I talked a while ago about a game that was massively successful if you have a threeman team like the team that made battle pet remastered and you were to sell 3 million copies and make 35 million dollars if so then under the current terms you really only have to pay Unity 6K per year that's the cost of three prone licenses whereas for example Unreal Engine has a five percent fee on gross revenue above 1 million so on that same example if battlebed had been created using in real they would have to pay 1.7 million dollars instead of just 6K and then under these new Unity terms add 3 million copies sold instead of paying Unity just 6K they would instead pay 80 grand so definitely a very big increase but still pretty much a running error compared to the 35 5 million dollars in Revenue but that's also an example of a monumentally successful game for most Indies both engines really have excellent pricing for most cities both engines are completely free and the simple reason is that for most Indies making Steam games this pricing change really means no change since most Indies won't be way under all of these numbers I believe the stats are that 90 of games on scene never make more than 5K so this fee will not apply to something like 99.9 of Steam games for example I'm working on my own upcoming steam game within Guardians I really hope that the game will find success but to me success means just selling a thousand copies even if in my wildest dreams the game would be a huge hit and sell 10 000 copies that is still 190 000 under this current limit although in my case I actually have Unity Pro so in my case that would actually be 990 000 under the new limit so my general takeaway is if you are an indie Dev on the same scale as me then it's very unlikely you won't ever hit anywhere close to these thresholds again keep in mind I'm talking about in the context of Premium PC console games for mobile the math is very different now right away there's a ton of confusion on all this the fact that the fee is per install means there are a ton of possible and weird edge cases which are not really explained anywhere there's an official FAQ with a bunch of questions but there are certainly so many unanswered questions the official Forum thread already has hundreds of posts and lots of questions so here let me try to clarify some things although do keep in mind that I do not work for Unity I'm just a normal developer they use zinty just like you so what I'm going to say here is based on reading the blog post very carefully I do not have any extra secret knowledge now the main thing that people are confusing is the end it is actually highlighted up here in the text it says that only games that meet the following thresholds qualify for the fee so those that have above the revenue and above the lifetime in songs it is confusing because down here in the chart it is not clear that it is and on both of these conditions so some people think that this fee applies if you go above the revenue or above the install threshold that is not correct this one is an and meaning for example if you're using Unity personal then this fee will only apply if your game has two 200k in lifetime insults and over 200k in Revenue over the past 12 months a lot of the confusion in the forums is people asking what if I have an old game and someone in sales do I have to pay and the answer is you only have to pay if that old game has made over 200k in Revenue in the past 12 months if the game was super successful in the past but no longer in the present if the game goes under that Revenue threshold then you don't have to pay any fee regardless of how many insults another point of confusion is people asking if this applies to their entire studio and the answer to that is no this is on a per game basis everything on the blog post is referring to a game not a studio so for example if you have a huge hit and then the next game is a flop you don't have to pay any fee for that second game even if the huge hit is still bringing in over 200k per year then some people who are also confused thinking you would have to pay this fee per user per month meaning if the user plays your game for two months you would have to pay two fees and the answer is no the fee is per install again it looks confusing because the chapter over here mentions a standard monthly rate so it makes it seem like you have to pay 20 per instound per month that is not correct basically the monthly over here has to do with when you have to pay basically the invoice for the install cost is going to be invoiced on a monthly rate but this is not the monthly cost so every month it is going to check the revenue and in some count above the threshold meaning how many unique songs were added in the previous month and then use that to complete the invoice but again this amount per install is just once per user even if your user plays your game for next 10 years then some more confusion is related to the threshold some people were thinking that as soon as you hit the 200k install threshold then suddenly you have to pay 20 cents times 200k that is not correct if you are on the personal free license and your game generates above 200k in Revenue in the past 12 months and you sell 200 000 in one copy you pay just 20 cents the fee is per install above the threshold it is not for all of it another very important question is what about free demos nowadays making a free demo and participating in a Sim Festival is really important to finding success so for demos the answer is technically yes 3 demos do count but again the fee only happens if above the download and above the revenue threshold so for a free demo even if you get 200k demo downloads since it's free you won't have zero Revenue so it does not trigger the fee related to that some people were saying that eventually a demo won't become a paid game and for that I believe the answer is you simply make a project on the NT dashboard for the demo and then a separate project for the final game that way the demo downloads do not count for the final game then there were also a bunch of questions for which there seems to be no clear answer for example how are installs tracked if your game uses any online service like for example analytics or Cloud Diagnostics then that's on rate Track by default but what if you're not using any online service how exactly does that work the answer that I get from UNT is it will attempt a simple connection to the ENT servers and importantly I was told that if that connection fails it does not break the game so this change does not force your game to be online all the time that was my first question when I first heard this and with regards to that simple connection someone asked does this break any privacy and loss now for that I believe the answer is no because as far as I know the player ID that is generated that does not have any personally identifiable data I believe that one is just a random hash so I don't think it has issues with privacy but I'm not a lawyer so I definitely could be wrong about that related to that question is what about reading songs say your player installs the game then uninstalls it and plays it a year later is that two separate in sounds or just one like I said I believe there are tracking installs through the player ID which is stored in the registry now I'm actually not sure if uninstalling a steam game wipes a registry if it does then I believe that would count as two installs and if it doesn't then I believe it would just count as one install another question with no clear answer is what about piracy so if someone Parts your game and plays it does that count I believe the answer is those and sounds do indeed count although supposedly Unity has some fraud prevention algorithm that they're already using in their ads and they won't be using the same algorithm here although of course I have no idea how well that works or how much of a problem this will be and related to that what about simply malicious actors so what is someone makes a script to uninstall and reinstall your game constantly in that case I believe the answer is yes that would count so technically if your game is above the revenue threshold then technically this could be a big problem basically you have to trust that their fraud prevention algorithm is very good at detecting that so as you can see in lots of questions lots of confusion I hope I helped clarify at least some of these and hopefully the rest will become clear in the very near future but in general my main takeaway is just like I said in the beginning if you're an indepth like me especially a Sim or console Indie dev then there's really no change like I mentioned in my own example if by some miracle in my own game sells over a million copies I would gladly pay this new fee and if you want to help me make that Miracle a reality go ahead and add dinky Garden see your wishlist I'm hard at work to get the game ready for release early next month alright so I hope this quick news update was helpful thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
