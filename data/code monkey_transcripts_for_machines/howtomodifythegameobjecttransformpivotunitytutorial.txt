hello and welcome I'm your code Mohan in this video we're going to figure out how to set the transform pivot to a game object let's begin so here we are in an empty scene now if you're new to unity when the first things you'll need to learn is how to make a health bar so if you want to make it in the world rather than in the UI you won't learn the way to this place right which is first you create an empty game object and then you add these fright renderer component just like that drag the bar sprite and just like that you have something that looks like a health bar however now if you try to scale it you will notice that it scales from the middle so in here you would go into the scale and modify the X and yep there you go it is scaling from the middle so by trying to make it smaller it won't actually scale on both ends now a health bar is usually supposed to scale from right and left so this will not work for what we want to do and I mean here before we go further I should point out that if you're using sprites you can simply go into the health bar import settings and here you can set the sprite pivot so you could set it instead of being in the center set it on the left side click apply and as you can see now the origin of the game object which is right in there is on the left just like we said on the texture and we can now scan on lists normally so we can now move the X and works just like that however for now let's ignore this ability for the purposes of understanding how Unity deals with transforms between parents and children and the difference between local space and world space if you understand how transformers work you will be more capable of creating anything you want for example if you're using the white pixel trick that I normally use you can't modify the texture pivot without a lot of hassle so it pays to know how transformations work so let's reset this back to center and keep looking at how transforms work so essentially a game object will always be transformed from its center it doesn't matter what sprite it has or what box Collider is attached to it the transformations are always done from the origin of that game object so in order to essentially change the pivot you need to be tricky with how you position your child game objects so here in the hump bar example we want to go from right to left as it shrinks now in order to do that we can make this game object a child of another game object so let's set the scale back to 1 now let's create another empty game object let's place it on zero zero same thing for this one let's call this our health bar and let's call this our health bar sprite and then we make this one a child of our container game object right here the values that you see are the unlocking values so if I put the parent and let's say on 10 0 and we check out the inspector for the child it does say zero zero again this is the unload composition for this game object same thing with the scale and all the other so if I scale by to check out that one and it still says just one so let's reset this back to zero back to 1 and now if we modify the scale of the parent we still have exactly the same thing happening however by moving the child we can essentially change the pivot of the transformations when we transform the parent so in order to achieve our desired effect of scaling from right and left let's shift the inner bar sprite to the right now in here how much you shift won't depend on the scale in this case let's see the texture the texture is 512 of width and we're using 512 less pixels per unit so that means the actual size on our game engine is one unit so if the sprite is 1 unit and we shifted by 0.5 you can see that he pivot on the parent is exactly on the inlet side and now if we transform the parent let's go in here and modify this key under X and you can see that it does indeed scale from right to left so we positioned our inner sprite in such a way that we modified the transform pivot when we modify our parent now in order to make a completed healthbar let's add a background sprite behind it now we don't want the background to be scaled so let's duplicate the sprite however let's make it not a child of that game object so here we have the background using the same texture but tinted in dark we have set the sorting order for this one to be in zero and the sprite to be in ten so the sprite shows up on top and now we can put all of these elements inside a main container for the health bar and just like that we have all the elements that make up a helper now if we want to modify the size of the bar we can simply go into this bar game object and modify the scale and it does scale from right and left the background always keeps the same scale and the sprite get scaled accordingly so that's how you change a pivot in a transform it's all about being tricky with how you place your children compared to your parents now this works for scaling as you saw but it also works for every other transformation so for example let's say I wanted to make a clock so let's create a new sprite and here I'm going to use the white pixel so here is an image with a white pixel and I want to use this one as my clock hand so let's make it rectangular and now in here I want to rotate it so I'm going to move the rotation that said and I want to shift it like that and as you can see right now we have the exact same problem as previously we are rotating from the very center so let's solve this problem the same way we did with our health bar so here we have our comic and container inside we have the object that actually contains the sprite and only shift this object so that the pivot is on the left side so this one has a scale of 4 so we shifted by 2 and again just like with a health bar we now have our clock hand container and we can rotate it on these head and does indeed act like a clock hand so you can see how by modifying the pivot you can create anything you want now let's also look at a scenario where you want to stretch it texture to a certain distance so I want to show this texture going from zero zero all the way over to ten ten now one way we can do it is calculate the midpoint which in this case would be at five five and we rotate the texture to point it or again we can be tricky with how we calculate our pivots and put this just like the one before the container doesn't contain anything and we put it on zero zero and again we shift the bar sprite on the right so just like that so again we have the pivot on the left side and now if you want to hit 1010 we can simply rotate it down the Zed starting from that pivot and then we calculate this game needed and just like that instead of having to come late a mid point you just put it on the origin point it towards the target and scale it accordingly so again if you're working in 2d you can just change the pivot directly here on the texture import settings however in cases where you can't change the pivot or are the only with 3d objects it pays to know how the various positions phases work always remember that the inspector showcases the unlocking transforms and not equal ones so the inner one still says it's on five zero zero and on the parent it says that it's in there so if I shift the bar to the on the X I increase it you can see that phones that way so there you have it will learn how to modify the transform pivot of an object so we can scale and rotate objects just like we wanted as always you can download the project files any Tony's from in Tacoma key calm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them so swear from your videos and I'll see you next time
