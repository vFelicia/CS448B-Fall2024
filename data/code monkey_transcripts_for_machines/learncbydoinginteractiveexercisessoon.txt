hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey So lately I've been working on my upcoming C course my goal is for the video part of the course to be free kind of like my kitchen chos course and then have an optional paid version in a future video I'll talk about my specific plan to make free courses with optional paid versions and do so in a sustainable manner right now I'm still working on this one I've already fully written the beginner and the intermediate sections covering lots of things if I was just making a normal video course it would almost be done by now but I really wanted to make something special so I've been working on a really interesting companion project project to help you learn better basically the absolute best way to learn anything is to actually do something if you're an absolute beginner you don't learn much by just blindly watching a video you need to actually write code in order to learn and fully understand what the code is doing this is also why so many people get stuck in what they call tutorial Hill they just watch tons and tons of tutorial videos or courses but never actually do anything so they feel like they never graduate to being able to build their own projects so in order to help people truly learn lately I've been building some really interesting interactive exercises these basically ask you to to do something related to the lecture so the goal is watch the lecture learn everything from it and then actually put it into practice these exercises exist inside a Unity project and I basically built some really interesting editor Windows to handle all of it so on the top bar I can just go into the main window any here is pretty simple just a list of the various lectures and then for example let's say you watch a lecture on variables say you watch a lecture and pay very close attention then you come to this Unity project open up this main window and select this lecture on variables then there's a bunch of interesting things let's see the exercises and Yep this opens up the exercise window and now here we can see various exercise like let's say this one Define a speed variable so the goal with this one is to edit the script exercise. CS to declare a variable of type int with the name speed and assign the value five to it so now I can click on start exercise to start it and basically what this does is it adds a bunch of files that I prepared previously onto the project so now like the exercise says we need to edit this script so let's open it and following the goal we need to Define some kind of in variable but now in order to show another thing that I've also been building I'm actually going to intentionally write some bad code so I'm going to write int with capital so this is not going to work so int then let's call it speed equals 4 something like this okay so let's save this code and back into Unity any if down here is yet another window so this is the code monkey companion window and basically this window is listening to a bunch of errors that show up on the console and also has context of which exercise is active and using that I can show a much better window that should hopefully be a lot more explanatory than what you see over here in the console window since I've read literally thousand upon thousands of comments in all the videos that I've made for this channel because that I do know the common errors that beginners actually have so I can write some custom messages for some common errors that I know beginners do encounter so by looking at this message it should hopefully be more clear than the message over here in the console so did you accidentally type int or int instead of int remember how code is case sensitive so if a beginner made this mistake hopefully this should be clear so now let's go ahead and try replacing it with in and save and back into Unity wait for it compile and right now there's no error but the exerise is still in progress so still not done because like it says here we need to write the exercise exactly as it needs to as always in my course I always try to teach good practices and the best practice that beginners really need to learn is simply the fact that code has to be exact so over here I specifically made it to listen to an in type specifically made it listen to the speed name and specifically made to listen to the actual value so if the speed is not written examp like this like for example like I wrote here with capital S then this does not work and again on the competing window down here this one also shows a warning so again another message that should hopeful help you learn better then also these other buttons so there's one to show some kind of hint like I said these exercises are meant to be made after watching the lecture so for here I'm basically giving an end related to whatever I said in the lecture in this case this is a super basic exercise on the VAR bance lecture so this also super simple so here it's really just saying remember the syntax for how variables are declared and remember how code is case sensitive then for some reason no matter how hard I try I cannot complete the exercise if so I can always show the solution any up here it shows right away so the solution is this in speed equal 5 so now I can either do it myself or click on apply solution and this will actually apply the solution so the files over here in the project files these will be overwritten with ones that have the actual solution I made that so you can actually see the final solution before ending the exercise or alternatively you can just stop which is basically just going to delete these files from the folder over here let's just complete so over here the issue is just speed has to be equals to five let it compile and if there it is exercise completed all right awesome so we can complete the exercise and back into the list and we do see yep we have completed that exercise and we have these more left to do so I generally hope that this will help people learn better by actually doing things but this is also just one part of everything that I'm building so I'm building the exercise the companion window down here which is going to hopefully provide some much more helpful messages whenever there's an error or something that isn't quite right and then like we saw if we select the lecture over here there are two more types so there's an FAQ so these are the frequently asked questions so a bunch of questions again all related to that specific lecture so in this case the variables lecture so the goal is watch a lecture pay attention then come here and basically get a refresher on the various things so in this case what example is a variable a variable is basically a container for data so I highly encourage people after watching each lecture to come here and watch all the frequently asked questions and then of course there's also a really nice quiz so this one again some simple questions like what is the primary purpose of a variable in C so is the purpose to name a function to store data to execute commands or to create new data types and in this case yep a variable the goal the primary purpose is indeed to store data so yep that is correct and here is the answer with a bunch more detail so variables are containers for data and so on so with all of these windows with all this stuff I really hope that this C course will be really awesome for anyone who wants to learn and I'm going to cover topics from beginner to advance so no matter how much you know about C hopefully you will learn something with this course and with these tools I really do believe that you actually learn by doing rather than just plainly watching a course so this is why I'm putting so much work into building all this but also building all this obviously is a lot more work than just making the video so that is why I'm going to take a little bit longer to get everything done so it's still going to take a little bit but if you're interested you can go to the link in description to sign up and I'll let you know when the course is ready also on note for these windows as you might have seen these were actually built over here with UI Builder so I'm using the UI toolkit so right now I'm super busy working on the course but after I'm done when I get back to regular tutorials this is definitely going to be one topic that I want to cover I've been researching and learning how to use it in order to build all this and I've been pretty happy with just how useful this is UI to Kit is actually quite usable by now so definitely stay tuned for a tutorial on that sometime in the future and just a quick mention the assur is having the unity Awards asset sale for just two more days so if you need anything any tools any assets any kind of thing then definitely go ahead and check it out since these are all the assets that I've won awards pretty much all of these are awesome like for example just looking at this one I high recommend feel I high recommend text animator I use both of these in making my game dinking gardiens these are super awesome feel helps you make your game a lot more polished and text animator helps any kind of tax pop out and tons more really useful tools so if you need anything check it out to the link in the description and if you want to learn about any Unity tools or features and check out my ultimate unity overview this covers a mountain of stuff including many things you might not even know exist okay so now I got to get back to work on the C course still not sure when I'll be able to get it done but hopefully sometime within February I really hope this course with these interesting exercises and questions I really hope this will help people learn whether they're beginners or intermediates so definitely stay tuned for that all right thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
