hello and welcome I'm your code monkey min this video I'm going to give you five options so price you're any game let's begin so as you're making your game you will eventually have to decide how much to charge this can be a tricky thing to figure out so here are five tiers you can look into these tiers that are based on my experience as a PC game developer so they applied to selling your game on Steam or a console and aren't very applicable for mobile games number one free if you're just getting started then chances are your first game will not be very good experience is very important when making games so with your very first game which you should really value most of all is feedback look at it as a learning experience to improve your skills as a game developer so you can later start charging an actual price if you launch on Steam you won't get a bunch of people trying out your game and hopefully giving their feedback as user reviews try to analyze all the reviews to figure out what you did right and what could have been done better since it's free it means players will be more forgiving when giving their feedback keep that in mind and don't become overly confident if you do end up with a very high review score number two three to five dollars once you start charging everything becomes much more difficult just because it's a cheap price don't assume people will go easy on well some people will say it's great value if the game is good you won't also get comments from people saying it really should be free and on the free tier you don't need much to convince some people to give it a shot but in here even though it's cheap you still need a compelling game it needs to be unique enough to convince people to put down even if it's a very small amount so if you just make a basic loan or a simple platformer you won't find much success even if it is so cheap this is the perfect price point for experimentation since people won't be forgiving on the total amount of content what you do have in the game has to be good but you don't need to make dozens of hours of content so use this price point to try out mechanics that you would like to later use in a larger game number three ten to fifteen dollars at this price point it's supposed to be a good indie game you're competing with games like terraria or FTL which are ten dollars in here people expect a quality experience with at least ten hours worth of content so your game should be compelling enough to stack up against $10 competitors while offering something unique so it should be polished and mostly bug free all the menus should be clear and animated while the characters well designed an easy to control and the story or core mechanics extremely solid at this price point you also need a clear marketing strategy the three to five dollar price point lends itself to impulse purchases but in here that no longer happens you need to know your audience and set up your store page to convince people the game is worth the cost the good news is that this price point is perfect for a solo or small team if your game is good and you market it correctly you will be able to make enough money to pay for the cost of the game number four twenty plus dollars this is reserved for top tier indie games games at this level are usually made by teams and contain dozens or hundreds of hours of extremely good content in here you have games like super hot invisible ink the Banner Saga transistor and so on players expect the kind of quality that gets reviewed on sites like IGN your trailer should clearly display good production values it should have great art direction a lot of content and a very compelling concept marketing also has to be a thing you need people to hear about your game outside of Steam so games in this tier normally have adverts on sites like Rock Paper Shotgun number five free with microtransactions I'm adding this one last since it's extremely difficult to pause this is more of a valid price point for mobile games rather than steam it requires very careful balancing and mountains of players most people won't buy our micro transactions so you need to balance making the game great for the majority of free players but also offering compelling content for the paying players again this is very tricky to follow up correctly so I wouldn't recommend it and certainly not if you're making a game to release on Steam so there you have it five tiers to price your indie game as always these are just guidelines of what players expect at different price points there's no rule saying you can price your first game at $20 but you're unlikely to succeed also these guidelines depend on how unique your game is and in what January it's competing it in a proper general like platformers there won't be a lot of competition charging very little on the other hand if you target a very unique and very specific niche you can probably get away with charging more since there's my options if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
