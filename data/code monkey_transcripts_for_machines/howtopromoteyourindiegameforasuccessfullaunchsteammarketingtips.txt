as to how you can promote your indie game there are many ways to do marketing the most basic prerequisite is simply having a public steam page the most impactful thing in marketing is simply time the quicker you get your steam page up and running the more time you have to gather wishlist lists build up over time so the longer you have your page receiving wishlist the better then like i mentioned a while ago one of the main ones is youtube if you have the right kind of personality you can attempt the danny style with lots of funny clips and some extreme editing as for me i definitely do not have that kind of personality so that type of content would definitely not work for me but you can also do some more chill devlogs i made a video quite a while ago covering a bunch of devlogs like i mentioned themed matrix is a good one you also have flow studio that recently released a successful game you have lumber mill and devdog and many more feel free to check those out to see what style best fits you in your game also it doesn't have to be just devlogs maybe if you have a sandbox game you could make a channel with some funny clips or some weird unexpected things that happen in your game remember that the goal is attention so do whatever you can do that brings in the most intention another place you can do some marketing would be on twitter although in terms of results i believe this one is quite limited but still you should be making some gifts and perhaps one of them won't go viral then as you're making those gifts you can also post them on imager i think this one also has kind of lost its power nowadays but you might get lucky and make it go viral then of course you have reddit depending on what game you're making you can find a subreddit specific for the audience you're looking for for example there's a tycoon subreddit there's one for tournamentbased strategy or maybe you can even post in subreddits of other popular games similar to yours but do be careful with red rules some server edits are very strict about selfpromotion there's also ticktock personally i have not explored this one yet i'm not familiar with it but i did hear some indies are finding quite a lot of success then a tried and true method you have a mailing list just have a signup form on your website mention it whenever you mention your game and keep growing that list usually people who sign up to a mailing list are already preinterested so growing this one is very difficult but very powerful another technique a lot of people have used successfully is making a free prologue so kind of like making a free demo if you design the demo correctly and it leaves people wanting more then you will likely gather a nice amount of wishlist and related to that free prologue something more recent are the steam festivals i believe they have some rules on when you can submit but if you can definitely take advantage of it for example the game i mentioned a while ago lens island by floyd studio they benefited massively from participating in this team festival it's great for gathering tons and tons of wishlists even if those then convert less than the organic questions and of course you also have paid marketing this one will naturally depend on the funds you have available as well as the price of your game if you have a very cheap five dollar game it's pretty difficult to make paid marketing work but if your game is 15 or 20 dollars then at that point it becomes much more doable so those are just a bunch of ways you can do some marketing you might be thinking to yourself okay that sounds good but it's way too much work so again let me remind you that the alternative to doing no marketing is getting no sales so either you put in the work or you have a guaranteed failure sadly that's a reality whether you like it or not
