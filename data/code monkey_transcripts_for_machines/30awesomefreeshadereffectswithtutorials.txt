hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey super quick video just to tell you about something really cool Unity recently published a really awesome Shader sample set this is really generally great you've got 30 shaders examples for all kinds of effects for example there's one on how to do an angle mask so a common use case is to play something like snow only on the top side or how to make some really smooth noise in a very efficient manner you can learn how to dynamically generate some hexagons or some bricks you can learn how to use parallx in order to give depth to your materials or learn how to make some cell shaded lighting how to make some nice SM particles or how to do some really interesting really awesome interior mapping Shader all of these effects all of these are made in shadh so you can easily inspect to see how it all works and all the graphs have all excellent notes explaining exactly how all of it works I really love how all of this is explained and how this whole scene is set up you can just walk around this scene and learn about various features see how they look and learn how it all works under the hood now for me personally I am not a graphics or Shader expert so I've already learned a few things by going through this simple Shader graph really is a Tru magical tool if you learn how to use it properly you become capable of building so much awesome stuff this is a really awesome sample I'm very impressed with it I definitely do hope they do more of these samples in the future for all kinds of tools not just Shader graph Unity does listen to feedback so if you appreciate these awesome free samples definitely make your voice heard in forums in order to install this sample open up a project with unity version 22 LTS or Unity 6 then open up the package manager find the Shad graph package click on the samples Tab and install the feature examples now if you don't see feature examples if you don't see this then make sure you have the latest 22 LTS version for example right now over here I am using 22324 or make sure you're using the latest un6 version then inside you can just go inside the folders inside the scene folder and here you've got three different scenes for the three different random pipelines so in my case I'm using urp so I can just open up this one and yep here it is so again here are all the examples all of them perfectly annotated now they are split into 10 categories so there's one showing how to do all kinds of blending masks there's one for how to do custom interpolation one for how to do detail mapping how to do procedural patterns how to do UV projection how to do some more UV projection how to do vertex animation how to hand on particles use conditions to make branches and how to do some custom lighting this project also has this really nice custom editor window you can see over here on the drop down menu all of the various samples and you can select any of them and it automatically moves the camera to that object so for example let's begin by expecting one of the simplest ones so for example over here is the animated flag one this one use a Shader in order to make this little wind animation on this flag so we can first of all read this nice tutorial to see how it works so this example shows a simple method for making a flag that ripples in the wind and the effect really centers around the sign note which is what creates a Rippling motion so on the examples I have a nice little mini tutorial over here and then we can inspect the Shad itself so there's a nice button open the example Shader and Y here it is here is the animated flag Shader again and all of it beautifully ranged all of it looking really nice really neat also including a bunch of groups and a bunch of comments by the way if you know nothing about Shader graph you can watch my Basics video on it essentially this is a tool that lets you create shaders by using visual nodes instead of having to write code so the way this animated flag works is basically by taking the position of the object then the split node which takes the output position so this is a vector 3 takes it and just grabs the r and the g which in this case it really means the X and the Y it keeps those Statics and really only modifi is the Zen and the way it modifies that one is over here like it says using the sine wave so this is something that's constantly bouncing between 0o and one so using that and using a flag movement mask in order to make sure that it doesn't actually move the part that is connected to the flag pole it only moves the part that is further away so it use that mask use the sine wave recones the normals puts it all in the position and yep in the final result the flag does wave with wind or you can learn how to make an angle mask so this one like it says here the angle mask uses direction that a surface is facing in order to determine if The Mask should be black or white if it is pointing in direction of the given input Vector then the mask is white if it's pointing away the mask is black and using that in some multiplication with a texture this how you can have this so basically if we rotate this object then no matter what is the orientation the snow is always just on top then there's this one about UV interpolation I did not notice but apparently tiling and offsetting UVS can become quite costly especially when scrolling UVS on a fairly large object so apparently if you need to do some kind of scrolling to do some kind of interesting animations if so instead of using the usual telling in offset node instead of that apparently you can scroll them in the vertex stage and doing so the visual result is literally exactly the same so by toggling and untl this checkbox I literally see no difference but apparently if you untoggle it if you do it in the vertex stage Apparently that is much more efficient we learn how to do parallx mapping these are basically many techniques that attempt to add more detail to the shape of a surface than it's actually represented in the geometry on the surface so basically this one over here this is just a flat Cube so there's no actual geometry over there giving depth but if we look at it from the angle we can see it does look like it has some depth again this is all just shaded trickery so it makes it super fast this one also has three techniques so we can actually just go into the inspector and select use the normal only and yep that's what it looks like use parallx or use parallx occlusion so modifying all of those and yep they yield different results or the really complex effect that everyone always loves interior Cube mapping this is the one that was Wily used in the game SpiderMan and people thought that it was pretty much magic this is a really awesome way to add some depths to your models again with without including any custom geometry so look at how all those buildings all those rooms they look like they have actual geometry however in reality they don't this is really just a really nice Shader trick and of course if you want to learn just open up the example Shader so here it is a lot of things so something with exteriors Interiors talking about interior Cube mapping using a for now and so on and there's another Shad graph over here inside so double click any up here is a really complex Shader doing all kinds of things now really don't ask me to explain this like I said I am not a Shader expert so I would really need to spend some time inspecting this sample taking it all apart one by one piece by piece in order to really understand how all of this works which is exactly what you can do by yourself if you want to learn how to build something like this then the Shad graph is essentially the source code so you can just browse through this and learn how it all works so definitely go ahead and download this awesome free sample to learn how all of these awesome effects work and like I said Unity does listen to feedback I know some people don't think that's the case and in terms of leadership then yeah sometimes that might be the case especially before but I do know that the people that work on these samples and tools these people really do listen to your feedback so if you want them to do more samples kind of like this one definitely go ahead and tell them in forms then go download the sample and learn how all of it works also just another quick mention on this video I'm currently editing the free C intermediate course video stay tuned for that one coming out on Monday all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
