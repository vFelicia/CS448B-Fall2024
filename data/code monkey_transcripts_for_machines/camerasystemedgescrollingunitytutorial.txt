hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to use the camera system we created previously to move the camera when the mouse touches the edges of the screen well let's get sir so we previously created our camera system and made it very easy to move and zoom around a position so for the scene let's set up our camera to form a position that I will manually move with the keyboard and then later add movement with the mouse so let's go into my game or I have a reference to my cameraphone script so as you saw in the previous video we created a setup function inside that setup function we send it a func that returns a vector3 so in this case let's make a private vector3 to hold our camera follow position and this is what we're going to send to our camera home script and for our zoom let's just send a fixed value let's say a TF just a fixed zoom we don't want to touch that for now so on our private void update we want to test for keyboard input so we're going to do if input dot get king of T code w we're going to implement wise movement so if we press W we're going to increase our camera follow position Y we're going to increase it by a move around and go here float move amount and let's say 20 M + x time.deltatime so this code is frame rate and the pennant okay do the same thing for all the other keys okay so here is my keyboard input and we should now be able to control the camera using the keyboard let's go into our scene test it out there it is I can press W and moves up I can process moves down D moves right and a moves left okay let's actually increase the speed but you know the controls are working so we now have our camera following the vector three for our camera follow position and we're modifying that vector 3 using keyboard input so let's also modify that when the mouse touches the edges of the screen so on our update down here we're going to do a test based on our input mouse position and our screen dot width so in here if input dot Mouse position dot X if it is bigger than the screen dot width minus a edge size let's set up a edge size in here and let's say 10 pixels so if the mouse position that X is bigger than the width minus our edge size so if it is with within 10 pixels of the right side we're going to move it to the right so let's see here I am here's my mouse and when I moved to right when I get within 10 pixels it starts moving yep there it is okay let's increase our edge size a little bit and that's support for all the other edges so in here we have moving to the right now let's add moving to the left so that is if the X is less than the edge size then we move to the left then if input that Mouse position dot y if it is bigger than the screen dot height minus our edge size then we want to move up and if it is under the edge size and we want to move down okay so this is the edge to our right this is edge whato and edge down let's test it out Here I am I can still move it with the keyboard and now let's move the mouse and when I get to the edge there you go moving to the right stops moving up stops moving down stops and moving left and stops okay let's had a simple boolean to enable and disable edge scrolling so let's go up here and make a private bull edge sprawling and on our update let's enable it by pressing space so if input not yet key down of keycode space if we press space let's set our edge scrolling to the inverse of edge scrolling let's pop up a message displaying if it's enabled or disabled so let's go into our code monkey tony's using the CMD bug class which is always you can grab the code monkey utilities from unity code monkey comm so let's go make a text pop up on the mouse position and say edge scrolling and then + edge scrolling and in here we're only going to test this if we are edge from down here and there you go okay let's see if we can enable and disable by pressing space okay here I am I'm moving with a keyboard okay great I go to the side then it is currently disabled I hit space and I can move to the side move up down left right okay awesome I hit space again and it's disabled and there you have it we can Pan the camera normally with a keyboard or scroll by moving the mouse to the edges as always you can download the project files in utilities for free from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer okay see you next time you
