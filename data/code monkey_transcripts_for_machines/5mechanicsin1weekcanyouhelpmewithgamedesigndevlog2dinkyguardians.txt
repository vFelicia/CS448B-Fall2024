hello and welcome I'm your code monkey crafting machine resource spawn areas a janki y some awesome building capsules heat mechanic and a spawn manager so here's the progress that I made in my game this last week now as you can see this is a new format that I'm trying out so let me know what you think and stick around to the end where I will ask you some design questions that I currently don't have an answer to that's as soon as I finish writing the very first devlog I get back to work on the game as always see challenges combining working on the game and continuing to make regular videos but thankfully this past week things actually went quite well I was still busy with regular videos took some time to edit the previous devlog then I had to get the 22 LTS video done and I was also editing a really awesome video for next week but I did manage to work on the game for maybe about 4 days full time so I was able to do quite a bit of work I managed to implement quite a lot of these systems the game is definitely starting to take shape although right now I'm actually working against a prestrike deadline I've got to get a working build in the game ready by the 10th so that I can have the build reviewed by Steam and ready to go on live for the festival in case you don't know how Sim works the first time you upload a build you have to go through their manual review process basically so they can verify that the game works and has nothing malicious in it after the first manual build review then you can easily upload any new version without issue so that means I only need the nice polish demo done by the 19th but in order to have time to go through the review process I need to openload a working build at the latest by d10 so anyways if I keep working like this like I did this week then that should be doable on the last devlog I already had quite a lot of mechanics so now it was mostly just continuing to build upon it I already had all of these buildings and all these moving vehicles and container buildings once again thanks to the power fighting good clean code I was able to easily add tons more features really quickly first was the crafting mechanic which obviously the game has to have a crafting mechanic personally I love crafting in just about any game so of course I wanted to add it to my own game thankfully it's actually pretty easy crafting really just means inputs and outputs I actually made a video quite a long time ago on how to make a nice crafting system just like Minecraft that one is using strip mall objects so here I'm doing pretty much exactly the same thing the one big design question is do I use a container building for the input another one for the output or do I just toss the output item right in the air end up going with throwing the output item just because I think it's a bit more fun to watch the item as it flies away unfortunately like the recipe that was actually the tricky part or not necessarily tricky just very time consuming building the entire UI definitely took much longer than expected for some reason I thought I could quickly build out on the uis around the machine in about one hour but I was definitely deeply mistaken in reality it took more like six hours to get it all working one really tricky part was the UI for selecting which container building is linked now I want the game to have lots of Interlocking Systems so all the buildings are nicely separated the crafting requires an input but the crafting building doesn't come with that input so it's up to the player to construct a container building and then link them both together this way only buildings work very well with one another which makes the player have quite a bit more ownership over the world so I think that's fun I use render textures to show all of the nearby container buildings I also covered red detections in detail in a previous video it's a really awesome EMT tool you should definitely know about them but making the Y was really tricky I refactored the code for selecting the link container building about five times constantly writing and rewriting code which I guess this is a teaching moment so regardless of how experienced you are and I do have quite a lot of experience I still write and rewrite and refactor tons of code I definitely don't get it all working the first time so if you don't write your code perfectly the first time that's perfectly normal that's exactly what happens to everyone so anyways I wanted to be really well written since I knew and lots of buildings would use this same element now if you want to learn how to write Googling code then check out my free course in the multiplier expansion alternatively for more advanced level check out my turnbased strategy course which I just recently updated with the second free expansion anyways back to the game so the UI took quite a lot of work it's very janky I definitely need to remake this for the final demo but for now it's functional so that's good enough I can go up to any building and interact with it to open up the UI for that building and then I can modify the settings for that building by the way the way the interactions work is I'm using a real nice interface just like I covered in a nice NPCs video then the next step was handling the building now initially when I first saw it was why don't I do it just like I've done in pretty much all my games meaning just have some buttons at the bottom where I can select what building I want to construct and then just like to place it now that works very well for Mouse based games but this game is meant to be more controller friendly so I didn't really want a button overlay my solution is actually something that I'm very happy with I made some proper objects to hold essentially the building blueprint now for me I love dragon ball and I love the scifi capsules that Bulma makes just a tiny capsule then she throws around and the building is constructed so here I did pretty much exactly that I made some more objects these are regular carry objects so any object can carry them however they extend the base word modular class to add some more data for which building it is then I easily added the recipes for all these objects obviously none of the inputs are real right now they all just cost one green gem but they won't have a proper building cost now the next mechanic is a simple but very important one the game is meant to have lots of resources but obviously resources have different tiers the basic style resources should be eased together but then other hand leveling resources those should require some special attack together the solution that I came up with was to make a resource area which is where a resource exists in the world and then I Define how many of those resources are spawned natural so for things like basic apples which is the food that the dinkies eat for this I can just make them spawn constantly but then for purple gems which are a much more advanced resource for this one I made it so that nothing spawns constantly but the resource area is still there in order to get resources the player needs to Resource some kind of fracking machine which when placed on top of the resource spawn area it suddenly spawns some resource so this is another nice mechanic which works alongside all of the other regular machines now I've actually got a design question to ask you related to this mechanic but before that here's the last two mechanics that I worked on this week first is an extremely important mechanic which is the heat mechanic honestly I don't know if that's quite a good name for it I'll definitely have to think about the name a bit more but basically every game needs some sort of antagonist and in this case it's a zombies which want to eat the dinkies so I want a mechanic that will handle basically how the zombies are spawned I didn't want to have just a basic wave spawn timer that the player had no control over I wanted a bit more skill base and I also want to encourage the player to think carefully about how they set up all of their automation machines so my answer to that design problem is the heat mechanic which defines how many zoombies are spawned and how often and how the heat is calculated that one is based on loose objects in the world basically objects like the output for the mining machine these experience panlets the building capsules the heat manager simply Cycles through the entire map and counts up all of these objects these this mechanic is meant to encourage the players to make their colony nice and efficient rather than just Gathering resources NonStop and it also has a fun secondary benefit since it encourages the player to clean up the world it also actually helps in terms of performance since some of these loose objects these are own physics objects I also want this mechanic to be kind of selfcorrecting meaning kind of like Dynamic difficulty if the player is doing badly then it will essentially become easier so if the player has tons of objects all over the place then there won't be tons of zombies spawned and those will then overrun the player and eat all of the dinkies but then as that happens these zombies spawn a mountain intensity that one is based not just on the heat amount but also on the dinky Mount so as a zombie seat a bunch of dinkies and a bunch of objects then difficulty will essentially go down that way if the player messes up and is overrun it's not an immediate game over but it will destroy tons of the colony and at the same time make future waves much more easy so they can take their time to rebuild now the next mechanic that I worked on is the opposite of this one which is a dinky spawning I had a rough idea for what I wanted but I still need to sit down and think exactly what do I want I know that I want the dinkies to be based on houses the player builds some houses and then Dickies simply spawned from those houses so I refactored the house to have a list of dinkies all the dinkies that were spawned there there's unlimited dinky per each house then every x amount of time basically the dinky spawner goes through all the houses finds all the houses that still have a valid thank you position and simply spawns a brand new dinky so right now this is really just the bare bones design for this mechanic and then next week I want to flash this out quite a bit more speaking of next week here are some design questions that I'm thinking about that maybe you might help me answer as well as what I'm going to work on next week so first design question is related to the resource node spawn areas right now I'm just placing the game object in the editor but obviously the player needs to be able to see where these resource node areas are now the first obvious answer is some kind of overlay I've actually done that pretty much in every single one of my Sim games there's always some overlay to see some more data but just like what I mentioned with the UI that doesn't really seem to fit this game I really want this to be more controller based more worm based so right now I'm actually thinking something more like an item that the player can equip which then enables them to speed the spawn areas something like some kind of radar and then that actually leads me to the second design question which I also don't have an answer for which is if I give the player the ability to hold special items how exactly am I going to do that so do I do some kind of invisible infinite inventory that's one approach or do I keep the player holding the items just like they can right now carry some physical objects personally I really like the physicality of seeing the player holding the objects but obviously that limits the player to just holding one special item at a time now technically that design can be fun especially since the main goal only is for the game to be multiplayer so I do like the idea of having players work together as a team and each carrying a different item but at the same time that could also become more annoying than interesting yet another related design question is what am I going to do about combat now I'm thinking the player would be able to hold some kind of baseball bat or some kind of mini pistol to really take out the zombies but again do I go with an infinite invisible inventory or do I force a player to carry and drop the weapon like I said these are some questions that I'm thinking about still don't have a clear answer so let me know your thoughts on these design questions now here's what I'm planning to work on next week and some more design questions first of all I want to implement the power system right now the buildings they don't work for no cost I want power to have cost I'm thinking about making some kind of power object that the player can then feed into the machines then I want to implement the trash mechanic like I said the heat mechanic is all based on loose object so I want some way to destroy those objects and that's where the trash mechanic comes in basically the player won't be able to have some kind of building where they can input something and just destroy that object then I also want to work on tier 2 dinkies and crafting now thinking along the lines of something like Anno where some higher tier people require some more complex items then I also want to implement some more automation interactions this is another design question which is right now I like how the automation interactions work so I've got a mining machine tosses an item then the atom wherever picks it up and drops it on the container counter and then the moving vehicle moves it around those are good but at the same time all those machines pretty much just interact with one other machine I want a bit more complex interactions I want each machine to be able to work with a variety of others so the player can really Flex their creative muscles so I definitely need to think long and hard about that and then I want to implement the game and goal the idea right now is you repopulate this one with tons of keys and then basically construct a rocket to fly out into space and then colonize another world so I need to make the mechanic for defining the gong and then sort of record the gameplay to see if the world is safe so that the player can actually exit finally the most important thing that I really need to implement is actually an obvious one which is Implement networking right now the game is only single player but it's obviously meant to be multiplier it is meant to have both options and in order to make the belt for review I do need it to have working multiplayer I have no idea how complex this fast won't be I did really enjoy working with network for game objects that was surprisingly easy but still this could be quite difficult so perhaps next week this is actually all that I'll be able to do but still this week was very productive hopefully next week won't be the same so stay tuned for the next level now as you can see from this video I'm experimenting with a different sound for these Devon walks to hopefully make them a bit more interesting let me know in the comments if you like this style for more General devlogs I'll probably keep doing regular videos just without camera just a voice over whenever I do some kind of Deep dive like the one that I'm planning for the automation mechanics but for General levels I think this style might be better either way let me know in the comment alright so go ahead and thank you Gardens here wishlist thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
