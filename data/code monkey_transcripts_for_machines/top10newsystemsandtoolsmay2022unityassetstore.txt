exactly this in a super simple way you just drag and drop the script and it all works perfectly so if you don't want to bother with handling all the setup to get animation rigging working then this super simple tool looks like it's quite useful up next if you have some textures where you would like to make some tiny adjustments look at this tool it looks really easy to use you add all kinds of modifiers onto your textures and play around the settings there's tons of modifiers to change the texture in any way you can play around the saturation brightness contrast you can add a sharpen filter add a color overlay swap the inlet blur noise and tons more works both in the editor as well as during runtime so this looks like a useful tool if you want to handle all these customizations on the texture itself rather than through a shader really interesting then if you want a complete game kit here is an action adventure game so if you've been playing ellen ring and you'd like to give it a shot at making a game just like that then a nice kit like this one can be quite useful features a third person character with some melee combat you've got some enemies there are interactable doors chests and levers you can equip weapons and armor do some dodge rolls and manage stamina also features of course leveling up and some awesome boss fights so if this is the kind of game that you like to make then perhaps this kit can be useful in order to inspect it and see how it all works if your game has a nature theme then this procedural fine tune looks great it's all procedural so it can be applied to any surface of any mesh it looks very natural great colors on the leaves and flowers definitely a great tool to add that extra bit of polish to your game if it has any kind of forest or nature setting then an interesting tool for easily handling leaderboards in your game contains all of the features you could possibly want you can browse through user pages you can find a specific id you can highlight the chord player and much more all the data is stored in an easily usable json format and as such it can be easily connected with a remote api for any kind of online storage then for another complete game kit this one is all about making a factory game it looks very feature rich you can easily define custom items and recipes without ever needing to touch any code you can create new buildings producers processors and storage there are smart conveyor belts with tons of customization you can also split and merge them buildings can have multiple inputs and outputs and the whole thing works on a 3d world with elevation support it's also pretty cheap so if you'd like to learn how a game like this is made then you can get this inspect or alternatively you can also download the project files for the factory game that i made myself and look into that one then here's an interesting uv editor that is made exactly for the kind of low poly assets that i'll have to use as you know i use tons of cindy asks in my videos i love the style that they use being low poly means they use lots of flat colors and this simple tool lets you recolor any part of the mesh with a similar click it looks really simple to use you just click and modify the color of anything so if you like using low poly assets then having a tool like this one can be quite useful to get even more out of your assets up next is a simple tool for optimizing your scenes with a single click if you're having trouble with performance due to too many visual assets then a tone like this one can be harmful this tool uses several optimization techniques he uses mesh combining where it merges several meshes into one it handles layer based distance culling occlusion culling and tons more this one is by the same dev that built the gaia and gina terrain tool so you can be confident that it's a very well built tool then for a simple one just a weapon wheel generator it does exactly what you expect helps you generate a simple weapon wheel it's all dynamic so you have tons of parameters you can change to get the exact weapon wheel you want works with both mouse as well as gamepads and then if you like using player preps but you dislike the limitations it has negative like this one can be useful it's basically an extension on player preps adding more features like more data types for example the builtin player press doesn't support the boolean type you can also add encryption you can easily read and write directly in the editor without having to open up the registry so it's a simple tool for working with player perhaps and does exactly what you want alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the nts store for may 22. there's links to all in the description and as a bonus you
