for for oh it's not all right all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great Friday thanks for being here all right all right all right can you change timing for next time uh sure I'd like to try that although I got to be honest I still have a big issues with my voice in that my voice doesn't really work in the morning for some reason when I wake up my voice is all messed up I got to I got to go to the gym walk my dogs do something in order for my voice to work so yeah for me life stream in the morning doesn't quite work so that's why I always do it around this time which is pretty much afternoon around here so right now it's 445 p.m. around here so yeah that's uh I'd like to try it out should be uh a fun interesting experiment trying out doing a a live stream as soon as I wake up maybe about 6 a.m. that that could be fun but yeah I'm not sure my my voice would work for that s I'm learning Game Dev this year and I couldn't have made progress I have made without your VI oh that's awesome thank you hey I'm I'm glad my videos have helped you yeah that's awesome congrats and keep on learning all right okay so basically I got a little bit of work to do so I figured I might as well do some work on the live stream so I've got my my companion project for my C course and I've got a bunch of exercises and there are a bunch that are still missing the hint text and the completed text so that's basically the text that shows up when you need a hint with some kind of exercise and then the text that shows up when you finally complete it so yep got a write a bunch of this so that's pretty much what I'm going to do while also trying to answer some of your questions in chat as soon as I I can so yep that's pretty much the goal here all right make a t an attachment system similar to escape from tarov I'm not sure how if there's anything specific to escape from tarov but I did make a weapon attachment system so if you want you can go look at this one you can even download the project files and just use this one as is so I assume that I mean basically lets you uh Define multiple parts and then connect multiple Parts together in specific points so yeah if you have the right asset pack with all the assets all perfectly prepared it's actually relatively simple to make a system like that and if you have enough enough parts for your weapons you can actually get quite a lot of variety so that's actually something really awesome if you have the asset to do it so yeah so yeah I don't know if it's form Taro as something specific but if not then yeah for the basics that should probably work think about making a video on procedural generating one thing that I've always want to research I keep forgetting the name what's it called the thing where it falls down it it collapses into oh God what do you call it wave function collapse that's it that's the the one method that I've that I've seen about and studied about it a little bit but I'd like to really research it probably because it seems it's something really simple but also really awesome like you define a bunch of basic rules and basically just collapses each node into one specific State and when you do that to the entire grid to the entire world it generates something really awesome so yeah that is definitely a topic that has been on my todo list for a very long time so yeah hopefully one day hopefully uh make course on real engine uh not really I mean the reason why I can make courses teaching knowledge that I know is because it's knowledge that I do know because I've been using Unity for over 10 years I've made nine games with it so it's something that I'm very confident with my own knowledge that is why I feel confident enough to teach you whereas in real I've never used in real so yeah I'm definitely not the right person to teach about that uh okay so let me try doing this so let me first do the exercise and then write the hint right the complete the text and yep so on this one first of all I'm on lecture number five on the intermediate this is the lecture on properties oh do I have an exercise open yeah probably probably do it's probably not that one oh yeah he was still checking the other one okay want to ask do you think it's possible to create a game similar to Wipeout yes I mean I I have haven't played but isn't that the boat game if so then you could even just start from the the uh Unity boat attack demo so yeah I mean Unity made this this demo quite a long time ago which I which I believe is pretty close to that game so yep you can definitely just take this take this project as a base build upon it and build something like that so you got a bunch of boats a bunch of customization this project also has that really nice water Shader so yeah for making a game like that this would be a really great start Point antigravity Wipeout okay I'm not sure what that means but gravity gun that's fun I'd actually like to make that that that would be a a fun little uh prototype mechanic it would be pretty fun to do uh okay so let me try so on this exercise the goal is create a simple Auto Implement property uh string player name okay so here the goal is to Define that so that is pretty simple so let's go public uh uh actually don't remember if at this point oh yeah this is on the intermediate so I have thought about public and private okay so this meant to return string and call player name then has a get and a set yep that's it that's the property just like that love kitchen cars oh that's awesome so much for making all right yeah thanks so much for going through it I I hope you'll learn the lot from it that was a that was a fun one to work on soelling for properties found the property property is auto Implement so success all right so yeah this exercise is actually quite simple so let me go up there and now I just got to pretty much write the hint Tex okay so the hint remember the Syntax for how an auto implemented property is made how it has no specific code for the get and the set so basically this is the hint that shows up when you when you go through an exercise and you click on show hint basically it shows up that one cl show solution it shows that one click on apply solution and it applies that solution so yep that's pretty much it so basically just got to write a ton of this text for a ton of the things what is your favorite course you've made wow that's a really tricky question I have to say I mean right now my latest one C course I really love this one but I love this one specifically because all programming so it's really nice for that but at the same time I also really love the kitchen chaos course I love how how many people that course has helped I mean that is by far the most successful video on on my channel so I really love how how that course reached so many people and the comments have all been super positive then I also really love my turnbased strategy course that one was also really awesome I I love games like XCOM so being able to build that one from scratch step by step that was really awesome that was really cool so yeah sorry that's kind of that's kind of a a tough question to to answer because out of many of the courses that I that I've made for many different reasons between them so I can't really pick a favorite one uh okay so remember the Syntax for how automl property is made yep that's it no specific code completed so in this exercise you'll learn how to define how to define how to implement a auto or no implemented property how to define a is it a or N I never know that but yeah Define autom implemented property this a great way when you don't need any specific logic specific custom logic so basally Auto auto implemented properties really awesome really easy just to find the get in the set and yeah pretty much that that works although honestly for me personally I normally the only thing that I use this for is when I'm trying to make the Singleton pattern so I just Define some kind of instense with a public yet in a private set that's pretty much the only way the only time in which I use property this is actually really really interesting topic because I know a lot of people like to use them quite a lot but me personally I never like how the fact that properties uh look like uh look like variables but AC can like functions that's pretty much it how it simultaneously stores data although in reality it doesn't this one is just Auto implement but it kind of stores thata and at the same time runs some logic in order to get ins set that data so for me I find that needlessly confusing so that is why I personally I prefer having just basic field just basic variables and then having get and set functions I prefer that quite quite a bit more so yeah I use private set over protected because usually I only want to if I'm doing some kind of Singleton instance for that usually I want this class I don't want any extended class to be able to assign this I only want this one to set itself so yeah usually for that just go with private instead of protected huge fan of your channel nice I'm making a course about procedural animation in unity do you have any advice about how to do a good course because I'm new to this you mean how to make a course I mean my best advice is do it more than once that's that's pretty much the best basically for all the course that I've made what you see in the final video is basically after I've done the course about three times so the first time I first do a prototype just doing it by myself no camera no recording no nothing just do it by myself in order to figure out what is the rough structure of what I'm trying to build so that's a first time just a quick andary prototype getting all the elements then the second time I try to write start writing the actual course script and try to write okay step by step I'm going to do this this this and this and then after that after I've written the entire script then I go through the course the second time at that second time I'm trying to follow step by step and at the same time correcting all the all the steps in the script text and at the same time after I finish that one then the third time that is the actual time in which I finally press the record button start recording things and pretty much everything so yeah basically every course of mine that you see what you see in the final video is basically at least the third time that I'm I'm going through the entire thing so yeah that is my best advice don't don't assume that the first thing you record is going to be perfect because chances are it's really not going to be so yeah just get into the habit of doing it multiple times and oh crap I shouldn't do this um and yeah get in the habit of doing it multiple times and the more you do it the easier it becomes okay so let me just uh all right so yeah so this one is working it's done completed so the hint is done let's complete the exercise and move on to the next one okay now also got a nice cup of tea set of my usual water just trying to see if it helps my voice cuz for me my voice always gets messed up after about 1 hour so let's see if this one helps on this live stream so far I'm feeling pretty good I am banana okay all right nice comment uh okay so lecture on properties what's the next one where am I properties multidimensional Rays that's a fun thing okay so on this one the goal is Define and create a 2d array so Define a 2d array of inss with three of length on the First Dimension and four in the second dimension then set the value on index 02 to 56 return the array from the function okay let's do that one love from Portugal hey nice hey thanks for being here thank for free course yeah that's cool turn on making a farming game like Farmville actually I uh I don't remember did I make the uh cuz I I did do a quick farming game once yeah on this one when there was a really awesome Humble Bundle and I made some so if you want to see the rough idea for how I would build it that's it but yeah farming game is actually something that I've wanted to do for quite a while so where's the that's the RTS game the farming game yeah basically I would love to make a a basically complete tutorial SL mini course on how to make a game come like this it's actually relatively simple I mean if you know about interactions so for example if you watch my NPC interact video if you watch that with a little bit of setup you can build something pretty much similar to this it's actually not that difficult you just make a little grid set it up on the floor then check how to how to interact how to get the mouse position in order to find the point in the grid then you place some kind of prefab that prefab has some basic logic in order for the vegetable to grow and so on so yeah that is actually I don't know for some reason personally I like farming games I think they're they're pretty fun so yeah I'd love to do a more detailed detailed tutorial on making something like this that would be that would be interesting s daily routine video got the question what helps you stay motivated uh have you limited yourself to news and political events uh sort of I don't know I don't don't necessarily pay too much attention but I'm not sure though those two things are linked at least not in my not in my case I don't know I mean staying motivated it's always for me when when it comes to motivation the the phrase that always jumps to mind is selfdiscipline over motivation that's pretty much it because motivation I find it comes and go it's not really uh reliable to rely on that so basically for me I try not rely on that I try to have a list of things that I got to do and then just try to do them one by one going through like that so basically instead of relying on feeling like I because I mean to be honest doing live streams this is something that is still very unnatural to me so right now I am pretty much forcing myself to be here doing this live stream and the reason I'm forcing myself is because well I want to do it I want to be able to do it so yeah I I got to do it whether I feel like it or not I'm trying to force myself to try to gain this skill so that's kind of it so yeah in general I mean do something you like and that way it becomes a little bit easier to do it and then secondly just go do it just go do it I mean it sounds overly simplistic I wish I had some some better more practical actionable advice but yeah it's really uh that's the best I've got uh okay so let's do this one so Define and create an array with size 34 that I mentioned the top of the array probably not but say with number 56 Let's do an INT array this meant to be a twodimensional array so so 2D no I can't do int array 2D equals a new int array and it's meant to have size three and four and then on index 0 and two it is meant to have the number 56 then let's return the int array to D okay love from India hey nice thanks for being here uh okay so that should be the exercise so basally just defining an array of hint with three four so just a basic multidimensional array let's run test and see if it is working so it's calling it checking the First Dimension it is correct second one it is correct checking the value it is correct so everything is correct okay so that's the exercise now let's write the hint and the completed one so where is this this one that's on lecture 206 so that's this one right here Define a TOD array okay so uh remember the difference between multidimensional arrays and arrays of arrays uh create a 2d multidimensional array with the correct Dimension properties then access the index like in a normal array and set the new value so that should be a nice hint basically the usual problem that people have with multidimensional arrays is the fact that it's it's different between making a 2d array versus an array of arrays so that is always something that has to be uh done differently and then complete text here you learn how to define a multidimensional array this is a really useful data type when you have something like a grid you want to represent and remember how you can have as many dimensions as you want all right so over here show the hint yeah remember the difference between multidimensional and arrays of arrays and yep that should that should work okay nice so let's go complete the exercise that's cool can I make a tutorial about a Reload animation I'm I'm really not the best channel to talk about animation because I am not an animator animator and programmer those are two completely different things so yeah uh I'm pretty sure there are a bunch of nice channels on YouTube teaching about animation probably with blender if you find for blender animation tutorial I'm sure you will find a ton of stuff so yeah then when it comes to Unity the things are actually uh the logic is pretty simple you just Define some kind of trigger in order to play the animation to go from idle into reload just go into that one when the reload animation finishes go back into the animal animation so yeah in terms of logic implementing a Reload animation is pretty simple the complexity is really just actually making the animation so you need to be an animator for that and I am not the right person to to teach that okay so let's go on to the next one lecture on nested loops and it's all about write a basic nested Loop so write a basic nested Loop for the outer loop runs three times and the inner loop runs two times call the exercise validate function and passing the current I and J for every iteration of the inner loop okay so simple uh there's no mention of the type okay so like that should be simple is there any chance your current course coming to UD me any time nope not really because UD me has some very strict rules about courses with free versions so for example right now I publish the beginner uh version for free and that one is about 4 hours whereas UD me limits it to about an hour or 2 hours something like that so nope I I'm not allowed to do that yud me really does not like things that are both paid and free at the same time so nope sorry that's not a possibility okay so let's write the loops the outer loop should run three times and inner loop should run two times so 4 in I equals let's go what is it three three * I ++ and for in j j under is it two times j++ and then inside call the exercise validate function passing in inj okay I think that's pretty much it so let's see hope for a small challenge I'm already doing a challenge but sure uh sleeping time is it I guess it's the fun thing about different time zones it's for me right now it's afternoon but yeah on a different part of the world I'm sure it's sleeping time uh okay so yeah waiting for the function to call it got all the indexes iteration six 3 two yep so exercise completed successfully so basically this one is on teaching all about nested loops and how the loop time so this one is on uh 207 so let me find over here exercise 207 write the as Loop okay so for a hint you can use any Loop type but for this case a for Loop is probably the simplest uh be careful about how many times you run the outer and inner Loops yep that's pretty much it this one is pretty simple about how to do that so in this exercise you'll learn how to to make a nested Loop a loop within another loop and is this one before the uh yep okay so this is especially useful when working with two the arrays or arrays of arrays so you can cycle through every single element yep n and Loops nice try the new Unity 6000 it's kind of funny how how they Define that how they said the the version is version 6000 so that's going to be interesting I mean it's going to be fun in let's say four years when they get to Unity version 10 so it's going to be version 10,000 that's going to be funny but yeah I guess they have a bunch of a bunch of logic where it assumes that the version number has to have three or four digits so that's why they went to 6,000 instead of just six so that is going to be it's going to be it's going to be an interesting thing later on this year when they finally upgrade the version to Unity 6 and uh yeah that should be fun have a Goku mug yeah I do it's really nice where's my my camera hey it's pretty cool got this one got another one with Vegeta so yeah always always fun uh would you say it's worth it learn C outside of an engine to learn the skills further I made a 2d platform but feel I relied too much on the engine uh my question to you is what why do you feel you relied on the engine and why do you feel that is a negative thing that is that is kind of thing I mean usually when it comes to using an engine versus not using an engine that is really a question you have to ask yourself do you want to make a game or do you want to make a game engine cuz usually for most people you can't really do both at the same time you either focus on one or focus on the other make an engine or make game so so if you want to make games focus on making games use everything the engine has available to help you that's the entire Point behind an engine is to make game making super easy or uh as easy as it can be so yeah definitely use the tools at your disposal in order to make whatever game you're trying to make but of course if you're trying to do programming for fun as kind of a challenge then yeah maybe try making your own engine just for fun just learn about it but do know that in most cases unless you are super gifted chances are you probably can't make a game and nine at the same time uh let's go and complete the exercise let me just this is the window is a little bit odd why is it odd I don't know like this okay oh boy now I now I lost myself in the chat is there a chance of motion matching coming to Unity I'm not sure what is motion matching but just the other day I was doing my my uh top 10 new systems and tools uh list and I I saw one that was really interesting oh God yeah now now finding it would be quite tricky but uh oh God cuz yeah I saw one that looked really interesting one oh boy because I got a a ton of things so that makes it quite a bit tricky in order to find it so how was it is this one oh know it's called motion warping yeah this one seemed like a really fascinating very interesting asset so now cookies yes I accept cookies so yeah I don't know specifically what is motion matching what does it mean but yeah there's a bunch of there's a bunch of really impressive animation aets uh on the aaur that apparently are really good for combining multiple animations to do all kinds of things those are really interesting this is one thing that usually for me uh in terms of Animation I really just stick with the Bare Bones the absolute Basics so I've never touched really one of these complex animation controller type things but yeah that is definitely something that I I would love to do I mean I would love to one day do some kind of tutorial SL mini course on making a game kind of like Assassin's Creed so something very much focused on animations and lcking up different animations ling up animation for some kind of attack where you got an attacker and Defender ling up both of those so yeah that is one of the things that I very much would like to do someday because yeah because I do know there are tons of these assets so I I assume the reason why there are assets because it's usually really complicated to do but with these ass should be relatively simle to do so that should be pretty fun that's that allowed me to code and learn C at the same time oh really are you talking about one of those hot reload uh assets those are also really really nice really fun uh that is one of the one of the video topics that I would love to start doing again uh is pretty much doing more asset reviews because there are so many awesome so many useful assets on the store but so many of them are really tricky to to use so I really enjoy the the videos that I've made it's a visual script tool that converts to C oh that's interesting yeah converting from visual scri that was the goal behind bone 2.0 before it eventually got killed or something so yeah that was a that was an that was interesting how they were going for bone 2.0 in order to do some interesting things but apparently pulled back I haven't touched visual visual scripting in a while I wonder how much it has progressed in the past few months it should be interesting okay so to go on this exercise Implement a simple recursive function oh I got to say I really dislike recursion I really just like it but I do know that some people especially people who are into math really like recursion so that why I covered it I I have a lecture on recursion over here in my course but yeah personally I really dis like it always it always makes me more confused needlessly confused so yeah personally for me yeah I'm definitely not into recursion but y it is it is something I mean if you if you like it if you like math and recursion can definitely be a nice thing okay so let's make a recursive function so do I return void I think so cursive function now in order to call it multiple times let's just store an i variable okay now see that's the thing if I'm doing a a for Loop where I call this three times that's it's pretty simple I just write it automatically I don't even have to think about it but in order to do this I really got to think so okay let me think so if I is zero if so then I'm just going to return and if not then I'm going to call recursive function with I minus minus is this it I think that is it okay I think that is it so it pass in with three and if it is above that it goes I minus minus it passes in again okay so I think it's like this but again recursion always confus me I never know 100% if it is correct about proced M generation will be fun yep sure one day oh boy yep there you go I just messed it up stack Overflow uh why did I uh isn't oh boy recursion always always drives me crazy yeah why is it a stack overflow okay now I'm a little bit confused as to why this one throws a stack Overflow because it should be isn't the ey going down am I crazy so let's see it talk about how to do proper research and develop When developing mechanics uh I don't know play play similar games that have similar mechanics and if you're trying to talk about oh boy I think I just broke Unity that's not nice uh if you're talking about research um yeah definitely play similar games that have similar oh Jesus everything got messed up okay stop playing stop getting all messed up oh Jesus where's my I can't ah I can't find it now sorry I got to hide the characters just so I can move it go up there why is it on three is it always calling the oh crap that's not it that one uh yeah but basically for research just play similar games that have similar mechanics can you please not spam in chat I'm trying to do something trying to answer things so please uh uh anyway so yeah in order to do uh research mechanics yeah play similar games that have similar mechanics and then try to do that I know that doesn't make sense uh yeah basically play similar games that have similar mechanics and uh yeah then for making it try making it piece by piece so start making something really simple so if you want to do some kind of hook shock mechanic first figure out how do I find where am I hitting the the mouse position so first find that then find out okay how do I push the player towards that how do I make my character control do that then figure out okay what happens when the player touches that so really research comes from seeing all kinds of games that do similar mechanics and figuring out analyzing how those games Implement those mechanics and then how to actually develop them that comes from learning how to do things step by step trying to do all kinds of things uh oh is it because of that actually makes no since okay recursion really drives me crazy my brain isn't working yeah I think I might as might as well fix it but that doesn't that makes no sense yeah I think yeah actually never mind yeah now I know why why it makes no sense ah God damn it this is why I hit recursion because that's it doing I minus minus breaks doing I minus one this works cuz the issue is that it was decrementing the variable itself but it was decrementing like before it calls the function with the parameters or something oh boy yeah or doing I minus minus that is always oh boy so this is a live example of why oh no and now my Unity just broke so that's not nice oh boy yeah turns out if you have a stack Overflow amount of amount of messages in the console turns out everything break so yeah that is really not nice all right and why is my my overlay is also a bit strange isn't it I don't know it feels like sometimes messages show up and sometimes they don't let me just put that one like that uh all right so back in here am I back on the same place I think so that's not the Loop oh boy cuz now I broke my I broke my exercise thing but am I on the correct exercise scene I don't even know yeah turns out if Unity breaks in the middle that kind of messes things up so okay let me just where was I I was on one of these on right rightness and loop no simple recursion yeah cu the did it save okay it did save that so at least that that's good but yeah okay let me just TR Ling see if now it does work got Z iteration expect oh right because I forgot to actually call it so let me just exercise validate and yeah okay but yeah for some reason my I think my overlay might have died which is a bit annoying because now I can only see that messages on the side I got a iteration one two and three I hope that works so yeah all right how do I find if I'm doing clean coding or not I mean it starts by making an effort in order to write good clean code and then it comes from your own experience of being able to identify what is good code what is bad code and being able to uh as you learn that you'll learn quite a bit more on what is good code what is bad code so over time you become a lot better at being able to see code and being able to identify am I doing this right or should I do this some other way that would work quite a bit better so yeah that really comes with the experience it's possible to learn how to code things in unity the correct way without working at a studio sure yeah I mean you can definitely learn Unity you can learn all kinds of things just by yourself I mean nowadays the amount of information that you have available is really quite a massive amount so that is something that is really awesome uh so yeah although at the same time every studio is going to have different things different ways of working let me just change this because I think this was broken I don't know why uh but yeah every studio is going to have different things so regardless of how much you learn by yourself once you join some kind of Studio you're still going to need to oh boy now it's sprinting all the messages that's messed up uh yeah once you join the studio then you're going to have to adapt to whatever way they they work on that studio whatever things they do okay let me just okay so go so recursion is all about a function that calls itself so in order to define a limit you need to pass in all that data in the function parameters and and do some kind of empty return When you want the function to end when you want the function Conant to end yep and now the complete text so here you learn how to do simple recursion if you are a uh if you are more of a math person then doing recursion might be simpler than is my my overlay is all messed up might be similar than doing Loops although personally I find a lot more confusing so I only tend to to use Loops all right yep so recursion definitely a complex topic what is recursion recursion is when a function calls itself so it's basically what I've got over here I've got a recursive function and note how this function is calling itself and if it calls itself too many times it leads to a sack overflow which leads to a lot of messed up errors a lot of problems which as you saw eventually crashed my Unity so when working with recursion you got to be very careful about your end conditions like over here the mistake that I had was instead of doing IUS one I was doing IUS minus which in turn was apparently calling this function with the previous value of I and only updating the local variable after calling it so that is why this thing was all messed up and doing I minus one that does fix it so yep that is recursion and except by doing that it also messed up this uh this part of the can I modify it nope oh boy so that really messed things up oh no oh God okay oh no I just am I still alive is everything still working cuz yeah my overlay just crashed and I don't even know did the live stream go down did it go down okay no OBS seems to be working but yeah oh boy yeah so I got to let me just I got to fix out you are still alive okay thank you because yeah that really I don't know what happened with the uh live chat overlay because it's the first time that it's got really messed up to the point where it pretty much broke so I basally need to manually modify this one thing so what time is it like that all right so let me just modify this and see if I can get it working again so like this and today is that okay so let's see if like this the overl is working again okay I think it might be working again so I just need to make another build and hopefully it should be working uh right so why is this going into the oh right because I created The Nest Loop and then did that and then that happened okay so yeah the n and loop and the other one is hopefully now working so let me just start this up put it on this Monitor and hopefully like this it is working let me do a message myself and see if it shows up okay my message does show up okay so I still don't know what exactly went wrong but anyways it should be working now so that should be good okay so where was I I was on recursion so I did that one I did write the one on recursion simple recursion I did write the hint write the completed text so let's go into next one so the dictionary let's go onto this exercise okay how do you secure your data when when you are on social media I am not sure what you mean by secure your data I want to create similar Condy growth in a similar field are you talking about people copying things I mean usually you can't really uh uh prevent that so yeah I'm not entirely sure what you mean I mean technically right now anyone can take videos from my channel and publish them on their channel so technically there's really not much I I can do about that the only thing I can do that is be right here continue making content because if someone is copying me they can only do the content that I've already done so they can't do all the things that I'm going to do in the future so they can technically copy my content but they can't really copy my brain so yeah so yeah I'm not entirely sure what you mean by by that but yeah hey in and out thanks thanks for the Super Chat when was the last time you wrote A C program outside Unity do you like WPF I always forget what what that one stands for but uh it's actually been a while I mean I do I've written some what was the last thing that I did I remember when I was like looking to buy something I don't remember what I was going to buy but I basically wrote a program in order to scrape a uh a bunch of websites in order to find the price for some kind of item something like that so I did something where I had some kind of overlay that ran every time I open up my desktop it ran it would check the price for something and then give me a message if it was under something I don't remember what I used it for but it was yeah I don't remember but something like that and uh another one that I did really interesting a very long time ago that was uh like I don't know like seven years ago was I made a bunch of programs that would basically uh scrape the homepage of steam in order to find all the steam new releases and find out how many reviews they had in order to find what games were're finding success and coming out every day so again that was something that I made that run on every single uh every single time that I turned on my PC it would run that program and it would show me some kind of window Okay so yesterday uh these three games came out which had more than 10 reviews then I could click on them inspect them and so on so yeah there was a bunch of time in which I was really really focusing really hard on learning what exactly works on on seam what doesn't work and at that point I built that little program in order to help me research and that was actually surpris it was surprisingly easy to make and quite valuable in order to learn how seam Works what kinds of games were coming out so yeah that was actually pretty interesting but but yeah usually when I make things uh in C outside of unity usually when I make that I basically just make them super basic console apps usually I don't do anything with kind of uh visuals so it's been a very long time since I've used like Wind forms and stuff like that usually I just make the most usually when I do things outside of unity I just want some kind of logic to run automatically if I do want some visuals then I will probably use Unity as opposed to building something like wind form so yeah whether you want visual or not that's usually how I handle things okay okay so let me try doing this what was the goal of this exercise so the goal create dictionary of type resource type int and set goal to five with to 12 call exerise valid and pass in the dictionary okay so over here let's create a brand new dictionary so we want to create dictionary of type with the key resource type and the other one is meant to be an INT so uh this is going to be resource amount dictionary something like this so let's what that's not wait for frame that's strange um is that it just creating it oh no and then set gold to five and wood to 12 so over here let's go and set the on resource tye. gold set that one to five and for wood set that one to 12 then call the exercise validate and pass in the resource amount dictionary okay I think that is it I'm from India or my game development Mentor I'm 14 years old oh that's awesome that's really cool I mean I started learning programming by myself alone when I was 10 years old so yeah if you're starting at 14 you're starting really great really nice and young so yeah definitely take advantage of all the videos on YouTube on tutorials all the free course all the kind of things and yeah if you are active in your own Learning Journey that early then yeah by the time you're 1820 you're going to be very knowledgeable very successful so yeah I definitely wish you the best of luck continue on learning okay waiting for dictionary function was called gold does F5 wood does F12 and yep that is correctly successful so y that's the exercise on how to define a dictionary so let's do this one write the hint and text okay so for this one so so what's a good hint uh remember the Syntax for how to define a dictionary with key and uh value then remember how it dictionary is an object which needs to be constructed with new dictionary is an object needs to be constructed with new and in order to set uh values on certain Keys you access it like a array like an array yep that should be good enough in order to guide it I think the biggest barrier on my gim def career is Art yeah that is definitely the exact same thing for me as well so yeah that is why for me uh using the AET swur has been really awesome I definitely wish I had the AET swur back when I was a kid I mean because I was making games that were relatively ugly steam power.com uh all because I really could not draw anything so if I check out my first game my Survivor Squad visually it definitely looks very much subpar I mean to be honest I'm very proud of what I managed to achieve given my extremely limited art skills I'm really happy with the the inl characters I do think those came out quite nice I mean I drew all that myself which I mean for an artist this is not impressive but for myself yeah I'm definitely very happy with how I managed to build that but yeah look at how those those uh pieces of glass the glass itself is extremely simple the uh sentry guns I think they look really great but they are also extremely simple extremely basic they're the the weapons lights all the things and yeah basically this oh boy the hand for that little smoker Zombie thing yeah that was uh it's been a long time since I played it so yeah I definitely would like to play this game again CU it's been a a very long time since I tried doing that cuz yeah look at this I drew all this so I drew those little Beds which look very strange I drew the character I made the animation and uh yeah but I also you can obviously see how I drew those portraits by how super basic they are so yeah that that was the the extent the limit of my art skills at the time it was pretty much drawing it like this which is definitely extremely basic extremely simple look at that smoke so yeah basically when I made this back in 2013 back then I really wish I I had the knowledge to be able to use the accur cuz I could have just come down here in order to find all kinds of really awesome Sprites so I could just combine my programming knowledge with some really awesome Sprites and the game probably would have looked quite a lot better I mean I'm still happy with how it came out but it would have been quite look at this it's got a bunch of top down things and quick tip if you're making 2D games you can also just buy uh 3D assets These are 3D meaning you can place the camera anywhere so you can buy a 3D asset like this and if you're making a top down 2D game just take the camera move it upwards take a screenshot and boom you've got a really awesome 2D assets to use use in your top down game so yeah it's uh if you know how to use the asset swore thankfully nowadays lack of art skills is not an issue or it it is not an issue to the point of being limiting so if you if you know how to use it if you know the kind of game that you're going for even if you have no art skills you can still build something pretty awesome hey with that a nice cute custom character nice hey thanks for making that um and by the way for those of you who don't know you can customize your character so you can go you can draw a bunch of things just follow the instructions over here on this page you can download this image then you can draw on top of it you can draw whatever character you want in either way you want you can draw something as long as you draw on the correct points you can draw whatever you want and then you have then the character over here will look exactly like that uh okay so let me do where was I oh right he completed so in this exercise you learn how to create a a dictionary this is one of the most useful data structures you can use especially in games for things like inventories yep dictionaries are actually really awesome having a key value pair is something that is useful in so many scenarios it is really so very good so very nice reminds me of an era flash games were really fun great yeah flash really was awesome it's quite it's a shame how nothing like flash exists nowadays I mean of course you've got things like itch and so on but yeah flash was just it was a magical time you could just download Flash start making a simple game upload it on new grounds and boom 500 people a thousand people were playing your game giving you feedback that was really something magical something really awesome whereas nowadays technically you have itch you can put up any game but it's much trickier in order to get people to download your game or if you make it a web game then there's all kinds of limitations actually I haven't used webgl in in quite a long time maybe I should look into that one but yeah basically with flash there was pretty much no friction nothing go on to a web page downloads automatically you start playing right away you can play it you can give Fe give feedback do all kinds of things so yeah flesh was really awesome and how straightforward it was and how fast it was to both make games and get feedback for games that really I feel like the four years that I was five years that I was working on flash and I made 40 games with it those were really tiny games but the fact that I made so many and I got so much feedback out of it I feel like that really helped me improve my skills both as a game developer and a programmer so yeah I do think that was really part of the reason why I have the skills that I have today so yeah it's really such a shame that nowadays you can't really get something Exel like that you can do game jams which I guess I mean there are pros and cons there are a bunch of things that are much better nowadays than there were previously but yeah losing flash was really sadly quite a a negative thing create a stack and populated with strings so let's do a stack of type string so that's a string stack and let's do one why is this one constantly doing that do a stack of string and for my string stack let's push let's say the string code monkey and then let's say the string Iron Man just like that uh then what am I supposed to do oh I think I was supposed to actually let me see the exercise oh yep that was it Code Monkey Iron Man and then Black Widow push those in order so black wiow all right where's my where am I one my windows oh no it's there okay good I have me why can't I resize Unity interface really doesn't huh I I I'm sorry I have no idea I mean you go onto Unity preferences and in theory over here I don't don't even remember where it is UI scaling so in theory over here you should be able to modify it so don't you see this menu at all on Mac if not then yeah I wonder if it is possible or maybe Mac is just based on the desktop setting so maybe you have to go on the Mac desktop setting and modify that it seems strange that it wouldn't work at all especially because Max have so many resolutions so yeah sorry I don't know if you don't see this many if it doesn't work then yeah I really really don't know hey I love your videos hey I love you for watching them so yeah thanks for being here watching the videos hope you're having a great Friday okay so uh let's play and thanks again and out for the Super Chat all right checking the sa count three expected three so yep that is correct trying to pop it with black widow like expected Iron Man and Code Monkey so yep that is it that is how you handle a stack which is another interesting collection type one that I randomely use myself but if you do need to use some kind of stack of papers or things then stack can be quite nice uh so over here remember uh how a stack is created how it uses the stack type inside angle brackets brackets then remember how stack uh then remember the the functions to add add elements to a stack remember the function to add elements onto a stack which is not add which is not named add okay so here you learn how to create and work with a stack this can be a useful a structure when you need to uh always remember when you need a what is a stack the stack is uh I always remember I always forget it's a follow collection right first in last out that's it right because I push pop yeah it's a follow yeah uh yeah this can be a useful data structure when you need a follow collection first and last out so yep that is pretty much it you SX for generating a procedural path oh really oh that's actually interesting that's a nice use case yeah you can pretty much just push okay go here then here then here then here and yeah then you can reverse the stack and then pretty much just pop each individual stuff oh that's nice that's a that's a cool one that's that's a great use case nice okay let's complete the exercise like that when will you 6 be released as far as I know I believe they said by the end of this year so if I had to guess I would guess around the same time as uh the unite conference which I believe usually happens September October November so that is probably going to be so I would probably assume either shortly before that or EXA on that so by the end this year that's that's pretty much it then also an interesting comment what's your thoughts on Devon Ai and I actually have a very video exactly on that topic coming out later uh can I even yeah so definitely stay tuned for this video and right away by the title you can see what's my thoughts on Devon AI so yeah basically this is the video coming out what time is it 541 so in about 20 minutes yeah I'm going to end the live stream shortly before that so after that go ahead and watch just a quick video just because I saw some people were really scared about this AI thinking okay this is the end of programmers or software developers software Engineers all of this and the reality is really not quite like it it's really one of those things where the hype is really insane and reality is quite a bit different from the hype so uh basically the the premen and Theo made some really interesting videos on that so basically over here I just give my super quick take on it just don't worry about it but then definitely watch these videos in order to get more of a more detail on why exactly it isn't exactly like it seems on their marketing material so yeah definitely an interesting topic so yeah definitely stay tuned for this video coming out in about 20 minutes so let me quickly do a bunch more exercises uh so that I can do that okay so the stack I wrote this one let's go to the next one so that's the other collections function prams let's do this exercise is there a way to visualize the Audio Waves in a unity game just like in an audio editor huh that's a good question I don't know because I'm not very I'm not very experienced with audio but if you go onto the audio listener does it have maybe does have some kind of function in order to get that but I actually don't know get output data get Spectrum data maybe that maybe that could be it you're ready to populate with audio samples the channel to sample from and I have no idea what is an fft window see The Listener get output data get Spectrum okay but yeah it does seem like it is exactly that so I mean it's doing debug. line so I assume this is going to draw the spectrum of whatever the audio listener is trying to get so so yeah that's a very interesting question I've never tried making an audio visualizer but apparently with this function you can probably do something similar to that at least this code seems to be quite like that yeah that that would be a fun thing to build a little audio visualizer or you could also do all kinds of logic on that so if the audio really spikes maybe spawn an enemy some kind of monster some kind of thing so that could be a fun mechanic to work on in some kind of horror game that could be could be interesting okay let me do a few more so I don't got much time left so let's do this so this exercise write a function to add any numbers so write a function add numbers that has a params parameter for ins and Returns the total sum of all of them okay so that should be pretty simple so this one Returns the sum so int add numbers and now inside it I want to have an interray A A prams interray it's prams right this one is not the yeah it's on the function prams not the optional ones uh so numbers array and let me do an end for result starting off at zero return the result and then for each and number in the numbers array for each of this result equals the number number okay I think that should do it so if you have add numbers add the numbers results adds each of each of them so it should work let's see morning I just starred my son on your Unity class oh that's awesome that's cool somewhere things up he is at the animation steps oh I mean uh if it gets really messed up to the point where the project is broken you can download the I assume you're tell oh boy my voice is already messed up I assume you're talking about the kitchen cow course so if so on that one you can go on to the course website and you can download the project files for each specific thing so over here if you go on to Ah that's not the link that's the link uh over here on this one you've got all the lectures and on each of them you can download the project fils at that point so if things had messed up to the point where there's no coming back that's not that's not a problem just come here Download Project files and continue falling on from that but yeah yeah really awesome how you're going through with your son that's really cool continue doing that yeah all right looking at it did find it does have the prams corrector it calls it one two three and Y it is correct yep so that's how you make a function to add any number of numbers I guess okay so on this one let's write write the hint so the hint so uh the Syntax for using prams is like any other parameter type ex except it must be an array type in this case an array of int okay that should do it and for the adding logic just a simple for or for each Loop cycling through all the elements and adding them together uh let me just put four and for each like this is that I don't know uh so here you'll learn how to define a params parameter which allows a function to take take in any number of parameters which can be really useful when you have some logic that you want to work with any number of parameters that's cool so the params keyword which is actually surprisingly useful that's the add numbers and let's go and complete the exercise all people running around bottom yeah those are the people chatting right now so uh yeah basically it's working with the uh YouTube API so if you want to know how all the how this little overlay Works actually covered a bunch of tutorials at the bottom of this page so if you go on there yep if you want to figure out how to make this yep it's pretty simple it's basically a transparent un window this is running on top of my desktop then for the characters the way they are animated these are mesh based animations and the way it's talking with the YouTube API is by doing an htttp request from inside unity and then the characters the way they are randomized with all kinds of colors and shapes that's really the same system that I use in my game battle round Tycoon for making all kinds of characters love s streams oh nice streams will have to follow along for more all right that's cool yeah thanks for thanks for being here yeah I definitely would like to do live streams a a bit more regularly because it's um every time I do them I enjoy them it's always it's always nice chatting to people directly so yeah definitely something that I would like to do more often but as you can see from my voice I'm really not I'm really not the kind of person who can do live streams for long so it's been what about one hour and yeah my voice is already quite messed up so yeah I would like to do them more often so shorter but more often so pretty much just one hour live stream like two times a week I think that would be a fun little uh schedule that would be that would be fun okay so this exercise qual fun fun set a player but only passing the player name parameter something other than null and the player HTH something other than two okay so this one is the lecture on optional parameters and yeah so call the setup player function and the goal is passing the player name something other than null so let's pass in the player name so something other than null okay so I pass in that one and the player health so player Health something other than zero so like this so yeah in case you don't know this syntax this is how you can set up optional parameters you can call the parameters in any order as long as you specifically specify exactly what parameter name it is so use a parameter name then a colon and then whatever value you want to call so note how down here this function this one has all these parameters defined as optional parameters that is why they have the little equals these are optional parameters and they are defined like this so Vector three for the player position then the health and then the player name but if you use the name for the parameters if you use this then you can actually call the parameters out of order so that is why over here I'm calling the player name and then the player health and Y this is perfectly valid code so it should work like that let's go uh okay setup player has been called that one was left his defa that one was set that one was set yep success all right so that's really cool so that's a lecture on the the call optional parameters so the hint on this one remember the Syntax for calling optional parameters you uh write the parameter name then a colon then the value with this you can even call parameters out of order so that's fun so here you learn how to call optional parameters and how to call them out of ay new member nice uh and how to call them out of order this can be great uh sometimes for making the code more readable since you define since you define since you write the parameter name when calling the function all right good hey new member thank you so much yeah it's been a while since I saw this little popup here so yeah major blue 7 thank you so much much for becoming a channel member thanks thanks for all the work you put through your tutorials ah nice hey thanks Ricard yeah I'm glad people like the tutorials and as long as people like like the tutorials I will continue making them so yeah thanks for watching them I really hope the tutorials have helped you a lot and yep I do plan to continue doing this for many many years so yeah hopefully if you if you want to continue making games for a long time hopefully you can join me on this journey so we can all make games together for the next 50 years that's pretty much my goal so yeah if you want to join me definitely join me uh okay let's complete this exercise I never created the video on hfsm for player controller I don't know what you mean by that hierarchical state machine is that what you mean hierarch hierarchal finite State machine I assume that's what you mean I've used a bunch of sa machines but usually for me I use sa machines like the most basically basic thing possible so yeah for me I if you want to make a did uh the did he make I think he made a really awesome video IH heart Game Dev I think he made a really awesome video on state machine yeah there you go he made Nikki made a bunch of really awesome videos on pring Unity State machines making a better State machine so yeah if you want to learn about State machines like more complex seate machines definitely check out his videos videos are really awesome really really detailed really excellent editing I'm always amazed every time he he makes a brand new video it's always really excellent really nicely edited so yeah if you want some really complex State machines yeah there's this one from two years ago I don't remember how what is the differences between them but yeah definitely watch both them really awesome so if you want to dive really deep onto State machines I can definitely recommend these videos really awesome uh okay so where was I so the optional parameters I did finish that one okay let's see what time is it oh 54 because I got to make sure to finish the live stream by 6 PM otherwise it might mess up the actually I don't know if it cuz I think I did that once like I I published a video and then finished live stream afterwards and I think that really messed things up so that is why I didn't want things to be messed up right now but I don't know maybe I'll go for like five minutes more and then see what happens with the analytics I don't know let's see either way let's go on to the next one where was I value versus reference types another extremely important topic very important watching your kitchen chaos course and I'm almost done what can I do after copy all the games watch the C course create simple games I would definitely say that you can uh make some kind of simple game or build upon it in some way that that is what I would say so basically try to modify things and oh God what was the uh what did I title it uh my game better no oh crap I can't remember the title if I just search for kitchen cows might show up basically there was a developer who yep took my game and made some took the game from the uh kitchen caros course and basically bu upon it and made something completely different so yeah I would definitely encourage you to do something like this so pretty much take that as a base and build upon it do something so as you can see over here there's all kinds of new visuals all kinds of new items there's a bunch of a bunch of things that have new new uh there's a bunch of you know there's like cooking eggs there's uh there was tips from the from the customers the customers actually show up and so on so yeah but I would definitely encourage you to do something like that like the um uh yeah I would encourage you to continue building upon it I think that's the best way to do it just try to since you should be if you fully understood everything in the kitchen chaos course you should be very familiar with that code base so hopefully that should allow you in order to actually build things upon it in order to uh really modify things and figure out how things work when you modify them that's really what of the best ways to work so one of the best ways to learn is learn by doing so definitely make sure you modify some things to see what what happens what changes and the more modifications you make so if you were to make something like this so pretty much still the same genre so you use the same base but you build something very different on top of it doing that is a really great way a really great uh learning exercise that will definitely improve your skills quite a bit I think the member notification should be short yeah this one is it's basically manual so B it shows up here and yeah and sometimes there's another one there's another button to que but yeah thanks so much for becoming a member nice how can I get access to these exercise these are part of the uh premium version of the course so yeah if you have that you can download the companion project which is this entire project which contains all of this okay so let's do this exercise let's see what is the goal addit the second parameter on the function to what matches the score inside each object note what the modify score function does okay so this should be a simple one so basically there's a struct which is a valid type and a class which is a reference type and then constructing brand new uh struct brand new class and calling the function to modify that one just sets the score to that and basically in order to modify here is it going to be five the initial value or is it going to be 12 now in this case structs are value types meaning they are passed in as copies so if you modify a copy inside of it it is not going to modify it so over here this one is going to remain with five but classes these are reference types so it is going to modify just like that one and if you have no idea what I what I just said definitely watch my video on uh structs versus uh valid types versus reference types if you don't know what those two are you definitely need to learn them because those are really important things to know because if you don't know and you're working sometimes with something that is a copy you will go quite insane because you don't know why something isn't modifying the answer is because you're working with a copy as opposed to the original see validate 55 122 and yep that is a success so let's write the let's write the hint and the completed so completing remember the differences between value types and reference types how if you pass in a value type onto a function you pass in a copy so if you modify that value inside that function you are modifying the copy value and not the original value so that is the big difference between value types and reference types okay so here you learn the difference between value and reference types and how they behave very differently uh especially when pass then as a parameter onto a function yep just like that all right that was cool nice difference between functions and methods really uh the exact same thing technically in C the technical correct term is methods but I don't know I don't like the I don't like the word methods I don't know it feels strange so yeah for me I call them functions but in C technically a function is a method so yeah but it's really just a name thing if you tell anyone I wrote a c function they know exactly what you mean if you say I wrote a c method they also know what you mean so yeah really just different words that people use interchangeably video tutorial on importing 3D assets and maybe some sites where to get them for free or blender if you use it I did make a video just like that on or rather about animations rather than things B pretty much the same thing so if you want some free characters and free animations I highly recommend you look into mixo it's a really awesome website where you can get all kinds of free characters and animation I think you need to log in yeah okay uh but yeah you can get characters and animations so if you want something simple this is great if not then of course the asset stur I mean you can just go browse the asset stur so for example let's go into one of these menus disable this okay so the assur has 93,000 results and and now you can go over here into pricing put it on free assets and boom there you go you got almost 9,000 assets for free so you got free Sky boxes free uh 2D packs free 3D environments you got free tools you got more low poly acids some high resolution textures you've got some characters third person controllers a bunch of sounds sound effects more sky boxes more characters even a really nice CTI Studios asset which by the way uh just just in case you need some I said something that I mentioned on the on the other on the last video which oh it's already SI so I got to go see that one uh but yeah uh basically if you if you don't like Cy style then there's right now a really awesome bundle so for 25 bucks you can get tons of assets to do all kinds of things personally I really love this one I really every time I see this one makes me want to make a game kind of like 300 because there's one part right here that has some really awesome Spartans really flying around look at this uh right there look at that doesn't not look really awesome so yeah every time I see this pack makes me want to make some kind of already bought it hey I hope you put it to good use because this is it's a really awesome pack really tons of assets and there's a bunch of more stuff for zombies and so on so yeah basically if you want uh free stuff I would recommend you just go onto the UN accur and browse there's a m of free stuff and if you like low poly assets for 25 bucks there's an pretty excellent bundle uh I already have pretty much most of these but if I didn't have yeah I would definitely be picking this up and doing all kinds of prototypes in all of these interesting actually a while ago I we were talking about someone asked about a farming game so yeah this is when there was another bundle this was I don't know like two years ago 22 so yeah two years ago so when this happened I took a bundle like that and I made a bunch of interesting videos so I made an interesting uh RTS using a SciFi pack I made a nice farming Mini game with a farming pack and made a nice Taxi Driver game using the city pack so yeah definitely you can pick up that bundle and then you can watch that video to see all the kinds of things you can build with it so yeah it's a if you want to build some fun prototypes this weekend then yeah hey that sounds like a a great way to use your weekend okay let me just do this okay create a struck let's do one or two more and then yeah I got to got to stop talking for a little bit because my voice already Prem messed up okay create a struct so the goal is to find a struct named World position with in X and Y Fields then Define a field of that type on start create an object of that type with X1 Y2 and assign it to the field okay so let's do exactly that so first Define a struct that is pretty simple so a public struct named World position and now inside it I want a public int X and a public int y why okay then Define a field of this type so World position World position and now over here let's create a brand new object and let's assign it the x = 1 and y = 2 yep exact just like that let C use them to make a bunker idea for a game oh that's cool what something like fallout shelter that is a that is a game that I've seen many times and I've wanted to play many times but I still haven't haven't been able to do it but yeah I would love to make a game kind of like Fallout charish so something where it's a side view seeing all kinds of bunkers all kinds of things and being able to uh interact and do all kinds of management and all the things that is a I think that is a fun gen so yeah that's definitely a game that I would like to make that would be would be a fun one okay so Define a struck Define a field and assign it create it like that yep drink ginger tea with honey I've been trying oh okay okay I just messed myself up I didn't know this still had liquid oh boy okay that that wasn't intended oh crap all right anyways doesn't matter uh yeah I've been trying all kinds of te's but honestly it doesn't really help like I drink tea and my voice still gets messed up after one hour of talking so I don't know if that just means that I just need to pretty much train my voice a little bit more I don't know but uh yeah for me whatever I do it does not seem to work um anyways okay let's head on play and see how this works managing fulltime job in game development uh that's definitely quite tricky uh I mean doing Game Dev on the side or doing Game Dev uh with kids or so on yeah that definitely becomes quite a bit more more difficult but it can be done I mean for example um where was he oh for example over here Nikki from iHeart gev I mean he makes a ton of really excellent tutorials and he does have a a a uh software engineer job so he does have a normal job and then does video tutorials on the side so we could also do that uh make games instead then there's Dev duck who has been working on his RPG for like 5 years now working alongside a job so technically it can be done but it definitely requires quite a bit more uh managing your own time that is yeah maning is a strong word cling to life yeah it's definitely Game Dev on hard on hard mode trying to do everything at once yeah that is I can definitely feel that uh okay so this one is working where is Danny good question I don't know uh all right so yep this one did work success so let me just write the hint and so on and then yeah I think I'll do one more and then that's it okay so defining struct so remember how structs are very similar to classes just with the struct keyword then Define field of that type just like a class and construct it also just like a class so here you learn how to define a struct this is very similar to a class but remember the one big difference how stru are value types whereas classes are reference types yep that's the one big difference between them and let's complete the exercise do you think it's possible to make an audio editor in unity I audio is really one of the main things that I really don't know much about so I'm definitely not the best person to answer that because I'm not entirely sure what does audio editor mean but yeah I mean in unity you can do all kinds of things with audio clips Unity audio clip you can just see all the functions that it has you can get the channels frequency and so on so yeah I don't know much about uh audio but if you can get the data get the sample data from the audio and you can set the data then I assume if you combine these two you could build some kind of interface where you can connect things uh connecting together in order to be able to make Cuts in order to be able to modify things and so on so yeah technically I do think it is possible and also uh Unity also has a audio mixer so if you want to do some kind of complex audio mixing like I said I'm not an audio expert I've only used the absolute Basics but I do know the audio mixer is very powerful with lots of things so yep are you going to GDC no sadly no it's what it would be fun I would like to but yeah it's uh pretty much on the other side of the world so that makes it for a very expensive trip so yeah sadly sadly no but yeah I won't be at home uh watching the keynote I assume they're going to do some kind of keynote or maybe not actually that's a good question I haven't thought about it until right now but yeah if they do some kind of keynote I will definitely be listening to it I won't be uh watching all the talks if they have any and then doing some kind of uh some kind of summary video so nope sadly not going to be there uh physically but yep I will definitely try try to cover try to do some kind of news on all the kinds of things that they might announce there how's your dogs doing they're sleeping very carefully very peacefully so yeah let them sleep uh okay thought of Hosting your own Community game Jam I have but then I remember just how much effort it takes to organize that whole thing and then I remember okay that would be a fun idea but I'm already insanely busy with work so adding a really insane event on top that would be quite tricky so definitely something that I would like to make at some point but yeah figuring out all the logistics to make that work and make it work properly that is quite difficult so maybe someday but definitely not planning anytime soon okay let me do one more okay so lecture on class intermediate basic inheritance so the goal is to find a base unit class with a get speed function that should return three then Define an enemy class that inherits from unity and then Define a player class that inherits from unit and should override the get speed to return five okay so let's do exactly that so this is pretty simple so Define a unit class okay then it should have an INT get speed and by default this one should return three okay then Define a enemy class and this one should inherit from unit and just like this nothing else and then Define a player class and this one also inherits from unit except for this one this one needs to override so this one needs to be marked as virtual so for this one uh let's override override the get speed function and this one should return five okay that's it pretty simple so this exercise teaches you about inheritance uh let's run and see if it does work let's see okay it did find the unit class the enemy class the player class the enemy does inherit does inherit it did find it calling it on Unity get that and he got that that is really cool that worked all right nice inheritance is always a a tricky thing it has many ways to go wrong but when it goes right it's actually quite fun okay so that's this one right basic inheritance so the hint remember the syntax for inheritance first you define a base class then Define the uh what do I call it oh boy what is the name the extended class no then Define the other classes and extend the base class with con base class in order to provide a different implement mentation for some function the base function needs to be marked as override and no not override virtual as virtual and the uh uh in the oh what do you call it extended function I don't know extended function needs to be marked as uh override just over here needs like that so here you'll learn how to implement basic inheritance where you have a base class and then classes that extend That Base Class and overwrite some logic to provide a different implementation yep okay that's it how are you checking the code are you using reflection or checking the code Itself by reading R text the answer is both it depends on the on the exercise some of them uh do uh read the text itself as if it's uh just basic text but yeah most of it is where's the right here but most of it is actually indeed by using all kinds of reflection so for example on this one the exercise the go on the exercise to define a unit uh class and Define an enemy class that extends unit and a player class that extends it and has this function so yep over here I'm using all kinds of reflection so going into the type of exercise to get the N type of type unit so I get the unit type the enemy type and the player type and then just checks if all of those types actually exist and if it does find them then all of this is correct then it checks the if the enemy type is a subass of unit type if so then yep it means that the enemy correctly inherits then same thing for the player type check that it does inherit then using the get method in order to get the function called get speed so if it finds that one then this one is not going to be null so it does find that one and then checks the return time for that method and over here the complex thing about having to create an instance of a unit object learning how to do this was actually quite tricky I must say I had not used reflection as much as I had to do by making this score so this was a a fun learning challenge for me so having to create a brand new object in order to invoke it pass in an object reference and so on in order to get the return type so passing in a unit object and then player object calling it on that and so on so yeah so yeah basically it's all reflection it's all actually a pretty fun thing learning how to do all this how to do reflection to build all these interactive exercise that was actually quite an interesting thing and yeah in the end it does work great uh okay what time is it yeah 615 okay so I think that's going to that's going to be it let me just go and okay so that one is done all right good okay I do want to learn how to make a pinball game that is physics based in colliders oh that's that sounds interesting although physics is usually a little bit of a headache so I wish you the best of luck with that because yeah making a game where the game design relies on physics that is always always has quite a lot of headaches so that is always quite tricking but yeah definitely best of luck with that uh you be interested in doing how to make a functional file manager inside Unity wow that's a tricky one I mean it's not tricky it's actually relatively simple but it is very laborious let's say in order to be able to to do that I mean takes all kinds of scroll bars learning how to populate it but populating it's actually relatively simple but yeah it's um it's actually it's one of those things that is simple to do but requires a ton of work so yeah it would be a fun challenge so if you have some time definitely do that but if not I'm pretty sure you can find some kind of file manager on the aaur uh well actually no wow that's oh cuz it's on free okay okay yeah I thought it was a little bit strange how didn't have any but having a file dialog file manager and so on so yeah yeah but if you want to do a fun programming challenge yeah I would definitely encourage you to do that learn how to make a file manager It's relatively straightforward and actually pretty pretty fun to do should be nice so yeah C course is really helpful for me watching from India that's cool that's awesome definitely go ahead and watch it take your time and go through it step by step do you recommend building a highend PC for game development love your channel oh nice uh the answer is for PC specs it really depends on what kinds of games you're making so if you're making something like Flappy Bird you really just need the Bare Bones Basics you really don't need anything special but if you're trying to make something like pubg you definitely need something very intense so yeah the specs really depend on what kinds of games you're trying to make but if you're making uh quote unquote simple games like the kinds of games that I make then yeah pretty much anything doesn't need to be super highend especially not a super highend graphics card unless of course you're going for that but for me usually my games are very simple on the graphics ront so yeah for me usually don't really need a highend PC just something basic work actually quite great but your turnbased strategy course Sha of course will be cheaper or some discounts yeah over time I will uh increase discounts I mean right now I'm still focused on really polishing up the the rest of the intermediate and I still got to build the entire Advance section but yeah over time I will be doing more and more discounts on the course so yeah and either way if you can't afford definitely check out the uh free uh video on the inner C course and on that one I talked about my plan was if the course sounds 100 copies I'm going to make the intermediate version for free within a month and it has already passed that so within next month what time is it we're in midmarch so yeah by uh the beginning of April you can look forward to the intermediate uh section of the course to be free over here on YouTube so definitely stay tuned for that and yeah so basically even if you can afford it I want to make sure you can still learn so yep that is why you've got this one then stay tuned for the next one all right so I think that's going to I think that's going to be it so this one I do think this one work great so yeah it's already 620 so yeah any y the code is working here completed it does say the correct message it does have the hints and so on all right so yeah I think that's that's going to be it that should be like that like I said I would like to make live streams a bit more regularly just make them uh about 1 hour cuz yeah my voice is already messed up I definitely can't go any longer so yeah that's going to be it let me just complete the exercise and everything over here is done so yeah definitely and uh like I was saying a while ago definitely go watch the video which is actually out right now so the video on don't be afraid do just in case you're you're uh you're seeing some news on Twitter and you're a little bit scared definitely go watch this video which should be yeah it was published 20 minutes ago so go watch that and don't worry too much about it but anyways okay so that's going to be it for me let me just go on turn on the background let me put where's my OBS there's my OBS all right so yeah so that's it for me yeah thank you so much for joining me and I hope you have a great weekend all right so bye everyone see you next time bye thank you bye e e
