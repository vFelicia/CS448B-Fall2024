in this video we're going to look at the overview and the game design for my complete visual scripting course it includes the making of two games a platformer and an action rpg the whole course starts completely from scratch and goes step by step until the final polished game all without writing a single line of code let's begin alright so the content from this video is taken from my complete visual scripting course let's check out the game design of the two games we're going to build and then an overview for how we will get there so let's see now the first thing to do when making a game is thinking about the design so here's the design we're going for this is a platformer so we're going to have a side view the player will have the ability to move left and right as well as do a jump the player won't be affected by gravity and won't stand on the floor and various platforms there will be initially two types of hazards so we're going to have some spikes and then we're also going to have some lava so if the player touches any of these it won't cause the player to lose and falling off the map also causes the player to die later we're also going to add another type of hazard with some moving fireballs then there will also be coins that the player can touch to collect and the current amount will be shown in the ui and the goal for each level is to reach the end and touch the star which will send the player on to the next level later on we're also going to implement some moving platforms so they move between various points and the player can jump on top of them then we're also going to add a nice double jump so if the player jumps in mid air we get a second jump and when the player goes through all the levels then they win the total game so we end up with a game win scene where we can see how many coins a player picked up in all the levels okay so that's our game design it's a simple design which will allow you to learn a ton about unity in general and specifically about visual scripting we're going to start completely from scratch and slowly build it up bit by bit okay now let's run through a quick overview of all the steps we're going to take we're going to start commonly from scratch so the first thing we do is create a brand new project after opening up unity we will set up the layout then install the universal render pipeline and finish the project setup now like i said i specifically designed this course to include multiple games so you can learn how to apply visual scripting to any scenario so when we have the setup we're going to make copies of our base project for each game then the first game is the platformer and the first thing we're going to do is look into the game design this is a very important step so we know the actual design we're trying to implement then we get started on making the game so we begin by learning the basics of visual scripting how to create a new visual script how to add nodes what are inputs and outputs and so on then we'll learn how physics works in unity and apply gravity to our player character after that we make our first visual script to handle basic player movement learn about visual scripting variables and use it to define the player movement speed then we add some jumping and learn how to test if the player is touching the ground afterwards we'll learn some more visual scripting concepts first learn about super units and how they are extremely useful then learn about groups and how they help you visually organize your scripts after that we'll learn how to work with the animator and add some animations to the player then implement unity scene machine to control the camera and add some proper platform visuals with all of that done we have a nice base so we implement the first hazard a simple spike if the player touches he takes damage and dies then we handle scene management and reload the game when the player dies after that we'll learn another extremely important visual scripting concept which are events so this is the main way that you can communicate between various scripts we then set up the ui and begin using events to show a you died message when the player dies with the player death being handled on the spikes we also handle the death when falling off the map then we add some nice coins for the player to collect and finally add a gold to the level which is the star then we handle the logic for making multiple levels and how they can be visually very different with the second level we make it look like the inside of a cave and add some lava using the unity particle system then we implement postprocessing to add some nice effects and we'll learn all about shadowgraph which is unity's official tool for building custom shaders without writing any code so we build a nice shader to make the level particles glow then we add some sound effects and some music we build a simple options menu with buttons to modify the sound and music volume after that we create a scene for when the player wins the game and display some stats and then build up a very simple main menu so with all that the core of the game is done so now it's time for the very important step of adding polish to the game first we add some awesome particles when the player dies and wins the level then some simple animations and lights to the coins then we improve the player script to have the sprite facing last move direction afterwards we add a nice trail then implement a simple double jump and then add some awesome moving platforms lastly we add some dangerous moving hazards then we do something interesting we modify the input of our game to support touch controls and with all of that the game is pretty much done so then we just build a handful of unique levels using all of our mechanics and with that the game is done so the final game is simple but still a pretty great platformer it has all the mechanics that you would expect and once again it's all done 100 using visual scripting so we have all these mechanics a fully functioning game and there isn't a single line of code anywhere alright so that's the overview for the platformer it's a simple game which makes it perfect for learning the basics of visual scripting and then with all the knowledge that we gained from building the platformer we move on to the second game the action rpg this one is quite a bit more complex with tons of awesome features and mechanics let's first check out the game design that we're going to build this is an action rpg game in a topdown perspective meaning that we have our player sprite but we have no concept of height or a y axis so there's no gravity the player will have the ability to move left right up and down along with normal movement we're also going to have a nice quick dash ability then as for weapons the player won't be able to attack with a melee attack and he will also have the ability to fire some arrows the arrows have an unlimited number of ammo so they won't regen over time and for a defensive ability the player also has a nice yield which blocks most damage so it unlocks most attacks however we're also going to implement some fire arrows that go through the shield then there will be two enemy types so we have an enemy that uses a sword it does melee attacks and another one which is a bow and fires off arrows the enemies won't patrol around the map and chase the player when the player gets close the game will also feature various hazards so we're going to have some very basic simple spikes we're also going to have some lava and then in the dungeons we're going to have some cannons which shoot some fireballs the world won't be designed and it won't be populated with all of our mechanics so we have the main whirl and scared throughout the map there will also be some portals for the player to enter into those dungeons then as for pickups we're going to have some normal coins as well as some heart pickups the coins are used in the shop in order to purchase various things so we will have some upgrades for the maximum amount of health as well as the maximum amount of errors then we're going to add a key door system where a certain key opens up a certain door and also some generic push buttons and some toggle buttons which will allow us to create some very interesting puzzles then the goal of the game is to collect all of the five star fragments so they are scattered throughout the world and the player must pick them up individually and when the player gets them on then we have our winner and we win the game and then in the final polish stage we're going to add tons of effects and visuals okay so here we have our complete game design as you can see it's quite a bit more complex than the previous game with tons of features and mechanics but given how much you've already learned with the platformer you should be able to build this without any issues we begin once again with an empty project like with the platformer we begin by checking out the game design we're going to implement first we create the player character and set up some basic movement then we create the animator and this time we'll learn how to use animation pointers in order to manage animations in all directions then we add a sort attack with the visual and logic for identifying targets with the player working we then control the camera using cinemachine just like we did for the platformer after that we'll learn all about unity tile map and how we can use it to build up our world then we add postprocessing to the game and after that we make a really awesome health system we make sure to build it properly so we can use it both on the player and later reuse it for the enemies then we set up the ui and here we learn the value of reusing as many elements as possible so we import the exact same options menu we made in the platformer along with the sound and music scripts then we add some basic spikes and then handle player death and reloading the scene with all that done it's time to add some enemies first we'll build up the structure of the enemy with the visual and the animations then it's time to learn about yet another very important visual scripting feature which are state machines we use them to handle our enemy ai first make a patrolling state where the enemy patrols between various waypoints then we handle the state where the enemy chases and attacks the player after that we add the health system to the player then with the player taking damage we add a defensive ability a nice block with all that done we add some pickups so first some simple coins and then a health pickup afterwards we'll learn how to handle another very important thing with visual scripting we're going to learn how we can fire events and get a return value then we add a nice evasive dash and we add another weapon in the form of projectile arrows then we take those arrows and make an archer enemy we build an enemy manager script that can spawn multiple enemies and use that to make some interesting battles then we make some keys and doors to build up a key door system and after that it's time to finally build some dungeons we make them look visually very different then we make a script that can spawn some coins and make a chest object that spawns coins when hit after that we build up a cannon that shoots firebombs and make a nice lava hazard with a great visual later we make some special unblockable arrows for the enemies and create some pickups to increase max health and the max arrow count using all that we have learned we then implement some shops so we need to pay a certain gold amount to open the door and get to the item then we make some interactive buttons that we can use for all sorts of scenarios like opening doors or building puzzles and then we add the main goal for the game which is together all five star fragments with all that the core of the game is done so we add a simple gamewin scene along with a simple main menu and then as usual when the core is done we get to work on the polish first we make a shader to add some tint to the enemies when they take some damage then we add an awesome dissolve effect when the enemies are spawned and then we add some animations to coins and various pickups of course no action rpg is complete without smashing some pots so we add that then we implement the trail render on the arrows with all that done we take some time to use the tile map to build up our whole world we add a trail on the dash and force the player to stop moving while attacking then add a nice glow to the star fragments and improve the unlevered shader to look quite a bit better after that we polish the fireball so they don't vanish instantly learn how to add camera shake to scene machine set up the player to respawn when dead add a really nice sword slash animation along with some grass bushes that i have a special shader to sway with wind then we take everything we have built and populate the whole world with all of our mechanics and with all of that we have the awesome action rpg done we take a look at the final game we have built which has tons and tons of features and again we built all this internally using visual scripting without a single line of code all of those mechanics the player the enemies the pickups the dungeons and so on everything done purely with visual scripting so it's a really awesome game with tons and tons of features alright so that's the game design and overview of the whole course i'm really happy with how it came out and based on the reviews it seems people are really enjoying and learning a ton the course features multiple games all made completely using unity visual scripting without a single line of code each game starts commonly from scratch and the lectures are presented as clear step stepbystep tutorials just like my normal videos i specifically designed it to include multiple games so you can learn how to apply visual scripting to any genre you can think of with the knowledge you will learn from this course you will then be able to make any game you want all the lectures have their project files included and i'm always available in the q a section to help with whatever questions you have so if you're looking for a guided stepbystep course on learning how to make awesome games with visual scripting then check the link in the description to pick up the course alright so thanks for watching post anywhere in comments and i'll see you next time
