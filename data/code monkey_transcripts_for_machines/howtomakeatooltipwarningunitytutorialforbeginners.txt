hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're continuing to make a tool tip in unity we're going to add the ability to flash a warning let's begin so here is our window and here is our Tilton it shows up when we pass the mouse over a button and displays text which in here is static and in here we have text that is updated on every frame so this attack button has the cooldown behind it and again we can see the cooldown displayed on the tooltip updating on every frame so this is great for displaying extra information to the player now something else that is also very useful is flashing the tooltip whenever we have some important warning information like for example an error message so in this case we could show a flashing warning when we click on the attack button if the cooldown isn't over yet now there are several ways we can do this we could modify this class to add that behavior however in doing so we would make this class needlessly complex and cause many issues with having a tanta any warning visible at the same time so what I normally do in my games is have the normal tooltip and then a separate total warning class this causes some code duplication but keeps our analogic nice and simple so here in our project folder let's duplicate our tooltip class and let's call this the tooltip warning so here we just change the name and here we also duplicate our transform this is the total tip and then we have these auto boarding and drag over and you only create a class okay so we now have two separate tooltips that we can use so let's see the tooltip warning code here is the class and most of the code won't be mostly the same so for example following the mouse that acts on both tooltips and setting the text as well one of the main differences is that the warning is meant to be visible only for a short while whereas the normal tooltip is visible until it is actually manually hidden so let's create a very simple timer to hide it after some time so appear we simply make a private float for the show timer and on our update let's simply reduce that timer by time.deltatime and if it is under zero then we want to hide our total and in our show total function we're going to have an optional parameter for a float show timer Max and let's default it to two seconds and here we simply set our show timer to be our show timer max so we start off at let's say 2 seconds and then comes down every frame when it's under zero it should hide the total ok so which is a very simple timer but it should be working so let's go into our window class and here on our attack button let's do a simple if if the attack come down if it is bigger than 0 then we are currently in the attack cooldown so in here we want to showcase a warning so we're going to our tooltip warning class and we want to show a simple warning saying cannot attack and if not then we do the attack which just sets the attack kunda ok so let's test ok here is the normal tool tips on works perfectly fine if I click on the attack the normal one still works click again and yet there you go there's the cannot attack warning message and after a while the message went away alright so the basics for our warnings on tip are working we have a warning that we can display and it stays displayed and stays following the mouse just like the normal tone tip and disappears after some time now obviously since this is meant to be a warning we want to make it more visible so let's do a simple flashing animation so we're here on our updates let's create a simple flash so we need some variables for that so a float for the flash timer and they end for the flash state so here we increase the flash timer by time.deltatime let's also define a float for the flash timer Max and if the flash timer if it is bigger than the flash timer max then let's increase the flash state and then we do a switch on the flash state so just like that every time we go past flash timer max the state won't increase so in here using odds and evens we can set a different color to make a very simple animation so case we have state of 1 let's set our tooltip text that color into wines and we also want to change the background color so here let's grab a image for our background image and we set the background to a red color in case we have a too we do essentially the reverse we put the background in white and we put the text in red so just like that we should have a nice flash now again we don't want it to flash just once so we can simply add a few more cases so like this we should have a nice flash so now all we need to do is go down into the show tooltip and here we set our variable so set the flash time we're back to zero and the flash state also back to zero okay so when we show our tone tip we set the flash timer and flash state both to zero then on every frame we increase the flash timer by the adult time if it is above flash time or max which in this case is set to 30 frames per second if it is we increase the flash state and if it is either one three or five then we show the tooltip using a white color and the background using a red color if there is a two or a four then we show the tone tip in red and the background in white so again on our window we have our warning being shown if we click once the attack cooldown is still active so let's see if that is flashing saying cannot attack okay here we are there's the tooltip working perfectly fine there's the attack if I click once yep there's a code out now click again if there you go a nice very visible warning saying we cannot attack because the calm down is still active and as you can see this is great for displaying error messages to the player so there you have it we took our tooltip and duplicated it to create a warning tone tip that flashes to show the player a error message as always you can download the project files and utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in
