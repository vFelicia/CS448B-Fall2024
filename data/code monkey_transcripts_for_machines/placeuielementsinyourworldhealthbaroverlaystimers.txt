in this video we're going to learn about using a world space canvas this is a very interesting feature that allows you to play around with ui elements that are placed physically in your world let's begin okay so this is going to be a really quick video since it's such a simple thing but still i want to make a video just in case you're not familiar with now this is the way that you can use the extremely powerful ui elements and position them in your world for example in my complete builder defender course i used a warrant canvas for displaying the construction timer circle display just a very simple rotating effect that would be very tricky to do with normal sprite renders but it is very easy with a world canvas check out the complete course linked in the description if you want to learn more now let's say you're working on some sort of rts so you have a whole bunch of units and you want to make a health bar on top of each unit now the first approach is you can make a health bar using sprite renders in fact i already covered how to do that in several videos so for example here is a health bar so we have a container game object then inside a border which is just a black sprite then inside we have a container for the actual bar and it's set up in such a way so that i can modify the scale on this object and moves from left to right and then inside i have the actual bar sprite visual alright so like this it works but you can see it's pretty complex to make just a normal bar so let's see how we can make a simple health bar just in the ui so let's open up the ui go into the canvas and here it's really very simple you just go add a ui image and there you go tint it in red give it a certain sprite and now here the ui image has this really nice image type so let's set it to filled and in here set it to horizontal starting from the left and there you go now just size it accordingly and just with this we already have a working health bar so in here it's set to film fill on the horizontal and we can easily set the fill amount and it automatically fills it correctly so if you want we can then add another one on the background and even add the outline script and there you go over here we have a much simpler much easier to use health bar so making a health bar in the ui using an image is much simpler than making the world using sprite renders then obviously this has even more options so we can fill it for example let's fill it radially and just like that now we got this real nice effect that would be really difficult to do when using normal sprite renders then we also have for example the shadow effect so there we have nice shadow outline and we can also put this inside a container and add the component canvas group and with this we can easily modify the alpha of all of our elements which again would be something that would be very tricky to do when working with sprite renders all right so as you can see the ui has tons of really useful features and when you think about all of these ui elements in the canvas you might think that they can only be used for the ui but that's where a world canvas comes in now if we select the canvas over here we have the canvas script and we have a render mode and right now it's set to screen space overlay which is the default one however we can select the other ones we can select screen space camera which makes it so that the ui is visible by a specific camera and lastly we have world's face which will make this a world canvas so if we selected and now we go into the game view and right away we don't see anything now the reason you don't see anything is because the canvas now exists in our world so it will be rendered by the main camera and if we go into the scene view we can see that the main camera is rendering down there but our ui elements all the way in there so let's bring it back over here into zero zero zero okay and now in here we can also get rid of the canvas scaler and just set the scale onto one one one and on the width and height for a world space canvas setting it to zero zero makes sense so if you look in the game view yep now we see our ui element placed in our canvas and is being rendered by the main camera alright so with this we now have a canvas where we can place ui elements and it's being rendered in our world now obviously the scale of this health bar is massive that is because the screen space overlay takes essentially a screen size for all the objects but in the world the units that we're using are much smaller so let's just resize all these so there it is here we have both of our health bars so one of them is made up of sprite renders and one of them made up of ui objects and again with this now we can use all the normal ui elements that exist so over here for example let's create an input field and there you go here is this element and it shows up in the world we could also add a really interesting scroll view we could add a slider and just about anything and over here if you want you can also access the sorting layer in order to for example make sure that it's always on top so with this now i can just copy this so hit copy go inside the prefab and just paste it right in here and there you go now this unit has a world canvas for its health bar and if there it is now every single unit has a really nice worm canvas health bar so then through a script setting all the film amount is extremely easy and like i showed using the canvas group makes transparency much easier than working with sprite renders so for example you could fade the health bar in and out much easier with this than using sprite renders and by the way here i'm showcasing this in 2d but everything works exactly the same in 3d so here is a 3d demo and you can see that over there we have a really nice world space canvas and you can see that it respects the camera's depth so as i go behind this one yep there you go it stays behind the object so it's made up of ui elements but it's positioned in the world and can be hidden by other objects just like pretty much any other element so there it is a very simple very useful feature now i should also mention that as usual there are pros and cons to every approach using a world space canvas is awesome and it can be extremely useful but also has some downsides specifically with regards to performance if you abuse it so each separate canvas uses its own drawcon so here on the frame debugger we can see that each renderer batch is being drawn separately so there you go each of them yep one by one so if you have a lot of canvases active at once you should probably make a system to disable them when not needed however a single canvas isn't really very expensive especially if you take away the raycaster component now another pro of using multiple canvases is that in a single canvas if anything changes then all of the elements need to be repainted so keeping static elements in a separate canvas from the ones that update constantly can actually help with performance so that's a benefit more related to normal canvas rather than a worm canvas but still nice to know so as long as you don't go crazy with hundreds of world canvas at once you should be fine alright so that's it like i said this is a very quick video but i'm hoping it helped you in case you weren't aware that this was an option it's
