all for just 25 bucks if you don't yet have a mega pack like this one then I highly recommend you pick this up anytime you have an idea for a game it is really useful to have a bunch of assets you can easily pick up and use with all these assets you can make tons of really interesting games and if you want to stay up to date with the latest news on Game Dev Tech and gaming then sign up for my Game Dev report newsletter if you've seen my videos on that format then the newsletter is really the same idea just text based which lets me do it much more regularly than these big videos so check out both links in the description all right so starting off with some gorgeous looking visual effects these are perfect indicators for things like move here or attack here so great for some kind of RTS or action RPG or maybe you can use them as visual Buffs like healing and defense this one is actually a bundle it includes three packs with 40 effects then if you want a gorgeous environment look at this one right away this reminds me of the game or and the blind Forest that was a gorgeous looking game and this environment would be perfect for exactly that but at the same time this is a full 3d scene so you could use it for a side platformer like that game or just a normal 3D game next here's a fun one all about Kawai animations definitely a very unique animation pack very Niche this would be perfect for some kind of anime game it includes all kinds of animations in a kawaii style but then also for some reason also has some attack animations so definitely strange pack in total there's over 200 animations so it's actually pretty big next if you need some tune V effects look at this one all of these effects look really gorgeous they all look really satisfying there's tons of variation that you could use in many ways I could see this being used in a diblik game or maybe even something like Devil MC rry then if you need low poly weapons here's a nice huge pack it's got quite an impressive amount and it's actually quite cheap you've got everything you could possibly want so you've got rifles you've got shotguns pistols SMGs there's some heavy machine guns snipers launchers even grenades and flashbangs so if you don't have any pack with tons and tons of weapons then this would be a great one or maybe you're making a game inspired by Horizon zero Dawn if so check out this huge Pack full of scifi dinos the model are all really awesome very unique some very inventive character designs in total this features seven models each with three skin variations and lots and lots of animations included then here's a fun one 3D emojis these actually come in modular parts so you can mix and match to get tons of variation it comes with custom editor scripts to make it really easy to customize so this is the kind of thing that would be really excellent for giving a game a little bit of extra depth maybe you could spawn these 3D emojis on top of your character when they do something or when they say some kind of message then if you need tons of super high quality VFX check out this one you've got lots of great looking effects all in a realistic fantasy style these were also made in VFX gra and Shad graph so you can also inspect all these effects to see exactly how exactly do they work or maybe you're building some kind of farm or zoo tycoon game if so look at this one it's a pack with a ton of farm animals so you've got cows balls horses pigs all of them in a really nice cartoony style the proportions are very stylized and each of them also comes with a nice set of animations next here's a fun one some nice quar transitions these are perfect for polishing your loading screens or really any scene transition you can tint it in any color so even though it looks like liquid this could be something like water slime or lava then if you need some nice animated icons look at these ones making your icons animated is a really nice and easy way to add a tiny bit of pish your game you can make them static once on idle and then animate them on mouseover you've got loading icons WiFi icons there's some bar charts you've got some texts messages gears notes and tons more or perhaps you're game is pixel art if so look at this nice monster pack they are pretty tiny they're 128x 128 in total you've got 100 Sprites with multiple animations so this could be really great in some kind of pixel art RTS or maybe some kind of God game or Village Fantasy game then if you're a fan of the Matrix and you want the Shader effect that looks just like that if so then look at this one it is exactly what you expect you've got lots of green characters moving around so very simple and if this is the style you're going for then this makes it look really great then for an animation Punk here here is some survival Locomotion survival means you have the usual normal walking idle crouching animations and so on but then you also have animations for applying a medkit there's one for eating taking some pills grabbing some items setting up a campfire you can also do some punches and some simple parkour so if you combine this with nice character and nice Force environment you have a pretty decent Survival game next if you need something more Jolly here's a cute Town asset pack it's very nice got some very vibrant colors everything is really nice in cuboid the demo scene also looks like it could be a great starting point for some kind of City Adventure game or maybe a cute tiny GTA game just had a car controller to control these cars and walk around and do quest for some kind of cute characters on the other hand if you want something really creepy and look at this fantasy monster it's a very weird creature with multiple faces and a strange skin this one actually comes with detailed facial expressions to make it even more creepy so if you'd like to make a horror game usually those are really just based on having a single really interesting enemy and if so then this one would fit great next if you're making some kind of band simulat game look at these characters they are really nice and Anime likee this pack includes the characters plus the instruments and the animations finding an animation pack for playing some music is actually quite difficult so if you'd like to make a game like this then this looks like the perfect pack then for some fun props here are some stylized barrels it's a very simple pack you've got an empty Barrel there's one with some water and one with some really nice cartoony Dynamite then if your game is cartoony and you need some characters look at these two it has two great characters I love the style very unique it seems like this is actually a new publisher so I hope they make more characters in this same style or if your dream is to make a game like Tony hwk then here's a great starting point it's a pack with a bunch of skateboards and longboards features lots of interesting designs I think they'll look really great all right so those are my top 20 new visual assets on the unity asseta for May 24 there's links F the description and as a bonus you can use a coupon code monkey 10 to get
