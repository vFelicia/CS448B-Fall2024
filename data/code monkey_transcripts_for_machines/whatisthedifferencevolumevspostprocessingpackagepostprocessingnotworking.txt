hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here's a super quick video on something that beginners might find confusing especially when following some older tutorials that is the difference between the postprocessing component and the volume component which one you should be using depends on the render pipeline that you're using if you use the wrong one then you won't see post processing working and in urp you also need to enable some settings so nowadays you should be using either urp or hrp probably urp since it's meant to run on everything and runs very well it's what i always use however if you're following another tutorial it might be using the legacy render pipeline whereas you are probably using urp so you might follow a tutorial and in that tutorial they tell you to go into window and open up the package manager then over here go into the ent registry and scroll down until you find the post processing package so this one so it might tell you to install this package so you install it and then it might tell you to create a new game object name it something like post processing then add a component and find the post processing volume then make a global create a new post crossing profile and add a bunch of effects so here i have a bunch of effects but as you can see it does not change anything so if i'm looking to scene view and camera view if i'm looking to both these nope they all still look the same so i can enable or disable this and nope nothing changes again this is the issue the issue is because this specific post crossing volume this one is meant to be used in conjunction with the legacy builtin rather pipeline so if you're using urp then this won't work we can test that by going into edit project settings then under graphics as you can see i'm using urp but if i clear this then i go back into the legacy render pipeline now if i close this if i go into the camera and on the camera i had the post process layer component make sure it triggers on everything there you go now it does apply that post processing so this one right here the post process volume this is the one that you use for the legacy render pipeline but like i said chances are you're using urp so if i go back in here and i once again assign my universal render pipeline asset with this one no post crossing volume does not do anything so when working with the urp you do not use this component so let's remove this and instead use the volume component this one then you can create a new profile and add the effect just as usual and yep this is how it works now if you have the correct post processing component but you still don't see the effects happening if so then you can go watch my video on my glow checklist here very quickly in order to make this work you just need to make sure you go into the camera and in here enable post processing specifically for glow you need to go into the render pipeline asset and enable hdr and finally on the render itself you need to go here and enable post processing if you do all of those and you're using urp and you're using the volume component if you do all of that then you should be able to see post crossing work perfectly also one more tiny thing on the scene view just in case you don't see it the scene view up here on the top right corner you see a whole bunch of buttons and there's this one right here with a little star you can click on it to enable all of them or click on here and then you can enable or disable post processing also over here on scene view so click to enable or disable alright so now you know the difference between the volume and the postprocessing volume components you should be using urp and if you are and if you find no tutorial using the all post processing stack then now you know when using urp use the volume component instead it does not require any package anything at all you just add the volume component instead of the old post crossing volume alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
