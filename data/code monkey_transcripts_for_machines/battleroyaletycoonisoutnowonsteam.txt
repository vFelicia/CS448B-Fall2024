hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and as you know I'm an indie game developer and I've just fully released my latest steam game battle round tycoon out of early acces this has been quite the journey it's the longest I've worked on a game and also the most complex you can pick up the game right now on Steam and see all that I'm teaching here in action so I will now play the short trailer and then talk about the journey to make the game and what's coming on the channel all right so there it is the game is finally in version 1.0 I'm really pleased with the end result I think the game has an interesting concept and is well executed of the system's work well with one another and I focused a lot on making it a really pleasant and polished experience going through early access in reading all the feedback has helped me improve the game immensely the game right now is better because of that feedback so if you did pick up the game during early access and wrote a review I'd like to thank you for that the game is better because of you I'm also very pleased with the development of the game and how I managed to organize my code this is really the most complex game I've ever made and managing all that code has been tricky but doable usually when I make my games it feels like good quality always goes down in the end but not in this case I've been adding a ton of features this past week and working in the codebase is still very doable thanks to how everything is cleanly separate so yet another example of just how important it is to keep your code nice and clean if you do it it will help you manage to make more and more complex games I've covered some of the systems on the channel so check the links in the description to understand how such a complex game is made from various separate systems this has also been the longest I've worked on a game I first started in April of last year with an early access release in December and if one release right now so that's a total of 17 months of the fountain part of that is due to complexity but also due to how pretty much at that same time I started this channel and making videos so I've been trying to balance these two fulltime jobs and be productive at both as you saw by the unlike of videos these past two months there are times when it really requires extreme focus to get something done and now that the game is done I'll be back to making videos while reading all the feedback and fixing all the issues that might pop up if you followed along the channel this past year then you'll have seen how a game starts from nothing and through constant incremental progress it eventually becomes a complete final game the game is now fully released on Steam and you can get it with a bonus discount if you pick it up through the bundle it applies discount even if you already have all the other games and all the other games are the ones in the code monkey bundle if you do pick up the game then please read a review with your sonot I want to constantly improve as a game developer and reviews also help the game get more visibility on Steam this channel is all about teaching game development so if you're interested in making games I think it's very useful to view how what I'm teaching in these videos is applicable to a real final game so right now my plan is to focus a hundred percent on this channel at least for the next couple of months hopefully you won't like the videos and the channel will grow to become sustainable later this month I'm also heading to unite Copenhagen so I'm looking forward to learning a lot and sharing what I've learned there should be lots of great stuff regarding the feature of unity and now here's my question to you what would you like to see more on the channel more complete game tutorials or more single element uturns would you like to see more ECS and job stuff more videos on systems from vanuatu goon what about sim tutorials like how odd the workshop may be a game jam maybe something with preset packages so it's easier to start maybe some interactive tutorials or what about a livestream like that test that I did a long time ago I'm really excited about all the potentially awesome stuff I can work on to help you learn how to become a better game developer so do one let me know in the comments what you would like to see this week I'm still busy working on the game making sure that everything is nice and suddenly but I should be back to regular videos by next week and as always many thanks for watching these videos and I hope you like the game alright see you next time you
