then here's an interesting question why do most solo devs keep remaining as a solo Dev even after getting a massive hit I believe the answer to this question is exactly the top comment on the post it simply says how managing people sucks personally I have no interest in managing people so even if one of my games became a massive hit I would not go out and hire 20 people and make a massive Indie Studio I'm really a big fan of making small games either ACC by myself or in work with one to two other people
