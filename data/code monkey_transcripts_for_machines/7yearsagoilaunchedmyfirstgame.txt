this video is made possible by my game bomber play seven awesome games and help support the channel get the steam game bundle at unity code monkey comm slash game bong in this video I'm going to tell the story about the time that I launched my very first PC game seven years ago the game was survivors Quan which was a strategy action game that still to this day I think it's mechanically very interesting I'm telling my story in the hopes of inspiring you by showing how we all start from nothing let's begin so all the way back in 2012 was when I finally decided that I want to make a complete desktop PC game I covered in my entire game that journey in another video and if you've seen that video then you know that was the point that I transitioned away from flash and into PC game development in December of 2012 I started looking at how I could possibly make a PC game which is how I eventually came upon unity for design I wanted something that was mouse heavy so I was looking for a design that really made use of the PC as a platform and that design eventually ended up becoming survivors but still to this day I think it's a really cool game with some really interesting mechanics it's definitely not very polished and very clunky at times which clearly shows that it was my very first game but mechanically speaking I think it still holds up today especially the sequence survivors for gun points which features the same base mechanics with a ton more polish so I start working on what eventually became survivor squad all the way back in December of 2012 and six months later in May of 2013 was when it finally came out so that was a really interesting time I was really pleased with what I built I learned a ton and I finally had made a complete proper PC game I've played it in full screen and it worked exactly as I imagined so in that sense I was definitely feeling very good about it especially in retrospect since now I know that about 90% of people who start making games never actually finish them so the fact that I started in completely game over the course of six months was definitely a great thing however in order for it become a job it also needed to make money and well that's where the problems came in now back then Steam already had greenlight it was actually announced about one year earlier and the announcement of greenlight is one of the main things that first planted the seed in my head that I could make a PC game before greenlight essentially you need to know someone so for me as a random kid and living in Portugal obviously I didn't have any connections and didn't know anyone in the games industry so before greenlight the idea of being an indie game developer was simply not possible at all however greenlight did happen and with it came the possibility of making PC games and making a living so when I first announced the game I quickly submitted it to greenlight I wrote on the text made the page made some cool gifs and so on I remember the response was free good the game was decent back then and people seem to really like the concept behind it however back then the queue to get through green light was still huge you needed thousands upon thousands of votes in order to move up the list and finally get accepted again with me being just a random kid with no connections and no concept of marketing I couldn't really get that many votes so when May came and my design was complete and I felt the game was ready for release I hadn't been accepted yet so I did what every other small indie developer did back then which was to simply release it on my own website now thankfully back then Humble Bundle already existed with their extremely useful humble widget without that it would have definitely been a pain to handle all of the payments distributing the game files but thankfully through that widget it was very easy so i polished up the website made a trailer and released the game and well you can probably guess what happens when an unknown game from a firsttime unknown in the developer in a tiny country launches a game the answer is well pretty close to zero sales I think on the first day it sold something like five copies and then on the second day your whopping twenty copies and then back down to ten and then three and so on so very quickly it dropped down to zero now like I said that was a really interesting time so I was really happy to have made a complete proper PC game examine like I wanted but the end result of six months of work was something like three hundred bucks so it seemed that despite of my efforts my dream of making it as an indie game developer wasn't really going to happen one interesting thing was how the game did get an article on Rock Paper Shotgun which was really awesome back then when I first started making PC games two of my main dream like calls were to get my game on Rock Paper Shotgun and get it reviewed by totalbiscuit on his WTF his series family that's like girl never came to pass so that's what happened when I watch my game I was happy with what I produced and sad with the financial results for a while that was a pretty dark time I mean back then I had dropped out of college about a year before that so I really didn't see much of a future for me when I first saw green light I saw a possible feature and then when I saw zero copies I saw that possible feature disappear in front of my eyes but then I did see a glimmer of hope and look at my green light page which was getting a slow trickle of upvotes and simply did the math if the votes kept coming in then it was only a matter of time till I had enough to reach the top of the list and be approved and if I got on Steam then I would get a second chance at success once I had that thought my brain clicked and that's when I felt that fire again and that feeling that it was still possible so I went right back to it I was going to improve the game as much as I could in the time that I had so that's what I did over the next five months I fixed a ton of bugs polished a ton of things added more features and improved it as much as I was capable at the time and then it finally happened I got the email that said the game had been approved for only son scene so that's probably the best email I have ever gotten my plan for a second chance was finally coming to fruition one of the more interesting videos I made is the 200 days in greenlight video it's on the analyst web Studios channel linked in the description it shows the graph as I went through green light on with some comments I pretty much took a screenshot every single day and then made that video so it's really cool to see the progression if you want to see how things were back then and definitely give them all so the game was accepted which meant I had access to the same backend then it was still a ton of work left to do I had to make the complete steam store page I had to learn everything about how steam bells work which was really complex and really confusing that definitely took me several days to finally understand how it works and about my bill and once I appointed it I immediately tested it with my own account watching my game from the steam point that was yet another great moment to see a game that I made going through the steam client I mean I spent most of my childhood playing counterstrike so I remember playing 1.5 and hearing about this new program called steam that was going to be required for future comes track versions so I got steam many years ago right lunch since it was a requirement to play CS 1.6 little did I know that many years later I would have my own game on that little program so getting the bill deployed was really tricky but I managed to do it then I wanted to do the best work possible so I want to add achievements and all these team features so yet another challenging thing figuring out how on earth is these team API work making all the achievement icons writing all the names and description and setting up all the code to trigger the achievements I definitely felt this was my one true chance so I did only could just to make it work and then finally after all this on November 8 2013 the game was launched on scene so in terms of results it actually did surprisingly well back then steam had fewer games coming out every day so a game which looked interesting and had a unique concept did standup in that first month on seeing the game sold about $15,000 so in that first month I made more money than I made working on flash for over 5 years and it's obviously several orders of magnitude more than I made when I launched the game on my own website in May now depending on where you live 15,000 might not seem like much but here in Portugal that's pretty much a fulltime income so at that point any game development became my official job now if you saw the games out journey video then you know that things didn't go so well after that this is a very volatile business and I've certainly had my ups and downs over the years but still for the time being the game was very successful design wise I'm still very happy with the film review mechanic is still very interesting and unique even today the sequel survivor squad complex is still in my favorite games I'm a despite being a financial failure another really cool video that I made was the game development time lapse it shows the game being built over time starting completely from scratch and going through all the code being written and all the assets being added it's really interesting to see all the mechanics being added all the levels being created the world map being generated the visuals going from temporary placeholders to the best that I can make the time so yeah really interesting to see it all come together it's such a long a long time we go check out the full video linked in description now that was seven years ago which honestly feels like a lifetime ago since then I have published seven more games wrote something like a million lines of code learned a ton about game design and marketing and I made this channel with now over 300 videos sharing what I've learned over all that time so that's the story of how I made my very first PC game I covered my whole game that journey in another video that one covers how I started making IRC games back when I was 10 years old then eventually found flash and finally seven years ago I got onto unity and made my very first PC game if you haven't seen it yet then definitely check it out that video took a long time to make but I'm really happy with how it ended up alright so I hope my story has inspired you and provided with some more detail as to what any game development is relevant like and my message to you wherever you are in your journey is to keep it up and keep making games we all start from nothing but if you persevere I am sure you too can grow and find your success check out
