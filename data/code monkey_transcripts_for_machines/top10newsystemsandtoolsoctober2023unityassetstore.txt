hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and asset to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for October 23 this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered the for new assets and next one I'll cover top visuals and effects as always there's links to the ass in the description and as a bonus you can use your coupon code monkey 10 to get 10% off your order also by the way my own game has just come out this month it's a fun game with some automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you can build a colony Auto it and keep the tiny defenseless dinkies safe from harm you can then colonize other planets gather more resources with the ultimate goal of colonizing every single planet and automating everything so your dinkies can finally relax it is out now on seam I hope you like it and please make sure to write a review also right now you can get an only at 50% off all right so starting off with a simple tool to help you make some interesting transitions adding a simple transition like this one is a great way to easily add a bunch of Polish to your game anything more than a hard cut will always look so much better this one has 17 different styles with tons of customization the effects are all very varied there are some super simple swipes some that look like some Toren paper there are some weird geometric shapes really lots of variation in just about any direction you can use it to easily Fade to a solid color like black or use it to smoothly transition from One camera to the next this is indeed a great super simple way to add that extra bit of polish your game next here's a really fun a very unique one called peros Sprite it's a scen view Sprite painter meaning that you create an area in the scene View and really you didn't just draw on it it's certainly a very unique tool that looks like it can be quite useful like for example when prototyping you can super easily draw a rough sketch of exactly what you're trying to build I always waste a whole bunch of time making separate Photoshop files for the various icons in my games being able to draw some temporary icons directly inside Unity that would be quite useful and of course if you are a proper artist then you could even draw some final or near final art just using this tool that could help you save quite a bit of time and it also has a sort of prefab system so as you draw on the original the changes are reflected in all the copies and it even support some animation so you can easily draw things at various frames to make some nice sprad sheet animation honestly this looks like a really impressive very unique tool I'm surprised I've never seen anything like this then if your game has tons of skills then you need a tool to help you visualize all that data check out this one you can define a skill you can give it a name an icon and then Define which skills are requirements for that one you can then upgrade that skill Define a cool down and various properties it can also take all that data and autogenerate some C scripts personally I'm always a fan of this feature always as a fan of C script generation this way you don't have to mess around with tons of strings all over the place this is actually one of my favorite features from the input system you just generate the class and you can then add Logic on various events then for making your game look gorgeous you're going to need some Vol metric fog so here's a tool to help you do that in case you don't know what exactly is volumetric fog that's basically how you can have fog that has an external shape like fog peering through a window or peering through the trees so God R those are an example of a type of volumetric fog it's a simple effect but it always looks really great it gives your lighting gives your scenes a really nice 3D feel the fog can also be affected by lights giving it all kinds of colors and you can even use some light cookies so if you want to improve the visuals of your game definitely look into some volumetric fog next we have a tool called Data driven enums this is a super simple tool for defining some data structures in an and easily choose which ones you want to use in your games so it's kind of a different way of building something like script objects and making it very databased meaning all these types these are not to find at compile time but instead they can be added and modified afterwards this is kind of thing that can be quite useful especially if you plan to add some player modding while you can technically create some script B objects at runtime it is much easier to just read a Json file and import that directly in the game then here's a very unique very strange one called time logger basically it's a logging tool so you can record all kinds of debug. log you can log whenever something happens in your game but then it also has a Time Dimension so you can scrub through a timeline to see what log was fired and when then you can also add some extra gizmos to visually see on what position was that object when that log was fired I can see this being quite useful if you have for example some kind of Target finding logic and you want to visually see when thises unit actually find the targets and where was it when that happened being able to link up a log with an act position the world that can be super useful in various scenarios this one has plenty of unique Gizmo types you can have some super simple boxes or spheres or even some fress room cones and simple vectors definitely very unique potentially very useful tool next if you want to implement some chat in your game but you don't want to have to build an entire feature complete chat system then maybe look at a tool like this one you've got a nice input text box to write whatever you want it has some nice scrolling text field showing all the text then supports various colors and text decoration like bold and font sizes also support some emojis and in demo they also show something like the CounterStrike kill feed where you have a name and then a weapon icon and then another name I'm assuming that you can also add some custom icons on top so yep building something like this sounds super simple actually I'm thinking of implementing a simple chat system myself in my own game dinking Guardians so perhaps I'll actually pick up this one in order to save me quite a bit of time then if you need to do some spines but you need to do them on the UI inside of the world then check out this one it does exactly what you want it lets you render splines directly in the UI which also means you can then play around with all of the various UI elements so things like masks shadows and outlines those all work with these spine based lines this spine itself can be positioned anywhere you want with whatever curve you want you can even modify various other properties things like texture and size at various points in the spine it even use the job system to make it super performant this is actually the very first tool that I've seen that is built directly on top of unity's recently released official spine package and looking at it this seems to be very well built so this is great news next here's an interesting one so one thing that a lot of people have issues with is 3D path finding since for example the builtin n mesh that one only works on a flat plane so if you need 3D path finding meaning going up and down for that look at a tool like this one this is obviously great for flying units so things like a helicopter or really just some kind of flying monster this one is using go pathf finding meaning goal oriented action planning basically you define a goal with a position in 3D space and the agent tries to complete that goal the goal can also be more than just move here it can be follow or orbit a certain position so if you have any game with some flying units then a tool like this one is definitely a must have then if you need some extra frames one excellent piece of tag is dlss that's deep learning super sampling basically it lets you run your game at a low resolution and then use machine learning to upscale it this one seems really easy to use you just drop the component on the camera and that's really it so this is an excellent addition if your game is GP unlimited the one obvious downside is this only works on Nvidia RTX gpus for things like AMD you have to look into another piece of tag called Fidelity super resolution I think so this specific teag has some limitation but it couldn't hurt to have this option just in case your player does have an RTX GPU all right so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on unur for October 23 there's link to in the description and as bonus you can use the coupon code maky 10 to get 10% off your order also check out my recently released game dinky Guardians and I hope you like it all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to the these awesome patreon supporters for making these
