hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights for november 2021. in this first video i will be covering a list of three assets and the next ones i will be covering paid assets and tools check out the phone playlist to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also right now unity is having a massive black friday sale for these free assets naturally that doesn't matter but if there's any paid assets you've been waiting for then this is your best chance of the best assets are currently discounted everything from tools models animations effects and just about anything check it out with the link in the description alright so starting off with actually one that is simultaneously free and not so this is a shader pack with tons of shaders over 180 effects works on all of the render pipelines now the thing is this one is all based on the amplify shader editor and if you do own that then it's completely free the amplify shader editor it's an editor kind of like shadowgraph and has existed for many many years this asset has been part of quite a lot of previous bundles in sales so chances are you already have it and if you do you can go into the store page and you can get all these really awesome effects all completely for free now for the rest of this list everything is commonly free so for example here is a really nice spin blower it does exactly what it says applies a blur to moving objects it looks really excellent when applied to swords or tires the comparison video is really excellent at showcasing the massive difference it makes so it's one of those things that it really helps add that extra bit of polish to make your games really stand out next up here's some really good looking liquid simulation it really looks very impressive works on both urp and agrp now this one is the free version but there's also a paid version the free limitations are based on number of collisions and limited number of emitters but if you have just a simple use case then the free version might be enough next up here's a pack with some great stylized textures features 20 unique materials they include all kinds of maps color maps roughness ao and all textures are in 2k so pretty high resolution so great simple pack if you need a bunch of high quality free textures then if you need a vehicle for your game here's a police car it's a great model slightly low poly but not too much personally i think it looks great also includes an interior and separated parts so the body doors wheels and steering wheel all separated so you can easily animate them so this could be great for a racing game or maybe something open world kind of like gta and if you like this style then this developer has tons more vehicles then if you're working on a game with a cute art style and you need some ui here's a great one features 40 icons a bunch of buttons and a nice wallpaper if you like the style then there's also a paid pack with many more items and objects then here's a really fun one a low poly training dummy looks really nice and it even comes with two animations die and fall down so this one could be great for adding to a training scene in some sort of action game then here's an interesting tool to generate ropes you place down a plane then select some objects and it generates a rope around those objects it's dynamically generated so you can even move it and play around the visual definitely a niche tool but if you need some ropes and here it is then if you're working in 2d here's a pack with a bunch of weapons both melee and shooting weapons they look pretty good nice cartoony textures so you could use this for example with the 2d aiming system that i covered previously and lastly here's a nice free pack with a bunch of modular armor pieces personally i've got some paint packs from this developer i quite like the style it's low poly but not too low poly this 3 pack comes with a bunch of characters and 6 modular armor sets alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unt asset store for november 2021 there's links to on the description stay tuned for the next video covering paid assets and tools there's lots of awesome stuff there check out the phone playlist to see some more lists with free and paid assets and let me know if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do them also check out my own free and paid assets on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
