hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's talk about the number one most important skill you need if you want to be a successful indie game developer with this skill you have a chance to find success and without it you are guaranteed to fail now i don't like videos where they tease the answer to keep you watching until the end so here it is the number one skill is marketing but do keep watching to know why that is the most important skill and in this video i'll also give you some helpful links on how you can start learning indie game marketing as well as some metrics for you to track and a checklist to follow to have the best chance of finding success with your games now if you're a game developer you might be upset to hear that marketing is the most important skill you might be thinking oh i really just want to make games i don't like working on marketing and i get that but regardless of how you feel about it this really is the most important skill nowadays we live in what is called an attention economy attention is really the most valuable resource that is why the going with platforms like youtube and facebook their goal is to keep you on the side for as long as possible it's because your attention has value it's also why a company like netflix says their biggest competitor is not movie studios but rather games like fortnite there's a million things competing for your attention and more importantly for the attention of your players marketing is simply the study of attention and how to get it that is why it's an extremely important skill that you absolutely need to learn now let me also clarify what i mean by most important here i'm talking in the context of wanting to become a professional indie game developer meaning that you want to make a living from making games you want to make games that sell internet profits so you can keep making more games and keep this as your job but on the other hand if your goal is to make games simply as a hobby just for fun then for that marketing is much less important but it's still pretty important since even if you're doing it as a hobby i'm guessing you still want people to play your games so regardless of your goal you're still going to need to attract the dungeon and as soon as some people hear that they should do marketing some people go straight into the default answer which is oh i don't worry about it a good game just sells itself so let me tell you right away that is absolutely not true the quality bar is really high nowadays being good is not good enough having a good game is the absolute bare minimum requirement there are tons of games coming out that are really good but without marketing then people simply don't know about them so they never sell so a great game that no knows about will not sell itself if you are a regular on this channel then you know i do a top 10 list of the best new games released every month fighting games for that list is pretty easy there's tons of awesome new games every single month the tricky part is really cutting it down to just 10 and every time i make one of those videos i see tons of games that look really cool but have almost no sales for example look at this game that came out a few months ago it looks like a very well made retro shooter it's got a nice art style lots of effects and it's a relatively popular genre and the reviews it received are indeed positive so this looks like a great game but based on the reviews and using the box and lighter method which means you multiply the reviews by between 20 and 70 so around 40. with 50 reviews we can assume this game sold around 2 000 copies which at this price point of 10 means only about 10k gross revenue which after seems cut any refunds or chargebacks and taxes after all of that it might be just about ak net now maybe if the developer lives in a place with a really low cost of living or maybe if this game was made insanely fast in some like under 3 months in that case maybe it's not such a horrible number but regardless of that based on the quality of the game you would definitely assume a better result so the question is why did this one not find success i'm going to mention some metrics you can track in a bit the main ones being followers and wishlists if you go to steam to be you can see that this game had just 300 followers before release so probably only around a thousand wishlists that means very few people knew about the game even fewer were notified when the game was released and even fewer then picked it up which in turn means it was buried on steam under thousands of other games by the way if you're the developer of this game please don't take this the wrong way i'm not saying the game is banned quite the opposite from looking at the trailer in the reviews it seems like a great game and i believe with some good marketing it would have sold much much better and i didn't just cherry pick one specific game to make my point you can go browse the steam new releasing list and see for yourself just how many games look great but don't even have 50 reviews and just like i mentioned in those top 10 new releases videos the reason why i do those is so i can keep up to date with what's coming out and see what is finding success so researching those games and doing those videos is a way for me personally to keep studying and learning about marketing so that my future games have a better chance to find success also another example one of the reasons why i started this channel was specifically to tackle this problem i was studying steam more and more and i learned that discoverability was really only getting harder and harder if i wanted to find success with my games i could not rely on steam finding the players for me steam will only help you sell your game if you can prove that your game can sell meaning that if you don't get that initial amount of sales then your game will simply be lost in a sea of thousands of other games but if you do make that initial push then c will do the rest if you take the effort to do some marketing and you get some people excited for your game and get them to pick it up on day one if you do that the sim algorithm will see your game is getting sales which in turn will promote it to more and more people leading to more and more sales so one of the reasons why i started this channel was for marketing reasons so that i could gather an audience by sharing my knowledge with some useful videos then hopefully that audience would pick up my games whenever i release them and by selling a bunch of copies on day one that would signal to the steam algorithm to push the game and have a successful launch that was my original plan however i must say if you're thinking of doing the exact same thing i would caution you to think about what type of audience you're trying to attract for me i enjoy learning and teaching things so i made a tutorial channel but it turns out that a game dev audience is very different from a game playing audience i initially assumed that a lot of people would follow my tutorials and be curious to know where the knowledge came from so they would then pick up my games to see them i have a bundle on the code monkey website but in almost 4 years and over 20 million views it's only sold maybe 500 copies and now i definitely understand that personally i'm more of a game dev than a game player and i definitely find that i like the time to actually play games so all of that to say be intentional about what type of audience you want to attract there are several people doing some more developed content and that type does seem to translate into sales for example on the top you have denny his devlogs are extremely entertaining they definitely appeal to a more general game playing audience and as such all these games have been massive hits another example is thin matrix he gathered an audience over several years making devlogs and when the game came out it sold tons of copies and then steam pushed it to more and more people making it a massive success so using youtube is absolutely an excellent way to do it just make sure you target the right audience with regards to how to learn indie game marketing here are some very harmful links first of all you have the clark tank this was a show made by ryan clark who runs a very successful indie game company that made huge hits they made games like crypt of the necrodancer and cadence of hyrule the clark tank was a weekly show where he would go through the steam charts and analyze why each game was doing well he doesn't do it anymore but you can still go watch the old episodes there's tons of excellent info there and he also made possibly one of the best tanks of all time on how to consistently make profitable indie games marketing is an extremely important part of that process and an excellent companion video all about how to analyze hooks i would highly highly encourage you to watch that video and study it marketing becomes much much easier if your game idea has a good hook on the other hand if your game has no hook or a generic hook like it's just another generic 2d pixel platformer in that case marketing becomes even more difficult i can also highly recommend the newsletter game discover co it's a weekly newsletter all about indie game marketing analyzing why some games find success and tons of stats on how indie games are selling another great one for marketing is chris tsukowski he's got a vlog with tons of useful articles and even some youtube videos where he analyzes various store pages i also made some videos myself a while ago on some checklists of what you should do before and after launching on scene lots of the things on that checklist are all about marketing so you can see just how important it is so i would encourage you to study all of those sources if you do you won't be much better off than most indie devs and greatly greatly increase your chances of finding success now as to how you actually do it there are many many ways to do marketing the most basic prerequisite is simply having a public steam page the most impactful thing in marketing is simply time the quicker you get your steam page up and running the more time you have to gather wishlists and wishlists build up over time so the longer you have your page receiving wishlist the better then like i mentioned a while ago one of the main ones is youtube if you have the right kind of personality you can attempt the danny style with lots of funny clips and some extreme editing as for me i definitely do not have that kind of personality so that type of content would definitely not work for me but you can also do some more chill dev vlogs i made a video quite a while ago covering a bunch of devlogs like i mentioned themed matrix is a good one you also have flow studio that recently released a successful game you have lumber mill and devdog and many more feel free to check those out to see what style best fits you and your game also it doesn't have to be just develops maybe if you have a sandbox game you could make a channel with some funny clips or some weird unexpected things that happen in your game remember that the goal is attention so do whatever you can do that brings in the most intention another place you can do some marketing would be on twitter although in terms of results i believe this one is quite limited but still you should be making some gifts and perhaps one of them will go viral then as you're making those gifts you can also post them on imager i think this one also has kind of lost its power nowadays but you might get lucky and make it go viral then of course you have reddit depending on what game you're making you can find a subreddit specific for the audience you're looking for for example there's a tycoon subreddit there's one for turnbased strategy or maybe you can even post in subreddits of other popular games similar to yours but do be careful with red rules some silver edits are very strict about selfpromotion there's also tick tock personally i have not explored this one yet i'm not familiar with it but i did hear some indies are finding quite a lot of success then a tried and true method you have a mailing list just have a sign up form on your website mention it whenever you mention your game and keep growing that list usually people who sign up to a mailing list are already preinterested so growing this one is very difficult but very powerful another technique a lot of people have used successfully is making a free prologue so kind of like making a free demo if you design the demo correctly and it leaves people wanting more then you will likely gather a nice amount of wishlist and related to that free prologue something more recent are the steam festivals i believe they have some rules on when you can submit but if you can definitely take advantage of it for example the game i mentioned a while ago lens island by floyd studio they benefited massively from participating in this team festival it's great for gathering tons and tons of wishlists even if those then convert less than the organic questions and of course you also have paid marketing this one will naturally depend on the funds you have available as well as the price of your game if you have a very cheap five dollar game it's pretty difficult to make paid marketing work but if your game is 15 or 20 dollars then at that point it becomes much more doable so those are just a bunch of ways you can do some marketing you might be thinking to yourself okay that sounds good but it's way too much work so again let me remind you that the alternative to doing no marketing is getting no sales so either you put in the work or you have a guaranteed failure sadly that's a reality whether you like it or not as for metrics specifically on steam there's some you should track like i've already mentioned the most important one is wishlists wishlists are one of the ways that the steam algorithm learns that your game is popular the more wish list you have at launch the more steam will promote your game and everyone who wish list will receive a notification when your game launches then the more those wishlists convert the more steam promotes your game further and further another one related to it are followers these are people who click on the follow button on your store page it means they will receive notifications of any announcements you post so followers are kind of like super wishlists as for specific numbers naturally higher is better you should aim for at the very least having around 1500 followers and 5 000 wishlists if you've been working on your game for many years and you generally believe in its quality and you're under that number in that case i would honestly delay the launch and focus hard on marketing until you achieve those you only get one launch it's nearly impossible to come back after a bad one there were some reports although i don't think they've been confirmed that seam has some sort of bar at around 10 000 wish lists meaning that if you get that much you will automatically get much more visibility on the lunch again not sure if that's a fact or just a rumor but regardless more is better so yes the number one most important skill if you want to be successful in the game developer is indeed marketing regardless of how you feel about that it is simply the reality if you refuse to do it then your game will most likely be a flop so do work hard to make your game as best as it can be but also work hard to actually tell lots of people about it this one is a really important topic so i'm really glad i made this video i'm happy you made it to the end and i really really hope this information helps you make your game a huge success now go ahead and hit the like button so more people can find this video and help those people not waste their time by ignoring marketing alright thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
