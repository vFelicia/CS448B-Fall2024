e e e e all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great weddes day it's looking pretty good over here it's been raining nonstop for the past few days but thankfully today there's a little bit of Sun so it's been quite nice actually hope you're also doing great all right so I thought it would be fun trying to revisit some of my own games that I haven't played in quite some time so let's play through it survivor Squad this was my first team game so I made this in 2013 actually it was around May of 2013 that's when I launched the first version and then November that's when I finally eventually I had to get through green light in order to put it on Steam so the initial version was on uh around May of 2013 then in November finally went out to steam so it was an interesting game uh I haven't played it in many years so let's play it and see how it is I still really like the main mechanic the whole thing being all about uh field of view and your characters can only see in front of them so positioning of all the units is all very important that is still a mechanic that I still find very interesting nowadays so yep uh and actually before playing I wanted to rewatch this little video that I made quite a long time ago so 10 years ago I made this video this one on the development timeline for the game it's actually an interesting video so let's see oh let me just put on my phones and make sure that the audio is coming good thank you very much for the course you're Legend oh thank you for watching them I hope they've helped you learn quite a lot okay so let me put okay put the characters a little bit smaller like that nice yeah so this showcased the development of the game basically I made a bunch of backups as I was as I was building the game and then for making this video I pretty much just went back through all the backups recorded a bunch of footage from all of those and it was actually quite interesting uh so here is the game as it was in the very beginning just a shame that I didn't record some kind of date but yeah so back in the beginning just 200 lines of code all super simple just got a little character moving around looking around then trying to handle the the unit selection that was a a tricky thing that I had to do and over here we can see in green these are actually the path finding so that was the main thing that I knew okay this is definitely going to be a challenge so actually over there you can see the AAR object that is because using the ASR path finding project I actually made a video on that because it's one of the most useful assets that that I've ever used so path finding so if you need path finding I can highly recommend this as like I've used in in pretty much all of my Steam games and I definitely highly recommend it's super fast super insanely performant and look at that basally creates a grid and that helped really solve this problem cuz I tried making my own path finding and it was really difficult and when I use this one all of a sudden everything worked so that was definitely great yeah trying to making all the making all the doors uh this is great remembering this because back then Unity did not have any 2D tools at all so even though the game is in 2D it's a top down flat 2D even though uh the doors as you can see these are 3D objects using uh 3D physics so back then I'm pretty sure 2D physics did not exist there did not ex maybe Sprite priner existed all that same point I think I did use some regular quad so yeah back then there were pretty much no 2D tools so even though everything is 2D in reality it's all 3D so having to make the doors with all the physics having the character have some kind of rigid body to push them yeah that was really interesting then trying to handle the basic animations see path finding uh better than the unity builtin navigation yes it is better simply because the unity navigation I mean that one got a big upgrade relatively recently but I'm pretty sure it is still just single thread so that is one of the one of the main things when using Asar you can make it m to thread in which means you can have like 100 units and it takes like I don't know 1 to 2 milliseconds so it's insanely fast even with tons of units on a large map so yeah for a game like this where I want to have some like 100 zombies per map and like five units with with with that many units if I was using just some super based pathf finding it wouldn't work but using something that that is multithreaded that definitely make it super super fast no issues whatsoever and then over here it's trying to work out the animations and the the Looting logic being able to interact with objects being able to interact with the little thing then finally doing some shooting so those are supposedly some zombies which is really just the exact same Sprite just tinted different then over here trying to see the Feld and the view mechanic this was like the core mechanic that I wanted to make for the game so that is definitely something that I made way in the beginning of the game so over here it's actually quite a long time ago right those avatars down there you can actually customize your avatar so there's a link down here so if you want to customize it would be nice to see a bunch more people using some uh custom where did I put it oh forgot to let me just grab the link yeah if you want you can customize your character I even made a video tutorial so if you want to uh customize the whole thing with uh if you want to customize the whole thing making a draw your own character that can also be done so yeah that's pretty much it and if you're curious as to technically how all this works there's also tutorial links down here for how to make a transparent Unity window the mesh based animations how to trigger an HTTP request from Unity which is basically this contacting the the YouTube API and the get spread sheeet so yep if you want to see how all of that works that is actually uh quite nice okay we're woring right say handling the field of view that was something that was really difficult then over here is trying to make spawn points for all the various things so that I can spawn one place then some enemies start spawning and yep they start shooting they start doing all kinds of things so there's already quite a bit of logic quite a bit of AI then over there quite a large map and again note how everything is in 3D so even though the game is 2D all the elements are still in 3D so the walls all the characters and so on and yeah starting to handle the logic for being able to do breakast to find all the targets and so on again this was my first game so for me this was all very new at the time then trying to handle the persistent fog of War this was a really tricky mechanic this one caused a lot of issues it was really slow for for a real long time so that was definitely one of my biggest challenges in terms of performance but yeah when it works it's really great so the characters can walk around they can move and they actually see so that one pushes the door and sees that over here being able to control multiple animations multiple units and finally generating all the map all this is procedurally generating so it's actually really nice I made an algorithm that basically defines various rings around a center point and then just randomly places some nodes alongside those rings and moves them slightly randomly to make it uh quite random but yeah pretty much just makes a bunch of rings and then goes through them and pretty much randomly makes some connections between each node uh basically all of these are potential cities that the player can travel to and they have to have some kind of connection for them and I remember that it was really interesting trying to validate that it made some valid Maps so this one is clearly before I had that validation because for example that one that one is unreachable and the way you do that just in case you don't know you really just use pathf finding so if you ever want to make some kind of node based map for all of your games you can just do this just randomize a ton of stuff and then use pathf finding just basic Asar pathfinding in order to calulate the path from each node and if you can't find a path that means that one is reachable if you can't then it's unreachable and you can just delete that node so yeah this was definitely a great one and then starting to make it more noticeable or not then making the one high with the backpack as you can see my terrible art skills H that was nice yeah starting to interact with a bunch of bunch more objects and having the little tool tip that's nice then trying to interact with various things and doing all of the unit management being able to click to move units back and forth and again on with my programmer art and try to play around with some more complex levels some more things and so on coming to Gamescom I'd love to I've never never been so yeah I'd love to go someday and is it around August or something so I don't know would be would be really nice yeah and over here the UI was also using a separate camera CU I think screen space UI did not exist at the time so that was definitely quite interesting then over here trying to control various things and being overwhelmed and trying to handle the the visibility whil outside of that yeah that was a lot of stuff in here hey Le hi Code Monkey wanted to thank you so much for truly incredible cont new post oh nice I recently opened my own IND the studio and all that started with your tutorials good luck with everything oh that's awesome hey good luck with the studio hey I hope it goes great wow nice so how big is that how big is the studio like two people five people that's definitely an interesting thing so for me usually I work alone like for example on this game I made the whole game by myself but yeah I've always wondered one day one day eventually in a handful of years I'd love to to make a very small just three for now all right nice that's cool that is really really nice so yeah best of luck with the with the studio and the game okay and barie is here hey Jack how's it going hey I hope you're doing great nice uh right so yeah so the development it's really interesting to see the game being developed and over here the animations that was also really awesome so I made the animations based on different body parts so there's a body part for the head another one for the body another one for the legs and some being animated and so on that's all it works great but the problem with that is that each character is basically made up of like 1 2 3 4 5 six like six or seven different game objects which obviously if you've got 100 units that's 100 time 7 that's like 700 game objects that is really heavy so that was one of the biggest issues that I had So eventually for the final game basically had to make a tool to take those animations that I built over here inside of unity and convert those into pgs and just use some basic Sprite based animations with that I only used one game object so with that the game was was able to support tons and tons of units so yeah that was definitely one of the big performance things that I had to do I made all these animations myself they are super basic but yeah I actually think they still look pretty good trying to do the the weapon and all that stuff and yeah over here the game's definitely trying to take a little bit into shape trying to draw all of the things that was nice oh yeah and playing around with with things trying to dynamically generate so that basically I spawn the entire wall then I place a door on top of it and I had an editor tool that basically went through it and sliced the wall where the where door placed and the door in the windows and being able to play basically slice walls that really made it so that the the level design that was so much faster so much easier so yeah that was one of the best uh uh Game Dev tools that I've built this one for 11 design was definitely super useful yeah we need to see you on those multiple Dev collaborations where there's no communication are you talking about the Black Thorn prod videos I was actually on those on the very first one and it was definitely an interesting experiment and uh they have invited me to participate in a bunch but I'm always so busy with so many things so yeah it's a it's a really fun thing I really like seeing those videos but yeah participating is takes quite a bit of work so sadly I don't really have much time for that uh yeah over here trying to see all the various Maps ah that was nice basically I would generate one prefab for each building and then I would have like entire world prefabs that had like positions for three buildings and then it would basically just randomly pick one of the buildings to place on each position so it's a super simple way of doing uh randomized animation but using that placing on Geometry and all of that and it was working quite well yeah oh and now the special zombies ah that was that was tricky back then I love playing Left for Dead so a lot of the zombies are very much inspired by for that so there's one that jumps one that grabs and pulls one that blows up that was nice where's the running content it would be a little bit tricky to make a live stream while running but who knows maybe one day and all of those moving around oh and the blood particles that was another one that was really tricky that was being able to make all of those particles work at once that was super difficult and if you want to learn how to make that I actually made a tutorial on that because that was a very interesting video on how to make a persistent particle system basically how to make uh particles that you can spawn them and they remain on the map for pretty much forever so that is it's something that I think is really awesome so you can basically basically it's all based on dynamically generate meshes so you dynamically generate just a little quad and then basically just move that quad around so essentially even though there are like I don't know 100 a thousand parts in reality it's all just one mesh with a bunch of quads positioned in specific places so it's a it's something that took quite a lot of work to make it work right because in the beginning I had no idea what I was doing back when I was making the game so in the beginning this you can see the FPS over there going down look at that going down to 35 yeah this is definitely that took quite a bit of quite a bit of work to make the game performance in the end oh and then playing around with lights that was also really nice oh nice oh that's the that's lab the randomly generated dungeon thing then little intro that was nice wow so yeah watching this little uh development time lapse sure brings memories I mean it's been 10 years since I made this thing so yeah yeah doing the death lab all the things that was really cool making it all generated it's kind of like a Rog like mode before Rog likes were a popular thing so that's kind of fun I don't remember where I took that idea from but yeah making something that was just playing onstop kind of arcade then making the main menu like that and yeah yeah that was quite nice how the game came from pretty much nothing to a Fallen game then making all the options that was definitely quite tricky having to handle all those things in DUI and there you go right there Steam Greenlight cuz back when I made this video this video was made in May of 2013 so back then it was still not on Steam it was just on green light so yeah back when I made this video was trying to get some votes uh yep vote on green light is this link still workable okay no it doesn't work oh yeah green light that was something but yeah so basically it started from just like this and eventually end up in a game so yeah if you were to make the same game tonight assume it would be a million times ear oh yeah definitely with all the N updates uh not so much about the updates on though of course that that would help quite a lot I mean the main thing is how the game is 2D but I was forced to use all kinds of 3D tools because there were no 3D tools so with that it would be much easier but more important than that is really just my own skills uh I am much more skilled at both programming and just using Unity because being able to use your own tools to a high degree of efficiency that is extremely important so yeah if I were to build this game nowadays it would not take me the I don't know in total took me one year to make so yeah nowadays I could make this in I don't know maybe three months so yeah the the how much your skills improve with experience is really something that cannot be understated it is really something truly truly magical so that is why I always encourage you to make tons of games gain tons of tons of experience do lots of things and basically if you do that everything becomes quite a bit easier so yeah so that was the development timeline now let's actually play the game because it's been it's been something like I don't know like six seven years something like that since I last play the games so yeah this should be interesting and thanks again Leo for the Super Chat and I hope the I hope the new studio goes well congrats on that freeze that D Gardens has already been out for like six month yeah time flies like crazy so yeah that is indeed that is indeed quite a crazy thing Portuguese tutorials would be a little bit tricky in terms of logistics trying to make every single video twice but yeah if I could find a time machine yep I would love to do that that would be really nice okay so let's go ahead and play a brand new game and go for the campaign and yeah there you go a nice little intro cut scene and doing a little slight the Survivor ask you about your stream avatars doesn't it take a lot from daily quota yes it does and I had to uh there's a little form where you can request a quote increase so basically that's what I had to to do I had to go through there provide a ton of information I remember that was a terrible process it was really annoying really insane how they required so many things but yeah that's pretty much what what you have to do you've got to go through there to request a quota because if you don't then I mean alternatively what I did in the beginning before I had that quarter was basically just made this chat down here basically just update at a much much lower rate so we would just get things like I don't know every 10 seconds or every 5 Seconds something like that yeah increasing the quota is free I mean in fact I wanted to pay for it I was like just just let me pay just give me the quotee I need this uh it's not something that won't be expensive I assume so just let me pay but nope they don't let you pay so you have to request to get a quote and then hope that they approve it it's a it's a very strange system but yeah uh okay let me just make sure that the audio levels are are they good it's kind of hard to it's a bit too loud okay I think the other levels are good so let me know okay so yeah select Survivor so yeah doing a nice little uh tutorial so right click to move so I can move around and drag your mouse after right click to pick the aim direction see that's pretty much the the core mechanic of the game is being able to go anywhere and look in any direction that I want I still really enjoy this this mechanic so yeah this is definitely one of the games that I if I had time I would love to remake this nowadays because I still really like this mechanic all right so let's keep going down there and all the I draw the blood myself it was basically just trying to go into Photoshop and make some interesting things it was quite tricky uh all right so trying to do all kinds of things everything is empty and going through there that's a really nice effect I really like the the field of view even nowadays I still think that it looks quite cool okay and opening doors I also think that is nice I remember implementing that little sound effect that was also that was also a tricky one yeah that was fun and there's a little bit of a texture out there with some normal maps that was something that I played around with and trying to manually place the blood everywhere that was really tricky and then trying to go it's like door kickers but with zombies yeah yeah pretty much door kickers was actually an awesome game boom boom shoot oh God oh God here's my attempt at making a little story I don't have a weapon look in that cabinet there was a knife there so remember I was putting in induced coma pretty much the most basic story you can have so the whole world is gone there was an infection now those things are everywhere yep okay that makes sense there's a scientist somewhere on a secret lab working on a cure I had the squaded a few mates but I'm all that's left oh that sucks that's hard all right so let's go ahead and pick it up so scavenge for supplies and stick with me okay sounds good it's now a gaming channel yeah I thought this would be fun I can play the game and give some feedback on the behind the scenes back then oh hey Daniel with a custom character nice hey thanks for being here uh what happened oh right he picked up a knife so now I've got a knife that is pretty cool question no matter how much I watch or try to work script by myself I can't make it without watching tutorial again any tips the best tip is experience oh there's no game sound oh seriously only now you told me there's no sound I only noticed that this was so I was watching the video a while ago and you said there was okay so uh uhh crap crap no no no go back so I thought sound was coming in but apparently not so I was watching the other video would sound apparently didn't quite work out um uh someone was asking about how to write a script by yourself main thing is really you just need to gain experience the more code you write easier it becomes so so if you are a beginner It's Perfectly Natural to Google things all the time I mean I Google things all the time myself so that's really not something that is something that changes so let's see your first game well here it is my first team game that is okay so let's go ahead and start searching for things and there it is the little animation key on the uh little icon on top of the mouse this was something that I really wanted to make it's something that I love in like the old school RTS games they use they usually had some custom cursors so that was something that I really imp M heard the Thunder yeah can you hear the sound now I assume now it should be working yeah cuz I I had that one mutant for some reason so yeah that was tricking you published your first game how do you deal with negative reviews uh you read them and you try to learn from them so basically reviews are are an opportunity gain to gain feedback which is an opportunity to become better at making your games better at being a game development or something like that so don't take them personally don't don't see it as an insult just take it as something something to uh just see it has something to learn from and if it is just insults then just ignore that's really the the best thing yeah failures are the steps of success so yeah try doing something if people don't like it then try to see what can you learn from it but yeah reviews are a normal part of the process so you won't get reviews and you won't get some negative reviews so don't avoid those just try to deal with them as best as possible really is everything still super low cuz on that one seems like it's on 35 let me just it's kind of hard to tell what is super low and what is well now it should be a bit higher hopefully by the way good lighting you f for a game 11 years ago yeah nice thanks yeah I mean the main thing is really it's actually not lighting just the field of view mechanic that is really the main thing just just that alone although there is some lighting there's also a little light in from the character okay so this is the map we can see the various notes around us all right heard the scientist was working somewhere East so that's where we're head all right BL noes are secured gry nodes are cleared and red nodes are infected so resources up there gas for traveling food to keep survivors alive all right and we can craft new weapons and equipment okay that's great and some hphone tips all right that's the basics all right so yeah this the nice UI over there with the nice icons that I drew myself using my very limited art skills but I think it makes sense you can see that one is supposed to be gas that one is supposed to be food wood scrap I think that's copper I think that's silver some cloth and that's a backpack then over here some more some more icons trying to see all the controlled cities oh doing some craf nice and which ones didn't make it so yeah and down here doing a bunch of tips on building nodes on the shop selting survivors the info menu the attack timer danger level the node size all right so yeah pretty good let's go was this your first team game yep yes it was so let's go with these two and start to go there hope to launch my beer factory this here along with your helmet oh nice that's awesome go for it beer factory that sounds interesting nice can you please not spam because I'm trying to do things and it doesn't help to be able to to have to modate the same time anyways okay so let's go on the let's go on the Lo out and I've got a knife a good old trusty knife so let's go ahead equip it I've got two Sur oh one of them took damage well that kind of sucks all right so let's move on there's a little car moving around you another little intro cut scene this was nice I really enjoyed making that making a little animation of the car moving around and I'm pretty sure that I drew this car myself I'm quite happy with that I think it does look pretty decent so yeah okay so our objective is to clear the area of any infected and scavenge for supplies I'm going I'm going okay so let's start moving around and start and there's the little voices this was actually really nice this was definitely something that I wanted being able to select and have the voices for each unit ready got it just want to make sure that now it's not way too loud think it might be on the way uh but yeah adding all the voice that was really nice I remember that I found a a website that could do that let me just cuz I think it's way too loud on the live stream and way too okay anyways yeah on the way uh but yeah making the voice up on a website where I could hire some voice actors oh come on move okay anymore oh shoot okay this one isn't doing anything we just a knif sound is good okay good to know cuz I got to say this is the first time that I'm doing oh no no no go first time that I'm doing a live stream with oh crap first time that I'm doing a live stream with some kind of game some kind of thing so yeah got to learn how to handle the sound all that no no no no move move oh crap ah okay he took a little bit of damage but yep so bunch of zombies on already out all right good so there's only one more left then we can just on the way and I think want to ask is AET flip a good practice should I make my dream game from scratch the term asset flip implies that you just copy paste an asset and didn't modify anything to it using assets is perfectly fine so use assets but don't don't make asset flets mean don't take an asset and just use it directly like I made a video on that topic so basically using assets great asset flip bad so don't do asset flips but do use assets that's pretty much it assets are great they are a great way to being able to make games and being able to buy things for the skills that you don't have that's really the main goal for assets Ying going on the way all right so let's scavenge a bunch of things oh he got another pistol did he nice okay nice so now both them have a pistol yes I'm going let's yeah I'm going okay found the food crate ready the on it some scrap it yeah I really enjoyed this uh gameplay of making all the all the various nodes and Scavenging buildings I really like that idea the idea of basically clearing out the building and then scavenge it for resources and then being able to use those resources to do all kinds of things on the okay so that's the building everything else is gone so oh yeah I didn't even see the the little tutorial okay cleared looted and yep let's go back so let's leave this area now that I noticed I think my chat down here actually my little woo gaining some exp nice so get 61 exp found some scrap an X blueprint some wood and a foot crate and let's go back into that one okay great let me just cuz I think my my chat thing down here for some reason broke so let me just uh restart that one just quit I have no idea why that one broke but hopefully won't cause issues now okay now it's loading tons and tons of messages oh no my my overlay seems to be on broken Yeah so basically just spawning these same messages over and over again so I have no idea what happened basically just something messed up it seems like it's constantly copy pasting the same oh no okay let me try to fix this try to reset it I'm trying but uh I don't know something I remember that when the first time that I use this little overlay someone actually found uh found an exploit the exploit was basically how you could use some HTML tags within your text so some people use a size tag and basically made the Tag super huge so there was some text down here that was occupying the entire screen that was the the whole thing that broke the first time that I used this little overlay that was a a fun exploit so if you go back and you find the very first uh the very first live stream you w see everyone abusing that exploit it was really tricky but yeah if you try it right now that exploit has been fixed basically right now it just takes away all of the HTML tags so no long C that but yeah that was a that was a fun one uh right so yeah I need to basically open Unity and make something yeah overly made with unity text yep it is it's using the actually don't even know if it is text mesh Pro it's uh if I go inside a unit and is it text mesh Pro uh the name text uh oh yeah it is textmesh pro yeah cuz I made it so long ago I didn't know is it textmesh pro or not so okay so basically I just need to modify one thing I think so let me just what time is it oh it's 500 pm. oh okay uh we just yeah this one is still constantly bugged constantly messed up uh uh what time is it uh what day is it just adding a little validation to make sure that it doesn't break things so let's see hopefully this should hopefully solve it oh and that one crashed for real okay okay now I don't even know if this okay just a second cuz I wasn't expecting this to break because if I try it over here it's going to break this one okay let's see now it's going to load tons of messages or is it going to crash or is it loading the but it seems like he okay so either way I think it is working maybe okay let me try making a build and see if this time it does work correctly there's difference between Games published on the Play Store and Games published on Steam well one is mobile and one is PC desktop something so that's really the main thing so if you do you want to make PC games or do you want to make mobile games that's really just the question okay that one opened up let me open up the control and hopefully now it should work let's see if it now works okay is it now working or is it still can you please not spam okay let me do something and see if my message shows up okay okay so did it get bugged again I have no idea why it oh is that why maybe that's why because it happened again huh interesting basically it happened cuz uh okay let's see does this one okay this one does throw null reference exception what is null why is something null some kind of user string is null oh interesting so basically if a user posts Say Non string although I have no idea how on Earth a user would be able to post a n string yeah so pretty much the YouTube API is returning a ning string and that's apparently what is breaking everything so I guess if oh it's validating oh if uh I put a string do is null or empty for this string if it is null or empty if so then let me just return just return empty string I guess yeah for some reason this is what was causing issues apparently still no idea why on Earth that would throw a non reference exception but let's see okay let's see does it work okay at least no errors and there's my message over there okay so let's see if this one does work so who knows maybe I just fixed one Buck it's kind of funny how I've had this little overlay around for oh let me just quit out of this one I've had this overlay for quite a long time and yeah I haven't actually had many problems as you can see as you can see this is actually made using Unity 2019 so I'm still using the exact same project the exact same thing and it still works generally well okay so let's see if things are finally working correctly finally without any issues let change the okay let's see is it working let me say something else and see if my message shows up shows up shows up and does show up okay great so yeah apparently the bug was because a message was coming along as no which would break everything so apparently that was the issue but yeah all right okay so that was hey Timbo yeah nice Rayman Sprite that was cool uh do messages have Rich next they did until someone exploited it so I had to disable it all right so apparently yeah that does apparently now it's all working good so let's go do you prefer a free game with ads or $12 games without ads me personally I prefer games without ads so I prefer to just pay once and that's it I get the whole game so yeah just pay once whatever it is two bucks five bucks 10 bucks 20 bucks whatever personally I do not like ads but a lot of people do so if you want to make games based on ads you can also do that okay so let's go on to the next one city named London which is actually funny cuz each of these has different names and actually if you download my utilities you won't find these names in there so if you go onto my website and over here if you download the utilities you will see that inside the utilities there is this code that I wrote for this game so the code to make the to generate the random names for all these cities there's a bunch of them inside an array and also for the for the characters I also made something to to to Generate random names because over here this game was all about randomly generated stuff so yeah I was uh all right so let's go move in and there it is a little cut scene again they go in and now they both have a pistol and there's actually a shop on this one it I don't remember the shop oh there it is that's how it works cost of three how much do I have I've got three but I a I could use a Survivor but I can't really afford don't have 12 and food crate I don't think I need food so I think I'm going to yeah I think I'm going to keep my my weapon like this H okay so already got a bunch of zombies and by the way they also listen to sound so whenever One Survivor shoots something the zombies that are nearby they listen and they move towards that position that's actually quite simp basically just doing a sphere cast around an area find all the objects that have Cs and all the zombies they all have CS so find those objects and just say okay this one heard this one so move towards this direction so adding sound to your units actually yeah going pretty basic out pretty simple okay so let's go got to find that one and then he's going to find so let me put this one over here shoot that one now that is going to attract a bunch of zombies and now either of these can shoot them nice I really enjoyed when I finally got this working uh being able to basally attract oh no shoot him shoot him grab him okay good on the way nice and all the body parts at the floor that was also really nice to make that was also something that I use the persistent particle system basically have them have them spot stop and basically blow up into multiple pieces yeah that was nice so I think in terms of particles the game still looks pretty cool so there's a bunch of a bunch of shells for every time there's a bullet there's some body parts there's some blood and there's some foot uh foot ceps Footprints so it looks uh quite nice please for your utility code or to use some tips if you just download the utilities and you read the code all the code is there all the source code oh hey George hey how's it going uh yeah so if you read the utilities all the source code is there if you just see you can probably see which ones would be useful to your games and so on yeah when do I know I have enough knowledge to start making my own game to sell uh it's when you make something that you think think someone else would pay for it that's really it there's no there's no test it just depends on your skills sometimes uh some people are really talented and the first game they make is something that is super awesome and other people are happy to pay for other times like myself you got to make tons of games before you make something that other people would pay for it so yeah there's really no test other than making things yeah hotline monkey zombie Edition yeah hotland Miami was actually really awesome that was a really great game also very tricky I remember playing it and finding it quite frustrating because it is a very difficult game oh nice got an axe that's cool I think the axe uh fires more does more damage than the knife so let me pick it up and doing all this inventory stuff this was also something that was definitely quite tricky what is the longest time you have been burned out not being able to progress on a Game Pro project that's an interesting question cuz actually for me I never really suffer too much from burnout just because I make sure to know my limits and not go over my limits on it so yeah for me burnout is actually something that thankfully I haven't really experienced too much so yeah basically know your limits know when you're becoming way too stressed and make sure to do things other than work so for me I have my dogs I have the gym so even on days when I work way too much I never sacrifice those things things so make sure you have things outside of work and make sure you don't work 24/7 that's pretty much PC games make more money than mobile games technically yes there are mobile games making millions of of things but uh if you want my advice don't make games just for money I mean if you want to make money there are many others ways many other easier ways to make money so I would say make games if you want to make games so yeah don't don't make mobile game just because mobiles uh tend to make more money or rather at the top you have the potential to make billions of dollars but if you don't like mobile games you will never make a mobile game that reaches the top so yeah that's something I'll definitely not encourage you to yeah uh make a specific type of game just because it tends to make money oh hey Rio hey how's it going it's been a while hey thanks so much for the coffee nice hope you're having a a great day nice moving let's pick up some wood and there's still one more zombie over there that one is the little overlay that shows up when the basically when there less than I think it's five zombies so up top we can see okay there's only one zombie left on this map so let's make sure to kill him so going to move oh gra that one that one is full move there okay you can let me shoot through the window and see the nice window particles there it is that looks nice yeah the window being split up like that basically there's a little sprite with the I don't know the broken window and then the particles for the broken window I really enjoyed making all the all the particles for for all those things yeah that was definitely one of my favorite parts of this game CH play this game from 11 years ago yeah it's quite crazy how it's been 11 years since I made this game that was okay both them are full it's been it's quite crazy how how time goes by super quickly boy this map is really too dark I'm going ready I'm going yeah let's go scavenge suddenly I'm full way too many things [Laughter] sh love your new channels hey nice yeah that was a a really really fun video to make that was definitely very interesting being able to make something very different from the usual personally it was a great learning experience learning how to put a camera on a tripod in order to film real life how to play around with lights make sure that everything works correctly I how to make sure that when I'm filming something that the camera is positioned correctly filming correctly to make sure that my hands aren't blocking the video and so on so yeah for me it was a really nice learning experience learning how to make videos other than just like this which basically the camera is static so there's really nothing to it in terms of preparing for making this type of videos but yeah making videos in real life definitely is quite a bit trickier show some pen tricks I actually pretty much only know two uh I basically I learned pen tricks when I when I was was a kid and over time I pretty much just just kept two of them that's it Mrs heart which game is it this is actually my first game it's called Survivor Squad and I launched it all the way back in early 2013 then onto steam in November of 2013 yeah that was that was quite a long time ago it's quite interesting I knew Unity for some for one year but someone 7 years experience left on my knowledge he bullied me I just disappointed I don't know what to do uh uh I would say don't worry about someone who bullies you for something I don't know if you're trying to learn I would say just focus on yourself just focus on learn your things if someone insults you then I don't know that that says more about them than it does about you so I would just ignore it keep on learning keep on getting better that's probably my best advice first video was awesome didn't want wife to watch it really okay uh nice okay Mission summary so scavenge a bunch of things almost got enough level up it's been a long time that I don't remember what were the skills that I made on the level up for dark power was expecting they cook clean while you cat that would be nice if they were able to do that but nope they just sleeping on top there they are sleeping they sleep like I don't know 20 hours out of the day but yeah I mean they're they're dogs that's all they're supposed to do oh all right so let's see another location so let's go well let's keep pushing out let's go into this one Madison would be nice to get another Survivor okay so let's go rck and Morty yeah that's a really nice right I hope you find the Survivor this time yes I hope so too got it let me just they have plans to go back to work on turn one Liberation yep that is definitely part of the plan sometime later this year not sure when but yeah later this year definitely would like to get back to that cuz that that game ID is really interesting so I very much would like to on it uh okay so let's start off no no no no no no okay knife him okay I'm going let's try doing it silently this time okay you come in on the way oh no no no no no no no there's one guy there's one guy shoot him oh save him save him save oh crap yes oh crap the alarm I don't remember what that I don't remember what the alarm meant how do I oh crap it's outside no okay it's going to be tricky okay you got to go outside go there go there you look down oh boy oh boy oh boy shoot him you shoot that one you shoot that one come go go go turn it on oh crap one of them got hitoo okay that was that was stressful Jesus there are so many okay found a little bit oh wow that was stressful okay nice shoot them all boom look at all those body parts all those bodies oh boy that was a fun mission that was nice I forgot about the about the alarms I didn't remember how did I add those all that time ago s post by follow your multiplayer course made own game with over 7,000 Vis yeah I saw that as well that was really awesome really cool and the game looks looks super awesome as well uh where's my tab not oh thanks again we go just on rdit was it on Unity 3D yeah I saw that post this morning that was oh is Reddit K sensitive isn't it okay oh it's not a crap how do you find the Reddit because I normally open it automatically red tt3d yeah cuz I saw that one uh that was really awesome it's really oh that looks cool uh oh was it no it wasn't it's one about uh do you remember the name of the post uh R it had my name on it kitchen caos course oh I think it was this one oh yeah it's this one looks really cool no it's not this one's the previous one this one is also really cool I was making a a restaurant Tycoon this was really cool yeah I made a video on this one yeah ghost Cafe this was the one so this was the one a year ago really awesome I hope that came is still progressing really nicely but there was another one like that I just saw it like literally one day ago may it was this one yeah it was this one nice look at that looks really gorgeous Bly it's someone who saw my uh kitchen cows uh course the whole free 10hour video on YouTube and me this video looks really gorgeous I really love how this looks that is really awesome yeah reaching 7K wish list that is really an insane amount that is really awesome so yeah look at the visuals it really looks really great right so yeah yeah reading this makes me makes me really happy I mean having someone who watches my my videos my courses and then make something this awesome and fine success and is able to pursue that dreams yeah that is makes me really happy to see so yeah definitely if you want to help them out definitely go ahead and wish list their their video their game it's a looks like a casual simulation game and yeah definitely looks very nice very relaxing so yeah so yeah reading this post I saw this post cuz I go on red on the UN 3D every once in a while so I saw it and yeah it was really awesome so yeah I hope this game does really well and I hope more of you follow this of learning from my videos and then go out on your own make your own games your own things and hopefully find tons of success yeah all right yep that is inspiration to all that it is possible yep indeed that it is what's the ideal specs required for game da the answer is whatever you have right now so basically you don't need anything special all right the specs those are going to depend on what kind of game you're trying to make so if you're trying to make something like Flapping Bird you don't need anything but if you're trying to make something like I don't know Call of Duty war zone a massive Battle Royale yeah that one is going to need a bit more higher specs but in general just use whatever you have and yeah that's probably going to good would you like to make a new survivor Squad as the next project with improv Graphics yeah that defitely I mean if I if I had more time 100% I would love to remake this game cuz again I I still really love this this mechanic of having the field of view and basically you can only see you can only shoot what you can see so basically over here if in the beginning if I had placed just this Survivor pointing there he would have died by all the zombies coming down here so I really like the idea that you have to position things in multiple places so yep I would love to make uh make a game like this again with knowledge that I have today I think it would be really awesome really fun I definitely would like to do that okay clear than loed nice y nice yeah it's uh I mean being able to build your own games is something really awesome how you made the field of view I actually made a tutorial on that topic quite a long time ago but yeah it's it's basically just firing a ton of rast so you fire rast over here and see okay it hit something over here so you score this point then move a little bit fire another recast like this find this point then another one find this point another one find this point and so on then with all these points you basically just create a mesh going from here to here to here to here to here and those and basically you end up with a little cone that's that's really it you make a ton of recasts find all the points that intersect what did I call line of sight so yeah here it is line of sight and it's basically just like that so you make make a ton of rast find out where they hit uh 2D physics objects and then basically just dally create a mesh using all those points to make all those things so yeah it's something that is actually surprisingly easy to do and personally I think I still think that this little mechanic still looks really cool and I still really enjoy how this game goes plan to make more videos on net code and unity networking Services uh yep definitely and at least I would like to explore net code for game objects because I haven't really looked into that one yet so that is definitely something that I would like Okay so let's level up a survivor okay I really don't remember all the bonus damage with melee weapons I'm not a fan of melee gains bonus damage against enemies currently attacking your team well I'm hoping they don't get attacked so keeping enemies away is vital bonus damage against nearby enemies okay that is probably good so let's go with that no no let's go with that one and for the other one okay maybe for this one yeah let's make this the melee guy Ali is going to be samurai all right so good got some some items got a bandage wood all right cuz I forgot cuz the the health is persistent so I need to bandage them if I if I don't want them to die there's a little little truck moving around with the pathf finding that was nice oh hey ashot another custom character nice St able to beat this game really yeah it can be a little bit tricky definitely oh crap I forgot I don't have gas oh I totally forgot about that oh right yeah cuz the gas okay now see if I was making this game right now I would definitely put a mouse over in order to explain why can't I move to this node the reason is because I don't have enough gas but this should definitely have some kind of tool tip saying why I can't oh hey and another custom character meow hey nice ah it's really awesome see a bunch of custom characters over here nice okay so let's try going to London and let's hope that this one finds some gas uh yeah let's just put a knife on that one that's it and let's move out boom there he goes we find the Survivor this time yep that would be that would be nice way yeah on it okay so let's go and let's actually start off let me start off with my melee guy okay going one do the pistol stay back no no no don't shoot him don't shoot him you crap I got hit moving okay so for the pistol guy you stay over there got it yeah yes this guy go ahead where just got to find the door somewhere going got it moving okay is there no door in this building moving I'm going okay I'm hearing noises oh crap on there moving on it where's the door got it on the way on it on the way check place this game overcook too y Rec 2 is awesome it's been a while since I played it but yeah it's a really cool game okay okay so that one is holding on but is there only door on this side that's the thing about randomly generating levels okay so let's start moving in that direction shoot him got it I'm going okay on the way yes on the way okay nice on the way yes got it okay I heard some noise oh okay kill nice ready all right so let me put going this guy over here no no no no no crap on the way guess now there's one coming in shoot him nice okay good woo nice please make a mobile game and publish it yeah I definitely would like to cuz I I've I only made one a very long time ago one of my flash games I converted them into Mobile but yeah that was definitely a long time ago so I would love to do that just to just be able to go through the the mobile process to learn how that one works nowadays because that is something that changes quite drastically over the years so yeah definitely something that I would love to do I love you so much okay that's nice cool I feel best when you learn something new my best teacher in this world wow that's that's cool that's awesome hey I'm glad my videos have helped you definitely go ahead and apply that knowledge to a original game nice uh are these levels rly generate yep or semi random basically each of these houses I built like I don't know like a dozen two dozen houses the uh the layout so I position all the all the various doors all the walls and so on and I think I also position the various points where the zombies can spawn so yeah basically I premade a bunch of houses and then for every uh for every world every map that I that I load into that one has a bunch of spots of which random houses are placed in there so like for the simple Maps there's only one spot where a random house is placed there others have like three spots so there's a random house here another one here another one here so yeah it's basically semi random there's a a bunch of handmade things and then a ton of randomly generated stuff okay let me try smash that one and there's only one more got it let me smash that one okay nice now let's clear everything going all right so much stuff to loot on the way ready on the way let's see okay he found a bandage that's good that's helpful you found some gas okay that's good so I was out of gas on the way yeah yeah oh you found some wood as well and some scrap would be nice to have some more gas I actually don't know how much that has got it I hope that has like I don't know like five gas or something but everything oh there's still one more let's open it do a little search doing the little search animation nope nothing in there it's not full looted really yeah I'm not seeing anything else yes okay there it is let's go go go yes yes with everything got another bandage and got some scrap got it still not looted got it on the way on the way I wonder if there's a different on the way on the way on it on the way I'm going on it okay maybe it has a different moving yeah cuz I remember there were some maps that had but I thought this was a small map on the way anyways probably has everything so okay nice let's go ahead and go back home death stranding is also a mobile game now is it is it available on mobile that was a great game I really enjoyed playing that one yeah it's a really nice casual game and personally I really like the story I know a bunch of people do not like death tranding because it's almost like more of a movie than it is a game because there are so many cut scenes but personally I really love the cut scenes the story and all of that so yeah that's training that was a game that I really enjoyed that was nice and let's go back it's Darkwood 2 Gameplay I I think Darkwood was actually coming out at the time that I made this game so 11 years ago like I vividly remember seeing Darkwood on on green light like Darkwood when was this one announced cuz it just came out recently or no in uh 2017 okay relatively recently but yeah I'm pretty sure Darkwood was announced at the same time as uh my game was coming out which was in 2013 so yeah this one had a long development time and yeah it also has a field The View mechanic although this one is much more horror focused much more scary but yeah I very much remember seeing this one on green light before it came out that was uh it was really interesting yeah it's on new iPhone oh interesting oh yeah C intermediate video please yeah the uh uh free video on the intermediate section of the C course that will be coming out I'm not sure if next week or the week after that cuz I still got to put the whole thing together in one video video and render the whole thing so I still got to figure that out but yeah either next week or the week after that yep the intermediate section will be going play Life Is Strange no suddenly no but I've heard great things about it so it's definitely one that's been on my to list for quite a while I heard the first one is excellent so I definitely would like to start by trying out that one why don't you gather teams to make big game uh it's because I'm not very good at managing people so is this one infected it is infected uh so yeah basically worthier strengths I am not good as a manager so I very much prefer making games by myself I find that much easier cuz being oh someone needs help why you need help on the way ready let me grab a pistol I'm going okay do I got the four Survivor nice oh is this the guy with the I assume you heard about the hidden L that was looking for a cure for this infection I know where it is oh that's cool or at least I know where to find its location on the way okay my L friend used to work his house is right there all right so this one of the custom missions nice there's three folders hidden in this roers within location of hidden Labs one of them is the right one yes on the way all right that sounds interesting got it and his alarm is surely online okay so there's going to be an alarm all right to keep them away while I search everywhere okay that sounds good yep yep I will help so let's go okay just got to make sure got to remember that Connor only has on it okay let me try doing this silently first try take down that one on it no noise try to look inside okay can't see anything okay there oh crap oh crap okay okay okay okay it on the way I'm going okay go on oh crap okay it's going to be tricky did the guy go inside I don't know if he went inside okay I think he went inside okay you cover the rest the are there no more zombies inside I'm going oh no there is okay X home Vibes if they are aliens yeah I guess if these were alens could be XCOM like okay so I really got to where's the where's the alarm how do I stop the alarm okay this is going to be tricky okay let me go with this with this guy outside I'm going okay that want to track zombies on the first location okay that's good the way the got it oh crap cuz I can't leave the other one alone no no no no no no no no no no no no run run run yeah I'm going the way oh I actually think that guy does he follow the first one I actually don't remember how I made the logic for it but yeah I guess that one follows Z person let me swap it out you give the weapon to that guy okay so you stay there and you go with me okay and let's go okay search for on second location can you find the third one no oh boy it's good that I made it have unlimited ammo I remember that was a question that I had and I think the answer that I came up with is just the okay so the alarm is automatic I think the a pretty good game 11 years ago oh nice thank you on the ground objects full uh it's basically just a single mesh okay let me just come on find the find the button to stop the alarm does he find it okay he found it woo that was that was stressful how old are you I'm 36 um yeah so the ground is an object pull no that is a a single mesh so I actually made a video tutorial on that for the persistent particle system and it's really just every time there's a little particle like a BL particle or a bol particle basically just spawns a new Quad on that mesh and basically the whole thing is just a single mesh so that makes it really performant and really able to support pretty much uh pretty much unlimited number of particles cuz every time I mean you can have like I don't know 100 meshes without having any performance issues and with 100 meshes you can spawn you can spawn 65,000 vertices so on one mesh you can spawn what is it like 12,000 14,000 particles so per each mesh you can have 14,000 particles and you can probably have 100 or a th000 meshes so yeah using this you can definitely have so look at this I mean the game is running pretty well and it was running pretty well back uh back when I made this so 11 years ago on my PC back then this was still quite performant and with all these particles all this Blood body parts all this stuff yeah it's uh if you bake things into a single mesh then everything becomes really super performant so it's a quite nice okay that guy did not oh is he waiting for the it let me just got it okay let's do a little bit of thing cuz right now okay so pick that one up let's loot that one loot that one on the way and for you let's pick that one up I don't think there's okay you go loot that one and you go pick up the wood and there's nothing else to pick up okay great guessing it reduces draw calls by a lot yep if you make a single mesh then y that massively reduces Rock calls let me shoot this guy ah he's moving away got to go outside uh yeah basically just a single mesh that is actually really good what are the methods for increasing performance when making for example zombie hordes other than object pulling uh object pulling is the main one uh for when you want to not necessarily handle multiple objects but handle spawning of multiple objects when it comes to handling multiple objects at the same time that really depends on that really depends on where is your bottle neck so basically the first question whenever you do any kind of optimization problem the first question should be or the first step you should do is basically use a profile in order to figure out exactly where your bottom necks are because if your bottom neck is CPU or GPU that is going to have a complet different solution so that is the main thing you have to do is figure out what exactly is the issue what exactly is the problem and after you identify that problem then you can actually work on solving it by either using a different Shader using instance instance rendering or something like that or maybe by going into oh no no no no oh crap he died no a got it oh boy I forgot that was going to happen on the way okay on the so there's one guy in there no he died no get him okay good oh poor guy he found the documents and then died look at those those visuals oh man again this was all drawn by me so this is all programmer art very much it's uh definitely super basic but honestly I think the units I think they look pretty cool I mean the portraits down here those are obviously insanely basic those are obviously not something that anyone would call good looking but I think the units over here the top down view I think these actually look pretty decent pretty cool so yeah I do think these are I think even nowadays I'm quite happy with the the result that I did without thanks for ear tutorials he nice thanks for watching them I hope you found them quite helpful yeah got a bunch of things another level up let's make this one also Ground Control make them faster when they are closer kill the action George oh poor George I'm sorry I didn't make it and let's go back start Game Dev and only thing that scares me what math concept should I learn when I make advanced game the answer is in Game Dev you really don't need that much math stuff so like for I mean you really just need to know basic Vector math that's really it so that you know when you have one position and another position how do you calculate the distance between them well you do one minus the other one so just some super basic Vector math so that's really the main math kind of thing that you really need to know cuz other than that you really don't need anything too complex so you don't need to know like Advanced countless that was something that I I sucked at I really hated doing countless in know that was really super difficult so yeah you don't need any complex math yeah just a bit of algebra basic math so yeah unless you are going into rendering at which point yeah you do need to have some really serious math skills in order to do all kinds of rendering Matrix multiplications in order to see okay the camera is here how do you calculate the view frustr and all that stuff that is all super crazy so if you're going to make your own custom engine then yeah that is that is going to be quite tricky but for the most part if you're just making games you you don't actually need too much mou nice oh nice oh yeah uh depends on what you code I forgot the name of the game there was a game pictures in a 3D World require oh yeah if you're making I think I know what you're talking about but I'm also blanking out on the name oh what is the name ah game perspective camera oh God now I don't remember what was yeah that's it viewfinder that's the one yeah if you're making a game like this like viewfinder where it requires some really insane math in order to be able to take a picture then do some math for how that object should be generate in the world yeah this is this is definitely something that would require quite a lot of math to make it right cuz yeah that part is making this mechanic work definitely very tricky it's a really amazing game I mean I suck at puzzle game so yeah not not my kind of thing but I can definitely admire the effort that went into making this whole thing work yeah looks definitely very chill very interesting looks very very strange and yeah being able to do all that yeah that that is insane having to do all the calculations to make sure that the Transformations the morphing on all the objects make sense when they take the image and when they are spawned again yeah that was definitely quite I imagine that that took them quite a while to get that working just right because that was yeah definitely quite quite tricky so to only explaining the math behind didn't understand anything yeah I imagine if I tried I also would not understand anything because yeah that is definitely definitely very complex game very complex math uh where's my thing go there all right uh okay let's clear another oh level two so this one is definitely going to be a little bit tricky so let's try going and let's see now hey thanks for the Super Chat do you own Unity stock I actually don't know I did buy a little bit but then I had to sell it cuz I I bought a house like a year ago two years ago so I had to sell them some things but so yeah actually right now I don't think I did but at the same time I guess that's a good thing because the stock Skyrock like crazy then Dro like crazy so yeah uh yeah basically definitely don't look to me for financial advice no I'm a big fan of unity in terms of the game engine but definitely don't oh let me actually yeah this one probably needs a Advantage so yeah I'm big fan of unity the game engine but don't ask me anything about stock the company itself nope that I do not know I have no idea right yeah some got got three yes basic math for G 3D oh that's nice oh that sounds cool being able to see a a book about math specifically about Unity oh that should be nice I'm going uh all right so let's go and see got it okay moving got it I would like to make this one also quiet so let me just put up on the knives moving M okay you look back ready oh crap this one has has a heart okay I got to remember how to deal with those I think I just yeah either we destroy the heart it won't be over yeah that's going to be trick he Super Chat cute let's flood his wallet so I can buy stock okay sure I mean I do believe that Unity is going to be really great in the in the long term so but again I don't know anything about the stock price of unity so I do think the engine is great and I do think that it's going to continue being great for a long time whether that translates into stock that I do not know so okay so yeah on the way let's try can I actually melee the hearts I actually don't know if I can melee the heart okay go ahead knife a crap you still got hit yeah on it okay so let's go nice and slow moving ready it nice and slow just using Mele I'm going yeah I'm going okay let's go in there oh crap oh crap crap jum ah slice him Jesus that okay that took a while didn't I have a okay I got a bandage okay good although didn't help too much yeah yes on it going on the way okay let me got it okay I think I can do a little stand over there so let's go on one let's start equipping the weapons it I really wish I had more weapons okay you go in boom there's a spitter oh crap where is he did I kill him no no no no no run run run run get out get out okay good the heart is gone I'm actually okay nice all right let you know just start watching your tutorial very good oh nice that is cool about 3 to four hours into it oh that's awesome yeah definitely keep going through it what do you mean destroy the heart yeah I mean this little this is like a zombie heart so while that one is alive the enemies keep spawning and after it is dead then they stop spawning and over there them continues going down okay so a little bit but yep o use D twe on this I actually don't think so I don't remember I'm trying to think I do think that I experimented with some I don't know if it was dwin or lean twin I think that I did use some kind of twinning library but I I think I experiment with it but not sure if I use it because for example for the menus for doing this kind of zoom up I think I use some kind of tning library but I really don't remember which one now but but yeah dwin is definitely awesome definitely it's one of those assets that is super useful and I definitely would like to make uh a nice review on it at some point because it is indeed a super useful asset that a lot of people might not know about and that is actually quite useful there is a book I recommend visualizing equations essential math for game devs what is that visualizing equations essential math for game devs visualizing equations oh and it's a c book oh and it's more specifically for Unity oh that sounds interesting oh boy I gotta say for me I am not much uh into math so yeah for me seeing this finds a little bit intimidating but I guess if you want to uh learn about math learn how all of it works and yeah this does seem quite interesting understand the dot product I remember that I had to learn about this one when I want to make a backstab mechanic yeah when I wanted to make this one I use a DOT product because dot product basically tells you if two vectors are pointing in the same direction or in different or opposite directions so remember I had to use that in order to make sure okay is the character behind so basically is the do product positive or is it negative in order to be in front instead of behind something like that so yeah I know that I I had to learn about that in order to make it work so yeah do product the cross product querian that is always complex confusing rotation matrices and Oiler Ang Les W that is yeah I guess if you want to look math then this looks like a really great recommendation yeah definitely yeah if you want to learn math to learn math then yep Ready okay let me just on the find that one over there and cuz yeah what time is it oh it's almost 6 cuz I got to make sure to finish the live stream before 6 to make sure that it doesn't break with the video going live otherwise it kind of breaks I mean uh YouTube basically only keeps the stats only shows the stats for the very last video so if the last one is a live stream it gets a little bit messed up so anyways let me just quickly go through all of these getting lots of stuff that guy's going to die as soon as he moves over so let move over there see if there's anything else you search that one shoots yeah okay got nice backpack Lind Allen game logic is not hard uh that game took like 5 years to develop so yeah I guess depends on your definition of heart but it is something you can do but uh yeah it is a a tricky game oh there you go Mission summary nice then multiple projects but always get lost on how to connect all the components together yeah that is one of the difficulties but not make a spaghetti mess like many components in game any any tips uh the best tip is really just focus on decoupling your code as much as possible so whenever you make a class make sure you don't connect it to another class unless you absolutely need to so like for example when it comes to UI that that one is the easiest thing to separate so never have your classes directly update the UI always make it through an event that way the UI is that way the logic class is completely decoupled from the UI class so basically the logic class that one just fires event doesn't care if there's any y element lising or not and if there is then that then that thoughts on the Observer pattern yeah the Observer pattern is where is great it's Prett much using events in order to have logic go just in One Direction instead of both directions so that way if you do that if you just focus on updating your UI based on events instead of having the logic L directly tell the UI to do that if you just do that that is going to help you quite a bit but in general yeah just focus on decoupling as much as possible trying to limit how many connections you have between your classes but yeah it is definitely a very very tricky topic so you definitely have to you have to gain experience and more experience you have the easier it becomes that's roughly how it is how hard is it to make mini Maps mini maps are actually super easy to do if you want to make something really basic so I even made a video in 60 seconds but it's basically how you make one it's based on the super simple way is just have a random text you just have a camera on top of the map looking downwards and that camera basically just seees some mini map icons so just do that and it's basically second uh second camera so if you want to do a super simple mini map yep it's this easy it's really super simple is it more performant if USE events that depends on the on the topic in question but yeah in general it's more performant to only updates something when something changes as opposed to updating it constantly all the time so yeah if you use events as opposed to on every update querying for an update yeah that is going to be a little bit more performant uh okay so yeah it's 555 so I got to make sure to end the live stream in a little bit because again I don't want to wanted to break the thing so yeah and if any of you want to want to play the game it's actually I actually didn't plan this but it's actually on the on the steam cell right now or rather if you want to there's a bundle with most of my games if you want to get that one or if you just want the where it is there it is the Survivor Squad it's actually on sale right now I mean it's an old game so it's pretty cheap so if you like the field of view mechanic and you want to give it a try you can go ahead uh it's been 11 years since I made it but it's still still quite nice tutorial on how to make these fil view effects but I couldn't figure out how to soften the edges yeah that one is that is the really tricky part I mean the answer is you got to play around with some kind of shaded effect that is something that I wanted to implement and I tried but I really couldn't do it because back then when I made this game I really couldn't couldn't learn how to do all kinds of things so yeah in general but yeah it's pretty much a a Shader effect so you have to look into shaders you have to basically create the field of view cone and basically you have to apply Shader in order to blur that out in order to blur the edges and and apply that so yeah basically look into shaders being able to blur things blur a mask blur a mesh something like that so it's definitely a complex topic though so yeah it's definitely not something that is super simple um okay so yeah and let me show sneak peek of the video going live in a few minutes and uh yeah there you go that's the video going live in a little bit actually it's a fun one it was an interesting topic that I it sounds like a silly question but it's actually something that has quite a bit of nuance so yeah I do think this is a fun video nice one so yeah this one's going live in two minutes so definitely stay tuned for that so uh yep for free yep you have to pay the 100 euro uh signup fee and but yeah that's really it and that one gets recouped as you make money on Steam but yeah you got to pay that one whether it's free or not except you have plans to make tutorial series and plugging your game into a custom back end like leaderboard friend list updating I mean I did make uh some videos on how to make an HTTP request and that's basically what you're asking so basically how do you contact a web server so I've got one on dealing with clouds uh on working with Azure Cloud but yeah basically download that inside of images that's how you contact something through an HTTP request and I made another one on the cloud mechanics that was a this was a fun video making a bunch of cloud mechanics and something all right so gotta go in one minute Super Chat hey thanks so much watching from M Learn and I'll follow your cooking one thanks for oh that's awesome thanks yeah I've heard great things about that un learn so yeah definitely go through that one and then I hope you learn a lot all right so yeah I gota finish before 6 pm. otherwise YouTube gets a little bit messed up so yeah that's going to be it okay so let me set this up and all right background like that all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here for this live stream I hope you have a great rest of your week a great weekend so yeah thank you all so much for being here and I'll see you next time all right bye everyone bye
