hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset stores full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games and there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for july of 22. in this first video i'll be covering a list of three assets and next ones i will be covering paid ads and tools check out the phone playlist to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do them also you might have noticed that i didn't do one of these videos last month the reason for that is because i was super busy working on my turnbased strategy course which is finally done after five months of work so if you want to take your game dev skills from beginner to advanced then check out the course and by the way check out my own ads on the store so far i've made the free healer system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your game and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create custom animated cursors to really make your game send out and finally the free health system which lets you easily add health to any object in your games alright so onto the top 10 list starting off with a pretty interesting tool for aligning your objects onto surfaces this one is a tool that does exactly one thing and does it very well you take your selected object and you can snap it and rotate it to whatever object you want this is a very simple tool that will definitely save you tons of times if you need to attach objects to nonflat areas so if you want to add a mask to your capsule or perhaps you have a spherical world then this tool can definitely be very useful up next if you need a bunch of cute cartoony heroes check out this one really great style reminds me of link's awakening features two characters male and female holding a sword and a shield also comes with quite a nice amount of animations about 15. and if you like this style and the quality of this asset then this dev has a bunch more packs with tons of characters and monsters then here's a bit of a strange one it's a zombie it's got what looks like some pretty nice animations very expressive they would definitely look super scary in a dark game with a nice model although this asset isn't really animations it's the controller that moves them so this logic of pushing the zombie and having it fall down in a nice satisfying way that is part of the asset so it looks really nice although not sure how the moving nonanimations works but if you're interested in free so check it out then if you have some flags in your game and you want to make them flow with wind look at this shader there's lots of parameters you can change to affect the wind intensity the texture scroll speed and so on so it's a pretty simple shader and it doesn't look great next up if your game features some house interior look at this one it includes 43 props all of them in a nice low poly style so perfect for casual mobile games or really anything where you want to build a house interior like perhaps making a game like the sims and if you like this style then this dev has tons more packs with tons more objects then for an interesting tool a polygon 2d collider solver collisions with weird shapes are always a bit tricky and apparently the default unity box 2d physics that physics engine apparently has some trouble with some kind of convex shapes so this tool appears to solve that you can easily create any shape and it handles collisions even with a convex mesh you can easily handle collisions even with these weird shapes up next something pretty simple here's a low poly ak47 this one is a very iconic weapon really nice style it features a folding stock and a bunch of attachments so with this free asset would be great to experiment with some kind of attachment system and also lots of the parts are separated so you can easily animate them then if you have a weapon you need some kind of controller so here's a free fps controller contains a bunch of the features that you would need for such a controller so for example it features smooth item switching it features head bob some movement enhanced effects and much more also includes a bunch of 3d models for the demo scene so there's a nice leather hacks crowbar and a bunch more up next if you need some icons look at this one it's a nice collection of items for you to use in your medieval games and you can easily adjust the background to get some nice rarity color variation and then for another interesting tool here is a upnp connector this has to do with nat and firewalls if you've ever tried to make a multiplayer game you know how tricky this is to manage so this asset tries to solve that by talking to your router directly to setup port forwarding all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unity ssr for july of 22. there's links while in the description and also check out my own free and paid assets on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos
