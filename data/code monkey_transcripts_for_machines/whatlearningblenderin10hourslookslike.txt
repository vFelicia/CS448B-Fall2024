hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and a while ago i mentioned how i picked up a bundle with some blender courses i had never touched blender before so i've been going through one of the courses and learning as i go along as a nice challenge i thought why don't i try putting what i've learned to the test and make a simple mini game all with my own assets that bundle is still active for a few more days so if you want to learn just like me go check them in the description i have 20 years of experience with programming but i'm a complete beginner with 3d modeling so i've just been following the course and practicing a bit in total i think i've spent about 10 hours learning blender here i will showcase the progress that i've made and what i've managed to build even though i've only been learning for such a short time i'm also going to talk about several very important things related to just learning anything in general so make sure you keep watching starting off with actually a very important stage in the learning process when you actually use your skills that's when you really learn so my tip to you on your learning journey learning anything don't just watch tutorials or courses make little mini challenges like this one in order to practice your skills it will help you learn much much faster okay so here is the design that i came up with it's a sort of city traffic simulation game cars have a start and end point they start they drive around the road until they reach the end and despawn they test for collisions so they don't hit anything and i also made a traffic light system but actually removed that from the final game because i want to focus just on the 3d models right away you can see there's no visuals so i made this game entirely without any visuals just using cubes as placeholders making the game itself was pretty easy i'm already pretty good at making games with unity so the design and programming was the easy part for this challenge i actually record the entire making of this game so i might do an overview video on how i made this in this video i really want to focus just on the blender part so the first thing that i modeled was the house which seemed like it would be the easiest it went pretty well i'm quite pleased with the final result although i definitely messed up pretty massively by not using any reference images i just drew a house from my imagination and i don't have a very good visual imagination only now that i'm recording this voiceover that i realized that i didn't actually add any windows so the final model doesn't look quite a bit weird but still i quite like it one thing that tripped me up was a scale for my house i wanted to be 30 meters by 35 meters so i just went into blender and scaled the default pointer q by 30 by 35 however it turns out that the default blender cube is not one by one meters it is actually two by two so with a transform scale of one one the cube size is actually two two meaning that caused me to have my house model with double the size that was pretty confusing but i just made the transform half size in unity and it worked great after that i wanted to model a car so i started with a simple pickup truck this time i first searched for a reference image and actually found one from a nice side view modeling the car was definitely quite tricky i messed up a bunch of times and the model ended up with tons of invisible edges and separate faces i'm definitely very much a beginner in 3d modeling and i still don't know many things about how to make some proper topology also it took me quite a while to figure out that i should probably look for how to mirror meshes in blender i started off modeling both sides until i realized that was probably not the best approach also part of the reason for this video is really to show you how we all just start learning from nothing sometimes i see some comments in my videos where someone is discouraged because programming seems to come so easy to me well for them it's so very difficult but really that's the misleading picture of reality it's not because i'm special or anything it's just because i've been programming for over 20 years naturally the more experience you have the easier things become this video is a perfect example of how i'm starting 3d modeling right from the bottom this one is a skill that i know nothing about so i start off as a complete beginner and i'm slowly improving over time as long as i keep working on it i'm certain i will improve more and more and maybe in one year i will be able to make some decent models as another example of the same point for me as a blender beginner it took me about two hours to make this car whereas if you go on youtube there's a channel called infensia and he has some videos where he makes 10 unique cars in literally just 10 minutes that's a very visual example of the power of knowledge and the power of experience he probably has as much experience in blender as i do in programming so he's 10 times faster and produces a much much better result so with the pickup done next up i made a sporty car i used a lamborghini as a reference since they're already pre and low poly this one went quite a bit better i didn't have as many problems with invisible edges and vertices and i also knew about mirror from the start so i think this one came out actually pretty well then i made a building just some squares extruded inwards very basic also used mirrors so i really only modeled a single corner just involved subdividing the face and making a simple inset then i just replaced some of my ugly cubes with this building i also played around with the collar to get some variety and i played around with the windows first i tried a solid collar then tried making them fully reflective and finally just making them glow i think the final one looks pretty good next up i made the environment around the city basically just a bunch of hills so i just made a cube with tons of faces then just raising a bunch of them painting them green and i place them randomly and over here is the final game you can see pretty huge difference between the completely empty scene and this one even though this one just has some basic meshes so oh no of course i still have a lot to learn but honestly i'm very happy with what i've learned in such a short amount of time my goal isn't to become a pro 3d modeler i'm still going to primarily buy assets from actual professional 3d modelers i really just want to know the basics so i can modify some of the assets that i buy and maybe make some things that i can't find anywhere for example when i made my factory mini game i had to couple together the buildings from tons of random parts and of course i couldn't find anything for making a specific grabber or a conveyor belt so that's the kind of unique things that i want to be able to model also my goal with this video is really to let you know that you can always learn anything only takes this time but as long as you put in the time you can really learn anything so you can learn 3d modeling you can learn drawing programming game development machine learning video editing literally anything as you can see i had never touched 3d modeling and in just a few hours i actually learned a decent amount so if there's something you've been wanting to learn then go ahead and give it a go all it takes is just doing the first app and then keep at it the more you practice the better you become as for me i'm going to continue learning blender a bit more i'm not trying to become a pro 3d modeler but i'd like to be able to make some simple lowpoly things and so far so good if you're like me and you also wouldn't like to learn blender you can pick up the same bundle that i picked up it contains since of courses i've been following this one just learning the absolute basics of blender then there's also this one over here about making low poly characters i want to go through this one afterwards then there's also one about making some landscapes making some pics and learned how to get a job in the gamedev industry how to draw and so on so if you're like me and you'd like to learn just go ahead and check the link description alright so this was a very different video from the usual but i hope seeing my learning journey as a complete beginner was helpful so thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
