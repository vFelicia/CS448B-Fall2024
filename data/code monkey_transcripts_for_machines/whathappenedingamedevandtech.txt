Unity updated their UI tools Boston Dynamics new robot is straight out of the exist someone made Joker into an open world game people keep asking about silong and more today is the 21st of April 2024 and you're watching The Game Dev report starting off with the unity AI update as of now all five Muse capabilities are now usable directly inside the engine you can generate textures and you can generate Sprites you now also have access ACC to the prival of the animate this one lets you generate animations from text prompts and behavior which lets you generate Behavior trees for doing things like enemy Ai and M chat is also now available directly in the editor which brings with it one huge bonus now it is Project aware I'm extremely curious to try out all these tools animate sounds very useful and Muse chat being project aware makes it sound like it's insanely useful for doing things like debugging or project brainstorming they also published a GDC talk all about doing AI inference directly on device that sounds like a really interesting topic so I'm definitely going to watch it he and for non AI news they put out a really nice really interesting 48 minute tutorial all about their game happy harvest which is made using urp it goes through how to model new crops in blender how to create textures and normal maps how to set up the lights set up the prefabs and even work with UI toen yet another awesome thing is the updated urp and hrp ebooks these are completely free and containing a mountain of information they are literally over 300 pages long these are super detailed super in depth so if you want to learn anything about how rendering works I definitely recommend you give this a look one developer has reimagined the movie Joker in Unreal Engine 5 as a sort of open world game although calling it open world game is a little bit of a stretch there's no real gameplay it's just visuals and animations but for that it is absolutely gorgeous they have perfectly recreated a bunch of environments directly from the movie these feature some insanely highend textures insanely high quality lighting more than anything this actually showcased the power of today's tools from what I can see this was all done just by a single developer so really impressive where inspector says that the next logical step for immersive Sims is multiplayer the game director that worked on games like Ultima System Shock and D X believes that by using multiplayer it can lead to more player athor scenarios so basically the kind of experience that you can create with tabletop games his Studio other side Entertainment is currently working on a game titled thick as thieves it's a thief versus Thief immersive similar game where players have to compete with each other in order to steal some artifacts and see who makes the most out of this open environment it sounds really interesting in theory although making an immersive Sim in multiplayer sounds like quite the challenge I would say the main difference between making some like a video game versus some like Dungeons and Dragons the main difference is the lack of a game master so this is actually one scenario where AI might be really useful in games having an AI with context of the game itself generates some really interesting scenarios on the Fly that could be an really interesting experience so if you're looking for your next prototype to try out this weekend maybe give that idea a try in a bit of nice news the devs for play dat have collectively earned over $500,000 that's over 150,000 copies sold that's a really very nice amount for what is a very Niche device the play date is a tiny physical handheld device with a really strange crank all the games are built specifically for this device these types of Niche things can sometimes be really useful for Indie devs even though you might not sell a million copies just the fact that there is so much less competition there's only a handful of developers just that might help you stand out although of course getting on these devices also is one of the things that requires lots of networking so it can be trick to get in but if you do get in it can have some nice bonuses over on Reddit there's two really awesome postmortem one is on the game seller settlers which is a colony building Sim with a really nice really chill Vibe on seam it has over 200 very positive reviews and according to the developer has stld 10,000 copies and generated 70,000 in gross revenue they launched into Early Access with 36,000 wish lists it was made quickly in just 6 months with a team of about four people and on the other side we have minim Lane this is a tiny cozy Street management game with some very common Vibes a 3% team built this game over the course of 6 months it's already got, 1500 reviews they have sold over 50,000 copies which equals over $200,000 in gross revenue this one launched with 50,000 wish lists the wish list count actually started off strong strong right away noways visuals are extr important so having a game that looks visually interesting and has a unique concept just that alone can push your game to the top right from the very beginning and then of course it completely blew up during steam nextfest these two I think are really great examples of how you can build something really awesome in just 6 months so you don't have to spend three to four years making your very first indie game my advice is always make smaller projects as opposed to really big ones okay so now let's move on to the tech News Boston Dynamics has unveiled their latest iteration of their Atlas robot they made a video showcasing all the iteration to get to this point it's really awesome it's really quite incredible how far robotics has come in just a handful of years the new Atlas has no Hydraulics it's only electric motors this is their most advanced robot yet one huge benefit of that is how it has no limitations in terms of movement some people think this becomes quite a little bit creepy quite a little bit like the exist but it certainly makes sense that robots should not inherently have all the regular Lim limitations that human beings have by having none of those limitations it gives it an insane amount of freedom in alternate universe if I hadn't gotten into gimd I would have loved to explore robotic so personally I find this really fascinating and now a quick message from our sponsor which is me if you want to learn how to make games or make websites if you want to learn robotics Electronics or just about anything if so then learning C is a super useful skill you can learn for free right now over here on YouTube with my C course you can watch the free videos or get the premium version which includes interactive exercises and a ton of other bonuses to help you learn by doing check it out to the link in the description the Met Quest 2 got a permanent price cut to $1.99 price is still one of the main barriers for VR adoption so I think this is great new at this price point hopefully it will increase the size of the audience for VR games which will hopefully allow developers to make bigger VR games with a higher budget and still make it work technically The Quest 2 has since been surpassed by the quest 3 but it's still a really excellent device it's the main one that I have and it still works really great in fact recently I've actually been using it quite a lot I've been working with a fun moap animation tool so definitely stay tuned for that video tomorrow on Monday also about meta they have recently released their latest AI model LMA 3 it has a version with 70 billion parameters and another version with 8 billion so so far the results seem pretty impressive it can be chat GPT on a bunch of scenarios they've also made a web portal where you can supposedly use it however it's apparently region lock so I don't have access to it over here in Portugal meta has been following the interesting approach of making their AI models open source meaning anyone can use it so you can go ahead and grab it and use it in your projects one topic that I would love to explore would be grabbing this model and seeing if I can somehow make it work using the inference engine of unity using Unity sentes I saw a post on Twitter where they had this La model working with a Raspberry Pi so if it works in there then I assume it would work inside some kind of unity game either on desktop or mobile Apple has started allowing emulators on their store and Delta has been added to it this apparently a really capable emulator so if there's any Retro Game you'd like to do then now is the perfect time to go play it the games work great and can be combined with a controller in terms of legality you really just need to own the ROMs of the games that you want to play you can play NES SES Nintendo 64 Nintendo DS game boy and a bunch more now let's move on to some gaming news a game 14 years in the making is now out it's called Herold halot it's a very interesting game with a very unique visual design just by looking at it for one second you can mly tell that this looks like something quite different nowadays if you want to send out you need to be visually unique and this is an excellent example of exactly that the game features a very unique stop motion style the gam playay itself is a story BR Adventure Steam Reviews are sitting at mostly positive with some of the negatives being fetch quests and it's a little bit too drawn out however critics appear to love it with lots of nines and tens across the board another interesting game that is fun finding quite a bit of viral success thanks to its interesting premise is called Rusty's retirement this is a game that you play at the very bottom of your desktop while you're doing other things this feels really like the perfect addition to the idle game genre instead of playing on a second monitor you can play literally at the bottom of your first monitor I think this idea sounds really genius and I'm definitely not alone the game currently has 6,500 followers which likely means over 70,000 wish list so whenever this one does come out it's bound to be a huge hit and for something a little bit less Jolly lately whenever there's some kind of any showcase like the the triaa initiative or the Nintendo Indie world event when these happen there's always tons and tons of comments asking nothing but silksong it's really awesome for devs of that game to know that people are insanely hungry to play the next title but at the same time it kind of sucks for all developers of all the games that are being showcased in all these showcases it feels like their games get ran out because there's a vocal minority of people that just want one game and nothing else so it's awesome to see the positive hyp for silk song but too much hyp can also be a bad thing although the great news is that Indie Games continue to be more and more awesome if there's anything you want to play in pretty much any genre you can always find something great and now let's go over to the quick F rounds over on Reddit there's a post questioning what exactly does $50,000 in marketing buy you one person who runs a marketing agency respond on what exactly you could do with it although if you are an indie Dev keep in mind that this strategy is very high risk IND the games are usually pretty cheap so getting a return investment in terms of advertising usually is quite tricky unless you have a super huge budget GTA V was apparently being filmed while in development with the goal of making some kind of documentary that that apparently suddenly has never come out if you're a fan of Game Dev documentaries I highly recommend the channel no clip they've got some really awesome ones and the first one that I saw that I absolutely adored was the documentary on the making of the game Broken Age it was part of the kickstarter I backed it just because of the documentary and I absolutely loved it then here's an interesting question why do most solo devs keep remaining as a solo Dev even after getting a massive head I believe the answer to this question is exactly the top comment on the post it simply says how managing people suckss personally I have no interest in managing people so even if one of my games became a massive hit I would not go out and hire 20 people and make a massive Indie Studio I'm really a big fan of making small games either ACC by myself or in work with one to two other people then a very common post about all the issues that you can find with doing indie game marketing nowadays and how it's really hard to reach people although in this example I would say just needs a tiny few things in order to find success but maybe I'm biased because I'm already a fan of the genre itself I wrote a reply to this post with my marketing tips for this have and maybe some of those might also be helpful to you and to end on a positive note here's a nice fun comic all about life after I really do like hearing people say that some like oh year 20s are the best years of your life and it's all downhill from there my personal experience has been the exact opposite I'm 35 right now and my life is 100 times better than doing in my 20s so if you're also in your 20s and you're struggling through life just know it can get better nowadays your 30s for and 50s can definitely be the best years of your life all right so that's the Game Dev report for today all these stories are linked Below in the description as you can see this is a new format that I'm trying out let me know in the comments if you do like this if so I might make it a more regular thing so go ahead and hit the like button button to let me know if you like this oh and stay tuned for a really fun video coming out tomorrow I've been playing with a really interesting VR tool that I think can be very helpful to Indie devs all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
