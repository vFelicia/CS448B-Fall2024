hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asaurus form of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video I want to check out some highlights for June 23 even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to unlock them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid ass and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and best known set systems as always there's only CS in description and as bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and while the Sim Festival is over my game demo is still available I'm planning on keeping it up as I work on the game so if you haven't yet had a chance to try it then go ahead give it a shot and let me know what you think also there's a Humble Bundle that was actually supposed to end yesterday but it got extended this one has tons of awesome tools and a bunch of visuals you've got some outlines which are Super useful in tons of games there are some nice shaders volumetric clouds a bunch of EFX a really nice split screen tool I'm planning to use this one in my own game there's a really nice crafting animation pack I've used this one in a bunch of videos and again actually the hammer animation that I'm using in my game comes from this pack and a bunch more stuff now Beyond this one there's also another bundle this one has a ton of royaltyfree music so everything from some action some epic trailers there's some retro game dramatic some romantic music a bunch of short actions and loops and so on as usual both these bundles are in a super deep discount at 97 off so if just one of these Aston looks interesting then the home button is worth it check them out to the link in the description alright so starting off with some really nice water VFX lots of stylized effects I love how they look they are some very high quality flip books everything from projectile slashes waterfalls and more all of it really high frame rate really satisfying next here is a spooky high quality character I really like design on this one the weapon attached to the arm and the Maze Lantern thingy it's a super high quality character with a bunch of animations so if your game has some kind of Dark Fantasy medieval style then this would be a perfect enemy then if you're making a retro game here is a nice UI pack it's got tons of icons bars buttons and lots of elements all of it in a really nice pixel art Zone then if you need some projectiles and explosions check out this one looks really good as always it's up to you to decide what the Commerce represent you can go really crazy with the colors to get some really unique effects next here is an interesting one it's a Historical Museum super high quality very detailed meshes a bunch of interesting dinosaurs so this would be a perfect level for a game I can imagine some kind of mystery Adventure game or maybe you could even take this into modular pieces and make some kind of level just like Doom then if you need some cute aliens here is a nice pack I really like this Dev they've got tons of really cute characters in fact the two main characters for my upcoming game come from this the dinky and the zoomy by the way go ahead and add dinky garnish your wish list one thing that I love about these packs is how all these characters they all have multiple Evolutions which would make this pack perfect for some kind of pokemonlike game or really just anything where you have multiple enemy difficulties next for some World building here's a great looking one it's a town Worm but it's in 3D I really like how all of the modular pieces match together based on design this really reminds me of the old school TS is kind of like Command and Conquer or Age of Empires those usually had some really high Cliffs with some very invisible and walkable areas or maybe just need some swords if so here's a mass effect with over 200 you've got some normal ones some very weird ones definitely tons of variety this style is somewhat cartoony and would fit perfectly with so many other packs now of course if you have swords you need sword animations then check out this one features over 80 animations of a character wielding a giant very heavy sword so all of these animations of the attacks feel really weighty and Powerful there are some regular attacks a bunch of movement and some really flashy finishers then here's a fun one over 300 food and ingredient icons it's got a really nice cozy style this would be perfect for some kind of Star Event like you've got some toes candy carrots drinks coffee some donuts and so much more next if you need some magic circle let's check out this one again it's up to you to decide what all these mean there are some that look very hilly and very angelical and some don't look very dark in their welcome all of them are really nice looking very complex you could obviously scale them up down to match whatever AOE or R spells you have then if you need a really gorgeous looking Sunrise environment check out this one it looks really great I love the style very inviting it's a nice Outdoors area with some tents there's a nice River and lots of trees so this one is obviously perfect for making some kind of game inspired by firewatch then if you need some generic scifi characters check out these ones they definitely look very scifi some shiny elements and armor with a bunch of colors so this could be great for a realistic multiplayer game for something more chill here is a farming pack it's got a nice low poly style tons of props and objects really anything you can find in the Farm is here there are tons of plants and footstuffs in various growing stages lots of vehicles characters trailers and a bunch more then if your game has a cute companion look at this one some very cute tiny characters others like scifi elements others like robots in total almost 150 prefabs or for something to suddenly unless cute here is a demon dog very spooky and looking very zombielike this one is made by Infinity PBR so as always it has tons of Sliders for you to customize it in any way you want next if your game has some building check out this one for me I'm with packs that have variations of multiple construction sages and this one has exactly that so you can see this being perfect for some kind of strategy game I can imagine just some villagers walking around hitting emmers as you spawn the buildings so great starting point for a nice RTS or something like that then for a very Niche one here are a bunch of paper plane models perhaps more impressive is I didn't know you could make all of these planes I only know how to make the standard one they all have separate body parts so you can easily animate them or maybe if your game is 2D here is a pack with a bunch of monsters it's some really nice pixel art I quite like the white outline makes it kind of one of my stickers I can see this pack being used in some kind of sideways turnbased strategy game with some basic animations for the attacks or perhaps for something more cozy here are some nice kitchens and props personally I love dioramas just like this they always look really nice so you can like to make some kind of decorating game or something like the Sims then this would be the perfect pack alright so these are my top 20 new visual assets
