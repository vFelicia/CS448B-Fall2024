hello and welcome I'm your codm nowadays having a big YouTuber or streamer player game can be the massive difference between failure or success it can get you tens of thousands of wish list before release or thousands upon thousands sales after release for example vampire survivors launch without much recognition but after splid cat covered it in the video it became a huge massive hit before that point it had sold almost zero copies and after that video it started a massive snowball that eventually end up with over 3 million copies sold so in order to get your games covered by these streamers and YouTubers in order to do that it helps you learn how things work from the other side meaning how do content creators actually find games to cover and thankfully some of these creators have posted some great info on exactly this topic how they find new games to cover and how you can do some things in order to increase your odds of finding success now for me since I usually don't have too much time to play many games for that the way that I usually keep up is by watching videos mainly from some variety YouTubers so mainly splatter cat wonderbots and Orbit on potato I normally watch these videos on 2 or 3 XP that's pretty much how I can keep up with all the tons and tons of awesome games that are coming out and funly enough two of these actually covered my game which was pretty surreal so here's an interesting post by wonderbots talking about eight separate methods where he finds new games to cover then there's another one which has a really awesome checking list for how to contact cont creators there's also a game discover code interview with splattercat and an interesting Twitter thread from Blitz who is also another variety YouTuber all this is tons of super valuable info for us as developers in order to figure out how to best contact creators and it's actually no surprise how most of them say pretty much exact same thing for me I I know the importance that con creators have in today's market in order to find success at any games marketing is really super important nowadays if you want to find success you need to do marketing I made an entire video with a bunch of my knowledge on this topic I frequently recommend the game discover code newsletter as well as the how to market the game newsletter both these are really awesome sources for indie game marketing I highly recommend you read them a few months ago I released my nine seam game dinky Gardens and I tried to apply all these sips myself and thankfully I did get a bit of nice coverage I was really happy to see a bunch of videos of people playing the game and the game has since hit my goals for Success so how do you contact content creators and the first really important thing to keep in mind is exactly what pit says over here the first thing is to remember that it's our job to First entertain the viewers second to pay our bills and third to promote your game so always remember to look at things from this point of view the goal for these content creators is like it says here first to make an entertaining video then to pay their own bills and only thirdly only a very distant third is to actually promote your game so make sure you do always remember that the main purpose of these cont creators is not to promote your game that's pretty much just an accidental side effect of the fact that they need games to cover so looking here at this really nice list that has eight methods the main one is email this is the one that is true for pretty much all content creators it's a simplest most straightfor thing just send out an email to all kinds of people however there's also a big difference between a good email and a bad email so there's this really nice check list for how to contact how to write a good email so first of all it should have an easy to parse email title so either first the game or make some catchy 5w hook again remember to look at things from the point of view of these creators they get tons and tons of emails so definitely make sure that your email is super easy to parse and read then includes some kind of release date any kind of embargo information although if you are a small solo IND The Game Dev I would probably not try going for an embargo in most case that just adds needless complexity then the basic game info so the genre available platforms price and a quick summary all super important is put a primary sront link probably a link to your steam page then if you do have a key if the game is ready to play if so make sure you include that game key very importantly do not make content creators jump through hoops in order to cover your game so don't say click over here in order to send me an email to request a key so definitely don't do that send them a key right away and hope that they cover it and then of course trailer screenshots or gameplay gift then the usual press kit including logos key art those are really important a bunch of screenshots some gameplay characters trailers game ass and gameplay gifts so this is a really use small check list if you follow this your emails are going to be much better than the average person for contacts here is an example email that I out myself where I obviously try to follow all these guidelines so for title I included s key because the email does contain seam key then right away the name of the game and the genre of the game so pretty much as shorten to the point as I can make it then just include the short description for the game I include the image over here including the reviews just so that they could see that the game is being well received and then of course importantly right up top over here is the steam key both the steam key as well as a link directly to the seam page then down here a ton more links so a link for the launch trailer some behind behind the scenes devlogs and then a bunch of logo assets importantly is how these are transparent pgs this is one thing that splattercat mentions in this interview so one big thing is to have a banger presskit with all materials needed to make some great thumbnails now I can tell you from my perspective as a gamd YouTuber that thumbnails are indeed extremely important over here on YouTube if the video is really great but nobody clicks on the thumbnail then doesn't really matter so making really great thumbnails is absolutely key and in order for these developers who cover games in order to make a good thumbnail they need to have the enough assets in order to build a great compelling thumbnail so that means that your game needs to be visually interesting and your presskit needs to contain enough assets so that these creators can build some really awesome compelling thumbnails if you want to see what makes an awesome compelling thumbnail if so you can just go and browse EV video list you can see all these videos and compare all the views between them that is obviously going to be dependent on the game itself the concept itself but part of it on the concept and part of it also on the thumbnail use and the way that they can make some awesome thumbnails is by you the developer giving them enough assets so in your press kit make sure you include as much assets as you can then over here for the rest of the email I just include a bunch of gifts I include a more detailed description of what the game is all about and in the end again reminding the link then on the email just make sure it's short and quick don't include a massive all text talking about all your game all the Lord in the game and all that blit points out the exact same thing keeping it short and including a link and some visuals and also don't clickbait so pretty much what I was saying a while ago if it says team key inside make sure you do include a s key inside so don't include some kind of dumb link to a Google form and force the Creator to do some work on their end make it as easy as possible for them to redeem the key and start playing your game right away let's post an example email from the game doe keeper this game is a massive Mega hit both in terms of sales and also in terms of getting creators to cover the game although once again it all starts by having an excellent game to begin with I would say this EML is a little bit too simple in order to convert properly but since the game was excellent and I'm guessing by the point that this EML came out the game was already pre popular because that they can get away with just having a super simple email just all the information nothing else just a simple link and that's it so do keep in mind that pretty much everything that I'm saying here everything in all these checklists and all this this is all really just a multiplayer that works on top of your game if your game is great then these will multiply your game and find massive success but if your game isn't as good or isn't simply as compelling if so then all of these tips and tricks won't really do all that much so anyways that's how you craft a good email but like we saw email is really just the first method that these creators find games let's see the other ones then method number two and three are both all about demos both the steam demos page as well as importantly the SE next Fest a lot of these creators make a ton of videos every time there's a seam Festival coming around so that's yet another reason as to how these festivals are super valuable to you as an indie game developer if your game does find traction on a s Festival if so then these creators won see your game even without having to see the emails and also an interesting note over here if you are Dev launching a demo on seam I highly recommend buffing up your branding it's one of the best ways to stand out especially against a crown of games with extremely low effort art basically to say that the Steam capsu for your steam game that's basically the little image and little icon for a game make sure that one is always super high quality so even if you are for example a programmer and all you can do is program an art I would still definitely encourage you in order to hire an artist at least to do just a capsule because that one does matter so much then method number four here we have an interesting One calendar sites this is definitely much more of a nich thing I do know there are some game calendars but usually they're really only available to either aleaa games or aleaa Indies so if you're a small indie game Dove kind of like myself usually these calend are pretty much impossible to get on to then next one is just social media in general so that I've said many times is how Twitter is actually pretty bad in order to find players for your games usually if you post on Twitter unless your game goes Super viral in most case chances are it's really only going to hit other developers so it's really not a great place in order to find players however like it says here it can be a great place in order to find con creators or potentially Publishers so if you can do that if you have the bandwidth in order to post on Twitter already if so these can be useful specifically for the point of attracting cont creators or Publishers however don't expect to find success with players themselves next method is Discord and specifically what he says here Discord is the best way my audience suggests games to me so as with so many things peer recommendations are really important sa if your game has enough hype that the audience for these channels the audiences themselves are actually suggesting your game to play that is a really great place to be but of course that is really difficult to achieve but if you can achieve that is definitely one of the best ways to get these content creators to cover your game then method number seven seam NE lases so at this point I feel that this one is pretty much just the UN luck of the draw sometimes you might launch a game and for some reason you might get lucky and some con Creator is is too bored and doesn't have anything to cover and they just browse it and they find your game but I wouldn't really rely on this one in order to find success and same thing for the other one sales so sales are great way to give your game a little bit more coverage give it a boost on the SE algor in order to find more players for your game and again maybe you'll get lucky and some con Creator W see your game for the very first time in play it but again another thing that I would not rely on so those are the eight methods but over here you also asked all of his friends that also do the same thing on how do they find games so splatter cat mostly finds games in his inbox and also browse the seam new releases but importantly only when things are a little slow retoration uses Twitter recommendation from friends and watch the tee new releases section then Yuri from IND gs.com apparently use the Game Dev and indie game tags on Twitter clamy from best Indie Games uses email as well as the contact form so as you can see most of these fine games roughly in the same ways if you take the time to learn from these cont creators and how they work if you do that and you follow these guidelines if so then it's going to greatly help your chances of finding success but at the same time let me make two notes here so first one is like I said all of these tips these are really just multipliers that work on top of your game so before all of this the first thing you need to do is pick a good compelling game a compelling hook a compelling interesting thing to play it all starts by that and these hips are pretty much just multipliers working on top of that and the second very important note is just make sure to not take it personally when things don't happen so if you send out all these emails you follow all these rules but you still have no coverage if so then don't take it personal remember that these con creators those are really just people they're all just doing their job so if they don't cover your game that's really nothing personal perhaps it got lost in the thousands and thousands of emails that they get or perhaps there were tons of awesome games coming out at that exact time maybe they just don't think that it's going to make some kind of entertaining video or perhaps it simply does not fit Their audience maybe it just won't make a clickable ball title in thumbnail or perhaps it's quite simply just not the type of game that they enjoy to play basically there are many many reasons why you might not get any coverage even if you try doing absolutely everything right so if you do get coverage that's really awesome but if you don't then don't take it personally so definitely do find these guidelines in order to increase your outs of finding success but also remember to look at things from the point of view of these creators again their first goal is to entertain the viewers the second goal is to pay their own bills and only thirdly it is to promote your game so I hope this info helps you find success with your own games if you want to play my own game you can check it out on Steam it's a fun automation Colony building defense game or if you want to learn all about C then check out my complete C course all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
