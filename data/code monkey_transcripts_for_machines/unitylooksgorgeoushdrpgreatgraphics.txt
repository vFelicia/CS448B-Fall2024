hello and welcome i'm your code monkey here let's check out this gorgeous scene that showcases just how good unity can look this is based on the high definition render pipeline which is all about giving you the absolutely best visuals possible this render pipeline is meant to target consoles and pcs as opposed to the universal render pipeline which is meant for running games on any device with hdrp you can make some extremely realistic stunning looking visuals and all of it based on real world values so if you set your materials cameras and lights with the exact same values as they have in the real world you should get some excellent visuals i've already made a video a while ago introducing agrp in there i talk about how to install it or how to add it to an existing project i go over the various options and tools and everything you can do to make your game look gorgeous check that video linked in the description now this one is the new template that just came out with dnt 2020.2 and it showcased the power of hdrp in three gorgeous scenarios first of all you've got an outside scene lit by the sun then you've got an indoor scene which also has some indoor lights as well as some sunlight and then a completely indoor scene they all look extremely realistic and despite looking so good it is also very performant i've got a geforce 980 which is a 5 year old gpu and the scene is running at 80 to 100 frames per second so it looks great and plays great now let's explore the scene to see how it works but before we do that this video is sponsored by skillshare skillshare is an

we've got our nice sunroof and over here we've got a really good looking unity sphere so you can really zoom in and see just how much detail it has so it's got some roughness normals looks very metallic and has a really nice shine and it all interacts perfectly with the outdoor light which is just a standard directional light on the scene you can inspect everything so you can click directly on the wall and over here see all the various materials and as you can see it's using the standard hdrp inlet shader so over here you see tons and tons of options this is just how detailed agrp can be so you don't need any complex custom made shaders you can use the standard hdrp only shader and everything looks gorgeous so you've got the sphere and then this whole thing is lit by the directional light so you can select it and see how it's set up and you can see how it's defined by temperature and intensity just the same as in real world values so over here you've got a certain temperature you can make the sunlight a bit colder or warmer you can play around the intensity and so on then on the camera itself you also have a lot of physical values so here if you expand this yep there you go so you can play around with sensor size iso shutter speed and so on so like i mentioned before if you have a knowledge of photography in the real world you can really apply that same knowledge right here then on the scene view if you're looking like this it looks all very clean but you can toggle gizmos and yep now you see everything that makes up this gorgeous scene so one of the things that you see you see tons of decals in order to make the scene look really alive if you select on decals and manually enable and disable them you can see the huge difference there's tons of them placed all the way throughout the level in order to make the scene look more natural and if you disable them it looks a bit too perfect so this is using just the standard decom projector and in the hierarchy you can also see and select the light probe and see how you have light probes all the way throughout this level as well as the same thing for a whole bunch of reflection pros so right here we've got a reflection probe for the outside another one for inside and so on okay so this is the outdoor scene looking really gorgeous then as we go inside we come across my favorite scene so this is a really good looking scene combining both indoor and outdoor lighting and it's got a really nice plant in case nonetheless so right away you can see some gorgeous volumetric light so look at that looking really good then you can see some particles made with vfx wraps so look at those butterflies yep those are particles you can also see a whole bunch of dust scattered throughout in here and then you've got examples of realworld materials so you've got some glass as well as some metal and by the way if you find the video helpful consider subscribing and hitting the like button it really helps out the channel once again we can pause the scene to inspect the whole thing so you can see over here it's using this glass material so you can pretty much just copy paste this material and use it in your own games then you also got the frame which has a metal black material and pretty much everywhere you look you can see some gorgeous lighting so if you look up here yep you can see just perfect lighting so it's perfectly complicating all the light some of the light bounces that come from outside bounce down there and end up in there if we enable gizmos we can see everything so you can see the sunlight comes from there then over here all of these ones each individual one has the sunlight so you can see it's using a spotlight and here you've got a mix of real world lights and baking lights so to see the lighting settings you can go into window go into rendering and lighting and here you can inspect all the settings that they use to make this whole thing look so gorgeous so you got tons of indirect samples and some direct samples then you also have some environment light and over here you can see all of the big light maps and just another lighting relating thing if you go into window rendering here you've got the light explorer and this one shows you all the lights in the scene as well as all of their parameters so here you see all their cold temperature the intensity the range and so on and as i mentioned previously we also got some really good looking particles here so look at this butterfly there they are all the butterflies just flying around and if they are particles and they are built using the vfx graph so you can just double click and edit it and up here you can see the whole graph see how it works and everything now i've already covered the basics for the vfx graph in another video so go check that out if you want to see how it works but yep you can just take this and pretty much copy paste and use it in your own projects so you've got the spawn initialize the particle you update the particle and then some output so you've got these really good looking butterflies then you also have some falling leaves and then here you also have just a whole bunch of dust so when you put all of that together you end up with this really awesome scene looking really really good then afterwards we go into our full indoor scene and by the way here we also see the transition so tons of exposure so it's really wide and then as we go in yep it automatically updates so the exposure transitions from really bright to really dark and then updates now that is done using a volume since again if you look in the hierarchy you can find all the volumes so right here you've got the volumes and if we turn on the gizmos we can see so you've got this volume here on the corridor this is a local volume with a certain plant distance and it's modifying the exposure and then outside here we've got the skylight with a different exposure so you can see on all the volumes all the various postprocessing effects that they have and on the global volume you can see all the base ones so you can see screen space reflections film grain motion blur you got some bloom really nice some ambient collision a bunch of fog exposure tone mapping and so on all right so here we go into our fully indoor scene so the outside light the outside sunlight is not affecting this scene at all it's only lit by these local lights and up there you also have an emission light here you can inspect the material inside it's using the curve wall and up here it's using an emissive light strip and it simply has some emission so that's that light then on the other side you also see a whole bunch of lights so these are standard spotlights and you can also see that they are also using a light cookie right in here so as i move yep you can see it move around so it looks really good so all that looks really great and we also got a smaller nice unity sphere and then over here we've got another scene so just nice chair and a whole bunch of lights so this is a great example of a fully indoor only scene so there's no directional light in here on all the directional light stops right in there alright so this is the new hdrp template as you can see unity is definitely capable of making some really gorgeous graphics to play around with it for yourself just go ahead create a new project using unity 20.2 and select the agrp template so this is a great showcase to demonstrate just how good unt can look you have all of these tools at your disposal all the shaders volumes and lights and it's up to you to put them all together and create something awesome if you found the video helpful consider liking and subscribing don't forget for a limited time the first 1000 people to click the link
