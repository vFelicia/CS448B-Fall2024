hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for November 22. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered the best three new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also Black Friday is happening right now there's multiple sales with tons of awesome stuff discounted there's UNT accessor of the best sets are on sale and some Flash Deals at 70 off the synthy store is also having a sale so if you need some gorgeous low poly packs check it out and finally there's a Humble Bundle all about learning blender 3D modeling at 98 off so if there's any assets you need then Now's the Time to get them alright so starting off with an interesting tool for helping your shaders in many ways you can customize the Shaded inspector making it much more intuitive you can also very easily create some gradients including having Parts in the gradient in EGR for some really interesting effects another great feature is the ability to pass an animation curve to your shaders instead of being limited to just instant floats definitely pretty interesting tool with a bunch of options that enables you to massively improve your shaders up next here is volumetric lights this is actually one of the assets that I'm using in my own game Total War Liberation by the way go ahead and add it to your wish list for the trailer I wanted the scene at night with some spooking lights although regular lights do not have a visible light shaft that's where volumetric lights come in and that's exactly what this tool does it's super easy to use you just attach a script to the light and it works instantly also has tons of options for making the light more or less transparent make the edges fade or not and you can even add some nice flying bugs as a nice particle system so if you have lights in your game definitely make them volumetric to get that extra look then an interesting tool that is very useful if your game has lots of text it's a audio text synchronizer like the name twice it lets you synchronize text alongside specific points in the audio so you can use it to Showcase subtitles at the perfect time word for word it features an easy to use editor where you can easily add all the timings so this one is a simple thing but if your game is Texas heavy it can add quite a lot of extra polish next here we have a fun simple tool it's all about adding shape to any object I'm always a fan of tools that do just one thing but do it extremely well this one has tons of presets you get the objects shaking exactly as you want it you can make it shake up down left right rotate you can make it sign based you can make it cool off over time there's tons of presets making it very easy to use next up is a fun tool that showcases the benefits of dots this one is a mesh slicer usually this is a precomputationally intensive task cutting a mesh in half at run time is pretty difficult but with the power of dots it's definitely possible this one works in a fraction of a millisecond so you can really get much better than that the demo is like fruit ninja but naturally you can use it for anything you want like for example building an awesome system like Metal Gear Rising Revengeance for a nice UI tool here we have a procedural machine it helps you dynamically generate meshes for your UI making them really nice and smooth and extremely customizable rather than drawing a ton of textures with all kinds of circular edges you can just use this tool to make them all really nice and dynamic so it's a pretty great tool for adding that extra bit of Polish to all of your UI if you're working on an action or fighting game take a look at this combo animation system it features a custom editor where you can drag and drop nodes to make all of your combos it looks like a really nice duel for quickly getting a hack and slash game up and running then an interesting tool called chirograph Baker what it does is you can write a Shader in shade graph and then export the results onto a texture so you can make all kinds of interesting textures which could then be inputs for all kinds of complex shaders but instead of having to run the generation logic all the time you just run it once and bake all the data into the texture it's a pretty interesting tool with some nice use case next up we have some clickable handles basically it's a collection of attributes which makes it insanely easy to for example Define a vector 3 and position it visually in the world instead of manually writing the text values you can add lines between the points add some labels add elements to an array you can add handles to other objects and show them all at the same time again all of it by just adding a simple attribute so it's super simple to use and then we have another tool that also does examine what you expect it keeps your camera at a constant width so you no longer have problems with some players seeing too much when using super wide resolutions as the resolution winds or shrinks the field of view is automatically modified to match alternatively you also have the option of always keeping the same field of view but dynamically adding some black bars to the sides if your game design is dependent on the player seeing only exactly what you want them to see then this looks like a very useful and simple tool alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the ents store for November 22. there's links to all in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also check out my own free and paint S1 store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some
