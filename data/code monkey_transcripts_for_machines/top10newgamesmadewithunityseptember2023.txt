hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with un launch in September 23 this month has quite a lot of games with some very unique mechanics and twists it's always really impressive to see just how creative some developers can be I've been covering new games on this list for over two years now and there're still games every month that are surprisingly unique the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts that to the test all of these games are inal impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month and of course let me start off my mentioning my own game which is now out it's a fun game with some automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you build a colony automate it and keep the tiny defenseless dinkies safe from harm you then colonize other planets gather more resources with the ultimate goal of colonizing every single planet and automating everything so your dinkies can just relax it's out now on seam I hope you like it and please make sure to try review with your thoughts all right so starting off at number 10 with a fun cozy farming Sim with a nice unique twist it's called paleo Pines the twist in this one is that it has dinosaurs if you're just looking for a fun cozy time then this is exactly what you want the dinosaurs are not just a visual addition though they have some proper gameplay mechanics the dinosaurs essentially act like kind of your tools you can ride them to travel faster or you can use them to help you do all kinds of tasks like for example gather resources there are all kinds of dinos both big and small you can jump on your D and explore this world find some unique structures encounter new plants and of course find and tame new dinos build your farm get some food and relax in this very wondrous world it is out now with 300 very positive reviews next if you enjoy tons of Loot and tons of weapons then check out God of weapons it's an action Rog likee where you climb a tower with some vampire survivors like gameplay one really really cool twist is the inventory system it's a really nice mechanic where you have to do some inventory Tetris to fit all of your weapons all the upgrades that you get all of those Come As Weapons which you must somehow place in the inventory The Twist is really how the inventory expands in strange ways face it's not always just a nice neat little rectangle it has some weird shapes along with weird shapes for the weapon which really makes for a really nice puzzle element to try to fit all the upgrades all the weapons honestly I think this is really an ingenious idea and I think it's probably the most fresh new take I've seen on this vampire survivors gameplay if you have a similar idea you'd like to build you can go look at my inventory Tetris tutorial to get you started this game definitely proves how if you take one very popular genre and you twist it in just the right way you can make something awesome and find some great success this one is is out now and already has over a thousand very positive reviews then here's one that is getting pretty much Universal praise it's called cocoon it's from the elite designer of limbo and inside and it certainly does have that kind of charm albeit a bit more colorful it's an adventure puzzle game so you explore this very strange but very gorgeous world everything is very alien like you play some kind of buglike creature with some wings all the bosses they're all very unique and of course with lots of nice puzzle elements you can interact with the alien machines and then there are even some ORS that have some strange unique abilities which you can then use to solve puzzles and uncover hidden Pathways honestly this definitely isn't the kind of Sher that I'm usually interested in but given just how enthusiastic all of the reviews are that really makes me want to check it out just to see what makes it so good it already has over a thousand overwhelmingly positive reviews at 97% positive so that's an insane amount next here's one that I'm sure that I've covered in a previous video on this series it's called beneath aressa I'm pretty sure that I covered this one back when it went into Early Access and I'm pretty sure that I remember that at the time I thought it looked absolutely excellent and very visually unique but from what I remember it also didn't do very well during that early access it only had a handful of reviews thankfully it seems like it had a successful Early Access and is now doing much better the game itself is a fighting Rog likee deck builder you choose your deck with various attacks and various abilities the game is very much character based every run gives you some exp which you can then use to unlock new unique Heroes you pick just one hero one companion and your deck look at description it looks like they added a ton of depth during early access it has many unique battlefields tons of cards and tons of upgrades you've got several Heroes and companions lots of enemies and some daily missions and just like I thought back when I saw it for the first time I really love how this one looks it looks really stylish it is now fully released with 600 mostly positive reviews next for something a bit more simple and just really very well made here is void crew it's a coop Focus space game where you control your ship you fly to various planets engage in space combat and gather some loot they mentioned Coop a lot so this really is hyper focused on that there's also a focus on customization both of yourself as a player as well as a ship you can man the turrets Define who does what tasks and you can engage in massive skirmishes with all kinds of enemies and you defeat them using various weapon systems hopefully you win the battles and then you can look for them for lots of goodies and lots of great loot it just launched into Early Access and already has a thousand very positive views and on top of that they also have a very robust road map so if you and your friends are looking for something to play regularly as you follow development then maybe give this one a shot next here's another very unique one called australa sixsided oracles it's a dice base deck building Rog likee so inside of cards you have some dice and a unique dual damage system one damage type lets you for example heal yourself or deal damage to enemies and the other one let's use some corruption which you can use to either damage yourself or damage some enemies some di can then use that corruption for massive effects so that leads to a really nice risk reward type gameplay you decide which dice go in your deck and you can play with the number on each of the dice looking at the trailer it looks quite complex with tons of abilities including several dice which can then be modified with extra dice so basically if you like games with complex Ru sets then this is definitely for you it is another one that is having an excellent reception over 1,400 overwhelmingly positive reviews at 95% positive then here's one with a very strange mix of genres it's called etern nights that strange mix is how this one is an action dating C basically it's the apocalypse and you go out on dates and find demons and some weird creatures when you're not exploring dungeons you can then meet a cast of five interesting characters you can learn about them and learn about this world as you go on dates and learn more about each character you unlock unique skills and spells which you can then use in battle every day has an interesting time limit so the question is will you spend more time getting to know your companions or going out into a dungeon to get some loot whatever you choose the clock is ticking it features some really great voice acting and some excellent 2D anime cut scenes it's certainly a very unique mix and one that lot of people seem to be enjoying it is out now with already over a thousand very positive reviews next for some VR here we have Hill sweeper VR basically it looks like Doom VR so first person super intense fastped combat in hell it looks to have some excellent movement mechanics you've got a nice grappling hook there's some nice hair dashes you can slice enemies with a blade or shoot them with a pistol it also has a cute demon wolf companion and the trailer also shows the player ping duol so that's a positive for me there's also something like a front flip movement I have no idea how this actually works but it definitely looks not for people like me who have a relatively weak stomach in VR in general it is certainly very inspired by Doom but it's not really just a basic loan it looks like a properly made game it has lots of unique weapons and some very creative enemies basically if you can handle this much movement in VR then give it a try it is out now with 100 mostly positive reviews then if you want even more card games here's another one called railroads and catacombs it has a visual style and gameplay very reminiscent of darkest dungeon you build your train you expand it and upgrade ated this is really the only safe space in the world then prepare your squad assemble the team that you want to take with you and you go out and explore the catacombs but remember not everyone might come back there are over a 100 card upgrades find the best combination so you can survive positioning is key get up close and personal or keep your distance they've got a longterm road map so if you're the kind of person who likes to follow along games as they are developed and maybe give the one shot it is out now in Early Access with 200 mostly positive reviews and finally at number one for something oozing with style here is El Paso elsewhere the very first second that I heard about this game I was immediately hooked all I heard was this is inspired by Max Bane and yep I'm in I absolutely adore Max ban for some reason that Bol time mechanic never gets old I find it just as cool today as it was when I first played it as a kid and of course the style itself the excellent narration the Noir style it's really such a shame there aren't many more games like it but here we have El Pas elsewhere which is definitely very inspired by Max pain and seems to be excellently wellmade it's got some more outer worldly elments so there's a bunch of vampires and you have to use stakes and bullets to kill them as you kill them you gain more and more bullet time which you can use to make some super cool slow mo leaps and shoot some vampires it's got a very dark and very moody atmosphere visually it has a really nice combo of extremely low poly and very low rest textures coupled with some excellent postprocessing and excellent Vol metric fog and lighting it really does look visually very excellent and on top of that the voice acting is just perfect just that perfect Noir Bas depressing tone normally my reference for games is primarily based on mechanics and not really visuals or style but this one is definitely the exception I definitely want to give this one a shot just for the excellent style it is out now with 300 reviews at 95% positive all right so that's 10 awesome new games made with Y launch in September 23 I hope this list helps you see how the unity engine is capable of building anything the onlys are really just your own skills and Imagination check out my own game dinky Guardians and I hope you enjoy playing it
