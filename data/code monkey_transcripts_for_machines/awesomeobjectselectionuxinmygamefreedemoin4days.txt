look at the awesome ux that I made for selecting objects in my game I can go up to an object like for example a moving vehicle now this requires setting the from and two buildings in order to work so I can click on this button and the camera zooms out and the game goes into a different mode where I can control a warm position then just checks for which round objects are around in this case it's only the container buildings so I can move the selector and I can select Which object I want I do the same thing for the other one and there's the moving vehicle quickly set up then I can also do the same thing over here on this dinky I can tell it to go interact with the power generator to get some power then I can go up to this one and tell it to grab power from here and drop it here and then go into this one to tell it to grab power from here and feed it onto machines so with all this it's super easy to interact with all the objects in the game you can go ahead and play the free demo on scene this Monday so stay tuned
