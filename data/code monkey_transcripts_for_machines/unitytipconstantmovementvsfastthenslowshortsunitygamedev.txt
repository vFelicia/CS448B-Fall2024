here's a quick empty tip so here is my player character and here is an enemy i want him to walk towards me however when i play the scene yep as you can see the movement was really fast and then really slow instead of being constantly a character should walk so let's see the issue here is the code the enemy has a reference to the player and completes the direction vector towards the player and then it moves its own transform in that direction however the issue here is that this direction vector has a magnitude of whatever the distance is between the player and the enemy so since the magnitude is based on the distance it means it will move faster the further away he is then slow down as it gets closer the solution here is very simple all we need to do is normalize the direction vector normalizing the vector makes it so that the magnitude always equals one so by normalizing the vector the distance will become irrelevant and it won't keep the direction now we can test again and yep there it goes the enemy is now moving at a constant speed no matter how far it is okay subscribe for more tips
