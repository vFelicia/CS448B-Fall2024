hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the assessor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for april 22. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered the best free new asset so go watch that if you haven't seen it and in the next one i will be covering the top assets and effects as always there's a link to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order and if you need some assets there's three sales happening right now there's a sale on the cinti store everything at fifty percent off all of them in their gorgeous low poly style tons of themes and for the next three days the kids pack is at 70 off and next week is the western fact then on the unity astastor spring sale 500 of the bestselling assets are on sale up to 80 off lots of great stuff including almost everything i've covered in my asset review series and finally there's also a humboldt bundle with a massive pack over 7 000 icons for 95 off so if you need anything for whatever game you're currently working on then check out those links alright so starting off with a very interesting hexagon generator easily generate giant hexagon whirls there's a bunch of tiles including some water and it also generates varying height so all of your worlds can have mountains the whole thing works with scriptable objects so everything is really flexible if instead of an entire world you just want to generate a simple room then look at this one personally i really dislike having to manually place all of the props so these tools are always interesting you just define the props and then play around with tons of settings and look at your brand new room if you use some outside props like bushes and trees you can even build a really nice outside environment the results look great and it even works for multistory buildings then a simple but useful one a auto complete drop down menu works with any text mesh pro field you can add a drop down menu then just start typing and it will show you all the matching objects this was specifically made to handle really big databases whilst being very performant so i can see this as being really useful if your game has tons of items weapons or religious objects of any kind then something else also pretty simple a nice image blur it's a ui element that blurs everything behind it so if you don't like having solid colors in your ui then this one would be a great upgrade it definitely looks much better in the demo and it's really easy to use just add the component and it works super simple then if you want a more complex tool for building terrains look at this one the demo shown in the trailer looks really gorgeous it's got a really high resolution terrain pretty much every short is really gorgeous tons of unique biomes you can easily create stamps and then stamp them on your terrain add some paths for your player to move or maybe just a river it also includes over 50 prebuilt stamps so for nonartists like me that's really useful up next for something very specific if you have some extremely valuable proprietary source code then a tool like this can make sense it basically obfuscates some of your code making it really hard for anyone to read it so it just turns all the text function names everything into jargon definitely a niche tool they've been building this one for five years so it must be good at what it does if you're looking for a complete game template look at this one it's about making a vehicle factory game there's tons of simple game templates but this one doesn't look quite interesting you basically drag and drop off the various parts to create a vehicle and then use it in a run it's a fun concept and if you want to learn how a system like this would work you can also look at my spaceship builder game then a tool that describes itself as an extreme tracing tool it captures a log of every single thing that happens in your game you can watch it working in real time you can see what called what with what parameters when it happened and so on really tons of detail so if you have issues with debugging then having this much information might be helpful up next if you're working in vr here's a photography kit it's really quite interesting you can basically create your own highend photography studio directly in vr so you can physically pick up a camera place it anywhere you can grab some lights change with the caller fov and so on pick up a second monitor position your subject and so on so it looks like it would be really fun just to play around this one or you could possibly use it even in a nonvr game just to go inside the game and take some really great screenshots of your models and over here we have another useful tool called asset cleaner like the name implies it helps you clean up your project folder so easily find all the essence that are not being used and purge them with a single click if you're in the habit of importing tons of assets when you just need a single one then this can be quite useful to keep your project from ballooning in size alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unt assessor for apron 22. there's a link so in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 percent off your order also check out my own free input assets on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos
