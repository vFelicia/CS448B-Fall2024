hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for december 2021 this month had tons of releases graduating from early access i guess they really wanted to reach 1.0 before the winter sale personally i love it when a game leaves early access usually it means it's very solid packed with tons of features and very well made and as a developer if you're planning to go with early access you can go watch the update list for these games to get an idea for sort of what players expect and how you should manage your early access if you want to be a successful indie game developer you need to keep up to date with what's coming out i make these videos once a month so i can learn which games are finding success all of these games are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also there is a film links in the description for some of the games are you looking for unity talent this video's patreon sponsor seriesgamejobs.com is a specialist hiring site dedicated to connecting unity teams with talented job seekers and contractors posting a job puts your company in front of over 10 000 monthly social viewers and costs just a fraction of promoting on linkedin alright so starting off at number 10 with no plan b if you've seen my video covering my gamedev journey then you know my initial goal for my very first game was to make a swat game but back then i was way too inexperienced i was unable to do some complex ai so i just swapped that idea for some dumb zombies but i'm always a fan of swat like games so i'm immediately interested in this one it's all about tactics you have your team and individually you click and then drag the mouse to draw the path that the character won't follow just a while ago i actually covered how to draw in unity so this is kind of that applies to a real interesting pathing mechanic you decide where all the characters will go and then you hit on play there are some games that work like this however one big twist with this one is you make the whole plan once and after you hit on play you can no longer change it so this game is not turn based or rather it's really just one single turn you define the entire path for the entire mission then you hit on play and hopefully you made a good plan and you get to watch your swat team go in and take out the hostiles the missions are precisionly generated so you have endless amount of variety and you can also build your own missions and share them with the community it just came out in early access and i look forward to seeing how this one develops then for a pretty huge release that just came out of early access over here is gtfo one of my favorite games of all time is left 4 dead this one features that same kind of excellent coop action but this time in a much more intense way it's very dark and gritty the game has moments of quiet suspense followed by some really intense action coop is very much the focus if you just run and gun you won't undoubtedly lose this one was in early access for over a year i think and in that time it gathered over 20 000 very positive reviews this one is also a really gorgeous game it's an excellent example of how good unity can look when you push it to its limits if you have a group of friends definitely give this one a shot but even if you don't the game also features bots so you can still experience it somewhere and up next fights in tight spaces this one is very unique from the visuals to the mechanics visually stands out right away very solid colors kind of like super hot it's a deck building turn based tactics brawler definitely a very unique blend you have cards with a bunch of moves from some very basic punches and kicks to some more exotic like a suplex or a spinning kick the cards have a damage amount some of them damage multiple opponents other cards are meant for evasion like a dash and there's multiple mission types from normal brawls to protecting a vip so all i know it's a really unique game it even has leaderboards and daily missions if you're the competitive type this one just came out after a long time in early access i remember seeing it when it originally came out and now that it's a full release i definitely want to give this one a shot it's a great case study on how to make a visually unique game coupled with some very interesting unique concept then over here we have pray for the gods the name is very strange it's prey praey it's a weird story basically bethesda sued them because they owned the name prey so they had to change it and they just put an a in the middle but regardless of the weird name the game looks great it describes itself as a boss climbing open world adventure game lots of movement lots of verticality the bosses are truly massive many many times bigger than your own character you've got a grappling hook and a glide ability and of course your own hands to hold on as tight as possible the focus is on the giant bosses but the game also features a large open world with a bunch of enemies a bunch of crafting and some really nice survival mechanics this one also just came out of early access and it has been very well received with over a thousand very positive reviews by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks then for some vr here is after the phone this one is made by the same developers that made the excellent arizona sunshine i loved playing that game it was definitely one of the best games where vr definitely had something very unique to the experience i loved it this one is an intense coop action game although you can also play solo team up with friends and take out the hostile undead features tons of weapons with some excellent gunplay which is always very important when making a vr game the whirl is a frozen hellscape which is pretty unique you can fight huge hordes with mindless and dead coupled with some very intelligent giant special monsters you can craft upgrade and wield a large variety of deadly weapons and some devastating powers it also seems to be doing very well for a vr game it just came out and already has almost a thousand reviews so if you are a vr developer then that's great news it seems like the vr player brace is just growing and growing and up next is shadow tactics icos choice this one is a standalone expansion for shadow tactics blades of the shogun that game was awesome i loved it if you are like me and you enjoyed playing the commandos or desperados games growing up then this is exactly that type of gameplay it's a real time turn based tactics game you have a whole bunch of characters each with their own unique skills weapons and abilities and you have to infiltrate and take out some enemy or enemy base stealth is usually king so take your time design your plan very carefully and execute also the game is just a joy to look at it's got a great art style and it's a gorgeous representation of ancient japan then for another one that just came out after a very successful run on early access here is kyubey factorium it's a very descriptive name it's a factory game with tons of cubes you can build massive factories across a huge world explore different biomes with tons of unique resources to collect build complex production lines with tons of machines at your disposal you can use conveyor belts and trains to transport your goods around and the goal is of course to automate as much as you can so your colonists can rest this one also features some heavy steam workshop support you can create your own items buildings biomes animals and tons more or if you're not into creating you can of course just explore everything the community has built i'm always a fan of factory games so i definitely want to give this one a try whenever i have the time then for something a bit more wacky and fun heavenly bodies it's a physics game set in the space station wiggling your arms around in 0g grab onto anything you can and just move around you can play solo or in coop the goal is to water plants mine rocks repair your ship and watch your head honestly zero g feels like the perfect setting for this kind of wacky physics games and i'm surprised this is the first one i've seen using this concept then if you want to be inside the vehicle instead of outside over here is frontier pilot this is one of those pretty serious simulation games in this one you pilot a scifi cargo ship with some very unique controls it's a vtol ship so vertical takeoff and landing it features some realistic weather and some realistic flight mechanics you can customize your ship to your liking change the visual and upgrade the equipment explore this unique world and transport your cargo successfully and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month over here is world box this one is based on a successful flash game and has just launched into early access despite that it already has over 2 000 very positive reviews this one is a god game and as a god you have the power to create life but also to destroy it however you don't have direct control over the citizens of your world all you can do is just nudge them in the right direction and observe how they evolve so will they grow peacefully or will they rebel and attack their neighbors you have tons of tools at your disposal to create the world as you see fit or to cause untold destruction these kinds of games really live or die based on the quality of their simulation since this one is getting such positive reviews then it must be great so i really want to play this one and study it alright so that's
