all right here's the secret about my game I actually left the developer console enabled so you can press shift and Escape in order to bring up the developer console and then type debug this is what I use in development to do all kinds of testing for example it's very useful to be able to spawn all kinds of objects without having to craft them I can also change the time scale to make the game go much faster I can give myself experience and automatically complete some research so all these commands were so useful that after a while I replaced the commands and just made a proper debug window so this has been great as a developer and now left it in the game demo just in case you want to play with
