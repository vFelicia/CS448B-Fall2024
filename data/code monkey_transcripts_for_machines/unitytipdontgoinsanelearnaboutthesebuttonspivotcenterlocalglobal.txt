here's a quick unity tip do you know what these two buttons do if not then you're bound to go insane at some point this button changes from pivot to center and this one from local to global if you don't know about that then you might go crazy when you try to rotate some object and it's not rotating along where the tool handle is that is because this two only set to center and not pivot it's the same thing with the rotation if the parent object is rotated and this one is set to global then you see the normal handles so for example it's very tricky to move this object along the parent's rotation axis however if you swap it on local now the handles are rotated to match the object rotation you can now easily move the child along the parent axis and here's a bonus tip unity now has snapping by default which you enable by clicking this button however it's only active if the rotation is set to global so if you can't enable snapping make sure it's set to global alright hope that's useful subscribe for more unity tips
