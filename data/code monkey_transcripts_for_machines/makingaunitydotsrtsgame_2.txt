all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day uh hey ashwat yeah it's great that you finally caught 10 minutes of it yeah uh I'm hoping I'll be doing this more regularly so you'll have plenty of chances to catch on days when you have a bit more time all right uh let me just copy this link oh is this something all right okay thank for great tutorials nice yeah thanks for thanks for watching them I'm glad the videos have helped you uh you're making this for the dot scores yep that is indeed correct so I've been working on the on basically building the Prototype doing all kinds of things and yeah still got quite a bit to do so first got to do the Prototype and then eventually it will become a full stepbystep course but yeah still quite a bit more work to go but so far it's actually progressing quite nicely Avatar check yep you're this guy all right is the music coming on okay levels yeah I think it's good it's on minus 30 minus 40 should be good all right okay so basically got a bunch of tasks that I still have left to do so here's my rough todo list there it is tons of tasks tons of things so still got to implement resource nodes the building uh Rally Point PD construction I've got to try out sound I still haven't seen if sound is uh working in dots or not I got to build a defensive Tower I think that one should be fun oh and just finish up the fog of War which is what I was building quite a while ago so that should be interesting and validate some stuff get more building visuals zombie visuals I've got to implement some kind of grid system using that so that's going to be interesting a way for units to randomly move around and some building placement rues so yeah definitely still got plenty of things on my to list so let's try to get a bunch of those done okay I just I just CLA nexted the microphone apparently it went way up so sorry about that oh hey wi games hey how's it going I hope you're enjoying dots since the 1.2 release cuz things have been quite nice can I ask you something yep feel free to ask questions and I will try my best to both work and answer questions at the same time uh so yeah basically this morning I was working on the fog of War system and I think I've got it working the only thing is I still got to figure out do I like it like this being a bit more um pixelated or something that is quite a bit more but yep I've got the I've got both f Wars so the active fog of War so I can't see anything outside of it then they go they explore they come back oh crap I forgot to enable the second one enable the second one and yep now it does work so there's a a persistent fog of war and a active fog of war and it is actually working quite nicely so and something else that I also have to also have to figure out is how to make the fog of War work with the visuals because right now I really just got a simple image on top of everything else so I really got just literally I got a bunch of Shader code in order to make some Shader magic in order to draw actually these images up here this is actually the fog of War texture so that one over there is the active fog of War so all the units so as I move the units you can see that little texture being expanded so that is the texture that is being drawn as you can see each unit has a giant circle on top of it so that's basically what's being rendered onto that texture but that one is just rendering just that one just what is active right now meaning if this unit now goes back that one now goes back so that is for the active fog of war and in order to make it persistent I basically added a Shader that takes two textures so the texture for the prist fog of War and the one for the active fog of war and basically just adds both them together so that is how I end up with this texture so it takes the uh active it takes the persistent multiplies both them together and I get the one that I use and then I can expand and go back and goes like this that's a simple system and yep the fog of war is actually working along quite nicely so yeah I was working on this this morning and yeah actually managed to get it working quite nicely so that was nice you have any suggestions for junior game developers looking for jobs uh I mean I think the suggestion is like the uh the main one which is R just apply to tons of jobs that is although keep in mind anything that I say on this topic I'm not an expert in finding jobs I've never had a quote unquote real job I've only ever worked for myself making my own gamees so keep that in mind but yep I would say definitely apply to as many places as you can and specifically for game development or programming art and so on definitely make sure you have some kind of portfolio that showcase your own skills I think employers prefer that quite a lot more than just having uh saying okay I've got a degree from some random place so yep that is my very rough um uh advice on that topic if you're ising simple low poly characters and stuff pixel F looks fine to me yep that's exactly what I was saying since the characters they are they're going to have a few more frames of Animation but it is going to be like this so kind of like a slow stop motion Style with very blocky characters and so on and I do think that with that having the pixelated fog of War doesn't look nice I could actually make this even more pixelated again that's one of those things that is just visual so regardless of whatever I decide to go with for the course actually I don't know which one was the yeah there you go just like that much more pixelated super harsh things which does have an interesting style but again you like I said so busily on the course I'm going to teach one thing but always keep in mind that anything that has to do with visuals you can then always improve upon it and make your own visuals whatever you want want to ask will the course be paid or free both there won be a normal paid version for the entire course and I will make a free sample video video here on YouTube still not sure how long but maybe I don't know like a third of the course so if you want to learn uh dots in general then you can just watch that and if you want this specific project with all these features then you can watch the whole thing so hopefully regardless of your budget you should be able to learn quite a bit hey Maisha hey how's it going uh none of my current project need dots but maybe I'll use it in the future it is definitely an extremely useful uh skill to have in your tool set and as always always remember that do you're not forced to go fully dots so you can definitely have a game that is like 90% game objects and then you use dots you can use either entities or really just the job system use that for those super hot for the hot path Logic for the things that run constantly like for example uh path finding so you can have 90% of the game using regular game object as usual then use a tiny bit of dots for the place where you need to that is definitely one great way to use it remember to pin something important good point uh okay so something important I just uh in case you don't know I just started the uh uh Game Dev report news for Game Dev Tekken gaming so I if any a crap the little icon oh crap I can't I can't click under the under the little hard icon okay that's tricky um yeah so if any of you have seen my my uh videos on the gab report format making those videos takes a ton of work so it's not something that I can regularly do but I can definitely write a a newsletter something a bit more common so if you want to keep up to date with uh various Tech Game Dev gaming news if you want that then you can check out the newsletter you can subscribe to it or you can just watch the Edition so this is the first one that I put out 26 yeah this was yesterday morning so if you want to keep update with news you can go ahead and sign up for that actually I enjoyed writing this so it should be fun I mean cuz I'm usually mostly keeping track of the news uh either way so basically just need to write a bunch of text to summarize my thoughts and it can be something nice for you to save today so that should be should be fun so if you want definitely check out that link okay so let me try to do a little bit of uh what if there is some interactable buildings behind the fog of War how do you make the player interact with them by mistake the that's actually something that I still need to figure out cuz right now uh this is really just a a visual thing so for example if I were to place some kind of enemy now tricky thing is actually over here on the scene camera because all of these are visible all the time can I actually cuz I can right isn't there a way to modify what layers the scene yep there it is right there so let's not see the mini map or the fog of War okay so that makes the scene view a little bit more clean uh but yeah oh and let me just stop clicking on these buttons so that's the fog of war and this one okay now I can click through it so yeah because basically right now the issue is that is really just it's just a mes like that so I still need some extra logic in order to know what positions are hidden under the fog of war and which ones are not so I still got to handle that logic but so far for handling uh all this uh complex interaction with the textures this took me quite a to figure out but I'm quite happy with the result it does work exactly as I want to so I've got the two fog of war I've got the active I can go explore then go back and that one stays explored so that's actually quite nice that should be fun what do you use to read your news are you subscribed to news sites or something uh a bit of everything so I check redit I check Twitter I just randomly read through things uh then I check for example the game discover code newsletter I highly recommend this one it's also really awesome if you want to learn about uh Marketing in terms of steam PC console and so on I high recommend you follow their newsletter it's actually really awesome so this one also has some really great things so that and various uh YouTube videos tons of YouTube videos for finding all kinds of things basically I'm constantly researching things from all sources and basically the only difference is now I try to write them in some uh specific place so that I can then go back to it I've been working on a comprehensive video lecture about game design docs oh that's interesting you ever use them in your workflow not really or rather my game design docs are super high level super General uh so I don't ever do something where it's like 50 pages talking about each individual thing that I'm going to do I normally don't don't go that deep but that is very much a personal preference sort of thing so if you do enjoy uh working with super detailed game design documents if so then definitely go ahead and use them it's just I would I wouldn't my advice would be experiment with both ways experiment with doing something just a high level overview and then go build the Prototype right away or build something a lot more detailed and then build a prototype try both approaches and you'll see which one works best for you because for me yeah just making something super high level and then working on the Prototype right away I find that works quite a bit better because otherwise on the game design document usually I end up designing way too much but then I make the Prototype and I have to iterate upon it in tons of ways and eventually the game design document just end up being outdated so that is why for me usually don't go super high level just a uh I usually just go for a Super H level over you okay so let me do a little bit of of work and then I will um talk about both project one page out vers 20 Page yep definitely so in my case very much as a onepage doc super super thing okay so let me do a little bit of work like something simple that I wanted to make was just a defensive Tower so how am I going to make that Tower so and let me just okay so this fog of War like this actually I should probably disable the fog of War right now but anyways just just leave it like that okay so let me make a building so let's see oh right and let me just clean up this code cuz he I was experimenting with all this so I don't need to do all that I I'm pretty sure that I do need to copy paste those and then do that one I don't need to paste that then just like this and nope none of this these were all the other person that I tried but nope just like this it works actually surprisingly well okay all right so on the building typ so over here let me put a defensive Tower some kind of building and now let me construct that building so as usual I'm using a script B object to handle the the types so for all the various things uh over here for the scrypto bone objects make one so this is going to be what did I call it I already forgot called a defensive Tower defensive Tower okay we got a defensive Tower like that let me add the list as well so wait oh I put the list on the building type as so list put this on the other window no not that one building type so list list list list oh it's on this one okay uh so I want the defensive Tower I want to do that when is one going to invite you on to the Game Dev show he has invited me several times so he said I'm always invited usually the thing is it's a timing issue so I usually watch a show like every every week I always just uh uh save it onto my phone and eventually when I'm walking dogs I listen to it I quite enjoy it but yeah usually it's a timing thing uh cuz usually I'm always super busy when I realize oh it's live right now so yeah but yeah I would love to definitely join up with them at some point that would be fun to say I bought your turn based tactics score since been such a huge help oh that's awesome hey I'm glad I'm glad you're enjoying it that was definitely that was a really fun one to both make and to see people go through it it's actually I think it's a really great one for taking your skills basically from beginner to intermediate advance I think that's actually a really great project for learning so yeah I'm glad you're enjoying it uh okay so I got the building type I don't think I yeah I don't have a prefab there that's one thing it's the prefabs on this are quite tricky so defensive Tower let we go inside it then I just need to come up with some kind of different visual so let me go a visual for the defensive Tower and what am I going to put it maybe a brown sort of thing all right it's on the visual for the defensive Tower put like that let me make it quite a bit taller and a bit smaller on this one so maybe 2.5 2.5 okay that's way too tall probably and is this one going to be selected that's a good question it's a good question I don't know I'll have to I'll have to think about that okay so this one is going to be a building this one is going to be a defensive Tower and it's not going to be a building barracks and I really just need to store the type right I'm pretty sure I don't need anything so so want building defensive Tower authoring and let's open it and let's write the usual boiler prank code so I've got first up here a public struck for the building defensive Tower this one is an eyee component data and this one is going to be empty okay and then up here a class for the baker implementing the baker of the type building defensive Tower authoring and just do it like that and here just need an entity entity get entity in this case this one is going to be dynamic it's going to move and then add component onto this entity new building defensive Tower like that yep I don't need any components just needs to exist damn how is the dots progress so far it's coming along nicely so I was working on both the minim map and the fog of War earlier today so yeah it's uh going nice still got a oh crap that went into the wrong hole uh still got quite a lot of work to do but so far it is coming along quite nicely so I don't want Barracks I do want health I do want friendly and this one is going to be a defensive Tower okay so now this one for Sho okay so first let me just place the tower so for that let me go inside the canvas and let me clone one of these buttons are these untable nope so why can't I click on them oh I disable gizmos okay uh building the gold Harvester the unity I'm pretty sure the unit that one is not meant to exist in the enemy let's put it all on the way out there and okay let's go one for the place building for the defensive Tower and let me place just a different image leave something yeah maybe in Black okay so now let's add the button for it so this one is going to be the building for building uh the defensive Tower so I've got that one and then when I click on it on the place building defensive tower on this one I'm going to place the defensive Tower and just down like that and it should work except I need to make sure to uh it's on the building type of so I think yep on this one I got a little switch for the oh crap I can't see under the under the thing so defensive Tower and I'm going to basically got to go into the en's reference so the building and I'm going to have to create one for the defense tower prefab go inside of this one and make another one for the building defensive Tower prefab okay so that gets that one that one spawns that one building defenses Tower prefab and that should be working so let's Place those references experiment with something new for the first time let's say dots current what approach would be the best like reading documents Etc uh my first approach is to go and watch all the video tutorials that I can find on it personally I really like learning from watching videos I can place a video on like two or three XP and very quickly get a sense of how the thing works so I try to do that but when it comes to things that are like on the bleeding edge something that is super recent like for example dots there isn't that much uh learning tutorials so yep in that case it's really just going into the documentation so the entities package and thankfully entities actually has a really nice nice documentation so if you go over here you've got tons of samples tons of code tons of text all all of it talking about what exactly is a world what exactly is a system and so on so thankfully the documentation is actually really excellent so basically that's how I do it try to watch videos if there aren't any videos go on to the documentation and then of course the most important process of all is actually open up a project a test project and start writing some code and try to see how exactly does it work so lots of trial and error read more documentation more trial and error and so on so something like that uh okay so this one did let me just drag the reference so that's the reference for that one I just need the entities reference for this one and let me grab the building defensive Tower wait did I not save it or did I not add to the authoring okay I didn't add to the authoring so the building defensive Tower prefab and then down here yep building defensive Tower prefab for the building defensive Tower prefab all right what does dots stand for Dots is the data oriented technology sack which is composed of three things it's the entity component system or ECS the job system and the burst compil if you put on oh crap my got something in my throat that's messed up basically if you put all three of those together you get some massive speed UPS so okay uh on the building the defensive Tower put it right there okay let's see if I can spawn some Towers so I select the tower oh forgot to put that one but Yep this work that is a tower okay good and I can select it and do something uh but yeah why is the oh I forgot to change on the button so let me go where's my canvas my canvas inside the canvas defensive Tower and this one is on the defensive tower all right great so I go and now it should be working what is the friendly component do is it just a dummy tag for identification yep that is correct so basically all the uh things for the player have a friendly and all the things for the enemies have an enemy tag so that is a super easy way so for example on the unit uh what did I call no the target oh crap now I forgot what was the name the target fine Target that's it the fine Target system oh actually this not a it's not a good example because the fine Target system this one works for both works for both the uh finding for the enemies finding the player and for the player finding the enemies so it's on the target component no it's on the fine Target that's it so basically I got a fine Target component that has a bullion for either this unit should Target friendlies things with the friendly tag or things with the Enemy tag and then based on that this fine Target system runs on both the friendlies and the enemies and then doesn't overlap sphere in order to find all of them and then if it has the target enemy meaning this one is targeting enemies if so then it's going to find if the uh if the entity within this overlap sphere within the uh search targate area if that one has an enemy component if so that becomes Target and same thing for the friendly so it checks if it has the friendly and so on so yep basically just a dummy tag component to identify which ones are player units which ones are enemy units like that one over there that one is a zombie building so I can clck and attack that one and yep it also works and this guy over here works with melee so he gets up close and yep does this right uh okay so for spawning the tower click and the spawn Tower okay now let's make the tower spawn some bullets now the one thing about dots is how it's um it's really interesting a data oriented design but it's also really tricky in order to figure out oh hey root Bean you're here hey how's it going uh but it's also tricky to remember all the components that make up the things like so for example on this one on the defensive Tower okay what does this one need it needs a selected so that it can be selected okay this one is friendly okay it has Health okay now it needs to be able to find Targets so it needs the find Target authoring and I'm pretty sure it also needs the target authoring that's the one that contains the actual Target entity right so it needs both those and then I think I also need the shoot attack authoring and do I need anything else I'm trying to think cuz yeah that's the thing it's always remembering what are all the all the components that are required in order to make the entire Behavior work that is one thing that is uh still a bit tricky to to remember but yep okay so that's the shoot point and the timer Max how often do you shoot let's say 0.1 to shoot really fast and for the find Targets let's find Targets every 300 milliseconds on a radius of something like 15 and I want to Target enemies okay so let's actually see if just like this if the tower works or needs something else any thises work all right look at that a tower that shoots as fast as a machine gun sping some more any yep all right there you go nice so there you go simple logic does work just need to implement some components and right away the logic is working oh did I spawn some enemy in in the fog War that's funny how to access I system I'm not sure what you mean I system is a is a interface that you implement you just have to implement you don't need to access it although if you want to access a particular system you can do this you can go through the system API to get a single T of some type of uh system that you have or get the nty related to that system so that can work is has component he dos equivalent to get component uh sort of but it's just a bullant so it just returns true if the entity does have that component or not so it's kind of like doing a get component and comparing against s so kind of like that although in regular code you also have has component just don't you now I'm actually confused do you have I'm pretty sure you do so if I go inside of this one dot it has usually get component has component oh it actually doesn't yeah totally forgot uh but yeah it's like doing get component comparing against null and yep if it is not null then does have that component okay let's go attract those two zombies follow me follow me to the Tower and now die nice all right so yeah the tower does work although it definitely does not make sense for the tower to rotate because this is rotating the entire object and Tower should really be fixed oh yeah right and Tower is also being attackable so I can place all the zombies there and they are indeed damaging the tower can they destroy the tower I assume so can they take out that guy boom he's all there you go Tower's gone enem is gone all of it is gone I can go spawn these TR shoot some enemies and the tank trying to go through all of them and so on all right I Noti you are using guy6 preview have you tried building the project cuz my computer freeze when trying to build uh nope I have not tried it I've been using guy6 to build this prototype but nope I haven't tried making a build yet so yeah we'll definitely try that out in a little bit I'm not sure if I install the module but yeah I'll try it out but hopefully it should work RTS means realtime strategy so games like Age of Empires command Conquer Red Alert Company of Heroes that kind of stuff uh right n I usable is dots for physics currently does it work with rigid bodies for say m dolls for example yep I mean over here for the authoring component for all of these so all of my units you can see over here for the authoring component it has a regular rigid body regular box cider and when convert into entities yep all of these convert automatically into their empty counterparts so they have a physics physics dampening gravity and so on so yep physics so far uh it's actually working quite well it's uh just need to attach the components and everything converts automatically into dots it's actually it's actually surprisingly nice this beginning is this a future steam game or future course it's a future course basically researching how to make a dots game using dots and that is going to be my next course but yeah I'm still very much in the early stages just building the Prototype got to build the Prototype then build the course and so on so so still quite a bit of work but so far it is working quite nicely there you go look at that the tower does work and all the zombies attacking all the guys that works nice uh all right but yeah let me add some logic to make sure that the tower does not rotate because the tower really should not rotate so how am I going to add that where did I add that logic uh okay now this is the tricky part find Target no one that one just finds a Target is it the shoot attack system and Yep this is the one that is rotating towards it okay so I guess I can go inside the shoot attack and inside this one I can put a p bull uh rotate on shoot something like this then up here do very much the same thing and then this one equals this so I put that and on this one I check the shoot attack and if the shoot attack value r. rotate on shoot if you are then rotate if not then do not rotate okay I think like this should be all I need to do now I just need to make sure that the the other ones shoot and the other ones the other where's my my pen uh those rotate those oh I still got the F of War textures here don't need to have that visible so let me just hide those that was what I was using for uh basically debugging basically having the textures visual so I can see exactly what the fog of war is doing so anyways let me go inside so for the tower the tower should not rotate so don't rotate but for the tank the tank should rotate so the shot target do rotate for the enemy fast do rotate oh this one is melee only okay and for the soldier do rotate okay so the solders should be rotating but the towers should not so these soldiers yep they are indeed rotating to find that one so if I move this one to get close enough and then rotate away and Y it does rotate in this shoot okay that's good or tank let's see if the tank is also shooting so let's go put tank right next to there and yep that one does rotate okay and if I put the tower and nope this one does not rotate oh so many Towers nice okay just like this already looking quite nice okay cool actually let me uh where do I have that the cursor system is that what I called it wait was it not no it's the cursor manager that's what I called it so on the cursor manager for uh wait what isn't this one now I don't remember remember which one did I did I check for the cursor mode where did I put it where did I put this logic oh I put it on the game manager okay that makes sense so on this one let's put it just like this and see how much it spawns than for all that you do your thought tutorials is very helpful for my small vampire survivors like game oh that's awesome yeah making a game like vampire survivors is definitely an excellent use case for Dots hey look that all those enemies and there you go the towers go down yeah I got to increase the the enemy uh shoot attack radius let me go inside the enemies the zombies you are finding targes on three units that is way too small let's go 15 and the zombie fast let's also go 15 now let's see now let's spawn a bunch of towers and now mountain of enemy woo nice oh there's way too many everyone's going to die okay that's fun and yeah even without any jobs any anything still holding on okay so that's nice and everyone's crunching together I think the fine Target system that is the main thing that is slowing down oh crap the tank is going under the Earth yeah that's the thing about about physics is right now they don't really stop they keep pushing each other so yeah everything does get quite messed up so let me spawn a bunch more Towers try to see if the towers can kill all the zombies everything gets messed up all right where's the difference between dots and game objects uh basically it's difference between using a object oriented approach or a DAT oriented approach which usually means massive difference in terms of performance so either you use objects like C objects or you use basically just structs just data and you modify all kinds of thata so if you do that things can become super fast you can support thousands of units and your game works very fast because just working with data as opposed to working with complex objects that have memory all over the place so yeah it's a it's a very interesting thing but it does require a very different way of thinking so it has great benefits great bonuses but it does require quite a nice uh learning curve uh did you see that AAR path finding Pros latest version has native do support oh really oh I did not know that oh that's interesting AAR death finding project that's actually very uh curious because this was already insanely fast using using his own custom uh uh multithread code it was already insanely fast so I'm very curious to see if he decided to why did he decide to to go for that that is actually quite interesting does he have a change log change log nice it's quite amazing how this one is still being oh crap uh is this everything is slowing down uh uh it's quite amazing how like it's constantly getting updates I mean I bought this for my for my first game Survivor Squad so I bought this in 2012 or beginning of 2013 so it's kind of amazing how I bought an asset that long ago like doesn't even show here yeah it was on version 3. something I think so I bought version 3 something and now literally 10 years later I'm still getting updates so yeah this is really a quite a massive awesome project it's quite amazing how it's still being uh being suppor it's definitely definitely worthy of being one of the main uh main things on the on the store how interesting doing NE mesh on curb NE meshes that's interesting nice that is cool yeah this one has so many possible things so many things that follower follower entity oh movement script that uses ECS oh that is interesting I wonder if it if it is using unties ECS or if it's a custom oh no it does use un ECS component that is very interesting so yeah I'm very very curious cuz again the code was already insanely performant using his own multithread code that I'm assuming he wrote by hand so very curious to see why did he decide to to do his own so yeah that is quite interesting yeah this one has local points yeah exactly yeah so if I was uh making my my own game then yeah I would definitely use it but over here since the goal of this project is to be able to make a stepbystep course I can't really use a a third party tool so I'll have to figure out my own way of implementing avoidance but yeah if I was working on my own project just for myself then I would definitely be using I mean pretty much all of my games I use pathfinding almost all of them I've used this asset in there because it is really awesome insanely fast so yeah definitely it's uh great to know how this one is really using un ECS so yeah should be really nice uh right okay so uh so the tower is working so that's basic the basic behavior that I want for the tower let me just make it shoot a bit less cuz that's way too insane so let's put it like3 or point4 something like that that should be a little bit better okay there you go that's a bit more oh right let me just change this one back to down instead of just being on hold see that is quite a lot of zombies all quite nice uh okay so basically my super basic Tower where's my my to list my defensive Tower okay that's good and the fog of War yep it is working well so far right now okay so let me place the uh the building placement rules or let me do the random walking just to get some I want to make some enemy units that just randomly walk around around a certain position cuz right now I've got an enemy then I have multiple other enemies on this one uh Define Target the radius and so on so let me actually spawn another enemy another regular no let me actually put the zombie fast this one let me put it over down to the side and for this one I want to basically randomly move around so for this one I'm not going to have some patrolling positions so let me do one for getting some random things long term Unity puts dots job CS burst on back end of existing op systems yep that's exactly the goal as far as I know so that should be really fun how many years from now if you use like the regular builtin Nev mesh in the background it's actually going to be using uh dots to make it super performant that is that's the goal so the question is how long will it take to get to that point I have no idea I mean right now things are pretty stable and the next thing they're working on is animation and World building so who knows maybe a year from now dot animation will be pretty good and the terrain might be better I don't know but that could be quite interesting oh good question fog Four Towers yep I did forget about that so yeah definitely uh have to add that up your content it's been very helpful for me nice that is awesome thanks for watching I'm glad the videos have helped you that is cool uh okay so yeah I need to implement the fog of War oh and the mini map did I have a mini map I think it did have a mini map but wait did I not have the fog of War on that one no I don't think I did so this is unit fast this one does not have a fog of War doesn't it I thought it did nope okay so this one does not have fog of War so let me just add it so this one needs a fog of War just put it on 0 10 Z and this one like that so it should be oh it's not visible but it should be there so for the fast unit this one now has fog of War Okay good does the tank have fog of War Noe tank does not have fog of War so let's go inside the tank unit let's add some fog of War put it on zero and zero okay and finally for the defensive tower for this one let's add some fog of War zero then zero just place it over there and that should now be working so actually if I go and if I spawn a unit I spawn a tower there there you go the tower can now see nice let me actually lower the poog of War just cuz that looks weird but then I'm going to have have to figure out how to make the visual perfectly match but so far yep I can move this guy moves around go back say like that go that like that okay good all right so far so good where was I is there a way of changing entity model animation or something I'm not sure what you mean by that changing into model animation or something I'm sorry I'm not sure what you mean by that there'll be a recording of the stream or full dots RTS guide in Channel eventually the goal that I'm building this for is for eventually making a course so yep eventually it w be a full stepbystep course I don't know how long maybe I don't know 15 maybe 20 hours I don't know how long it's it's relatively complex it does have quite a lot of systems but yeah no idea how long the final course will be but yep it will be full step by step from nothing until the final poish game so it should be quite fun love you your videos always help me when need that's awesome hey thanks for watching I'm glad they've helped do you have any project beside dots nope right now I'm mainly just focusing on this well this and the the thing that I mentioned a while ago the uh the uh uh Game Dev report newsletter I was writing that so if you haven't seen it yet this is the first issue so I was working with the figuring out the back end for this uh for this thing how do I write all the things and so on so yeah that's kind of my side project but for the most part yep just working on the dots thing right now would you use Gau why why not sure I would love to give it a try but use it uh consistently in a project probably not just because I already have so much knowledge with unity that it makes no sense to give up my 10 years of experience to work on a different thing so in terms of Oh I thought I changed it I didn't save it so in terms of changing uh completely nope but in terms of trying it out yep I definitely would love to have some time to try it out and see that hey new member Joseph hey thanks so much hey thanks for becoming a member nice um okay what was I doing I was all righty random walking so let me figure out out how am I going to let me think let me think so Bally just need to store the local position and then randomize different positions go to one go to the other one and so on okay so that should be a fun system to make so if I go make a random walking authoring something like this and on this one I'm really just going to have a simple thing right so random walking IE component data so I just have this one pre empty and then the usual Baker and I don't think that I'm going to need anything specific for it and I'm walking authoring I don't think I need anything oh crap what did I do did I rename something no don't rename Implement uh okay entity entity and let's see the end the and this one does need to work so Dynamic add component uh for this entity new random walking random walking so but then on this one needs a public follow three for the starting position uh and on that one huh I'm trying to think cuz the baker this one bakes the pref P itself so I can't save the position here okay that's actually an interesting question because I think I need to save the okay I think I need this one to be set when H okay so I think I'm going to manually set this as opposed to add this to every single unit otherwise if it's on every single unit and I have to make sure to update it otherwise units are always going to go into z0 okay so yeah so for now like this but yeah then I'm going to have to do that okay okay all right so let's uh let's try this so on the systems and let's go for a new entities I system random walking system and now for this one what do I need let's think so I'm going to need to do a system api. query I'm going to need to query for a ref RW of type random walking so I need to query for this so for each uh ref RW random walking random walking in that little query okay but like this it is uh trying to trying to remember how my uh wonking system works I think I have the the uh ref RW for the Target position I think that's what I'm using I got to remember again that's the thing about dots I always have to remember what is the actual uh component structure that I'm using because I'm pretty sure what did I call the unit move system okay I think it is this one that takes a Target position and then moves it towards the target position until it gets there and then stops moving and sets that to false okay good so that's what I need that's what I need so basally on this one so I'm going to check why is this one I don't know uh so if this one do value Ro is moving what did I call it move to Target okay so if you are no longer moving to Target that means this one is stopped if you are stopped then I want to give it a brand new uh position so I'm going to go into this one value rw. move to Target set that one into true and then go into that one and in order to set the target position and the target position won be something random okay good question how do I get something random inside of un mathematics I don't remember I think it's the random class y mathematics out random okay so I'm pretty sure this one I need to construct a brand new one but then I need to okay I got to remember how does the random class work R but shouldn't be in a Range yep so I just got to get a random distance a random uh Direction and then basically just multiply one of those apply it onto the original position so basically it goes to a random position nearby around the starter position so yeah but factor three down random that one is not using uh or does float three does this one have random nope does not have a random so I'm pretty sure that I have to get a random can use system. random you can use the normal one but if I'm eventually going to convert this into a burone job then I want to make sure that I'm only using uh uh ECS specific things so basically I'm trying to think of where do I CU I cannot construct a brand new random here otherwise the random position is always going to be the same one so I'm going to need to construct a brand new one but at the same time if I put a brand new random directly over here on the component then all of them are going to spawn no actually that could work or not huh cuz dealing with random that is actually an interesting question cuz basally the big problem is that random Works based on a seed and if I'm re if I'm using the same seed on the same thing then someone is going to be random oh use The Entity ID as the seed oh that is smart that is smart okay let's see about that one random random isn't this the uh this not ambiguous it's the unity. mathematics. random that's the one that I want so I guess in oh but does it work over here in the baking I think it only works afterwards because if I go random equals a new mathematics. random and this one now takes some kind of scene but over here yeah if I go to this one and get the entity index that one is does that not work do I have to convert convert to uint uint not unit uh so like this it's not going to work because this bake is only going to run once for the entire prefab meaning all of them are going to have so I'm going to need to create a brand new random with a brand new seed every every time that I make a new a new entity but other than that this should be working so this one creates a brand new random and then over here I can go inside the random walking not that random walking and grab the uh the ref r o ah crap no no no grab the value R that's it grab the random and now do what do I do a next load three do you have that do oh you have direction as well that is cool oh that is cool so I assume this one is going to be normalized okay so that gets a random Direction so a random Direction multiplied by a random distance So Random walking or actually let's put by a fixed distance for now and then I'll make it a random so let's make it 10f uh and then just need to add the other one onto it so Random walking ah crap random walking. value r o do the starting position plus that one multiplied by that okay so I think like this it should be working then once it gets to the Target that one sets it to to false and when that one is false it generates a new random position and should go kind of like that okay so let's see if all of this is working let me just spawn a new random unit and see if it does go to a random position a visual scripting course you made is really helpful nice yeah I'm glad it helped visual scripting is definitely a very interesting thing it is both very powerful if you want to use it by itself and it's also awesome if you want to use it as kind of like a stepping stone for learning code both options are actually quite interesting okay so let me add a random walking authoring now the issue is this one is going to go on to z0 okay so let me hardcode a position let me actually hide the fog of War for now let me hide both of these just so I can see that zombie okay let me hardcode this guy's position so up here on the random walking when we bake let's bake with a starting position put something fixed and it's going to be on 33.7 then 0 and 18.9 okay so basically it's going to get that one and now hopefully this zombie should pick some random positions around this place and never go further than 10 units so let's see let's see if it does work it's always a question wait is he flying oh crap I think he is flying nice you're not really supposed to fly but okay actually why are you flying isn't this one oh it's not updating yeah it is flying it's not supposed to fly but it is flying so let me just fix that really quickly so when you get a Rand Direction so a float three random uh Direction and and basally let's get the new L three for a Rand Direction but then I need to make sure that one is that one. yal 0f and then math. normalize safe let's normalize the random Direction and then I can use that one over here on this one okay now it should not be flying into into the air hopefully have you used copal it I I I used some kind of AI Auto auto complete a long time ago when when um when they had it by when Visual Studio enabled it by default but I found it so annoying that I disabl it like pretty much instantly generate the random float yep that that also works so both options perfectly valid uh so yeah I used it for a tiny bit but I found a lot more annoying than interesting that I eventually just disabled it and haven't tried it since but that was like I was going to say 2 years ago but I don't think it was that long like a year and a half ago something like that so now I'm actually looking forward to trying it out again cuz I have heard some great things about it so I did not like it when I tried it uh long time ago when it was very much in its infancy but maybe nowadays maybe nowadays if I try again maybe I will enjoy it so yeah I would like to try that out and see okay so let me see why isn't this one uh you got the random walking uh where's the move to position move to position Patrol positions melee attack find Target no where's the move to position oh it's the tget position okay so but why are you not generating a brand new one that one should be getting there and should be did I not write onto it okay I did not no I did write onto it okay so that's a bit strange isn't it why wait did you add the other one yeah that's not what I want that's not debug that I want I want the one on Unity engine use time as a seed you can but then it would break if two units get spawned on the exact same frame so it can't be time but using the NT Index this one is definitely perfect it just means that I need to spawn the random on every single entity as opposed to just on the bake so but yeah then when I spawn an entity I can definitely sort that out and it should work so right now just got to figure out why is it moving but then doesn't move again I'm not sure why you are not moving uh cuz that one gets there but then why are you stopping why are you not okay cuz it is constantly generating the same why are you generating the same bake work one time yep when you bake a prefab that works just once and then the entity that gets baked which is the entity that you then use for insetting that one is going to have the the exact same data as it did when it was baked so that is why the bake process runs just once so in order to make sure everything is unique I need to make sure to initialize this code every time a unit to spawn and not just here on the bake so when I make some kind of uh building that spawns zomb IES I need to make sure that whenever you spawn a zombie you have some kind of uh uh new thing onto it check the random into it yep I mean by by doing uh a new random that is kind of like injecting a new random into each uh entity so yep that is exactly what I'm going to do when I spawn a new zombie I'm going to run this code to give that zombie a new random based on that unity's entity as opposed to just this which means that all of them get the same thing but anyways uh why is this one spawning the exact same thing is because the trying to figure out if it's the because starting positions like that so it is getting some kind of offset oh I think I know the issue I think I know the issue the issue is that when you modify a random then I'm pretty sure you do need to save it again so I'm pretty sure this is the issue so I need to store a random for this random uh oh crap what did I right uh this one is the random inside of un engine mathematics wait is it not debug why why is this adding a bunch of random stuff oh cuz I had the UN engine okay uh so I spawn that random then I use that random to generate a brand new flow through Direction and then I'm pretty sure that I do need to save it so I need to go inside the random walking use the value RW and then update the random using this random I'm pretty sure that's what I need to do because yeah I need to use yeah I guess using a value RW that would automatically uh save it but like this it should work so I grab the read only I do a brand new one and then I write back the updated one onto it so let's see if that one works thought about making a cing game uh not really I got to say cars are not uh car games are not really my my my kind of genres so haven't really thought too much about it I've only done the super basic I mean honestly the most interesting thing that I've done uh with car was the the one about using uh machine learning what did I use yeah there you go this was a fun one this was a really fun project to research basically using machine learning in order to teach a bunch of cars how to drive through a track yeah this was definitely a fun one to make trying to set up the track trying to do all the things putting them all in training in the end it did work in the end they did inde theed train they went through all of it and they did manage to get through it so yeah that was a a fun project to to try out uh but yeah in terms of normal car games nope haven't really done much just because it's not necessarily my genre but yeah it is an an definitely an interesting thing yeah have you seen gam men's videos I've seen a few they seem very Advanced like used to work for Unity and knows everything under the hood oh nice I've only seen a handful of them I don't know if it was you or someone else someone else mentioned the the channel recently uh and yeah I added to my to my list to to be able to see it cuz I'm pretty sure I've only seen like one or two I thought the channel was like uh stopped for some reason I don't know I thought it was one of those dead channels from years ago but no currently still posting and yeah just looking at the titles it doesn't look quite interesting so yeah I haven't seen many of them but definitely got to look into it because just based on the tel alone it doesn't look quite interesting so so yeah definitely uh got to find some time to go through those doesn't look quite nice uh okay so is it working and yep it is working nice look at that the zombie randomly moving around goes from position to position never goes quite off the offset so it's got that starting position actually why is this visible hi it uh it's got that position and picks within 10 units of it just like that nice that is cool all right that's awesome so that worked quite nicely so yeah basically the issue was that that I was using the value R and if use that it's only read only access meaning it is not updating but the way this random works is you have to do a function in order to generate a brand new thing but after you do it is going to update this random but again since this whole thing is data oriented updating this uh this structure does not update the actual position in original memory so that is why down here need to do a a value RW in order to write back onto it and you now it does work so now for the uh random distance so float random distance let's go inside random and do a next a float does this one have a Min and maximum it does so for minimum let's say 3F and maximum let's say 20f or 20f that's a bit too big let's say 15 that's see random distance and let's go like this and yeah I'm pretty sure I don't need to yeah just like that it does work so so yep so this one should have that and then just got to figure out the the other issue about setting up uh not during the B time so I won't have to I have to see that that's fun quick question but fundamental how do you set up a game menu to hold the entity systems back before the game starts that is a very good question and honestly right now I don't know the answer uh I do know that is an issue because over here in this project I did import some assets in order to try try doing some things and when jumping into those asset scenes all the systems are working so yeah that is definitely one question that I still don't know the answer right now I will have to figure out how to make that work because yeah I'm really not sure I think the just again I haven't researched it too much but I do think one way might be on all of these systems implement the oncreate so public void oncreate okay this one isn't adding so basically uh implement the oncreate and then over here you can add uh system API that require no which one is it I never know which one requir for oh no it's the system State yeah I think that's it so I got to use some kind of system State and on that one require for update and then create basically some kind of entity that exists only on the game scene only on the main menu scene and so on so yeah exactly skipping yeah exactly so you've got the exact same idea that I have so I haven't yet uh tried tried that but I do think that is going to be uh the eest way to handle that basically I have one entity that only exists on the main menu one only on the game scene and then uh this kind of logic in order to make sure it works but yeah that is definitely one uh one issue that I uh that I noticed right away as soon as I loaded a different scene so yeah it's going to be uh but yeah hopefully with that option it does uh solve it quite easily I hope uh so I was going to say oh right just make sure that one works then test with two units and see how the second unit isn't quite going to work okay case that one is walking there it works then let's see if it goes to a different distance uh I can't quite see but it looks like it okay where are you going like that about 515 okay so yeah I do think it is yeah that one stop there so yeah it is working okay good nice all right awesome however now if I duplicate this one and if I put it over there he should randomly rotate around there but no he's going to go onto this position that is because the position is hardcoded so that is why I need to make some kind of system to spawn some kind of thing so actually let me try making a building so instead of having just the building zombie house let's try making a brand new building so yeah thanks again Joseph for becoming member and thanks again in and out okay so let's try building a quick new building so for that let me go inside the okay I've got way too many tabs open let me close all this and yeah I got the building type so oh crap building type so let's go inside of this one and over here let's make a zombie spawner so some kind of zombie spawner building and then I'm going to need some kind of reference so I can spawn actually no cuz I'm I'm going to manually place them right now so actually no need to put that I don't think uh all right start using normal dots until I start using Quantum for Photon oh this this Quantum from Photon does that one use dots or ECS I know it's super fast but I don't know what to use in the background that's interesting I mean net Cod for game object that is one thing that I haven't yet uh looked into I mean there are so many things to learn so yeah it's kind of tricky to find the time but yeah definitely I mean eventually if this uh if this game goes well then I would love to then make like a either a second course or just a quick free expansion on adding multiplayer to the game I think that could be fun so depending on how complex it is to add the uh building zombie spawner depending on how complex it is to add that uh to add multiplayer that could be an interesting little expansion for the building zombie spawner and basically this one is going to spawn a whole bunch of buildings so this one you got a building you are a zombie spawner and I'm going to need add the authoring component for it so a new bu in zombie spawner authoring crap I can't I can't read it behind the people yeah the little guys are amazing but sometimes it kind of blocks did I type it correctly I did okay good uh right so over here for a public struct building zombie spawner I component dat okay and then up here the usual public class Baker Baker of building Z zombie uh building zombie spawner authoring and on this one let's implement the class entity entity I can't I can't even remember how many times I've written this boner plate code but it's definitely been quite a few times so add component on this entity new building zombie spawner and on this one I'm going to need to have some kind of float for the spawn timer and spawn timer Max some kind of thing like that consider making a game as part of a team like d guardians but working with other dedicated artists and deaths for a sustained period that's a good question and eventually over the course of my life I would like to but at the same time I'm not very good at managing people so the idea of a longer term project as part of the team that sounds uh sounds quite challenging quite tricky but definitely it is something that I would like to do I mean in my flash days I did make some games pretty much as part of the team myself and another artist I did I think I did three or four it was the game blob Wars penguin plop awaken 2 and snail rescue yeah I think I worked with artists four times so I was a programmer with an artist so a team of two and uh it was a mixed experience some games were really awesome other games not awesome at all so yeah uh working with someone from for a long period of time does require a different set of skills that I'm not sure I have those skills right now so but ideally yeah cuz I mean I suck at doing art I I even suck at just finding Assets in order to use them in the game so being able to have a dedicated artist someone who actually has an eye to be able to figure out what looks good and just tell that person okay I need this building asset to do this kind of thing and having that person know exactly what to do yeah that sounds really awesome but yeah it's the find the right person and learning how to communicate and work with two people that would be quite a quite a an interesting thing if it works awesome if it doesn't work nightmare so yeah I guess I'm a little bit uh risk avoidant so that is why usually I just stick with myself maybe contract an artist but uh yeah kind of like that okay so let me just spawn down one and for the spawn timer start z f for the spawn timer Max and let's say2 F and then we shall see okay so this one is super simple just add the authoring component and that should work now let's see so the building zombie spawner so building zombie spawner let's attach that one doesn't need anything else okay good so now let's make a system for it so entities I system so building zombie spawner system now let see what about path finding uh for this I'm planning to go with flow flow field pathf finding which is something that I've never actually Ed myself I've I've studied how the algorithm works but I've never actually implemented it so that it's going to be an interesting uh personal challenge trying to figure out because I do think for this game which the whole idea is uh is kind of like the game they are billions I don't know how many of you know that steam power.com uh basically the idea is having they are billions basally the only idea is having tons and tons of things yeah flow field is definitely really interesting and for this many zombies uh for this many enemies then yeah doing this with AAR is pretty much impossible so for this kind of scale for this many enemies slow field really is the the perfect use case for it so that is why for this project I'm working on that yeah trying to find something that works with this many units cting path finding for each individual one of of those is really tricky but cating flow field you just callate the entire flow field for the entire world and then it doesn't matter how many units you have they just follow the flow field so that should be quite an interesting one yeah that should be uh quite nice so yeah I've never implemented myself so I'm very curious as a nice personal challenge trying to figure out yeah basically how fluid Sims work just calate the vectors just follow the vectors no matter how many there are and it should be quite fun so this may the query what do I want I want the building zombie zombie spawner I want this component what else do I want so this one is for uh spawning them okay so I am going to need the uh entities references so I do need a reference to that one so here oh actually I already have don't I yeah I do have the zombie pref okay so I've got the okay uh so basically all right let's uh do this so for each uh building zombie spawner no this one is W RW on this one for the building zombie spawner okay in the system do query on that uh R part though missing one okay so would zombies be an incompressible fluid that's a good question I I guess if zombies exist in real life I think they would be quite compressible meaning I think they would squish each other so the zombies in front they would get all messed up poor zombies so yeah I guess so do you play chess not really but it's something that I've always wanted to to learn like I know the absolute Basics but yeah I've never really gotten past that but yeah chess is really interesting definitely something I would love to learn uh okay so building zombie spawner so let's go in building zombie spawner let's grab the value RW let's grab the timer minus equals the system api. time. time okay count down the timer and if the timer if it is under zero if so then let's put that one equals that one. Max and now let's spawn the zombie and now let me remember how do I spawn zombies cuz I don't remember I always need to remember how to uh is it through the system API I think it is yeah I think it is so let's go into the system API instantiate nope entity manager nope how do I instantiate uh it's not this one oh it's from the state that's it I always forget cuz it's always there are so many things on so many places that it's always tricky to remember where it is okay so I've got to go inside the state get the single not the single T again I think on this one is on the system API I get single 10 yeah that's what I want for the entities references okay for the enties references for this one so I grab this one right here and then I insentient for the zombie entity and now here is the tricky thing so it's now over here oh good question do I add the component or add it by default I think it's actually that's a good question I haven't yet seen what happens if I try to add a component if the entity already has that component I actually don't know does it throw an error or does it just uh duplicated so let's try so I want the uh random walking so let's try putting this one on the starting position oh yeah I didn't even set the position for this one so the position I guess I need this so the ref R local transform for this one so let's get the ref local transform local transform get the transform in order to get the position for this unit because yeah I need to spawn the zombie entity and and state on en manager actually uh cuz I think this one doesn't this one have yeah this one does have set component again that is one thing that is always very confusing which one yeah you said component yeah thanks yeah which one system API using State I don't know which one but anyway so for this one let's try going to the zombie entity uh new local transform actually do I yeah if I do new it's going to be uh quite messed up so I do new. from position and on this position local transform. val. position okay so it's going to spawn on this position then for this one yeah generally system API is preferred yeah that's what I've heard but it's it's always so confusing how there are so many but apparently it doesn't have okay so so system API has set component but does not have ADD component so yep okay so apparently that one can set but cannot add a component and I want to test if the uh add component if that one does work or if it throws some kind of air okay so for the starting position that one is going to be the same as this one right here and with where you wait what cannot convert to component type wait am I using the game object what is a component type don't think you can use manager for structural change I think you can as long as it doesn't uh doesn't break this query which in this case I'm not spawning any building so in this case it should work but why is it not like what am I missing here I'm using the entity what is the component type add component can only add components by oh is that it so I add the type and then I I'm trying to think I mean I guess that's it but yeah I guess I can add a type of is that what it wants me to do do type of that one so I add the component and then I set the component is that what it wants me to do I'm pretty sure that I've done add component before didn't I Maybe not maybe maybe not anyways so let's see if this one does work so new random walking put inside the new random walking then with the start position yeah first add and then set okay although it seems like there should be a way to add and set the same time but anyways yep using an N command buffer yeah exactly if I I was uh what was I doing there was an oh yeah I did I did uh building Barracks was it on the building Barracks okay I knew there was a place where I spawned some entities yep it was on the building Barrack system over here that I was spawning some Barracks okay so on this one I wasn't adding any component I was just setting it in yeah and yeah in order to make sure that okay can make extension methods yeah I I guess so oh the bullets yeah that's that's what I was doing wasn't it I'm trying to think of what was the issue that I had where the bullet was being spawned on zero just to uh no it's not bullet the should attack system I think it is this one yeah there you go this is what I was looking for so update before that one so that when it spawns it goes on that so just making sure this one does not have that issue but anyways so yeah apparently first add the component and then set the component okay sure fine I guess that works and now on the random now it's over here that I can do a brand new random and I can use this zombie entity. index and now this will indeed have a normal uh a unique random for every single entity okay so yeah like this should be working and the Au ring already put it so hardcoded every two seconds so every two seconds it should be spawning a zombie so let's see oh crap it's already 700 p.m. well that makes sense why my dogs are already a bit stressed okay all right let's see there you go got an error right away why is there an error structural changes aren't allowed really that's interesting oh I guess that's why I didn't have this issue oh interesting so insentient is that is interesting that is interesting okay all right so I need antique man buffer antique man buffer and which one was the one uh again another thing that I got to remember how to how to work I think I use an anti command buffer at some point Didn't I that thing I can f transmission I'm a bit lost in this project yep that's that's perfectly normal I mean these live streams are me just researching for my prototype so you're not expected to to follow everything that I'm doing but yeah on the final course that won't come out of this the final I don't know 20 hour stepbystep course then it will work what is the anti command buffer that is just a way to queue up a bunch of commands so you can execute them afterwards oh yeah I used them when I made the the bullets in order to destroy them afterwards that's pretty much what I did and yeah so here I use an an command buffer but there was another place so again this is one of those one of those uh one of those questions about how anti command buffer Works cuz there's this way create a new command buffer playback and that's it and the other way is to go inside the an simulation anti command buffer and then you don't even have to do with the playback has do does afterwards so I'm curious as to which one is supposed to be the quote unquote correct way of doing it I don't know should I create a brand new one and then playback or should I use that one yeah I don't know which one is the correct approach but anyways let's uh let's go with this one and then we shall see if this one has some kind of uh negative sword okay anyways so on this one then I add a component on this zombie entity and it is going to be this component okay and then on this same command buffer I have to set a component on the same zombie entity and for this one it is going to be this one okay so it has that one and since this one isn't there it should be called automatically so let's give it a try L back in ECB creates a sync point oh interesting so I guess this this one would be the uh preferred option since it wouldn't necessarily create a new sync point because it only syns at the very end so yeah I guess so yeah good point so I guess this one is probably the preferred method and I'll use the other one if you want to manually play back some kind of thing uh okay all this and I totally forgot what I was doing oh right Spa the zombies there you go they are being spawned they are being spawned but they no I think they are working yeah they are spawning there and they are going to a random position directly on there nice so I do think it is working so I've got that building spawner and I place another one there and another one there and all of them should be spawned and then going in there and let me actually just fix that cuz it's annoying how they spawn on top of the building and the buildings probably should not have fixed collider solid colliders so I think by making it a trigger that should fix that issue and I don't think it w cause any more issues so there you go they are spawning there they are spawning there spawning there and yep they are indeed just randomly walking around on those positions nice and it does work all right cool and if I spawn some towers and the towers are going to be destroyed okay let's see if they destroy oh crap it destroyed the spawn anyways okay so let's see if they destroy it and now they go back into random position and they're kind of fighting each other so obviously they need some avoidance but yep they are definitely going somewhere and going like that this whenu shows you which point each ECB system is being executed oh does it interesting yeah I mean I guess so for the building spawner system which right now is no longer the zombie spawner system wait it says two entities still CU they're all dead so the entity still exist at some point or not I'm not sure but yeah is nice a flock Moving System yeah might might need something a bit more comp although honestly once they a bit more spread out or if I just add some simple uh avoidance detection then yeah this random kind of logic does work and yeah so there was one building here one here and one here and Y they are indeed spawning and they're going exactly like that so that's that is cool nice all right so yeah that actually did work quite well so that was nice yeah thanks for all of your comments that was nice yeah learning about when to play CCB spawning all things that was cool so yeah that was fun so this one is indeed working so the random walking and the building for spawning zombies so the building spawn zombies this one is also working I probably need some kind of logic to have a maximum so it doesn't keep spawning onstop but yeah so far it is working quite nicely yeah in so all right so yeah that was was that was really great uh and yeah I guess that's dogs are getting hungry it's already 700 p.m. so it's already a bit after their time so yeah shout out to Turbo makes games in the hot path show yep definitely so if any of you want to learn more about dots definitely check out his channel in case you don't know terrible makes games really great lots of lots of videos on dots especially this one I really like this one uh video on shoo use dots in 2024 really great explainer on what are the good projects for it and what projects don't necessarily need it so that's really great and definitely also check out the hot path show so that's uh the live stream which also has Danny who works at uh unity and a bunch of stuff so if you want to learn more about dos then definitely uh look into his channel it's uh really awesome so and eventually no idea how long but uh hopefully soon enough I will have the Prototype done so I can then get to work on starting to prepare things to make the course and so on so yeah hopefully by the end of uh by the end of this week I will have the Prototype almost done so I'll have a rough idea for when the course might be done but so far yeah so far it is coming along nicely it is looking nicely all right okay so let me prepare to close everything off cuz I got to get going uh and by the way check the pin comments so if you want to keep up to date with the news as I write them then go ahead and sign up on the Game Dev reports that's the newsletter that I write with all news and all things and so on if you want you can read you can watch the uh first post and I will keep posting I don't know maybe uh once or twice per week should be a fun way to keep up to dat to the news anyways okay let me put on that one like that and that will be it all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here I hope you found this interesting and yeah have a great rest of your week uh best of luck with your projects and all of that so yeah all right so I will see you everyone uh next time so bye everyone have a great week byebye see you
