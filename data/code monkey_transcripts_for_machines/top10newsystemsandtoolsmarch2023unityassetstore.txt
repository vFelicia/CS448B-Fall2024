hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the SSR is full of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for March 23. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered the best three new assets and next one I'll cover top visions and effects as long as there's only CDs in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order by the way right now there's a humble button with a huge 97 off discount on centi assets there are so many game ideas you could build with all of these maybe you could build a World War II shooter or a plane simulator with war pack maybe even Lord of the Rings inspired RTS with this one then perhaps use the Yang Warfare pack to make some kind of tycoon game maybe make your own life for that with the boss zombies you could build something like fallout shelter with the apocalypse Interiors maybe make some kind of Battle Royale with a better round pack or perhaps a songs like with the dungeon pack or really just prototype anything with a very useful prototype pack personally I'm a huge fan of their own low poly sound and if you also like it and you want tons of assets with a huge ride ID for a super deep discount then check it out to the link in the description alright so starting off with an awesome asset sequel here is magiclaw 2. this one is the second version of one of the most popular tools on the entire site it's a cloud simulation system with this you can add all kinds of flowy things to your games obviously that means Claus but it can also mean hair and I'm guessing you could even simulate some chains looking at the video the results are really excellent everything looks extremely fluid very natural this one is actually using in the dots so it's extremely fast adding some quad physics is one of those things that can be eased out and will make a huge impact in your players up next here's a nice tool that adds another seemingly simple thing that also makes a big impact it's called adaptive hands basically you take a rigged hand and it automatically grips any colliders if you have tons of graveball items in your game then this kind of dynamic system can be much easier to add than manually building out all of the hold animations you can easily animate between hold and release it looks really interesting and easy to use with tons of Sliders obviously this is perfect for VR are but really any game with any visible hands it also includes a hand poser so you can create some poses and play them in runtime very interesting tool up next if you want some particles in your UI and look at this one it does exactly what it says you can create UI particles with an image the regular particle system doesn't really work with the UI so this tool seems great if you need specifically that it looks like it has a bunch of features it features masking attractors Trails raycasts it works in both camera and overlay modes it includes 12 demo scenes and some standard particles then here's an obvious one that was only a matter of time it's a chat GPT integration into Unity this one is actually a topic that I've been meaning to look at cheche EBT has an API so you can build a tone like this but if you don't want to go through the trouble of learning their API then this tool might be easier to use you can ask it some regular questions like ask it to come up with a backstory for a character then it also supports asking specifically for scripts and automatically creating the csharp file for it now like I talked about in a previous video personally I wouldn't really use the AI generated code but I could also see it as being used song for making some quick prototypes or maybe for guiding some beginners alternatively a more interesting use case is it can analyze your code this is something I have not tried and it might be interesting honestly this whole topic of using the Chachi ptai inside Unity this is something that I've actually been wanting to research for a while now and since I'm done with my two free courses this is something I really want to look at in the near future so definitely stay tuned then here's a simple tool that does one thing very well it creates some springy bones you define the stiffness length and damping of the bones then as the object moves the bones react accordingly so this could be interesting for making some Wiggly characters like maybe some character with some antennas you can mix it with the animation for some interesting results then if you'd like to make a driving game here is a realistic car controller this is another one that wants to be a new version of a previous asset it only just came out but already has 400 reviews which is a huge amount the feature on this is massive so this is definitely an extremely robust feature complete tool there are so many components and settings you can play with all with a custom Editor to make it really easy to use you can customize how the engine behaves the clutch the gearbox and even play around with adding some brake lights building your own car controller is a massive amount of work so if you have some ideas that require driving Vehicles then picking up a tune like this one will definitely help save you a ton of time next if you want to add some gorgeous fluids to your game series that you want to do just that visually the results look absolutely gorgeous the Condren and the smoke looks really excellent you have all kinds of settings you can play with you can also render the fluid onto a flipbook for ease of use during run time fluids are another topic that players will love and with a tone like this one it's actually pretty stand it works on all of the render pipelines then here we have an erosion tool now personally I really hate making terrains I suck at making something look good and one reason why my terrains never look good is really on lack of erosion so I don't like this one can really help make the terrains in your game look a bit more natural you can apply some water erosion some wind erosion sediment buildup thermal erosion and you can layer all of those on top of each other the end result looks really nice very realistic up next here is a very unique tool it does exactly like the name says it helps you chroma key a video directly inside Unity honestly I'm not entirely sure how you'd use this in a game but it looks very interesting you can take any green screen footage and make it transparent I guess maybe this could be great for making some interesting cutscenes or some loading screens you could make a really interesting effect in something like after effects then load that video into unity and make it transparent either way very unique tool I've never seen anything like this and over here is a motion path animation editor you define a path with some nice visual editor handles then play with some settings add more keyframes and then you can make some object fun with best of all it's really just how easy it looks to use you can easily move and position all the keyframes and make it move exactly as you wanted worse in both 2D and 3D alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on dnts store for March 23 there's links are in the description and as bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and also check out my own free and Payless on store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
