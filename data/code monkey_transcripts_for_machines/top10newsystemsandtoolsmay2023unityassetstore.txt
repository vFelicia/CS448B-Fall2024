hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asaurus form of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for May 23. this is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I'm going to cover the best three new assets and next one I will cover top visions and effects as always there's only CS in the description and as bonus you can use a coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also the Cynthia sale is right about to end so if there's anything you want definitely go ahead and get it right now I made the drag racing minigame and the weapon attachment system using some nice packs so check it out quickly before the sale ends and the unts store is also having their spring sale I highlighted some of my favorite dances in another video on the ones that I covered in my asset review series are on sale for example this is a great time for you to pick up the quantum console so you can easily follow my free multiplier course and the Flash the ons are also still continuing definitely check that page to see which ones are starting soon so you don't miss the deepest discounts alright so starting off with a very unique interesting one it's a measuring system you just look at any object and you can easily get its Dimensions you can select whatever you you want so it can be metric or imperial this lets you calculate the distance between two points calculate some angle surface area and a bunch more one very interesting feature is how it also supports both VR and AR so this could be generally useful for some kind of construction job with an AR headset it has tons and tons of options and it even looks quite good next if you'd like to build some kind of helicopter game here is a great starting point it's a complete controller Works in both mobile and PC and it's not just the helicopter also includes some AI a bunch of weapons it has a first and third person camera there's a radar system buildings power ups and a bunch more it even has a gasoline consumption mechanic so it's a precomplete pack which would be a great starting point which you could then later on replace the visuals then here's one that will look very familiar to anyone used to blender it's a scene view bookmark tool what it does very simple you can just create bookmarks on all kinds of place in your scene then with a button click you can instantly get the same camera to that position on a large world this can be very useful for quickly moving around the scene View and also when working with models is great for quickly changing the camera to things like side view front top down and so on so pretty much just like you have in blender or any 3D model it's a pretty simple tool it does exactly what it's supposed to which can be quite useful next here's one that is also very useful to a certain type of game it's a bad word interpreter if you have a more casual game targeted at a younger audience or really just something that is very family friendly then this can be quite useful making a basic tone like this one is simple but making one that is hard for the players to bypass is actually quite difficult this one seems to have no problems when users try to bypass it by adding some spaces or dots between the bad words you can configure multiple languages not just English you can Define whatever swear words you want and make it easily updatable through a server so if your game is meant to be family friendly and you have some chat definitely look into a tune like this one next here is the tune for building a very Dynamic UI it's all based on CSS so if you're familiar with that then this should be easy to learn it works with dnty and also has easy migration to UI toolkit it features what you see is what you get live editing so it's very easy to add it on the Fly contains a very detailed manual with over over 300 Pages the tour only showcase a UI very much inspired by God of War and doesn't look very great this is one of those tools that has a certain learning curve but if you do take the time to learn it then promises to be so much better than the builtin tools then here's an interesting one it's a Shader converter specifically it converts from glsl into urp now I'm not a expert but from what I've heard writing urp shaders with code is actually really tricky so I could see a tune like this one being quite harmful one way that I could see this being used is on the tons and tons of Shader toy shaders that exist out in the world there are some that look really impressive and I imagine converting them to urp would be quite tricky so by using this tool that could definitely simplify the process if you're into Shader programming then maybe check this out next here's one with a bit of a strange name it's called burning building now I was looking at the trailer assuming that at some point the building would go on fire and it would be some kind of fire propagation system but actually it turns out that burning is really just named the developer so this one is just a nice building tool you can easily design a bunch of walls you can paint the floors and walls with all kinds the materials and place a bunch of doors the whole thing uses a mesh generation algorithm so it's all very efficient the ones can be destroyed or you can also edit it in runtime also include showing and hiding some areas based on player position or already exported areas then if you're working on some card based game here is a complete game engine template this can be used to make single player or online multiplayer games with a dedicated authoritative server each player can have a deck the cards can be played on the board then they have various abilities cuts and attacks the cards and abilities those are all script bone objects so you can easily create more and modify all of their stats it's made using unity's official networking solution Network game objects you can open packs collect cards and Define ingame currencies the main thing is really how this is all built to work online so if you have an online card game idea then this can save you a ton of time next if your game has dialogue and cutscenes then look at this system it allows you to trigger camera positions you can start some dialogue manage decision trees animation script events and more it features a nice nodebased workflow so it's a all easy for designers to use you can import downloads straight from a CSV file which makes it great for text Heavy games and it also supports a memory mechanic where an NPC will remember that certain things happened or that the player made a specific Choice then here's a simple one it's a value animated engine basically a interpolation Library there's a bunch of these tools but this one is made by a very expensive developer specifically very experienced in making UI elements you can animate any value time so that can be a flow tractor 3 a color or anything you can preview animations in edit mode without hitting play comes with a lot of preset animations and preset frame rates works with both unity and UI token alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the NTS server for May 23 there's links on the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your earn don't forget to check out the synthesalem before it ends alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
