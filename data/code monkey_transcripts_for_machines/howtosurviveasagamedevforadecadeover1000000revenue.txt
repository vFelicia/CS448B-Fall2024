hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's a really interesting article titled sustainable living as an indie bottom feeder so basically can you make a living whilst not being a famous Indie Dev this was written all the way back in 2017 and look at that look at the author Yep this was written exactly by me six years ago and this is telling my story so let's read through it and see if everything that I've said back then still makes sense still is applicable nowadays so howdy my name is cardos I'm the developer behind the one man in the studio and on slope Studios and you've probably never heard of me my story isn't sexy I didn't quit my job and work on a masterpiece for five years while living on Ramen I'm not an autor making a game that won't change the world and make people tattoo the name on their forehead my car is 12 years old my phone is 4 years old my apartment is boringly normal on a second world country my games Don't Get Hype previews on kataku or polygon they don't have a metacritosaur they don't get reviewed on IGN or rock paper Shopkin they don't get covered by Turtle biscuit or Giant Bomb but despite all that I've been running a sustainable business since 2013. so yeah right away all of this is still applicable to my myself nowadays I have made over eight games on Steam those games have sold hundreds of thousands of copies they've made over one million dollars in Gross and yet like it says here you've probably never heard of me so most people do not know the name endless loop Studios I am definitely not a famous Dev but I have been doing this as a sustainable business since 2013. and yeah it's funny to read this six years afterwards since then I have upgraded my car I used to have a Hyundai Getz now I've got a nucleo the car is from 2017 so I guess I've got a 60 year old car now my phone I've also upgraded but it's also about four years old now still live in the same apartment still in the same country and if my games still don't get high previews I'm currently working on my next team game dinky Guardians and for that game I highly doubt that it's going to be covered on Kotaku or polygon but I'm still quite confident that it won't be financially viable same so far all this yep still applicable nowadays so let's continue reading here's a nice screenshot from one of my first games gamecorp DX that is one of my most successful games it was made pretty quickly it's a relatively short game but the response was awesome the game is pretty cheap and everybody who buys it the reviews are still insanely positive nowadays so that was a great game so continuing my role models are more than likes of clay fairies from positive games and Jeff vogels spider web software rather than Eric Brown from stardew Valley or Toby Fox from undertale if you're looking to be in developer long term I fully believe the trick is quantity of sufficient quality so you have this ice don't very much agree with the sentiment obviously stardew Valley and undertale and those two are absolute masterpieces but they were also extremely risky gambons both these I think to more than five years each of them to the phone that is really risky spending five years working on just one game of course when it does go well then you get massively rewarded so both these developers they are insanely successful they can do whatever they want basically with one game they essentially won the lottery but personally I do not like to gamble my livelihood on the lottery I prefer more stable things so that is why Cliff Harris he is developer behind democracy so that was a huge hit also made production line also really great he got into publishing and started publishing some games made big Pharma also published created the Space Battles that was another big hit a long time ago we're doing the sync battles that was also interesting and for Jeff Hogan with spider web software there's all kinds of very strange very Niche oldschool RPGs he has made a ton of them and over the years has developed a very dedicated audience that buys pretty much any game as long as it fits that Niche there is an excellent GDC tone that I highly recommend you go and look at so like I said here I've only believe the trick is primarily quantity of sufficient quality rather than risking your whole life on pushing the quality as much as possible I'm a big fan of trying to lower the rest so you can actually keep doing this for the long term so as with any business there won't be ups and downs I expected my second game to do as well as the first and as a result I invested way too much time and money and when sales were way below the first one I panicked quite a bit and I became concerned about the viability of indie game development as a sustainable longterm career so yeah this definitely happened to me my first game Survivor Squad was surprisingly successful back then green light had just started so steam wasn't yet as much saturated as it is right now and that game that game idea that concept for some reason that really resonated with people so that game definitely sound a lot more than I expected but the second game server scored gun toys which was a direct sequel that one suddenly did not do as well I worked on that game a lot more I believe it is a better game in literally every single way but for some reason the market didn't like it steam didn't really care for it so that game I think it's only literally one tenth despite taking longer to make and despite investing a lot more time on buying art and all kinds of things so yeah when that second game flew up that really scared me quite a bit and like I said here as a result I did the best safest thing that I could do I spent three months remaking my most successful Flash game and made a tiny cheap highly focused highly polished game which found quite a bit of success which then helped me develop my fourth game and so on that game that I'm talking about that was gamecorp DX which yep the original game the original Flash game was called gamecorp it came out before I started getting into unity and making Steam games so I guess came out in I don't know 2011 maybe 2012 and that game was highly successful in the flash game or rather I should say highly successful in terms of players and gameplays definitely not highly successful in terms of monetary Revenue flash is really difficult The Flash version of the game was actually played six million times that is an insane amount I can't even imagine six million people playing my game but has resulted in financial terms that game only made about a thousand dollars whereas a remake that I made on scene that I sold for three bucks that one made something like a hundred thousand foreign flash was definitely an interesting thing I definitely learned a lot from it but in financial terms it was incredibly difficult okay so here are some tips that have helped me along the way tip number one keep your burn rate as low as possible absolutely great tip I definitely still believe in this nowadays I'll start with the most obvious one although also the most difficult one to use since it is very much based on where you live if I was living in San Francisco spending 4K a month just to stay afloat then I wouldn't be able to do this you can make a decent tight small polish game in six months and if your burn rate is 4K then that one cost you 24K whereas if the burn rate is just a thousand then it will only cost you six thousand so yeah difference between 24K and 6K that is difference between requiring something like 500 sales to make a living versus requiring something like five thousand if you can live on a thousand dollars a month you can make a really tight polish twohour game for six thousand dollars and assuming the game is of sufficient quality that is an achievable amount to sell say at this one I really do believe this is one of the let's say secrets that have allowed me to become an indie Dev the fact that I live in a relatively lowcost living and personally I don't really spend money on anything I don't really care about buying fancy clothes fancy watches fancy cars whatever I don't really care much for them except when I first moved out of my parents house and I started Living by myself I was living as cheaply as possible and I was living around 750 bucks a month so that is why I managed to essentially become a sustainable in developer If instead I was burning through four thousand dollars a month if I was doing that then it would be much more difficult to just basically stay afloat so here continuing Survivor Squad took 10 months to make I was living with my parents and I didn't really go out much or do anything so my Burden rate was essentially zero dollars yep that's correct I did the programming Art and Design myself I spent 350 bucks on hosting royalty free sound effects and the green light fee so do you think that game was profitable the answer is yes of course of course it was I don't know the number off the top of my head but I'm sure that game made over 50k so again spending 350 bucks and 10 months of my life for 50k that is definitely very easily to make profitable which again would be very different if I had spent 4K a month that would be very different math all of a sudden that would not become profitable so here don't demo your life on the expectation that your game won't sell a hundred thousand copies you might think well Sim has 140 million users how hard can it be to sell to just point one percent of that and the answer is that it's extremely hard very very hard always be hyper aware of survivorship bias everyone knows tardy Valley's own millions of copies but nobody knows the 200 other games that were released that month and made either nothing or a very small reasonable amount you can look it seem spy and look at the games in a similar genre and price Point's yours so could you survive to make another game if you sold just 5 000 copies what about 3 000 with the trick only of three companies a day combined with your savings be enough to help you make another game yep these are all still very valid questions nowadays the only difference is that nowadays things are even more difficult so nowadays I'm pretty sure there's a lot more than just 200 games released per month I think unless I checked I think last year there were some like 15 000 games so that actually means around a thousand games per month now of course some of those are Chevron wear but a lot of those are actually very high quality games and seem now has a lot more millions of users I don't know what is the total but just recently I think they hit 30 million concurrent active users so the total number of users that is an insane amount but at the same time most of those will only see the top games so most of the 1000 games that come out every single month most people will never see any of those same point of this that I wrote back in 2017 this is definitely still accurate nowadays if anything nowadays it is even more difficult start as small as you can focus on a tiny scope and make a tiny product of good quality players much prefer to have a small 2 hour interesting quality experience rather than a 40 hour messy game with many bugs no polish and a dozen meaningless Channel features your goal should be to design a game that when a player finishes they want more rather than something huge that no one will play because they won't get bored and frustrated within the first hour yep that is some generally very good advice making something small tight and Polished that is going to be much better rather than something that technically has hundreds of hours of gameplay but those are all very low quality however at the same time don't push this to the absolute extreme if you make a game that just has one hour of gameplay even if that gameplay is really excellent that might be not enough to justify whatever cost is for the game there are always going to be some people who play games sub two hours and just refund them but those are usually up wires if your game has at least two hours of content and if those two hours are excellent then those people will probably be very happy and the game can be quite successful and here use Early Access for feedback not for funding Early Access is awesome I've used it for all except my first game getting people to play your game ahead of an official launch is extremely important especially if you're keeping your costs as low as possible and don't want to hire professional testers unless you already have a builtin audience or press valve contacts Early Access is not for funding you will likely not be featured on the popular new release list and will likely only sell a few hundred or maybe 1 000 copies depending on the price however make sure your early asset release is in a decent State as an unknown in developer the simmer V score is the most important thing that will help you selling copies and you must defend their own costs if you're only using internally access with many nasty bugs under the guise of it's just an alpha it says over right on the same page you only get negative reviews and even if you fix those issues within 24 hours those reviews will still stay there and keep your score down forever as for feedback be very active in responding to comments and put out updates consistently yep all of this still excellent advice nowadays Early Access is definitely for feedback definitely not for funding if you're going into Early Access with the hopes of getting the funding to actually finish your game that is a terrible plan that will not work nowadays Early Access is even more difficult people are even more demanding so back then back in 2017 if you put our game on Early Access people would kind of accept a few bugs here and there and a lack of content whereas nowadays they do not nowadays if you put out something on Early Access it better be extremely well polished so nowadays it does not need to be in a decent state it needs to be in an excellent state with quite a lot of content already and yet like I said back then steam review score is the most important thing and yep that is absolutely true that is still very much correct nowadays if you come out of the gate with only access with a subparent release and if the reviews come out negative coming back from that is essentially impossible and like I said here you won't get negative reviews and even if you fix those issues within 24 hours the reviews will likely stay there and keep your score down forever there's certainly something that I know very very well there was one of my games where I actually forgot to add a folder on the Mac build like on the game I forgot to test does the founder exist it just assumed that the founder existed and on the build that I uploaded the same I forgot to add that folder so essentially on Mac the game was homily broken now as soon as the game came out I saw our view right away that said the game was broken on Mac it does not work right away I looked into the logs I saw that was a problem very easy fix so I fixed it super quickly literally within less than one hour of release I fixed that I did respond to that review and I said okay this has been fixed but the person who wrote that review they never bothered to update it so one tiny tiny issue that was fixed within 30 minutes of release even though I did fix it the review is still there it still drags down the score nowadays so reviews are extremely important and going into Early Access does not give you a reason to not worry too much people in Early Access expect the same level of Polish as a final game so absolutely do not use Early Access for funding and absolutely do not go with the mindset of it just announced it says on the same page people do not care if it is their only access people only expect a very well very polished very robust game with tons of content valid in long tail Yep this is extremely important since I look at my business as a longterm Venture I've only been long tail tremendously even my first game Survivor Squad which has a mixed review score still sells a handful of copies every month certainly not enough to live on but it does add up what that really means is that as long as I keep my burn rate low I don't need a game to break even super quickly as long as my costs were low enough that break even is achievable it's only a matter of time Yep this is absolutely true I mean nowadays it has been over 10 years since I watched my first team game and it still sounds copies now obviously it doesn't sound too much nowadays the long tail that definitely does go down over time but still nowadays it still probably sells I don't know maybe a hundred bucks a month maybe something like that maybe 50 bucks so either way that game that I made over 10 years ago that one still pays for some groceries nowadays and of course that's only just one game so put all the games together and the long tail can be quite good even though nowadays my last scene game came out all the way back in 2019 so that was quite time ago so my steam Revenue has definitely dropped off quite significantly since all of those years ago but still it is still more than zero so all those games that I made all those years ago they still work nowadays and like I said if my burn rate is low which nowadays it still is it's a bit higher than it was all the way back then but it's not that much higher so the small amount that I still get paid from seam that still helps me cover quite a lot of costs for my daily life take it easy on discounts they are useful tool to find new players at different price points but don't go overboard and bundling your game for one dollar within three months of release just make a quick Buck stay strong and keep your eye on the long term Yep this is another thing as soon as you launch a game you won't get tons and tons of messages and emails from all kinds of obscure bundle sites they won't promise to you bundle your game and sometimes of copies but each of those copies you are only going to get literally something like 10 cents out of each of them and as soon as you bundle the game once some people look at that and they basically assume okay so this is the value that the game is worth nowadays the better strategy is really just discount your game nice and slowly over time once again goes back to what I was talking about the burner it if your burn rate is low and you're okay with spending a bit more time to actually break even if you're okay with that if that is sustainable to you then you can afford to essentially discount much slower so just discount 25 for the first six months then maybe just fifty percent on the second year and maybe on the third year or fourth year maybe you can go all the way down to 75 if you do that it won't take a bit longer to get the revenue but again if you can afford a burn rate over a long time in the end that won't be a better strategy always keep learning and growing yep right away obviously I agree with this I mean nowadays I have the channel and part of the reason why I created this channel was because I really wanted to keep learning things keep doing all kinds of things and I wanted sort of an excuse to force myself to do that so this channel making tutorials covering all kinds of unity and Game Dev content that is pretty much Mike's use to keep learning keep doing things I just think to myself I would like to teach this sort of thing make this sort of mechanic in a tutorial and if I want to teach it in a tutorial I need to know it myself very well so yep I'm definitely still very much a Believer on always keep learning and growing then the game development scene moves at a very fast pace it's seems that the game changes every six months so you have to adapt are you making a platformer with nice art it was easier to send out five years ago making a zombie crafting Survival game easier three years ago a king of the hill game easier one year ago yeah there are definitely some fads that come and go and some genres become way too oversaturated like for example making a platform with nice art nowadays in order to stand out you need to have something on the level of something like cuphead so it has to be that special to really stand out Platformers are a dime a dozen there are millions of them zombie crafting Survival game that one is actually not necessarily A Century I mean there are tons and tons of them but people can't seem to get enough of them so that's a genre that is also very saturated but can still work and King of the Hill game honestly nowadays I don't even know exactly what this refers to was there a big amount of King of the Hill games back in 2017 honestly I don't remember but yeah I guess uh fads come and go game genres appear and disappear nowadays the big one is vampire survival likes there's already a ton of them but there are still some that you find success you should stay up to date with the business side of things but also your own skill are you growing as a programmer artist designer are you becoming faster at producing good content in your engine of choice do you have reusable code so your next game will be up and running faster than before do you have some extra Sprites laying around that could be used to very quickly prototype an interesting idea remember time is money yep look at that so all the way back in 17 I was already talking about the benefits of reasonable code even though this in 2017 this would have been probably before I read code complaint so probably before my skills regarding clean code really massively improved so it's kind of funny that before then I was already seeing the value of it and he has some extra Sprites laying around yep that can definitely help back then I was in too used to using the unity assessor but nowadays there are tons of stuff on the accessor so even if you don't personally have some extra Sprites lying around you can definitely pick them up some things either on the Unis or on some sale or on a Humble Bundle getting assets has never been easier and cheaper so that is great next tip gather the following this is my biggest weakness since I'm not a very social person so I'll just write about the generally accepted device be active in all types of social media I ideally you should spend as much time marketing as you do actually developing so yep that is definitely very good advice and all this is still intrude to myself nowadays I am still not a very social person if you've been following this channel for quite some time you can see how it took me in literally years to be able to gain the confidence to turn the camera on and try out this type of video so as you can see I am actively learning my advice I am actively trying to learn and grow any of social media is still extremely important and since nowadays things are even more difficult than they were back in 2017 Yep this advice about spending as much time marketing as you do developing this is even more accurate now than ever nowadays if you just focus on developing your game nobody want to see it so you do need Marketing in order to actually find the people that won't play and like your game and for that here on YouTube you can do devlogs you can try to gather an audience by making tutorials like I've done although to be fair that does generate a more Game Dev audience rather than a game playing audience so that is not a very good strategy for finding game players but you can do General devlogs you can go the entertainment route kind of like Danny that is very successful and you can obviously experiment with all the the new social medias there have been lots of any devs recently that I found tons of success on Tick Tock so Tick Tock Instagram all kinds of short content nowadays that is really useful so in general keep in mind you should spend almost as much time marketing as you do developing one thing I've done is set up a Nissan letter sign up link in all my games and their websites through it I've gathered about 4 000 emails now that obviously doesn't mean that every time I announce the game I will suddenly sell that many companies but it does mean I'm not only starting from scratch in it that is really good advice nowadays I still have that mailing list so when I recently announced thinking Guardians I did send an email to devilist I can't remember how many people are on there but still it's more than zero so it does help and again focusing on the long term every game I release and every day goes by that list increases little by a little maybe one day I'll get to the point where eclipse is so that is Cliff Aries from pasta games and I'll be able to sell 9 000 copies of a game before even hitting scene I think that was the game production line I think he made an alpha before going on to steam and that outfit was massively successful Sam if you do manage to gather a large following and large audience that enjoys your games if you gather that over many many years then things hopefully become easier and easier even if the market does become more and more centering when in doubt follow the TF2 Sniper as the wise man once said professionals have standards be polite be efficient have a plan to kill everyone you meet now we would advise replacing that last part with be prepared and have the plan to survive to fight another day if the worst possible scenario comes past but yeah whatever works for you yeah I would say this is definitely still a line that still resonates with me nowadays basically be professional if Game Dev is meant to be your career then take it as seriously as you take any job that you have an interest in make sure you have high standards with the things that you do and of course be polite there's no reason to respond negatively to anyone even negative reviews although that is quite difficult be efficient so in Practical terms this is why I talk so much about writing good clean code that is one of the best ways to get efficiency in game development and be prepared to have a plan to survive to fight another day that is why I never recommend you just quit your day job and try to bet it all on your very first game you should hopefully be honestate that if you do try to make a game and you're trying to make it successful song you should definitely not be in a position where if that game fails suddenly you go homeless and go hungry so that goes back to reducing your burn rate in order to reduce your risk in order to be able to do this for the long term as you gain experience and hopefully find more and more success in the game development is a very tough or crown business but I believe if you face reality instead of burying your head in the sand and focus on taking calculated risks you can't find success just don't define success as selling 100K units yep once again the same thing that I was saying make sure you lower your risk make sure you don't need an insane amount of units to break even the unless you need the easier it is to find success my next game hyper Knights is leaving early access is Friday I've invested more in this game than ever before but not so much that it will never be profitable feedback has been extremely positive so I'm confident it won't reach my modest goals however I also know that if it sells zero copies I will not be out of a job and serving on the street I won't analyze what went wrong and make an educated decision on what to work on next how long to work on it and how much to spend yeah it's a funny reading this all these years afterwards so hyper Knights that one didn't leave early access and in terms of review views and reviews were still extremely positive it is one of the highest rated games that I've ever made but in terms of sales suddenly it didn't do quite as well as I would like like I said I've invested more in this game than ever before but not so much that it will never be profitable so I did spend quite a lot I hired an artist I worked on it to make all kinds of art make the same page make game art make all kinds of stuff I even got some custom sound and all kinds of other things so I invested quite a bit on this game at least relative to my other games in the end it did not sell quite as much as I would like but given how even though I spent more I didn't necessarily spend an insane amount I think I spent I don't know maybe like 20 30 grand something like that and the game did return just about that so it wasn't a huge hit but it was definitely profitable and again back then this was I don't know my sixth game maybe and like I said I don't really spend much money so all the other games that I made some were successful some were less successful but the ones that were successful since my burn rate is so low I didn't manage to gather quite a lot of nice savings so I was at a point where even a hyper Knight stolen literally zero copies even if that were to happen I would not starve I had enough savings to be be able to survive for another one two three games okay I hope this article provides some perspective on the unless exciting but more reasonable and sustainable type of indie game development thanks for reading alright yeah so here it is this article reading it six years later and yep everything is still pretty much accurate nowadays things are quite a bit more difficult seem is even more centering but this advice is really Timeless advice so yeah it was fun to read through this all over again definitely an interesting article and I definitely hope that reading through this helps you on your own personal Game Dev Journey alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
