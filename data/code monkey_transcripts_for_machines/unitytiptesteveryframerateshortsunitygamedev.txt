here's a quick unity tip look at this simple demo this object is going towards the target it just gets there and changes color super simple however after you ship the game you get a message from a player saying that this is what they're seeing so the object moves but never actually reaches the target now this happened because you forgot to test your game on a low frame rate you did a simple distance check to see if it reached the target and in your machine the game runs at 100 frames per second so every frame the object moves a tiny amount however on your player's pc they have a weaker machine which runs the game as a low frame rate and as such the object moves much further per each update and never gets within stopping distance in order to make sure that this doesn't happen to you you can use the field application target frame rate to force your game to run at a specific frame rate if you force the game to run at 10 frames per second you would have seen this error before shipping then just add some extra checks to make sure your logic works in any frame rate in every possible device to reset back into unlimited just set it to 1 alright hope that's useful subscribe for more unity tips
