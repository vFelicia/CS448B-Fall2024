hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're continuing to create a graph in unity we're going to add some customizable labels to our axis separators let's get started so here I have the graph from the previous video with my data points and the axis separators right now the xaxis is displaying the index of each data point and on the yaxis it's displaying the value of that data point in seven let's customize the label text on the xaxis to say something like day one day two day three and so on and on the yaxis let's display the value as a dollar amount so we previously created this graph here which is displaying all of our values our values are represented in code as a list of integers so now for a bit of Polish and let's customize the unlabeled text so let's say in here instead of posting the index we want to say something different like day 1 day 2 day 3 and so on and here and let's say we want to display it in dollars instead of just values so in here on my show graph I'm also going to receive two funks the funks are in using system now a func is a delegate that returns something so in this case we're going to use a func to get a label for my x axis the x axis is in an INT and it will return a string and let's call it get axis label x and make the same thing for my y axis y except this one takes a float let's make these values optional so we still have the default functionality so let's set equals known and here let's validate our inputs so if get axis label x if it is no then let's do the same thing we were doing previously so we're going to create a get axis label X which will be a delegate that receives an int and it's going to return a string now the string that it will return in the case of our default behavior we have in here just the I dot two strength so go into in here and return the I dot two string so this is the default behavior in case we send null in here for the wine let's copy this set the Y which actually takes a float and for my Y you can see down here this is what I displaying by the phone so this is what I'm going to go in here and display we are rounding the float value and this point as a string okay so let's use these functions when we go down here so for my label X instead of displaying the eye I'm going to use that func to send it the eye and it will return a string and down here when I'm making the Y separators when I set the text let's make the get access label on Y and I'm going to send it the value which is the normalized value x dy maximum okay so we have set up the defaults to function exactly the same as previously so let's go back into our scene make sure everything is working exactly the same and there you have it 0 1 2 3 0 10 20 ok great now let's actually apply some funks so we can modify it don't leave on tags so appear on my show graph for my gap axis and label X I'm going to receive an int and I'm going to return some string then I'm going to have the get X is labeled Y which will receive a float and return another string now in here for my wine let's say I wanted to say de and then the I plus 1 so it doesn't start with 0 so the first one won't say the 1 day 2 day 3 and so on and for my floating here and let's say I want to say dollars and then still the way math F dot Brown 2 went of my foot okay so we should now be correctly displaying our custom labels as we want and yep there you go the accent label is now saying day 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 and so on and for my y axis it is displaying a dollar amount so there you have it we have added the ability to customize the labels in our axes this way you can clearly describe whatever information you're trying to graph in the next video we're going to automatically modify the scale of our graph based on our list of values as always you can download the project files in utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them ok see you next time
