you need some nice weather look at this one very nice and cozy it's a stylized weather system you can easily make some scattered clouds or some intense fog or some unique beautiful auroras play a rounded time of day and get a really nice pleasant look or maybe you just need a really highend character here's a photo scan soldier this one is modular so it's not just one character rather pretty much infinite most of the clothes come in 12 colors the face is customizable with tons of beards and haircuts so you can change all the body parts to get endless variation then for something low poly

want to decorate some interiors here's a really nice mega pack contains over 350 objects pretty much everything you need to build some really nice interiors they are all in a really nice lowpoly style so i could see this one as really useful for making a game kind of like the sims or really just anything where you spend a lot of time in a modern interior then here's a really cool modular castle looks really nice with a realistic medieval art style like i said it's modular so you can easily grab the pieces and build out your custom castle levels it includes custom parts but also tons of props to populate your world and up next here's a really interesting one a star creator it looks really awesome very realistic stars also very customizable so you can make something just like our sun or maybe some red giants or some scifi green ones super useful for pretty much any kind of scifi game then here's a fun one a pc constructor one of the surprise hits on steam lately was that pc building simulator game so this one would be perfect for making something just like that you've got tons of pc parts lots of gpus and cpus you've got tons of cases with all kinds of shapes various motherboards coolers psus and even some peripherals definitely a very unique pack for some animations here's a mage bundle in total 57 animations to fit whatever spells you have in your game lots of interesting animations ranging from some that look just like launching some simple projectile missiles to some that would be perfect for an aoe damage ability for some nice 2d here's a bunch of medieval fantasy
