hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video I'm going to go over my process for designing and implementing VIPs into battleground tycoon let's begin so in this video I will cover my process for the latest update to burn erotic Union which have VIPs they are unique yes which must be kept happy to increase your Park rating the game is up now on Steam so check it out to see what I'm teaching here apply to a real game so as always I start off by writing a rough outline of what I want to accomplish in a simple piece of paper for me I don't usually go too far in depth with my designs just focus on a high level picture and start prototype the VIP isn't in to be a very important guest someone that can give your park a huge boost or a huge penalty I wanted them to have a very unique sprite making them easily stand out I also sketched out the various UI elements that I wanted to create so I wanted a window that shows the current state of the VIP it should show a camera view as well as the name and a bar of the current happiness level and I wanted another window that showed up when the VIP and left the park containing a summary of what the guests thought and what bonuses the player got for his final happiness level so the first thing was to make a VIP spawn as a special guest with a special sprite I created a simple class to handle a VIP and the guest stores that VIP class instance so any special behavior I want I can just test if the guest is a VIP or not and just like that I had a guest behaving like all the others but with a unique name and sprite the VIP is identified by a enum value which defines all of the possible VIPs and based on that it selects the correct name and sprite then I got to work on the UI elements first creating the window that shows a view of where he is and what he is doing this works very much like a normal guest window it's just a camera that is constantly following him I've done a video on a character portrait window so check that out to see how it works the bar is set up like any other bar it just shows his current happiness level so with some sprites and moving things around the VIP window was working correctly then it was time to work on the exit window this window shows up when the VIP Li used in park on the left side you see a camera that has the VIP doing a special animation then you can see his name and his final happiness based on the happiness he left with I created certain tears for a special money reward so if his happiness is under 30 there's no reward if about 50 the player gets $500 and so on also on the window you can view every single one of his thoughts and the game thoughts are extremely valuable since they show you exactly what your guests are angry about and what you need to fix so having all the thoughts in the exit window is very nice to make sure you do better for the next one in my original design I also wanted some way of notifying the player that a VIP was coming soon I thought about putting a text popup in the middle of the screen but that would simply clutter the game so I use the side messages which is a really useful helmet for displaying certain messages I simply have the message saying the VIP is coming next month and another one when the VIP has entered the park another thing in my design was the heavy intro animation so based on my original design first I made it on the VIP window it would show the animation and then come back to the normal view however that what isn't being as visible as I would like so I separated that and made it into another window and put it for a dead center it's larger and it just shows the VIP and his name so that's one example of how I iterated upon my original design right now they all play the same simple animation but in future updates I will add specific animations for each specific VIP type then to make the VIP more visible I also created a nice thought papa it shows a icon for whether the thought is positive neutral or negative and the thought text the public shows up every once in a while and stays visible for a few seconds so even without opening the VIP window you can still see some of its thoughts at a glance using that popup I wrote a few messages specific to each VIP there's an entry message another one when their energy is half empty and another one when they leave these special messages are visible for longer and add a bit more variety to the game by making each VIP very unique lastly I created a VIP specific happiness bar that is used to calculate the park rate the VIP rating increases or decreases based on the exit happiness of each VIP it's pretty simple if they only give much happier than the current rating then drain goes up and if not it goes down the final park rating is calculated from all the various ratings so with all of those elements the VIP system was pretty much done the only thing left to do was make a bunch of unique VIPs the animation system that I'm currently using is the same one that I've used for several games now so that means I have a bunch of cool units that I can use from previous games for example I grabbed a bunch of units from hyper nice battles like the Spartan Persian and zombie from hyper Knights I grabbed a coollooking Knight from Ninja Tycoon I grabbed ninja and peasant and a bunch of other interesting characters that were used as workshop items for Hyper Knights like the Archangel and the Shadow King also some tf2 characters like the medic soldier and demo man which again were used as workshop items finally some sprites that I created specifically for videos on this channel like the sheriff and bandit which were made for the video creating the Deadeye system from reddit redemption to each VIP has their own sprites named special messages in feature updates I will add more characters from survivor squad and torrent acuity so this is yet another example of how powerful it is to reuse code and use the same systems every time if I had made a completely new animation system then all this would have to be created from scratch so that was it for creating the VIP system for valor on tycoon as you can see my process is relatively simple it starts off with a piece of paper containing the core ideas I want to implement and then I start prototyping and iterating upon it I believe this system is a great addition to the game since it helps keep the experience fresh when the player starts getting bored of seeing the same guest over and over a VIP will eventually pop up with a unique sprite and a special message the game is out now on steam so check it out to see what I'm teaching here apply to a real game if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them
