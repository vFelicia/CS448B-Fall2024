in this video we're going to make an enemy view cone to detect the player this is a lineofsight effect that interacts with walls that the enemies cannot see through if the player is found inside the view cone it's game over let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with nf2 torrents made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing so in a previous video we made this very nice film the view effect it's attached to the player and as I move around you can see the effect interact with the various walls and now in this video we want to take this effect and apply it to the enemies instead of the player an example of this type of effect being used is in the awesome commandos and thus proudest games I spent a lot of time during my childhood playing those games and always loved the view con mechanic that's also one of the reasons why my very first Unity game survivor squad was using this same effect you can pick up that game and its sequel include an indie game bundle so this is our final goal Here I am moving around in my ninja character and the enemies as you can see are patrolling around and each of them has a nice view come the view cone is the online of side effect where it collides with our walls so if I send behind this wall I'm perfectly safe however if I step inside the view cone and there you go he targets and shoot me instantly now I can hit restart and I mean here let's try to avoid them and go through the home map so that one is coming down now wait and now he's doing your way now I can go through I try to go and go through these two and now wait for this one and when he goes down he goes away now pass and run and yep there you go I've reached my trophy and I won the model all right awesome so just like this I've made it and won this nice stealth minigame alright so this is our goal let's get to it so here's our starting effect we're starting where we left off in the field of view video in that video we created this effect come only from scratch so check the link in the description and now in here the first thing we want is to apply this same effect but to the enemies inside of the player so here's the scene from the end of the previous video as you can see I have the character and then the field of view and here we are in this scene which has a nice level of these shadows here are the various enemies and we start down here and have to reach the trophy at the end in there so here we have the field of view from previous video let's see how this is working the way that it's working is essentially by having a civilized field for our field of view script and then on update we can set the in direction and set the organ all right so now instead of using this in here let's use it in our enemy code here is the enemy script now in here the way this script is set up isn't really relevant for our effect he's just walking around a certain patron path here they are in our scene as you can see all of them they go from certain positions and they fall with their patron ok so here on the script let's do what we did for the other one we're going to add a serious film for our field of view ok and then we just need to go into our update and here on our update we simply call set the origin to be this transform dot position and we also call set the aim direction all right so just like that with two function calls we should be able to see it working so back in the editor and let's just apply to this enamine here so we drag the film to view script onto that field okay and now let's test and yep there it is just like that you can see that this enemy now has a field of view effect and as you can see it is correctly interacting with the walls and we can pause and here we can see that the mesh is indeed correct all right awesome so you can see how simple this was to have because of how cleanly we created our original class there's no references to the player directly so our code is very clean and easy to reuse so now with this working let's apply to all our other enemies now here in the editor we could just duplicate this game object and set it like with it for this one but that would be a bit messy so let's set it up on the enemy start method instead so for that we're going to want to instantiate this game object so let's drag it into here in order to make a prefab okay there it is now here on the enemy class let's set a field for the prefab instead and then we're just going to have a normal field of view okay let's drag the prefab reference here we are and let's drag this reference okay and now here let's go into our start method and in here let's instantiate our prekow so we instantiate our prefab then we get the component field of view in order to get our new field of view alright so that should do it let's see and if there it is and now all of our enemies now have their own field of view so you can see all of them already have it and it's all very nice right awesome now let's make the angle and view distance customizable for each enemy so up here let's just add two more fields let's add a float for the fov and then another float for the view business and here the way we create our field of view class makes this very easy we can simply go into it and we set the fov to this fov and set the view distance alright there it is very nice now we can go into the editor and here each enemy now has the fields in here for the FOV and view distance and yep here we are and you can see that each enemy does indeed have a different film the view and view distance so here we are these are very short down very low and so on right great now let's deal with the enemy actually detecting the player so here on our enemy script and let's go to our update and here we're going to make a function let's going with find target player and we're going to call this on our update ok so now in this function let's first comment like just the distance to the player so we're going to do an if a vector 3 dot distance between this position and the player position and if that distance is under our view distance then the player is inside the V distance so if he is let's start attacking ok so here we are and let's test it out with this enemy so I go in here now its move inside his view distance and if there yogi attacked me instantly ok great so we are correctly testing the player distance now obviously we also need to test for the angle so here we just view distance you can see that if I go out here in theory I'm outside of his angle but we're just asking for distance so he hits me instantly all right so now that we're currently testing distance let's also test for the angle so okay here we are we're testing inside distance all right now in here on let's calculate the direction to the player so here we have our direction to the player and now in here we need to calculate the angle between the direction to the player and our actual aim direction now unity already has a great function to do just that it's the vector three angle this returns the angle in degrees between a from and a 2 so it has the angle between the aim direction and the direction to the player so this returns our angle now we need to do is test if this angle is less than our film review so if it's less than the FOV however in here the film the view variable contains the total field of view since we are completing the angle from the middle direction we're going to be inside the field of view if we are smaller than half of the field of view okay let you do it let's test here we are again there is our enemy now let's move in here on the side and let's go inside his view distance any of there you go he cannot spot me since I am NOT inside his field of view and now I move from the side into his field of view any of there you go he finds me instantly and shoots me all right awesome now the last thing we need is to make sure that the player is actually visible inside the field of view so as you can see his film the view goes all the way in here then the view this isn't here but in here it's walked by that wall so in theory if I go in there I shouldn't be spotted but right now yep I am spotter okay so let's deal with that okay so back in here we're testing for the view distance then for the field of view and finally let's also make sure that there is nothing in between the enemy and the player so here we can simply go into our physics 2d to do a nice ray cast the origin is this get position for direction is the direction to the player and for distance let's do our view distance so this returns a ray cast hit 2d and I'm here what's test if we hit something so if the color is not known then we hit something and now let's test if that something is the player so here we go into the game object we get the player component if it is not known then we have hit the player so here we start hitting him and if it is not the player then we hit something else so we ignore it alright let's see ok Here I am there's the enemy first let's try on this side and if there you go I'm inside the V distance but not inside the fov so he's not hitting me now let's go into the other side and let's go inside in here let's wait for them to go go inside and yep he's not hitting me and now if I move inside his field of view yep there you go he starts eating me right awesome so we now have our nice and min detection working they test for inside the view distance then inside the field of view and finally not hidden behind anyone so again here we are and that enemy can only spot me if I'm inside these view distance inside the field of view and not hiding behind so in here I'm fine and I can move in here and now I try to go and I that insulin so just like this we already have a very nice effect that would be suitable for any sort of stealth or horror game ok so now I can try to make my way through the entire map and reach my goal so get past this one ok now that one is coming wait for him to go it's coming wait and yep now I go now go go go yep now I'm in here now wait for both of them and yep now that one is going wait for him to go there now let's wait for him to go back and yep and there you go I want I got the trophy alright awesome so this is a really great fact if you're working on any sort of stealth or horror game you can use it on the player like we did in the previous video or add it to the enemies like in here now you could expand upon this further to implement the crop zone like in commandos and the Sprouse you could also add a smooth rotation to the enemy so their view cones were easier to avoid if you want to see the underlying field of view effect using a complete game then check out my survivor squad games included in the game bundle those games are all about controlling your survivors and managing each field of view to make sure you cover all the corners personally I really enjoy it and survivor squad gauntlets is definitely one of my favorite games so go play it to see how you can apply this effect to your own games as always you can download the project the attorneys from mythical Malcolm subscribe to channel for more inti tutorials post any questions you have in the comments and I'll see you
