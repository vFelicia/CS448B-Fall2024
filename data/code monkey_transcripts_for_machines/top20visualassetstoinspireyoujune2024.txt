hello and welcome I'm your KMI the SSA is full of awesome tools and asss help you make your own games there's more and more awesome visual stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for June 24th even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid ass and effects I've already made two videos covering the best fre new assets and best TOs and systems as always there's links to the ass in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code Mony 10 to get 10% off your order quick update on my dots scores after a ton of work building the Prototype after writing basically a small novel I finally started recording the lectures the recording and the editing are usually the fastest stages so I think I'll have the first part ready in about two weeks now I'm saying first part because it turns out this course will actually be quite massive making an RTX is a quite complex genre and adding dots on top of that means there's tons of interesting stuff to teach so I will be publishing the course in Parts as I complete them stay tuned you can sign up on the course page and if you already signed up then I'll send you an email to let you know when the course is out all right so starting off with a really awesome visual effect pack this one looks truly gorgeous some very unique effects you've got a heatwave and some kind of holographic effect alongside multiple variations so this could be some kind of scanner in your game or perhaps some really intense Fire magic spell next if you want to make your game stand out then a shaded effect like this one can really help it adds nice thick outlines to all the edges of your objects again that's all the edges not just the outside edges it is not just an outline effect personally I really love this look it makes it look a lot more stylized so even if you use some common visual assets they will still stand out then here's the latest CTI pack this one is all about the apocalypse Wasteland however wonder if they intentionally time this one to coincide with the latest Mad Max movie it does feature very much that kind of style you've got lots of abandoned highways Rusty vehicles and buildings that have been taken over by Nature it also includes a ton of really unique vehicles built from all kinds of random mechanical parts and it also has a bunch of acid with some goop mutants next for another nice effect here is Umbra this one lets you add better softer directional Shadows by default unity's main light has some pretty hard Shadows even if you set them on soft mode they are still pretty hard whereas this effect this one gives you quite a lot more control for making them look much softer much nicer you can customize the softness based on distance and it's also super easy to set up just add the effect to your renderer and that's it then for some super fun looking effects here is some carfire and explosions it looks really perfect just like you would see on some kind of movie where they place a bomb under the car the explosion is really satisfying going out of the windows and turning into fire the car even jumps up a little bit so like I said perfectly taken exactly as you would see on some kind of Mafia movie Next for a nice animation pack here is one all about Mages it's a really huge pack almost 500 animations that's a lot it's got lots of unique combo attacks with the staff you've got various actions to activate all kinds of skills and it's also got lots of parries and Dodge rolls so this would be perfect for some kind of game inspired by devil mry then then if you want to make giant RPG 2D worlds check out this one it's a complete pack with a ton of tiles you've got ancient ruins you've got sewers a prison Cemetery Crypt and a bunch more it includes both World tiles as well as some characters so with just this one pack you can make a super huge great looking world with lots of unique biomes or if all you want is just a single super high quality character if so check out this one it's a monk very much of the martial arts variety I love the style for this one although apparently this pack does not contain any animations just a gorgeous visual mesh next if you need a simple seethrough Shader then here it is it does exactly what it says it keeps your character visible even when included there are various methods to play around with so you can make the occluder object hide itself like just hide the entire object or you can use a nice round seethrough area you can make it fade on distance or customize the round seethrough shape then if you want to make your own Five Nights at Freddy's here's a pack perfect for exactly that it features some really creepy really spooky animatronics I got to say this is something that always creeps me out I am not a fan of animatronics in general and especially not when they're possessed but if you are if you're making a horror game then this is definitely perfect there's five creepy characters of various animals and if you have creepy characters in your game you probably want to shoot them so if so here's some nice shooting VFX all of them are very very realistic you have muzzle flashes and impact particles there's lots of them lots of muzzle flashes for each individual weapon and for the impact particles it also has lots of them for all kinds of materials so you've got one for wood ceramic metal and so on or if your game is more in feudal Japan then here's a great environment pack these got some excellent looking very realistic assets like seriously these could be taken straight from the game Ghost of sushima it features 400 highquality assets including some modular pieces so you could use them to build your own custom environments or if you're making a nice transort Tycoon sort of game if so here's a nice pack you've got Planes Trains and buzzes so really great for making a nice tycoon game all about transporting people between cities kind of like the game Cities in Motion I really like that game or you can just use the planes for some kind of flying Simulator game next next for some 2D here is a top down Character Pack they are in a perfect isometric perspective with many sides for the animations you've got lots of movement and combat animations so Redway just looking at this obviously this would be great for making some kind of game kind of like Diablo I then if your game has swords here is a nice pack with some gorgeous slash animations personally I always love the stylish fluidlike animations it works great on stylized action games it's got some nice whitened black slashes or if you're making some nice citybuilder game and you need some skyscrapers if so here's a great pack it's it's got lots of unique modules that you can use to build your buildings so you can customize in many many ways and it also includes various decoration prefabs or if you don't want to build all that you can just use the premade buildings then if you have characters and you want to make them a little bit more unique here are some nice weird masks these are some very inventive designs the wolf and the Goblin masks these look straight out of Demon Slayer I wonder if that's the actual reference or if they come from some other thing got lots of strange ones including some plague masks and some strange demon masks next if you have some characters and you want to make your game come alive here's some general daily activities animations it's a giant pack with literally a thousand animations they have a link to the full animation list on the store Page it's really a NeverEnding list of all kinds of everyday activities animations this can really help your game come to life as opposed to just having a single idle animation or if you're making a SciFi game here's a nice space VFX pack you can easily create Suns black holes planets or some nice Starry backgrounds all the objects look really gorgeous especially the black hole that looks really perfect and the stars of course also look great you can play around the colors to get pretty much any visual you want then for a nice casual UI here's a great pack it's got some nice round design some very appealing colors you've got lots of buttons banners icons toggles and really anything you need in order to build a nice casual game UI all right so
