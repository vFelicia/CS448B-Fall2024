hello and welcome I'm your Cod Maki the asset is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your run games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for December 23 this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video I'll already covered the best free new assets and next one I'll cover top visuals and effect as always there's links to the in description as a bonus you can use the coupon code Mony 10 to get 10% off your order by the way my own game is currently discounted as part of the steam holiday sale so if you wanted to try it out then now is your chance and speaking of assets previously I talked about the assets that I Ed to make the game and right now Unity is having their new year sale and if you want you can pick up a bunch of these on discount you can go look at my character customization system and pick up the character's asset this is the one that I use in the game and the one that I use in that system the quantum console is super useful for helping you debug and do tons of things then this asset adds some really nice effects that make everything look gorgeous I use umotion Pro to make a bunch of custom animations directly inside Unity this nice animation pack that I use so many times and the equival Shader this is the main Shader that I use to make the game look really nice really anime like then feel is obviously excellent text and met is one of the best ways to add that extra bit of Polish to your games and for the CTI assets they're actually all also on sale on the cinti store so if you like their low poly sound definitely give it a look check out all the links in the description all right so starting off with a really interesting tool for easily manipulating your objects sometimes when rotating something it can get quite tricky because it always rotates around the pivot which usually is in the center with this tool you can set a custom pivot like for example on an edge on a vertex and then you can rotate or scale directly from that point this is a tiny thing but it's something that is really helpful if you need it like for example if you have a tree and for some reason the model pivot is in the middle of the trunk with this you can easily place it on the bottom to scale and rotate it or for example if you have some kind of chest and you want to open it exactly where the INE would be if so you can easily snap the pivot to a vertex and move it anywhere importantly is this is not actually modify the original pivot it is still wherever it was originally this basically does a bunch of complex math in the the background to make it seem like the pivot changed without actually changing it really useful really tiny tool then one problem that I'm sure you've encountered is missing scripts here's a tool to help with that if you move or rename or delete a script any game object that had that script attach as a component will just say missing script it's really not very helpful how it doesn't actually say what script it was so you can end up with tons of missing scripts and no idea exactly what it's missing this is a very simple tool that helps solve exactly that it tells you the name of the script and where it was the last time it was seeing from what I understand this tool basically creates a Tracker so if you import it onto a project that has missing scripts you won't be able to help it needs to be there from the start but it also seems to integrate well with Git so if you have Source control it may work great either way this is an excellent tiny potentially very useful tool next here's a topic that I've wanted to research for quite some time it's a tool for exporting from unreal into Unity now there are lots of humble bundles all the time and some of them have some gorgeous and real assets and assets are really just assets so there's really no reason why they would be fix to a particular engine you can grab in real assets and take them to Unity or vice versa but while the meshes and textures those are just regular Universal files from what I understand the materials do require some manual work to convert that's the topic that I'd like to research but if you just want a One clict tool then this one seems perfect you load this plugin into a simple Andre project then load some assets into un real then you can simply press a button and this will create a Unity project with all those assets and all the materials and all the shaders all correctly loaded very useful if there are some unreal assets you'd like to try I definitely need to try this out next for something to help you with some gameplay here's a tool for helping you drag slide and rotate this is perfect for helping you quickly make all kinds of adventure games those usually involve lots of tiny interactions it lets you make any object interactable with a variety of interactions you can set up a key to rotate with an angle limit that automatically opens the door you can set up the door to be pullable from one side until the limit you can play with gears you can open some drawers push p pull turn drag drop and really just about any interaction you can think of Adventure and horror games are usually pretty much about all of these kinds of interactions so if you'd like to make a game like those a system like this can really massively speed up that kind of development then here's an interesting codebase tool called The Binding system this one lets you take any Fields you have and basically link them to some value for example you can have a car with engine script and you can have a custom script that listens you player input and then set some float with some speed amount normally you would then from that script call some kind of function on the engine and set the value however with this toel you can kind of do the reverse you can mark the car engine parameter as bindable and then bind it from the other custom play script to that function so basically it is a reverse instead of having your custom input tell the engine how to move instead of that the engine grabs the value from whatever is bound to that variable this can be really helpful to make your games much more designer Focus since you can link lots of custom logic very easily directly in the editor without having to touch any code you can bind to literally anything not just custom functions it can be any any exposed property or any script including all of the builtin components like for example a standard UI slider you can make the engine script bound to the slider value no code required super easy this is definitely very unique very interesting tool especially if you're the kind of person who likes to connect all your logic in the editor instead of through code next if you'd like to make a game kind of like Gang Beast here's a great complete template importantly this is an online enabled template that's what makes this one really stand out when working with physics making it online is always really tricky so that really is the important feature of this template this one is built using miror networking the characters are all very wobbly and perfectly synchronized in multiplayer you can attack your opponents you can grab them and throw objects all with lots of tiny physics all perfectly synchronized so this one basically has all the features you expect from these kinds of games so if you'd like to build one then this would be a great starting point then if you're a fan of the blender ability to subdivide meshes and you'd like to do that directly inside Unity if so here's a great tool it does exactly that you basically take a mesh any mesh and it automatically subdivides that mesh to make it a lot more rounded a lot more smooth since nowadays a lot of games are using in low poly style perhaps applying this fuel to some low poly assets can make it unique enough to stand out surprisingly this appears to work well on regular meshes as well as also on skin meshes so you could definitely also apply this to a bunch of characters naturally there are potential concerns with regards to the max number of polygons but if your scenes aren't too huge then this could work and could make your game look quite a bit more interesting quite a bit more unique or maybe you need something to help you generate the world if so look at this one this uses a lot of procedural generation to help you generate huge worlds it also matches different parts together as tiles it looks really easy to use just a handful of parameters and you already have a really nice looking world or you can dive deep and modify every single thing to get exactly the world that you want you can generate mountains River Seas islands and really anything then if you'd like to record a gameplay session check out this tool importantly this is not a video tool it does not record video instead it requires inputs actions and positions this way you can easily scrub through the timeline back and forth this is excellent whenever you encounter some kind of bug and you need to reproduce it if you did record the inputs that let to the bug that can make it really helpful in order to record you really just add a recordable component then select all the various fields that You' like to record you can record Properties or fields or even events and then that data is saved onto a regular CSV file which you can then play back during gameplay next if you've seen those TVs that take the color of whatever's on screen and apply to some LEDs in the back if so then this tool does pretty much that you can select a position in the world and it will constantly sample that color then you can use that color for whatever you want like for example tinting the UI or some text it looks really easy to use just attach the component to whatever transform exists in the world then just play around with all the various parameters you can clamp the color you can modify the saturation and a bunch more things that honestly I'm really not too familiar with because I don't know much about color theory but you do have quite a lot of control over exactly how the color is simpled this one is certainly a very unique thing but something that might help your game feel a bit more dynamic for example you can add some clamping and make it a very subtle effect make your UI suddenly darker when inside a dungeon and then slightly lighter when outside all right so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unts store for December 23 there's
