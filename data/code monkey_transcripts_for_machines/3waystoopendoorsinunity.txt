this video is sponsored by Places ultimate game idea contest powered by Fiverr in this video we're going to look at three ways to handle doors in unity all three methods are a valid and you can choose which one best suits your game later we're also going to look at four ways we can interact with our doors using a button key pressure plate and automatic let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code

it simply enables or disables a game object so if I try to go through nope can't do it but if I press a button there you go the game object is disabled so the collider is disabled and I can now easily go through it and I press another button and the game object is now active and I can no longer go through it so that's the simplest most straightforward approach just enabling and disabling a game object and then over here we have this one which is more like what you might use in a game this one is using an animation in order to move its colliders so first of all it's nice and someone then I press a button and there you go it plays a nice animation moves the doors around which also moves the colliders and I can now go through it now press another button and their yard moves the colliders back and again it's once again solid so the animation is moving the transforms which also moves the colliders so I can pass through and lastly over here we have the third method this one is based on a hinge joint so this could be the best one if you had a pure topdown perspective game something like hotline Miami or my survivor squad games so for starters I'd try to go through it and nope can't do it it's solid and now I press a button and the door is unlocked and I can now go through it and yep I can push it and works as a hinge joint and now I press another button and there you go it causes instantly and once again it's back to being sound alright so here are the three methods of handling doors first with a game object enable disable then with a animation to open and close by moving the colliders and finally with a hinge joint that we can lock or unlock so these are our three methods now in the next video I won't cover four ways of interacting with any of these doors so here I have another demo scene with those four methods they are only using the door and made a type now this one on the left is pretty much like we saw so I go in here I press button and there you go opens door press button again and it causes then over here we have one based on a key I actually covered this specific key door system in detail in another video as well so if I don't have the key there your doors closed but if I pick up the key and go near the door there you go it opens so that's the second method for interacting with the door and over here the third one this one is based on a pressure plate so as I step on it yep there you go it opens the door and when I step out it starts counting in a timer and as soon as the timer elapses the door closes and finally over here is the last interaction method this one is a simple automatic door so as I approach it opens and I go through I move away and there you go it causes so here are four methods to interact two doors that are on showcase in the next video and all four interaction methods work with any of the three types of doors that we're going to or in this one if you were watching this in the future then check the link in the description and if not it should be out by next week alright so here we have our three methods of handling doors this is our goal so let's get to it okay so here's the starting scene I just have some walls and player has some movement code and some head boxes check out the character controller video I made previously to see how this character is set up okay so now we have this very nice gap and let's add our first door now over here I have some door sprites so let's just drag it in so the left door and then the right door and now in order to keep our object nicely organized let's put both of our sprites inside of a channel game object so let's make a new one come with the door and drag both of them on there so we have our door and let's place it right in our gap all right so here's our door visual now in order for it to be solid let's add a box Collider component and let's edit the size to be about that okay there's our Collider so just like this we should have a block upon door let's test so here we are and if I move into the wall no cannot go through the wall and through the door no cannot go through the door alright great so far so good now this will be the door that is based on instantly enabling and disabling the game object so let's make our script to handle it create a new C sharp script we're going to call this the door set active and let's wreck it on top of our door game object okay now in here let's just make two very simple functions so we're going to have a poet boy open door and a public boy closed door so these are our two basic actions with our door and inside all we're going to do is extremely simple we access the game object in order to do step active so this enables or disables the game object so in this case when we want to open let's disable the game object and when we want to close we enable all right so that's it very simple this is the simplest method we just enable or disable the game object now we just need to call these functions so let's see the simplest method for interacting with this door we're going to make it that we press a button in order to open the door and a button to close it let's make our script so in here let's make a new C sharp script going to call this the door trigger button and let's make a game object to run our script so you game object give it a name and drag the script okay now in here and we're going to do is first of all add a serialized field for our door so door set active and now we do a paranoid update and on update let's listen to input yet key down and let's say when we press the F key then we want to open the door and if we press G then let's close all right here's our very basic door trigger button and back here in the editor all we need to do is drag our door reference okay let's do it and let's test okay here we are and if we try to go through nope the door is closed so it's a solid object now I press the button and there you go the game object is disabled and the door is now open so I can now freely go straight through it and I'll press the close button and there you go the game object is enabled again the door closes and again there it is I cannot go through it alright so we have our door working awesome alright so here we have the first and simplest method of handling a door it works with setting a game object either enabled or disabled and doing so makes the collider either solid or not so this is the most basic method this works although having the door instantly disappear and appear doesn't realm load too good so let's check out the second method of handling a door this one using animations so first let's start off by duplicating our door so let's duplicate and keep this one on the background now here we have the door animated and let's also remove the set active script and now this one is going to be animated so we're going to have an animation push it to the side so the player can pass so for that let's add the animator component and now we need a animator controller so let's go in here create down here we have the animator controller so here this we have the standard basic unity animator now let's create the animation to open our door so first we need the animation tab so we can right click in here in order to add a tab when it's at the animation tab there it is now we select our door animator object and create an animation clip okay so here we have our object in the animation tab open now for our animation let's push the doors to the side but since we're moving with the position we want to make sure we do not mess around with the global position we're just the local so instead of moving our main game object we're going to move the two children so first of all on this frame let's leave it exactly where they were then we move ahead and let's say three frames and push it on to the right alright so that's it just like this we have our simple door open animation now one thing really the animation is no it's going to the project and select our door open animation and in here this is a door open so let's disable our looping alright so that's this one working and now we can also duplicate it to make the door closed animation and to add it to our object let's go into the animator and we drag the door closed animation and now with our object selected we can go into the animation tab and over here some like the door closed and let's swap them out so this one starts off with this frame and ends with that one right there it is there's the close animation so here on our animator we have both of our animation sinks now first of all let's start off with door close so make this one the default state okay and now we're going to have a transition from closed on to open and now we don't want this transition to happen right away rather only when something happens so for that lets go into the parameters in order to add we're going to add a boolean let's call it open and now here when we sound like this transition we can make it a condition and the condition is when open is set to true so an open is set to true we're going to open our door and then we make a transition from open into closed this one is with the commission when open is set to false all right so we have our basic and major setup we just have a open parameter that we can turn either true or false now we need is to interact with this so let's make our script so create in you see sharp script for our door animated panel its regular on to our game object okay and now in here we're going to make our simple open closed doors functions like we did with the other one and in order to open and close we're going to need access to our animators so let's grab it on the awake so we get the animator and when we open we can set beau we're going to set the open to true and when we close we set it to false and that's it that's our very basic script so just like this our code should be working just one last thing over here on our door the way we animate it is we're only moving the inner objects but the boxing weather is currently in this one so right now if we did the animation it would some remain a solid object so in order to fix that let's remove the box Collider from this one and instead place it on our inner objects so now when these two objects move the collectors will move with it and in order to test let's also change our trigger script so here on the door trigger button instead of receiving ftype door set active we're going to receive a door animator and the function calls are exactly the same so nothing else needs to change just back in the editor we need to drag our door animated reference okay so just like this should working let's test okay here we are and the door starts off closed and if I try to go through it nope it's a solid object now I press the button and there you go the animation plays and the door opens and I can now go through it now press the other one and plays the other animation and now the door is closed alright so here we have a door fully working with a animation instead of simply enabling or disabling so this is our second method for handling doors this one is made using an animation which moves the colliders so that we can actually go through it awesome now over here I have a door which works in the exact same way but it's nicely polished I made this door for the key door system video and then I also reused it in the topdown shooter game that I made so it's functionally the same so press a button there you go a very nice more complex animation and doors open one for each side and are too close there you go just like that so functionally exactly the same and you can see that it looks very nice alright so this is the second method and looks quite nice alright now let's check out the third method this one is going to be using a hinge joint now a hinge joint is one way to reconnect an object onto another so the hinge door is going to be a bit different so let's start off with an empty game object call it our door hinge and now inside we're going to have two parts we're going to have the hinge and the door so for that let's create a basic sprite and then in here I have a simple white pixel so just like that this one is going to be working as our hinge and now for the door and over here is the door so we have our two objects now on the hinge let's add a component and we're going to select the hinge joint 2d there here you can already see the widget once you do once you add the hinge joint you can see that it also adds a rigidbody and then on the hinge joint you can see that it has a connected rigidbody so let's go into our door sprite and in here at a rigidbody as well as a Collider and now we can go back into the hinge and drag our door as our connected rigidbody so those two are now linked and now in order to limit the rotation we can add over here our use and limits and let's say that the rotation is just like that all right so that's pretty much a setup and since we're working in topdown then we can actually make this one just static instead of dynamic since we don't want our hinge to move and let's also go into the door and disable our graphic all right so this is on pretty much set up the hinge joint will limit how much this second door object actually moves alright that should do it and let's test ok so here we are there's our door and if we go to it and push it yup there you go I push the door and work exactly as the door shooters so there you go it's working so this object is connected to that hinge and because the limits that we set up we can actually limit this or make it bigger all right so here's our door working awesome now the question becomes is how do we actually open or close this door right now there's no lock on this door so I can just go straight through it and push it now we can very easily add a lock with one very simple thing here we can easily play around with our limits so when it's locked we're going to limit the angles to zero and when it's unlocked we're going to set it to these valleys so let's make our door script so a new csharp script for our door hinge and let's track the object onto it okay now in here let's do our normal open and close functions alright that's it and now on a weak let's grab the families that we set in the editor so first of all we find our hinge so transform find our hinge game object and then we get the component of type hinge joint 2d and now in here we can access our limits so let's sort the limits that are on awake then we also define the closed door limits and to calls it we're simply going to set the min and Max on to 0f all right so that's pretty much it we have our open door and closed our limits and then when we open we simply apply them so we go into the hinge joint 2d and set the alignment to the open door limits and in here to the coast are limits all right that's it very basic now let's modify our trigger button script so in here instead of door I names let's use a door hinge back in the editor let's drag our reference and when while staying in here let's make sure we start off with a closed door just like that alright let's test ok so here we are and if I try to push it nope can't do it so door is now solid and I'll press the button and the door should now be unlocked and if I go through it if there you go now I can push it and push the door around now press the other one and there you go it sets the limits and it's autumn closes the door alright so here I can lock and unlock our very nice door awesome so this is our third method using a hinge joint to make our door this is the perfect method if you have some sort of pure topdown game like hotline Miami or even my survivor score games alright so here we have our three methods of handling doors now first we saw enabling and disabling a game object so right now it's solid then press a button and the game object is disabled and I can now go through it press again and now it's solid again then over here we have the animation so right now it's not only to press a button the animation plays it pushes away the colliders and I can now go through it and there you go close it again so this is the second method and thirdly we made it using a hinge so right now it's locked I cannot push it but if I press a button I can unlock it and now I can push it purse another button and goes back to being closed so here we have three ways of handling our doors now in the next video I won't cover four methods of interacting with any of these doors so here is a demo of the four methods we're going to cover the one on the left is just like we saw its button activated so as I get near and press a button there your door opens I can go through press another button and it closes okay then this one is actually based on a key so right now I push it and I cannot go through it but if I pick up the key and I'll go through it yep there you go the door is now open next is one based on a pressure plate so again it's on solid now step on it and door opens and if I step away it counts on a timer and after a certain amount of time there you go the door calls again so I need to step on it in order to go through it and go quickly and it closes and finally over here is the own last interaction method this one is a simple automatic door so as I approach it there you go it opens and I go through it move away and it causes back again there you go just like this so these are the four methods to interact with doors that I won't showcase in the next video and all for interaction methods work with any of the three types of doors that we covered in this video so if you're watching this in the
