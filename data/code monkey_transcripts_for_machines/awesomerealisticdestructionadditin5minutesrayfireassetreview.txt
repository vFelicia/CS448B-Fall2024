hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out a really awesome destruction asset called rayfire this one lets you easily add super realistic fragments onto your games so you can easily shatter glass break wood into splinters or make concrete crumble you can trigger it with an explosion with a collision or by shooting some bullets you can even preshatter objects or do all of that destruction in run time and it even works on skin meshes so you can easily slice your enemies in half this video will split in two parts first let's look at some of the demos to see what the asset can do and how they work then after that i'll do a stepbystep guide on how to start using it and add it to your games there's also time steps in the video if you want to look ahead check out the entire asset review playlist where i highlight great assets to help you make your games awesome this video is sponsored by unity which is currently running the massive black friday sale on the unity assessor there's over 500 assets all heavily discounted everything from tools to models animations and tons of effects on top of that this sale also has lightning deals which start at 90 off and slowly go down in discount as more and more people buy the asset so that means that if you get it quickly you can get a massive discount i also made a video and a list covering some of the best highlights the sale is on until the 4th of december so check it out with a link in the description and this asset is also discounted as part of the sale so if you like what you see in this video go ahead and pick it up before the discount ends and if you're watching this after the sale is over then you can instead use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order okay so rayfire this is an awesome asset for adding destruction onto your games there is mountains of settings so you can destroy objects exactly as you want them you can make glass and shutters into a million pieces or concrete that breaks into big chunks or some wood that breaks into splinters or really just about anything there's tons of options for how you want the destruction to happen and then even more options for how you want to trigger that destruction so you can trigger it with a gun shooting some bullets or maybe with an explosion or just some contact by things falling on top of each other or maybe even some wind or anything you want it is also very easy to use you just have the component for whatever behavior you want play around the settings and that's pretty much it in the end when i do my demo you will see how it takes just a few minutes to set it all up this one is definitely one of the most impressive assets i've seen it does exactly what it's meant to do in an excellent way and it's also very performant with a huge amount of debris and tons of options to get it performing exactly as you want it so you can push it to its limits with tons of objects in order to run the game on consoles or pcs but you can also lower the simulation lower the amount of objects and get it working on mobile now also i should mention there is one limitation on this asset that may or may not be an issue for you as of the time of this recording it does not support runtime fragmentation on consoles you can still do all of the edit time things so you can preshatter objects record their behavior and slice them but all of that has to be prepared in edit mode again that means it works on consoles you just have to use the preshutter methods and not share them in runtime so from what i've tried that doesn't seem like a huge limitation but still if you're making a game specifically for consoles do keep it in mind and possibly do some testing beforehand okay so here i've got my project and i import the package now as for documentation this asset has a massive amount which is always excellent you have a where to start text file this one directs you into the info howto folder and for you inside you can see a ton of documentation then there is also a really awesome playlist on youtube so you've got tons of tutorial videos for pretty much any kind of topic so all these videos explain all the components of their settings and everything so as you can see tons of stuff really awesome and if you want you can even contact the developer directly on discord or through email now on the text documentation you have very highly detailed documents explaining each individual component so for example over here the rayfire widget this is one of the most important ones you can look at it and yep here is a really detailed really indepth component explaining everything that this does so for example this one the main purpose is advanced physics control and runtime demolitions then every single option is nicely explained so for example the initialization you've got by method or by start so it explains the differences it also has links to those really indepth youtube videos and there you go so explain everything about the simulation type about the object type and so on so really in terms of documentation this asset is absolutely excellent then you've also got a howto folder and this one has all kinds of scenarios with really nice stepbystep instructions so for example do you want to know how to demolish a mesh object in runtime caused by a collision so you just go here and you've got really nice stepbystep instructions for how to make it all that happen and finally you've got a massive amount of tutorial demo scenes let's look at some of these to see how this works for example under the shutter folder you can see all the various shadow types so for example let's start with voronoi here you see a nice simple demo with just some basic ones you can see they're using the standard mesh folder component as well as the mesh render and then this one has a rayfire shadow component so right now you see normal object just a basic wall and then you hit on fragment and now you can see a preview of how this object will be fragmented so it generates all of these individual fragments and all of them generated using all of these settings so you can see in the hierarchy how it dynamically generated all of these objects based on these settings so for example i can delete the last increase the amount by quite a bit fragment a bit more and there you go a bunch more over here on the scale preview you can increase or decrease in order to really see all the various pieces you can put into color in order to really see it and you can also just delete the preview so of these demos they've got various objects to showcase various things so for example this one has the amount set to 30 so it creates 30 fragments then this one has 400 so it fragments into 400 segments and then over here this one this one has a center bias over here on the center bias it is set nearly two one and there's actually gizmo that you can move however like this if i'm using the move tool and i move it in there it's actually moving the object that's because the gizmo is placed on the exact same position but if i swap into the hand tool now the normal move gizmo is hidden so i can only see the one for this gizmo so there you go so that's the center bias and if you have a fragment yep there you go so you've got more fragments around that area and less as it goes further away so you can play around the center bias to make it more or less focused on this specific point so for example this setting will be very useful when later on we'll look into using a gun in order to shoot an object and shatter more on the point of impact and less the far away it gets so these are demonstrating basic fragments in simple cubes and this final one shows how the whole thing also works based on custom meshes so on this mesh fragment and there you go the whole thing breaks into parts so this one on this demo is just showing one type so over here on the fragment type from this dropdown menu you see all the various types so these are only using voronoi then you've got various demos for all the various types for example over here the splinters demo so this one is perfect for simulating some kind of wood so as you can see it splinters in a really nice area then you can also play around the axes so you can get all kinds of these with all various amounts of things so that one is almost completely straight then this one is going the other way and this one is going on the z axis and again all this also works on complex meshes so this one would be perfect for any kind of wood material then you've got slabs so this one would be great for some kind of concrete so it creates nice big chunks then you've got radial so this one looks really cool look at that really nice and again you can change the center bias so for example this one would be perfect for some glass let's say we throw a rock around that corner and fragment and there you go it all breaks perfectly so as you can see you've got all kinds of custom shadow types you also have a really interesting one that's more kind of like a tool so this one so sometimes you might have a mesh which is separated into parts but it's all part of one mesh so all of this is one singular object but if you fragment using decompose then all of a sudden you get these really nice separate fragments so just a nice useful tool okay so all of these are just showing the shadow types then we see some more about actual simulations again these demos are really excellent showing all kinds of scenarios and how all the options work so for example here on simulation type if we run this one look in the demo there you go all of them fall down and yep when there's a collision they trigger they crash these are all really nicely named so you can see that this one is testing the simulation dynamics over there simulation type on dynamic so this one is initialized at start so as soon as it starts this object with all of these fragments they are all set up as dynamic so they automatically start falling then for this one they start off as sleeping so all the fragments are there but they're only simulated after a collision happens and this one is also similar this one is inactive so as soon as there is a collision they become active and the final one is kinematic so this one affects other things but it does not get affected so that is why when you fall one life falls right away these two happen on collision and that one does not fall so again all of this demonstrate all of the various ways that you can use this asset then this demo is showcasing the mesh demolition types so this one only generates the destruction on runtime so as it falls right now as you can see it's just one solid object and as it falls down on when it actually hits does it actually generate the destruction and these two await precache and awake prefragment so instead of waiting for a collision to happen these automatically generate all the various pieces as soon as the game starts and then when the collision happens it actually creates those pieces it spawns them and there you go they all fall down then this demo shows all of the physics materials so for example this one here is a heavy metal ball so if i activate it it starts falling down there you go it's a heavy metal ball so not much bounciness whereas this one is a rubber ball so as it falls down there you go nice amount of bounciness then some of these showcase friction so a piece of concrete as you can see it doesn't really slide down much but if it's a piece of ice there you go it slides down nicely then here for destructibility this one is made of metal so it falls down and yep just stays there and this one is made of ice so as it falls down yep it shatters into a million pieces so all the pieces and all destruction that we saw all of that can have any physics material that you want then over here on this demo mesh demolition fragments over here we can see the combination of all the shadow types that we saw being used in demolition so this one right here falls down and shatters pretty normally then this one over here has a center bias so if the rock only hits the side then it only causes that image to the side then this one falls down and breaks into splinters and this one falls down and breaks into a radio and again all these demos you can obviously inspect all the components to see how they're all set up so for example this one is the splinters you can see how it's set up you can see the mesh demolition it's set up to use shatter and then down here there's the nice refire shadow components of the splinters and all that so this is how you set up your objects like glass wood and so on you would define the shadow type then when something happens in game they shatter exactly as you want another really cool demo is over here the blade these ones you've got a bunch of blades so it's using the rayfireplay component and you can just click and drag and go and slice it there you go slices perfectly and again the docs are excellent for learning what all these settings do for example this one is set to on trigger on exit so if i take the blade and i put it inside the object it doesn't slice yet only when it leaves then actually cause the slice there you go one slice another one also another interesting thing is over here on the demolition on the rayfire rigid under depth this is how many times this object can be demolished so if you set to one can only be sliced once and if you set it to zero it can be sliced infinite times so here i've got the object and i can slice and go there you go generates that slice and another one right there and so on and the whole thing falls down really nice then if you add a ton more demos showing all the various ways that you can activate your objects connectivity which is how you can put together multiple objects into a single structure and then as well as dust and debris so this acid also comes with some prebuilt vfx to really make it look awesome and of course with destruction there's a really nice gun demo so you have a virtual gun object with this ray fire gun script then there's a second object for the target so i can aim and shoot in there and if you hit on play and over here under gun you can see and you can also see where it's going to hit and you can fire a single shot or you can just start shooting and really see how the whole thing happens there you go taking down that and in this case this one is using a connected structure so after take out enough and yep there you go the whole thing falls down really nice really satisfying with all the particles debris and so on all that really nice okay so like i said this asset is really excellent when it comes to documentation as you can see tons and tons of demos showcasing every possible use case you could probably want as well as all of the textbased documentation explaining every single component how to do a bunch of things and so on and all of those really awesome tutorial videos that make it really easy to learn so this asset really gives you all the tools that you need in order to easily learn how it works and start applying it to your games so with that said let's go to the second part of this video and learn how to apply it to your own game okay so here is my demo i have my basic character i can walk around i can move i can also aim and i can shoot now i covered how all of this works in my third person shooter video and over here i've got some glass and behind it there's some targets and right now if i shoot yep it all works it destroys the glass and back then it destroys the target so i can shoot and destroy everything now as you can see they vanish instantly they just get destroyed that's really not very satisfying so let's use rayfire to apply some destruction to this simple demo and see the massive difference that it makes so the first thing we're going to need is a rayfire gun so let's make a new game object let's come with a gun and now in component let's add a component go down into rayfire and down here let's use rayfire gun and here to make things easy to aim let's also add a target so just an empty game object for the done target and just assign it and just like this yep now we have target and i can move the target in order to aim anywhere okay now for these fields one of the more important ones is over here the radius so this is how big we want to hit so like this it will hit every object in this area but for a gun we really want to be quite a bit smaller something like this looks good and then for the strength this is how much force the gun will impact so let's increase by a little bit but not too much and finally for damage this is how we're going to actually destroy the rigid body object so you could just put it on max or just put it at one and then essentially we give it a health of just one so for that let's go into the glass object and over here add a component and for this one let's go into rayfire and add a basic refire rigid component now for initialization let's initialize it immediately at start okay for the simulation type in order to make this more performant we can actually start this off as inactive then for the object type this one is a mesh demolition type let's make it on runtime and then over here for the activation let's activate it on impact so it starts off inactive and then activates next up let's go over here into the physics and over here we can modify the material type and one of the included ones is glass so that's perfect for this one and everything else can stay with the defaults let's just make sure we destroy this using damage so down here under damage let's enable damage and put max damage of just one okay so we should be able to shoot the class and see the last break so let's see so the game is currently running i've got the gun selected and head on single shot and there you go yep it does indeed shatter the glass okay so far so good now let's play around with the fragments to make them look a bit more like less like this it's way too big fragments we want it a bit smaller so back in the last component let's add another one again go inside of refire and this time we want a very fire shatter we want to use this to define how it's going to shatter and also up here let's go into the mesh demolition yep and over here we've got the use shatter so let's enable this one so now we're going to use the properties from down here and of course we can also test see how it's going to be so like that that's the normal default shutter but for glass let's actually change the time so instead of voronoi let's go with a radial and again we can test just need to play around over here with the center axes and then let's also increase the number of rings okay so like this that's starting to look a bit more like less now just one last thing let's enable the contact bias so up here let's go into the mesh demolition settings and here we've got the contact bias and let's put it on maximum so now if we shoot the glass it should actually let's just disable these fragments like this fragments grab the gun target and let's actually try to hit it all the way up there in the corner and now that area should shatter more than the rest so let's see so here in the gun let's fire a single shot and yep there you go it does fire all of that and everything looks pretty great all right so far so good now the one issue that we see is that the spawn pieces look at these just hanging in the mid there that's because they are spawned using the same simulation as the parent so we set that one as inactive so all of these pieces they start off as inactive so we need to activate them for them to actually follow along so that's also an easy setting to change so let's just go down here it's under the demolition and the mesh demolition over here on advanced we've got the sim type so inherit this one takes the exact same one that the parent has or we can just put them on dynamics so all of them will be dynamic so now if we test here's the gun let's hide the impact and let's fire a single shot and if there you go the whole thing breaks all right awesome okay so the class is looking perfect now let's handle the targets now the setup is going to be pretty similar so we can actually just copy this component so let's copy the component the way fire rigid let's go into that target and let's paste the component and we can also copy the shatter just going to change the type so also let's copy this one go down to the target and paste it now let's just position the target so we can easily test okay so it's aiming at the target now the differences over here under physics instead of glass that target is made of wood so let's select that now we just need to change the shadow type so let's go down here and swap from radial and for what makes sense to be splinters okay now one extremely important thing when using this on a custom mesh like the one that i have here if like this i click on fragment you can see that nope doesn't work nothing actually changed so everything's almost exactly the same so it's not actually fragmenting now the issue with that is because the mesh needs to be set up in a specific way so let's go into the mesh so up here on the mesh filter and let's go into this mesh so here it is and on the mesh over here under model on the import settings we need to make sure that read write is indeed enabled so if this one is disabled doesn't work but if we enable apply then let's go back into our target and now we can hit on fragment and if there you go all the really nice fragments so always keep that in mind when you use a custom mesh make sure the mesh is marked as read write okay so target should be working and let's apply the same thing over here to the pillars so once again we can just copy the same thing the differences on this one is over here on the material type instead of wood let's go with concrete and then down here instead of splinters let's go with varnoi so like this these are way too big chunks so let's make them a bit smaller so just increase the amount pretty simple okay that looks pretty decent okay so with all this now we should be able to test so let's just reenable the last object and let's test okay so like this with the gun selection let's fire a single shot and there you go the glass is down and actually the pillar also went down so we need to disable that but let's see also over there on the target and yep the target splits into a milling pieces alright so it already looks pretty good now let's fix this issue with the pillar the issue is that the object was demolished by collision so we can just disable this or increase the solidity either one works so like this that probably should be fixed and also we can also punish this up by quite a bit by in the included debris and dust effects so once again let's go into rayfire and let's add the rayfire debris and then also rayfire let's add the rayfire dust so just enable the event on all of them okay so on the dust and debris i just had the included materials and now we can test okay so i can now shoot the glass and yep it falls down does not trigger the destruction on the pillar and now i can shoot the pillar one shot and if there you go it does fall down and the target as well so there's a target fire shot and there you go it all works all right awesome so all that's left is to connect this to our character so here is my camera script which is said using rayfire and then let's add a serialized field let's make it of type ray fire gun for the ray fire gun and also just a transform for the target okay so here in the editor just drag the references okay now down here is the shooting function again i covered how this script works on the third person shooter video so we have the target position which is the mouse run position so we can just put the target on that position so the rate fire target we set the position on the target position and then we go into the rayfire gun and we call shoot okay so that's pretty much it very simple what's this okay so here i am and as i am and i shoot if i shoot on the floor you can see yep over there the target is being set so down there you can see the target is correctly being teleported to exact mouse position where i'm shooting okay so i can now move around let's try to shoot the glass and if there you go the whole thing falls down try to shoot down any of it does work try to shoot down and yep everything falls down so all the breeze all the particles everything really nice explosion now let's just apply those changes to all the prefabs and also fix this one where the particles are hanging in the air so that one is pretty simple just over here under activation for the pillar let's activate it by offset so if they move by a tiny amount they become active and finally just apply the changes so these two components apply them to the prefab okay so here i am walking around and let's take out the glass and yep it falls they got more of it take out the target and another target take out all the glass all the things they got all the pillars and yep look at that really nice really awesome destruction everything blows over alright so yeah compare this with the previous one and you can see the massive difference that this makes all right there it is and like you saw all this was added in just a few minutes so the asset is really awesome and real easy to use okay so for another fun demo i want to look into slicing a skin mesh render so over here i've got a normal character just playing a idle animation and with my mouse i can change the slice angle and when i click yep it slices the character perfectly i also added some force so like you saw the character parts jump out and i also added some simple slow motion so let's slice like this and now slice again and there you go the whole thing falls down really nice so to set on the sample is pretty easy i just have this object which has the rayfire blade component and then on the character itself the character has a skin mesh render and then a rayfire rigid and over here on object type it is set as skin mesh and also down here under limitations it is toggled slice by blade now one thing on how the rayfire blade component works as you saw in the official demos you can usually just move it but with the skin mesh render for some reason i only managed to make it slice by adding over here on the targets list so i assign the character over here and then i've got a simple script it just grabs the rayfire blade component and then when i press the mouse button it simply calls slice target then to slice further it just goes into the character transform grabs all the fragments from the rayfire region and adds them to the target so i can slice them again so here is demo again rotate put the blade in anywhere like this slice and there you go everything cuts nicely all right so that's rayfire it's a really awesome destruction asset and the results really speak for themselves you saw the massive difference it makes and how easy it was to add all of the components are very well built with tons of options to get it working exactly as you want it and the documentation is truly excellent both in text format as well as the video tutorials so if you have any part of your game that would benefit from some destruction then i can highly recommend this asset and don't forget to check out unity's black friday sale if you like this asset then this is the best time to get it and beyond that check out all the other assets on sale pretty much all of the best ones are currently discounted i hope you find this asset useful in your own projects check out the funnel asset review plan list for some more awesome assets let me know in the comments any suggestions for other assets i should review thanks for watching and i'll see you next time
