in this video we're going to look at 20 quick unity tips in just 10 minutes alright so let's begin all right so let's begin with tip number one use a white pixel in order to visualize sprite renders so in the hierarchy if you right click create the 2d object and make it a sprite if you do then you can't see anything that is because the sprite render doesn't render anything if over here on the sprite field there's nothing assigned so an extremely useful thing to have is to have a simple white pixel texture and if you drag it and there you go now it's visible you can stretch it you can paint it into any color and so on so this is literally a texture just a one by one white pixel which you can make it in paint or photoshop or really any imaging program tip number two use the inspector debug view now when making your scripts if you're following clean code principles then most of your fields should be set to private now making them private is great but it also means that they don't show up in the editor which can sometimes be useful however there's a really interesting way to see that just go over here on these three dots and change the inspector from normal into debug using that we can now inspect all three private fields and see the value that they have stored now as another bonus tip you can also make multiple inspectors so go up here right click click on add tab add another inspector and for example you could have a normal inspector and then next to it a debug inspector so there it is very useful now tip number three you can automatically create the material to use a specific shaper so down here on my project files i have a very simple shader and now when you want to make a material you might go into the folder that you want to place it in right click go into create and create a new material so that creates a material then over here you go into shader and select your actual shader so that works but another quick shortcut is to right click directly on top of the shader and create a new material and it automatically creates it using that shader tip number four learn about the buttons to swap between pivot and center and local in global so this is something you absolutely must know otherwise it will drive you crazy up here on the top left corner you see these two buttons so this one as you click it changes from pivot to center and this one changes from global to local now this effect where the handles are positioned in the scene view so here let me create just a random object so here it is just an object with two channel sprites inside it and now if i select on the parent and over here is set to pivot then the handle shows up on the actual pivot of this object however if i click on it and select the center now it's over there in the center so for example down here this little white dot is on zero zero zero and then let's say i want to place this parent also on zero zero zero then if i were to go over here and place it on zero zero zero then if you didn't know about these you would be very confused as to why the position is on zero zero but the handle is not so this can cause a ton of confusion and it works the same on all the others so for example if i rotate over here on this end i would be very confused as to why it is not rotating exactly where the handle is placed so again keep in mind on these two and usually you probably want to keep it always on the pivot then the next one is the global and local so for example over here i have added some rotation into the parent game object but all of the other ones do not have any rotation and now if i select combo then on the child we see the handles exactly like this so they are oriented according to the global position space so in here as i move to the right it's moving to the right however let's say that i wanted to move the child alongside the axis of the parent now using this it's very tricky since you would have to pick both of them and visually try to make it exactly perfect so that is why you have the second button to transform into local and now you can modify this handle and there you go it moves along the axis so again if you experience some strange behavior with your handles always make sure to double check to see that you are in the correct mode next up the hierarchy visibility button so down here we have our nice hierarchy window we can see a list of all the game objects present in this scene and you can also see some white space over here on the left side now these are actually two separate buttons now for example here i have my game with a canvas on top now the canvas usually puts it in the corner in there so this is my normal canvas and i simply have a button on the left corner so that works great however if i'm trying to edit something in the actual world space then right here it gets quite confusing because i can really look underneath that one so you can easily go into the canvas and use the button on the left side in order to actually hide it so this one hides the canvas so i can now play around in the actual world without being bothered by what's on the canvas and now the important thing is that this only affects the scene view so if i go into the game view yep over here still looks the same there's the button still in the lower left corner so this button toggles the scene visibility for any game object so you can get a clear view of what you're working on and related to that is the button next to it which is the hierarchy unlock button so let's say i have a huge background sprite down there and now let's say i want to deselect the object that i'm currently selecting so i want to decent like this and if i do when i try to click on the empty space i can't do it since there's really no empty space so by clicking in there i just select the background so over here on the hierarchy on the background game object we press on this button and now this means that we can no longer touch on this actual object so if i click on it now it's the same thing as clicking on empty space so if i had this object selected i move it now i want to deselect i can click on there and yep it works and again this only affects the scene view and not the game view so these two buttons are really great for helping you easily play around as you're making your scene on to the next step use anonymous lambda functions in order to make your code more compact so when the functions are extremely compact which makes them perfect for many scenarios for example over here adding some behavior to a button click so like this it works you access the button you add a listener and you define the function that's going to listen that event so when you click on the button you're going to trigger this function okay however if you had tons of buttons this would be quite a lot of work you would have to write a separate function for every single button so instead you can make this a lot more compact by using a lambda function and yep there it is over here we have the exact same thing that we have down here so we have a function that takes no parameters and then inside we have our code block and in this case we just have a comment so you can use lambda functions whenever you need a delegate so another use case is when dealing with events let's say you don't want to define an actual function so you can do pause equals and over here write down the signature and yep there you go exam like that so lambda functions are extremely useful for making your code more compact if you want to learn more go watch the video where i cover delegates in detail next step you can destroy a script with destroy now for example let's say you want to run some code after the very first update so you make the script it does something on late update and over here we want to do it just once in order to do that you can simply just call destroy and over here we pass in this which is going to pass in the reference to this particular script and if you run it like this so here let's create an empty game object let's attach a script onto it and run the code and if there is the object no longer has that script so the object itself still exists but only the script was destroyed so this can be useful when for example a unit dies but you want to keep the visuals playing some sort of death animation you can just destroy the ai script and leave the rest next step debug.drawing now you probably already know that debug.log is extremely useful however did you know that the debug class also has more functions so if you just go here click on that you can see all the various functions there you go a ton of logs and over here we also have a really interesting draw line so this will draw a gizmo line which can be very useful for visualizing the state of your scripts so for example let's say i had a script that handled some pathfinding so it got almost a path and with this you could use debug.drawline in order to draw a visual representation of the path so here just cycling through the path and drawing a line between the current position onto the next position and yep over here we can see the inner workings of that class so we can see that we have a path going from there there there there so it's a really useful tool when you have some debug info that you want to show with some visual rather than just some text also when you're on the game view make sure you go up here and enable gizmos otherwise the debug.drawline does not actually show alright so the time is almost up so let's go through some quickfire tips you can hit shift space to go full screen so over here i have a shadow graph window so i click on it in order to select it then press shift space in order to talk on full screen so very useful to work around on shadowgraph then go back and go back into the game scene next one you can hit ctrl d in order to duplicate any object so it works in the project files and it also works over here on the hierarchy for another one you can press f2 to rename something again works with the hierarchy and also the project files next on the console right here if you select on these ones you can go into log entry and over here select the number of lines you want for the log so here are two log messages and you can set it to one in order to keep it really nice and compact but if you want to see a ton of text you can set it to many more lines and there you go now it shows that one now choose that one shows where it happened the script that happened and so on next up use the widget to modify the collider size so over here i've got a cube with the box highlighter you can click on this button and there you go now it shows a bunch of dots that you can grab so click and drag and there you go you can set the collateral to exactly the same size that you want without having to touch here on the numbers for the center and the size also related to that you have the polygon collider which you can still add a whole bunch of points anywhere on your shape and if you want to delete them you hold down control and then you click anywhere on the line now just keep in mind you have to click on line or to delete and not on top of the point if you go on top of the point nothing happens have to click on the line in order to delete it for a simple one you can press the f key in order to focus on an object so really simple and if you get lost it really helps when you don't know where a certain object is so just select on a hierarchy press f and there you go it goes straight onto the object and if you want to position your game camera you can use the scene controls in order to position the scene camera exactly where you want it then select the main camera object and press ctrl shift and f and there you go the camera automatically matches what the scene camera is seeing so move the scene camera to exactly where you want press ctrl shift f there you go next up you can enable or disable the select object by going over here and pulling on this toggle okay and also you can use a shortcut alt shift a so there you go it just toggles the visibility of this game object and regarding gizmos which are the various icons and lines that you can see here as you know you can enable or disable them but then you can also click on this area to see some more options and very importantly up here you have button to swap between 2d or 3d gizmos so right now it's 3d so they're almost invisible and if i click yep there you go now they become 2d and now they are visible no matter how much i zoom out or alternatively switch to 3d and massively increase the size alright so that's 10 minutes okay so that was quite a lot of tips and i hope you found some helpful ones that you didn't know about now as i was gathering this list i came up with many more tips so let me know in the comments if you'd like to see a part two alright so thanks for watching and i'll see you next time
