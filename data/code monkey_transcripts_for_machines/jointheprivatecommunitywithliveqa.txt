hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey just a quick video to let you know that I recently reworked the bonuses for patreon and YouTube members there is now a private Community Discord I've also been doing weekly live streams where I answer all your questions live and there's also a monthly Q&A video those are the new bonuses on top of the usual bonuses of the urgently project files for tutorials adding the name to the credits getting the character highlighted on live streams and just a big thank you for me for being a member basically when I published my C course some students wanted a place to talk to other students and just chat or ask questions so for that I open up the private Discord Community server actually used to have a public Discord quite a long time ago but it had so many people and it was really hard to manage basically I'm already super busy trying to keep up and answer all of the YouTube comments answer all the course questions all the emails doing all that that I really just couldn't manage one more thing especially in Discord which is all about real time and by being public it also made it a target for some spammers who would join the server post some horrible images get banned and then do it all over again so by making this one a private Community hopefully it only attracts people who genuinely actually want to learn while also sharing their Journey with others and while also keeping things a bit more manageable for me so I can actually keep up and chat and answer some questions so you can go ahead chat with others you can post about your projects ask any questions or really just hang out then also the weekly live streams so every Saturday I go live and just chat or answer questions so you're welcome to join me and ask me whatever you want feel free to ask about any problem you're having with your current game ask about any something like tips on marketing or if you just want to learn some M or C thing the next live stream is happening tomorrow there's a link in the Discord Channel and if you can't be there live or if you can't join Discord you can still post your questions in the monthly Q&A Members Only video I still try to answer all the questions in all the 800 videos on this channel usually those questions are related to a particular topic or a particular tutorial so this member's Q&A video this one is open up for more general questions on any topic and if you can't or don't want to become a member then that's perfectly fine too I hope you keep enjoying the videos I'm still here trying to answer all the comments on the normal videos as usual stay tuned for my free video on the intermediate section of my C course it's going to come out on the 15th of this month all right so if you're interested go ahead and become member either on patreon or over here on YouTube thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
