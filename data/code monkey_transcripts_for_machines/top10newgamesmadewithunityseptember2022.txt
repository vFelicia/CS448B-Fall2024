hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with the until launch in September 22. the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test this month it was super difficult to cut down the list to just 10 games there's lots of really awesome games with thousands of overwhelmingly positive reviews so as usual that's awesome as a player but also it can be quite tricky as a developer the competition is really tough all of these games are uniquely impressive so no list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month alright so starting outfit number 10 with a game that has been highly anticipated for some years now gone wood this is a old school immersive Sim shooter with some puzzle elements and a hornlike atmosphere it features an intricate handcrafted City with lots of freeform exploration there's plenty of paths you can take and many hidden passages to find there is a prehardcore stealth and sound system so the enlightened world is accurately tracked as every movement that you make the game certainly has a very well atmosphere everything looks is unlike its own dark and gloomy with some very sharp polygons so basically if you enjoy the original Thief games then it sounds like you would also enjoy this one then for something Jolly built with unity and using the most famous IP ever here is Disney dream light Valley usually Games built on nongame IPS didn't have trouble building something good but it seems like this one really bugs that Trend the reviews are all positive so if you're a fan of Disney then you will certainly enjoy this one it's an adventure simulation game you explore this world go out on adventures with some familiar faces the world has fallen into darkness and it's up to you to save it but at the same time no pressure you can also just enjoy living in these worlds go out fishing gather some minerals and just walk around personally I don't really have much of an attachment with Disney like some people I didn't really grow up on it but still I find the idea of exploring all these unique worlds and interact with all these characters that sounds like quite a bit of fun then if you like Rhythm games but you wish they were a bit more hardcore look at metal helsinger they're going to shoot enemies along with a Beat of the Music so it's basically kind of like Doom meets Crypt of the necrodancer the music is all adaptive the better you are at sticking with rhythm the more epic the music becomes features lots of famous voices that you might recognize if you're into metal and also one really interesting thing is how all of the songs are original and on the steam page itself they mentioned that they went through the process of making sure content creators don't get content strikes that is really awesome very important to a game like this that is all about music and I'm guessing it also helps some [ __ ] creators pick up this game because it already has over 3000 very positive reviews next for something that just had its full release out of Early Access here is temtem this one is a pokemonlike so you catch some monsters you train them and you use them in battle the main selling point is how it's massively multiplayer and you can play in either Coop or PVP but it also features a story campaign if that's what you prefer you explore these islands find all the creatures build up your own house and decorate it you can customize your character and get ready for battle so if you've ever wanted to play a massively multiplayer version of Pokemon then this seems like the perfect game for you then for some VR this month actually had one of the biggest releases ever bone lab for me I'm pretty casual when it comes to VR I'm mainly just stick with beatsaver but I've seen a bunch of videos that recently say that this game is about to blow up the VR World the Main selling point is their highly Advanced physics engine this is from the same developer that made boneworks which a lot of people also praise for their physics and this one takes that and pretty much pushes it to the next level so you can interact with all kinds of objects in ways that always make sense and also the main mechanic is how you can swap out your character so you can play as a tiny character to get around some small spaces then you can switch to a giant character which gives you a ton of string to move some huge objects and despite having such different character body shapes the game doesn't seem to have any clipping so whatever you do in real life matches the game regardless of the character size beyond that the game is apparently built with modding in mind so chances are that shortly after release you will already have tons of unique experiences all built by the community if this one becomes something like Gary's Mod then I can definitely see how this has the potential to really make the r blow up and up next here is the the wandering Village this one is a city Builder where you build your City on top of a giant creature which is also moving around however the creature is now really just a set of wheels the creature also has wants and needs so that certainly makes it for a very unique concept that interaction with the creature sounds really interesting you can either live in symbiosis and trust each other or you can basically become a parasite I'm very curious to try this out and see what happens if you take the parasitic route so does the creature somehow fight against you or not that sounds like a really interesting mechanic that you definitely don't see in any other city builders as the creature moves to the world you also enter different biomes you must fight other parasites and survive some poison clouds and of course it features an extensive Factory it also has a really nice style mixing both 3D and 2D so I quite like how it looks and this one is yet another huge hit already has over 1500 very positive reviews then if you're a fan of world war one here is isanzo this is from the same developer that made Verdun and tenenberg I played Verdun quite a bit I even made a video on how it's made remaking some interesting Unique Mechanics this new one is set in detail in front so in terms of visuals everything looks really beautiful the game is about war but it's set in Italy which makes the environment more gorgeous and being about World War One means there's tons of old weapons there's lots of Bolt actions and some hard to use weapons and of course there's tons of mustard gas so if you're into this time period or if you've enjoyed their previous games then check out this one then for game that came out of nowhere and blew up the whole internet trombone champ this one is a rhythm game it's all about trombones I have no idea why the characters are me's but for some reason they match up perfectly the game really has this very soon look the background is also very nonsensical I have no idea why there are horses everywhere this is all very strange and in terms of rhythm game mechanics it also seems pretty unique you have a vertical line and you move up and down and click to play so in terms of Rhythm games very different from things like 10 cents Revolution and those kinds of games the game literally did blow out of nowhere it launched with just about 5000 visually so not too much but now all of a sudden has over a thousand overwhelmingly positive reviews so it has probably already sold over 50 000 copies in just two weeks that is really insane up next here's another huge hit with a gorgeous art style it's Proteus it's an oldschool first person shooter with both single player and multiplayer the main selling point is how it's a retro look but it's made for a modern era and by looking at it I'd say they definitely succeeded the animations and Sprites are all very old school but all of the gorgeous effects particles and lights they all definitely make use of Modern Hardware to make something truly spectacular it's nonstop action with tons of weapons and tons of enemies to defeat there's lots of blood particles so the whole level turns red by the end it even features Community crafting level so if you enjoy the game you have thousands of hours of fun here it just had its full release out of Early Access with over 3000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so if you like this genre definitely give this a look and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is slime Rancher 2. I must say that I still haven't played the original it's been on the top of my YouTube playlist for many years I know that when I do find the time to play it I know I'm going to love it it's going to consume about 50 hours of my life and this sequel seems to build upon the original in every way the whole game is all about collecting various slimes then each slime does different things so some Slimes like a certain food and others need something different and these slimes themselves also interact with one another some slimes reproduce when next to others and some other types really just eat each other so it's a game all about emergent gameplay of the slimes have their rules their wants and needs and all of those systems interact with one another personally I love games like that with tons of Interlocking Systems and some emergent gameplay so that's how I know I'm going to love it when I finally find the time to play it also one of the best GDC tones that I've ever seen were by the developer of this game all about making games that stand out and survive I definitely encourage you to watch the Tonk extremely useful for any indie game developer that wants find success the game has just launched into Early Access and almost immediately he had over 6 000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so everyone is really loving this awesome Indie sequel alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with DNT launch in September 22.
