in this video we're going to cover the simple logic for doubleclicking and use it to trigger a special let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with enough tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing so here is what we want to create I have my player character in here and I can click somewhere in the world in town to move and there you go he's moving there however I am also testing for double clicks in order to do a different special action so when I double click there you go he starts moving and does a nice so a simple mic does one action and a double click does a special different action alright that's a goal let's get to it okay so here's our starring scene we similarly have the players sitting around idle there's no input okay so let's start off by making a simple script so in here a new csharp script this will be our testing code let's create a testing game object and drag the script onto it okay now in here let's make a friend Roy update and let's capture our mouse clicks so we do it if go into the input and get the mouse button down this function returns true on the very first frame that we press on the mouse button so in here will require an index for the mouse button the left mouse button is on index 0 and the right one on index one so in this case and let's s for the left mouse button so we pass in a 0 so the code in here won't be triggered exactly once when I press on the mouse button so let's just do a simple debug log and say click OK let's see ok here we are with the console and when I press the inlet mouse button if there you go there's our click debug dawa ok so that's how we capture a simple mouse click now let's go back into the code and here in order to make this more fun let's make our character move whenever we click so for that let's add a reference for our player script so a serialize field or in private player reference here in the editor you can see the field so we just drag the player onto it ok now when we click we can go into the player and probably move to function which were moving towards a target position so let's call it with the mouth warm position for that we can grab it from a function in the utilities as always you can download utilities for free from unity karmic calm so with this when we press the left mouse button we should be able to tell the player character to move to the mouse warm position let's see so here we are and when I press and let mouse button if there you go he starts moving to that position he gets there and stops okay great so we have a very simple click being captured now that we have that let's think about exactly what a doubleclick entails so in essence a doubleclick is essentially two clicks that are in very quick succession so that means when we click we need to know how long ago the last click what so here in the code let's store the time that will last clicked so up here make a private float for the last click time so this won't store the time when we unless clicked so in order to store that we go in here into our click and we set the last click time to be time time this contains the number of seconds since a start of the game okay so let's S&C exactly what is stored in this variable so for that instead of doing a debug log let's do a CM debug which again part of the code McGee Tony's just to spawn a very nice text popup and in that popup we say the last play time and then we pass in the time ok so let's test and see what the popup says here we are now when I click on the mouse button there Gildan last click was at 2.6 seconds now click again and our test with it 6.3 7.7 and so on so as you can see we are correctly storing the time when the last click happened so since we have the current time whenever we click we can easily calculate the difference between the current time and the previous time so here all we need is to do time duck time in last click time so this is essentially the time in between clicks now obviously we can't delete this before we set the unless click time and let's see the popup okay here we are now let's click and should be the difference between the start of the game testing so we click and there you go six seconds okay now click again now it's only been two seconds since the last click and two seconds and so on okay so now we can use this to check which one is the correct value for testing for double clicks so let's say if I click twice we run quickly and there you go the second one set point one three so double click yeah it's around point one seconds so if we give it a little bit more let's make it point two so if we click within point two seconds we consider that a double click all right let's see so in here we can make a private cons for the double click time which will be point two seconds and then in here it's extremely simple to do our logic all we need is the test if the time since the last click is less than or equal to the double click time then this is a double click and if it's not then we have a normal click okay let's do some pop ups so let's see here we are only to a normal click there it is now we double click and there we go the first one is normal and the second one is double ok so that's pretty much it we have our logic fully working now we already have the player moving to our click position now let's add a special when we have a double click so here in the code when it's a normal click we tell the player to move to that position and when it's a double click the player also has another function for the and we towards the mouse position so we pass in the same mouse world position okay so when we click we move when we double click we and that's pretty much it as you can see the player logic is completely separated from our input code so here we are let's move here okay now go in here and do doubleclick and there you go he starts moving and then does a nice every time I do a double click so I can move the point around and everything works exactly as intended so just like that we can now capture single clicks to make a certain action and then also check for double clicks to make a special action and that's it as always you can download the project files in Tenley's from in Tacoma com
