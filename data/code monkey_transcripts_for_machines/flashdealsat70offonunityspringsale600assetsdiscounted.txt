of the ones that I covered in my asset review series many of those are on sale for example the Asar pathfinding project Pro this one is always excellent I've used it in pretty much every single one of my Steam games it supports pretty much any game World any scenario any level shape and it's all insanely fast for some awesome destruction you have Ray fire this really helps you make some really satisfying destruction the results really speak for themselves you can slice objects make them crumble or just explode them into a ton of pieces the quantum console is another excellent tool that recently lets you add a console to your games so this is really excellent for testing it's why I recommend you use in my multiplayer videos simply because it simplifies that process so much so if you're waiting for this asset to follow my free multiplayer course then now's a chance to get it if you have a 2d game then the allinone Sprite Shader is a musthave it makes it super easy to add tons of effects to your Sprites easily make them glow make them Shake week and made all kinds of properties and really make everything in your game pop another excellent one is feel like name implies this tool helps your game feel awesome it's got tons of Sliders to animate everything and make every action in your game feel excellent then of course Guild an inspector most of you probably already have this one it's a really excellent tool for helping you build tools to make you much more productive so if you're interested in any of those tools you can go watch my asset review videos in there I give an overview of the tool and I also include a quick getting started tutorial so you can easily start using all of these tools to help you make better games faster then for some more awesome assets and tools on sale umotion Pro is an excellent tool for animating directly inside Unity as you might know you cannot edit humanoid animations inside Unity but with this tool you can I've used it quite a bit recently to make some animations that I needed it was super useful to help me make some minor changes to a bunch of animations for my upcoming game dinky Guardians another asset that I'm also using in my upcoming Sim game is quickly this is an excellent anime Shader it has tons of properties that you can play with to get looking exactly as you wanted in my case for my game it was super easy to use this to change the offline color to show the player Which object is selected if you want to take your game's visuals to the next level then check out volumetric lights in case you don't know Lights by themselves will not have any shape they can't slide but they are not visible for that you need a volumetric tool like this one adding volumetric elements to your game really makes it look so much better than the text animator this one always looks awesome if you have any kind of text in your game then I highly recommend you look into this one adding these effects to make your text Pop will do wonders to how good your game feels if you want to make a platformer game then a Hollywood asset is the Corgi engine this is a 2d or two and a half D platformer it's a complete game engine so with just a few clicks you can get a really satisfying platformer up and running if you want to draw on top of your objects and here is paint in 3D this is a great tool to help you add some kind of customization to your games easily let players draw on top of their objects maybe paint their car or paint a spaceship if your game has tons of dialogue and decisions then maybe check out this analog system building one of these kinds of systems is a ton of work so picking up something that has been through a ton of development will really help speed up your workflow this asset is literally 10 years old so you can rest assure that it is fully featured than production ready for making huge open worlds Gaia Pro is an excellent tool I haven't used it myself but I've heard great things about it if you want to build large tools instead of tool like this one is definitely invaluable if you're after the ultimate visuals and big lighting is the way to go and for that check out Bakery this too only is widely used in AAA games to get the absolute best quality of lighting with this it will really make your game look the best it can look for playing around with liquid check out zebra liquids this is a really impressive tool you have tons of control and all of this is running on GPU so it's all extremely performant if you want your characters to react to physics then check out Puppet Master it looks really impressive how the character can combine regular animations with some satisfying breakdowns definitely makes your game feel much more natural also a while ago I worked with the SSR team to make a dedicated page of my most recommended assets so you can watch this video which covers tons more tools and you can see all these assets pretty much everything here is discounted the asset inventory here is really great for managing tons and tons of packages that I'm sure all of you already have for me this really helps in searching for things inside the tons of assets I already own for a nice pixelated effect the pro pixelizer here is also really excellent makes for a really interesting effect and it can even lower or increase the pixelization the all sky here is just a great asset pack in order to make your game feel much better just change the Skybox and everything improves 10 fold and of course there's tons more stuff on sale as you can see 625 things are
