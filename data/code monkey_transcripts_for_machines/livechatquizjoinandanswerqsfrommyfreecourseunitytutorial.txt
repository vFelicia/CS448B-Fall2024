foreign thank you foreign thank you alright hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here all right quite a lot of people already here wow nice thank you all right so hopefully this should be fun okay everything seems to be correct all right okay great all right thank you Daniel for becoming a channel member and thanks again for sharing for a nice cup of coffee that's always useful so thank you so much all right hey everyone okay impressed this kind of inventory you have you mean the characters yeah I've been working on this lately usually I got my characters on on screen but for this one for this stream I'm planning to try out something different so we're going to make a sort of q a sort of a quiz where I can post a question then you can vote in chat and then we can see and learn a bunch of things together that's pretty much the goal with this live stream as usual it's an experiment so hopefully it won't break so hopefully everything here so far is working correctly all right okay great so let's see how this goes all right so just first of all just for testing let me actually make a simple question so just for testing let's go Create a quiz and there you go all right so let me just hide the background where's my background the background okay great all right so there you go a very simple and basic quiz and basically you vote in chat by doing vote and then either A or B that's pretty much the goal and let's see if all of this works correctly so as you vote there you go the little characters they move there it's recently but all right look at that all right that's great so far it seems to be working correctly all right so we got a lot of votes seems to be pretty much 50 50. so that's interesting so I'm going to vote myself a zone so in my case I'm going to go with dogs so I'm going to vote B and there you go all right and look at that cats are winning all right I mean I'm just happy that it's working so yeah so basically yeah instead of just saying A or B say uh uh uh exclamation point vote and then either A or B so basically all the people that are still waiting they are up here and then the character moves into one or the other position once you actually vote and actually mine did not move did I find some bug no there you go there's my character going into the B position all right great look at that it's pretty much 50 30. uh that's funny all right but yeah look at that perfectly 50 50 oh dog's winning okay so the system is indeed working all right and then well the next part is when there's a question when the time is just visual so I can then manually end it and I can either say one question is correct or all of them are correct so in this case um they are correct so let's go ahead end the quiz and there you go they're all correct they're all happy everybody succeed all right great okay so it seems the system is working so far so that's right so there you go can I vote C none of them no really no and right away I noticed there's a bug seeing the aren't supposed to be visible so apparently when I finish they all become green but that's okay all right that works fine all right okay okay so basically I'm going to try to show some questions and you can vote on the answer then I can talk about some learning thing related to the question and in meantime sure you can post questions in in chat and I'll do my best to try to keep this thing managed okay in some kind of YouTube integration yes this is using the uh the Youtube API and if you want to customize your own character just like you can see a bunch of people have custom characters then I see a SpiderMan around here somewhere uh anyway there's my character which has a custom Sprite and there you go look at that there's a nice Raymond so Timberland Jones there you go and ice on anybody else using custom characters nope just one all right so yeah basically you can go into this link and if you want you can draw on top of it and then your character won't have a custom Sprite so it's just a nice fun thing and if you want to know how I made this I actually also covered it down here there's a bunch of links so there's the transparency window which actually isn't being used here this is just a regular window then the characters they are using some mesh based animations and for interacting with the YouTube API that is using an HTTP request from Unity that's pretty much it so oh no something pretty simple but yeah it looks pretty fun look at that ring man that looks pretty cool okay great all right so let me just get ready to start posting the first proper question once again thank you so much for sharing for the cup of coffee thank you so much and thank you Daniel new channel remember so this one oh look at that a new channel member thank you unless thank you that's cool it's awesome when I come back to this overlay and everything suddenly Works magically uh asking what happened to the multiplayer section yep I'm still working on it I'm currently researching what is the best way to convert the game to multiplayer so I'm selling the research phase then I've got to I've got to make a prototype then I have to record on uh write on the lectures then I have to record everything then I have to edit and then publish so hopefully by the end of this month it should have the multiplayer course should be out hopefully by the end of this month hopefully all right okay so let me first post a first post the first question okay this is a bit tricky because I gotta do it manually but sure let me just put it can I put it side by side okay like that's good okay so that's the first option and the second option the third option and hopefully everything won't work correctly there you go create quiz and there you go the brand new question so what is the name of the game relating to the game in the free course so is it kitchen chaos cloner cooked or Chef chaos so go ahead and post your vote in the chat and let's see if all of you know all right and obviously on the side here I've got the page for the websites on we're going to go through a bunch of lectures and answer a bunch of questions do a bunch of things so let's see if one of you know the first basic question I mean the clue is kind of on screen but yeah let's see let's see if all of you know it just expand a little bit all right all right look at that so there's two song Theory people on C and for some reason some people aren't even though there's no d right now some people wouldn't be and most people over here on a there you go look that all those people there's Raymond there oh look there's a Spiderman I know who all right that's nice another Rayman is it supposed to have two Raymonds or is that a bug I don't know okay let me vote myself as well so I'm going to vote a so let's see and all right okay so there's something time left actually played around with the timer I mean hey yep there you are all right for phone to PC that's why there's two Raymonds yeah maybe it's just funny that's great voting you won't crash everything no hopefully not you can try to vote e just won't do anything just won't recognize because at most there's only four options so hopefully the code is correct how do we change our character sprite just follow the guide on the website all right so there you go there's a question and let me go ahead and the quiz and the correct one for this one is obviously a kitchen chaos someone's in the quiz and there you go everybody's really happy nice okay so most people got it right some people see them waiting some people put BNC and so on and over here we've got the leaderboard so let's see by the end how many so pretty much this is the number of correct questions and on the right side is the percentage so right now so far two correct questions 100 so pretty much everybody over here on the on the leaderboards all of them got it right and everything suddenly froze oh God something bad happened actually something bad apparently didn't happen uh uh exactly happened not sure but okay let's keep going and hopefully it won't break completely if there's something strange move position direct was destroyed okay all right anyways hopefully everything is still working correctly all right so that's great so I've validated that my nice little tool that's where someone for the no it's not because someone voted e Apparently one of these characters was destroyed for some reason but then some code is still getting it so right over here can I put it here there you go got a missing reference exception so some object is still finding something so it kind of broke but let's hope it doesn't actually cause a crash anyways if it does I can only just restart it I've got a nice load for the leaderboard so that should be fun and thank you once again and listen there you go and you shall remember another one rookie thank you so much all right that's nice I don't know how many channel members this has so it's a fun feature all right okay so let me just so yes the answer of course was kitchen chaosa was the correct answer so here it is it's a fun name I don't like it I think it was cool all right so let's begin let's see so let's see another easy question just make sure that you all understand how to vote so let's go just basing in all of the options and create the quiz there you go here is the new question so Hong Kong is the free course is it a two hours B five hours or C 10 hours so let's see if all of you know how much is it so let's see all right they're going lots of votes I'm going to vote myself as well which is kind of odd though because if you can see me then technically you know yeah maybe I shouldn't vote otherwise that might be a little bit cheating when it becomes a more complex questions so let's see all right and there you go most people voting on 10 hours let's see if that is indeed correct all right like about font front Sprite for Rayman looks really weird now yeah with all of the other ones facing forward but so I think Rayman looks great I mean when I was coming up with design for these characters for this machine mission system actually it was around the time when Prison Architect came out so that was more the sort of inspiration doing something simple like that rather than Raymond but yep Raymond also works perfectly with this tunnel since there are no arms and so on yeah this matter seeks capital or not nope on the code I made sure to check for that so if you post if you write with or without space it works if you put an uppercase on lowercase it works so hopefully it should work most of the time new sound popup is UI in unity oh yeah yeah this is inside Unity so here is a window I can even drag it and so on so yeah this one is inside Unity it is not a OBS uh element even though those are sometimes fun even vote box looks weird especially since it looks to the side oh right if you purchased right here moving that yeah I guess if he moves down that would be yeah then actually see movie if he moves on I guess that would be a bit tricky I got a meal from him is that so that's great all right so yeah let's end this one and obviously the correct question is indeed C so let's put the answer isn't DT so let's end the quiz and there you go all of them celebrating so yep that is indeed the correct question all right so congrats everyone that's great how did you do that you mean the elements one they are using the uh YouTube API and if you want to know how to make you just pretty much just have to do an HTTP request from inside unity and you can interact with the YouTube API and that's pretty much how it works so you can watch that video and that's pretty much how it goes was there a guy on age hearing maybe he was on the way to see and that is why he stopped in the middle when I stopped so that's probably why all right okay so let's go and yeah let's start with a proper question so let's go create the quiz let me select all of the possible options and this one and this one and let's put it like that and let's see okay so let's create a brand new question okay so here it is so this is on the lecture for the creative project and the question is which anti version did I use in the course so was it the 2021 LTS the 2022 Tech version or was it the 23 Alpha version so go ahead post your votes and this one is with regards to the create project manager so by the way over here on the website here is the course molecule and if you click on one of these it automatically Scrolls down so there you go the question is related to in lecture one for creating the project all right so people voting some people saying LTS some people saying tech let's see which is which all right okay so there you go everybody Boeing all right foreign end the quiz and see which one is the correct question correct answer and there you go you have the correct answer is indeed over here B and it is the tech version so usually Technically when it comes to UNT versions you should probably stick with the NTS version but the only reason why I went with the tech version for this uh course is because I want the course I want the video to stay up to date for as long as possible so technically usually you should use LTS I just went to Tech because Tech is going to translate going to turn into the LTS version in about two weeks two months so yes technically you should always use LTS the only reason why I didn't is to make sure that the video stays up to date for as long as possible but yeah in your own projects definitely stick with LTS which in about two or three months usually around March or April that's when Unity launches their brand new MTS version So at around that time 22 should turn into LTS so at that time you should be able to use that one all right so there you go that's a nice question and everything is a bit a bit like that yeah maybe I'll I'll restart the overall oh no it's good now okay I don't know sometimes becomes a bit strange all right and once again thank you so much for becoming Channel member another one Timbo Jones yeah thank you thank you for becoming a channel member thank you all right okay so that was the first proper question so congratulations and over here on the right side still see a bunch of people with all four correct 100 so that's great let's see let's see how much this one is by the end okay all right so let's go for the next question so let's create a brand new quiz for this lecture go with yes or no and there you go all right so let's see the next question so let's create the quiz and there you go here is the question so this one is with regards to lecture two so that's in layout picture so this one is do you know about the pivot Center and local logo buttons so do you yes no maybe can you repeat the question so let's see who gets this reference and yeah there you go so the questions with regards to the pivot Center and local Global buttons these are extremely important you definitely need to know about them so let's see how many of you know about them so this one is kind of a general knowledge question so let's see but it is something that I cover in the unity layout lecture so let's see out of this question all right so most people are getting TS that's awesome because this is actually two very important buttons that a lot of people don't know about so yeah someone asking how many questions are there in total I'm not sure I mean I think that's going to be limited to the time for the live stream so I'm going to do this for about one hour so let's see how many questions we can get through in that time okay all right so there you go still got a bit more and over here on the side I've got a nice test project so I can use that one to demonstrate whether something is all right so let's see there you go 20 seconds how many of you yes six people no 11 Maybe until you repeat the question all right so let's see do you know about these buttons for some reason the owners constantly doing something that's strange uh all right okay so let's go ahead end the quiz and for this one there's really no wrong answer because it's a general so congratulations to all of you all right so the pivot Center on local button so let me put a nice testing window over here so here is a basic testing project just to test it out and basically the buttons that I'm referring to are the ones up here on the scene view so there's this one on this side which says Center or pivot and there's another one which is global or local and basically these are extremely important so for example if you've got a game object let's make it a cube instead so let's make an empty Cube there you go here is a cube and if inside I put another object so let's say I put another Cube inside this Cube and for this other Cube let's put it somewhere on the sign so now if I select the parent object and if over there it is Select nonpivot look at where the transform handle is it's right there it's exactly on the origin of that object however if up there if now I change to center now instead of being on the pivot now it's over there on the center so if you didn't know about this and for example you tried rotating now if you try rotating you would assume that it would rotate right over there where the handle is but if you move to the side and actually right now yeah right because it's moving on the if you look over there it is now rotating just on the Y but also moving on the X and also moving on the Z so if I move it even further away and now it's like this one there you go with that one set to center now it actually selects the transform handle right on the center and if I rotate it look over there it's not just rotating on the Y if I rotate on the wire it rotates like this but if I rotate on the handle it rotates like that so this is something that is usually very confusing if you don't know what is going on so if you were to rotate here you would be very confused as to why it's not rotating around the tool handle so that is why this is extremely important and pretty much in 99 of cases you want to leave this one on pivot that's that way it makes sense so if you rotate over there it rotates on the pivot exactly as it should so example like this and the next one that one is the local or Global so that is with regards to rotation so for example let's say on the parent I rotate this one let's rotate it point it upwards like this so like this this is set on local mode and look at how the handles are rotated kind of slanted whereas if I put this in global now the handles have the global rotation so regardless of how the object is rotated these are always like this so if I move over here on the red arrow you would assume that it moves just on the I think the red is the Zen or now it's in CX you would think by this you would only move on the X whereas if I put it on local if I put them like this this one is moved based on the rotation that the object is in so if you want to put an object in front of it somewhere like this and you won't just push the object to the side then it's usually better to use it on local whereas if you want to move it relative to the world itself put it on global and move it around so yeah basically these two are some of the things that can really drive you crazy if you don't know about them so in most cases you really want to leave this one on pivot and this one either on local or Global depending on the use case so that's one of those things that a lot of people don't know about and can definitely drive you crazy if you don't know so hopefully now a bunch of you have learned something new so hopefully that's nice all right so that was a question and that one there was no wrong answer so congratulations to all of you all right great why do you name the channel and Code Monkey I always like the the term Code Monkey even though technically it's supposed to be kind of a negative but I always found it was pretty fun so yeah when I actually wanted to name my my game Studio I wanted to name it that but there was already a developer called Code Monkey so I couldn't use it for my game Studio but when it came time to making it for this for this YouTube channel for this one decided hey why don't I go back to that to that idea that I had previously so yeah and yep there's also a song called Code Monkey which is almost so pretty fun all right okay so let's go and thank you so much Timbo Jones thank you all right okay so let's go into the next question so this one is going to be on the lecture on Visual Studio so let's go ahead create the quiz all right so here is the question so in the lecture for visual studio so what Visual Studio extension did I use for the extra colors in the code so was it called Commodore plus is it nothing is it just a visual studio this phone defaults or is it vs4 so go ahead post your votes and let me open up visual studio over here just so we can see in a little bit all right there you go a bunch of votes coming in okay all right my visual studio is opening let me just make sure that I uh I always forget where the extensions the installed ones yep that's what I'm okay great uh now let me go back and see chat because I can't see it right now all right there you go Okay so go ahead if I knew this was coming up on the test I'd have studied more for it yep I mean everything is on the test so yeah go ahead and hopefully this helps you gain some knowledge that's going with this with this nice little live stream so we can all learn together and hopefully it should be fun all right okay so there you go 20 seconds left go ahead and post your vote so it seems a lot of people are confident in seeing is that correct some people are still over here stuck on D I don't know why because there's no d right now but yeah all right so let's see which one is correct make my game using kitchen Carol's assets yep go ahead and use yes in your own projects I hope you like it I skipped this one so I'm doing the majority yeah usually that is probably a a a good approach in this little quiz if you go with the majority I wonder maybe there's a question that the majority won't go wrong I don't know let's see all right so let's go ahead and see which one is the correct answer and the correct answer is C indeed it is the ashfora yep so that it is my character isn't appearing yep there it is right there all right so this is a really nice extension let me just so here is my visual studio and basically on extensions magic extensions and over here if you search for online you'll find vsphora and there you go it adds color to your Visual Studio text editor so this is the one that I use in the course and basically what it does it adds a bunch more colors so look at this over here the default in the case in a nice pink so the switch and nice orange and the types in a different color than the functions in another color then the builtin Unity functions in a different color and so on so basically adds a whole bunch of colors let me see if I've got a more complex project somewhere in here so I've got a big project uh let me find something a bit more complex okay so let's see this on the game Handler setup and there you go so we got a bunch more colors so like this with all these colors you know there you go nice string nice comments so with this I find this is a it's pretty much the only extension that I have outside of defaults and I find that it helps quite a lot having all these colors really makes the code much easier to read much easier to see okay here's the return else if and so on here's the type of function call and so on so yep I would definitely recommend you grab this extension so that is called and yep 61 of you did indeed correctly guess so yep congratulations all right okay so that was the correct answer okay what about resharper that's an addon yeah I've heard great things about resharper but I've never actually used it too much but yeah I do know that it does a lot of things same thing with uh what is it called jetbrains Rider a lot of people also like that idea for me I stick when I stick with the visual studio just because it's what I know but yeah basically nowadays there's pretty much no wrong option anything you choose all the tools nowadays are pretty excellent so yeah sorry I don't know if there's a similar one for for Rider no idea is there an alternative for vs format oh yeah that's right I'm sorry I don't think they're I mean I'm sure there is so if you search for something oh right there is made by the same company that made Richard oh really I didn't know that that's nice uh yeah so for visual studio on Mac you probably need to Google it I'm sure there's there has to be something related to I mean it's just that in color so there has to be but yeah sorry I don't know it's a vs4 is Windows only so yeah don't really know for that one okay all right so that's the question and over here on the right side yep it's only got a bunch of people with a hundred percent I wonder how long is this going to keep up all right so let's see the next question did I close this question I did right yeah now I forget uh yeah okay so let's see the next question so this one is from lecture four so over here let me just scroll down to lecture 4 which is one of the most important lectures it's a lecture on code style and naming rules so let's see what is the question and there you go okay so here's the question which is which one of these is correct so Pascal case camel case and snake case all right so go ahead and make your votes and which one of these is correct these are the names for the capitalization of the letters the words and so on so these are the three main types that most people use so Pascal case is it capitalized in front and middle or is it uh lowercase over there uppercase in there is camel case and lowercase and then uppercase or upper and upper is it lower and then phone case is snake case with an underscore with Dash with DOT let's see which one is it okay all right so go ahead make your votes and let us see all right so a lot of people are really confident in a so is that the one that is correct all right I just decided on Unity versus other platforms when I started which was back in 2012 that was when I started researching uh game engines because I wanted to move on from Flash and make something that I could play on my on my PC and yeah back then Unity was the only option so it kind of went by default but yeah since then uh it works for building any kind of game that I can think of so yeah that is why so I started because it was the only option and I kept with it because it's a great tool works great so that's pretty much the answer all right so which one is correct and everybody is really confident on a there's a bunch of people lost here on D A bunch of people on c and a bunch of people on B love you hey and love you too thanks for being here all right so let us see let's end the quiz and let's see which one is indeed correct and if there you go it is indeed option A so congratulations to all of you all right that's awesome it's awesome that so many people didn't know this one all right that was great yeah that is great so yeah if you if you haven't seen the course yet definitely go ahead watch a YouTube video it's linked in the description and definitely make sure to pay attention to this lecture specifically just learning this is one of the things that will massively grow your skills as a programmer so definitely make sure you always use the correct naming rules I mean correct is a bit of a wrong word the important thing is that you are consistent so whatever naming rules you follow doesn't matter you can follow Pascal case for functions or maybe use pastel case for for class names or maybe use it for fields or maybe properties whatever you want so you can use whatever naming rules on whatever thing you want the most important thing when it comes to code style naming rules just being consistent so whatever you do whatever you choose come up with a sound that makes sense to you and then stick with it that's pretty much it alright so congratulations to all of you where's my character there you go somewhere in here what should I do when I finish your course well you can go and try building an original game if you want go ahead take the knowledge that you gained from the course and try building something nice and original and hopefully you will have gained quite a nice amount of knowledge that won't enable you to build pretty much any game you can okay so yeah congratulations once again and over here almost there got a bunch of people not on 100 which is great because it means that hopefully you'll learn something new so definitely don't feel bad if you get one of these questions wrong the home point is to learn so yeah if you get it wrong you can learn something then that is awesome you learned it all right great okay Turtle it's been two years since I started my Kim Dev journey and even the most helpful person hey Aaron Collins VR hey that's awesome hey I'm glad I'm glad to hear that I'm always very happy to hear that people have enjoyed tutorials that they have helped you in any way so yeah that is awesome best of luck in all of your Game Dev Journeys and all of your individual ones hopefully the videos help you so we can all just make games and have fun together so hopefully all right some kept the boxes in there yeah they're like oh hey CPU hey thanks for being here yeah there you go got a bunch more custom characters yeah keeping the boxes in there the Box are meant for guiding you don't necessarily but yeah it's kind of funny head right and there you go it is the head pointing right all right okay so let's go on to the next question yeah I think I'm going a bit slow because it's already been 40 minutes okay so let's go let's I keep forgetting that if I end the the question or not I think I did yeah okay so the next one is on postprocessing and once again we are going to have another interesting four options so let's go let's create the quiz all right so there's a question this one is with regards to the postprocessing lecture there you go someone answered already okay so with regards to post processing should you add postprocessing as soon as possible so yes no maybe can you repeat the question so let's see which is which all right go ahead and start voting and let's see what do all of you vote for this one let's see it's gonna be fun all right okay all right there you go so on this one got a nice mix yes no all right let us see what do all of you so this one is really hard so the electron post processing which actually yeah actually got the the thing over here so let's see the postprocessing lecture and if I go put it on plane yeah that's kind of the issue with having an 11 hour is that I can't really click in there to see it I gotta go to the sign there you go adding some nice visual assets then adding a volume component and starting to add a bunch there you go look at that a lot of Bloom way too much Bloom got a nice little checklist to make sure that everything loads and playing around with empty analyzing and so on there you go I'll just trying to make the visuals actually look pretty good all right so there you go 10 more seconds let's see so it seems the majority thinks that it's no so is that the correct answer I don't know let's see all right there you go two seconds one second and let's end the quiz and which one is the correct answer and the answer is all of them are correct basically when it comes to postprocessing usually you probably shouldn't do it like literally at the first thing so you should probably focus on the actual mechanics and the actual things so personally for me post processing is something that I'll leave later on in the process when I actually want to show the game to someone so when I want to when I want to promote it and so on however one thing that a lot of people have mentioned which I do think that it makes a lot of sense which is post processing can also help you with regards to motivation so if you're the kind of person who has trouble with motivation motivating yourself with actually continuing to work on the game if that's the the kind of mindset that you have then postprocessing can actually help because by post processing originally making sure that your Visions look quite a bit better so if you focus on that in the very beginning that can actually help you stick with the project for the long run which in turn obviously helps you actually finish that project so for me personally the answer is no I don't really do it as soon as possible I take it for quite a bit later on in the depth process so I focus on the actual mechanics first but I can definitely see how for some people who have issues with motivation or that sort of thing then making the game actually look good I think it was actually Mark Brown when he was working on his prototype that he said that working on the visuals for quite a bit actually helped them stay motivated because the game actually looked good instead of just being a bunch of Cubes so basically the answer for this post processing as soon as possible that depends on you for me personally I'll leave it a bit later on but for a lot of people but for some other people maybe working on it in the beginning in order to make something look good that might help so yeah pretty much no wrong answer there so congratulations to all of them and Super Chat thank you create my first game just because of your awesome lessons it's announcing for wishlist Ah that's awesome so what is the name you have to say the name whenever you talk about your game so yeah that's awesome I hope it does well yeah and I hope it's also quite a bit uh further away in terms of the actual launch so I hope you left some time for Gathering wishlists so I think I think uh YouTube probably doesn't allow links but if you post the game name hopefully it's your job oh and by the way uh the game kitchen chaos is also available for free on Steam so if you want to play the final game if you want to have some fun go ahead and if you want go ahead and write a review so there are 10 reviews so now it shows up with the score so let's do it yeah all right it's okay so yeah so that was fun so all right so I hope that was a nice teachable moment about postprocessing yes or no all right okay so let's go on to the next one all right name is yeah there's a Super Chat cute hey name is paratives won't be out in three months or something to implement multiplayer wow okay multiplayer that's a bit of a a tricky one I'm curious so where's the search bar why is steam so so tiny uh para types oh God Is It Horror yeah horror is not my thing sorry so yeah I will not be playing this but yeah I mean uh looking at the trailer it doesn't look good I mean horror that's one of the main things where you definitely need to make it look the part and it certainly doesn't work the part so congratulations okay so all of you if you want to support this developer go ahead and add to your wish list heading multiplayer yeah or in multiplayer that's a interesting one what was that one that was a mega hit there was a mega hit multiplayer game recently I don't remember the name but yeah it can definitely do well but yeah horror is not my thing so either way I definitely wish you the best of luck in your multiplayer Journey all right okay ah so let's see multiplayer is a tricky one free course on multiplayer yeah hopefully in a little bit I mean technically you can definitely uh use what you learn from making uh the kitchen chaos game you can definitely what I'm going to cover in the multiplayer course you could definitely use it to convert that and learn about how to make a horror game that would definitely work so yeah that's a great news once you learn how a tune Works applying it to a multitude of different game genres that always works all right okay so let's move on to the next lecture so this one like your next question so this one is going to be on the character controller all right so let's see for this one how many people get this question right only let's create the quiz and there you go okay so question this one is on lecture seven so that's an electron on the character controller should you make all of your variables public so a no yes or yes because I want to torture my programmer teammates so let's see how many of you get this one I would hope that it's most of you because this is something that I repeat over and over again so I hope that if your wreck and Learning Channel that hopefully this one is pretty much automatic so let's hope so let's see and there you go lots of people and yep someone over there stuck in the yep there you go yeah I'm not supposed to be staying there yeah probably not all right so let's see how many of you all right so this one is on the lecture on the character controller which is pretty much the first really median lecture on the course before this it's all setting up importing the assets and so on so this is the one that really gets hits the ground running on making some nice some nice codes and by the way if you're following the course definitely make sure to check this website because I've had the frequently asked questions to a bunch of these lectures so if you want to know some things chances are you can go up here and there's possibly a question that you have it's already been answered over here so for example if the code isn't running if you don't see the logs so possibly you didn't name the player exactly you didn't attach the object maybe update is not written exactly and so on if you only see a single message that probably is on the collapse button and so on so yeah lots of interesting questions here that a bunch of people have asked and yeah so I'm constantly updating this so if you're following the course definitely make sure you check out this nice companion page okay so that's it so let's go ahead and the quiz and see which one is the answer for this one and yep of course the answer is indeed a so no you should not make all of your variables bubbling so hopefully for all of you so there's a bunch of you said yes and yes because you want to torture a bunch of people so maybe but yeah the answer is indeed no they should not automatically be public in fact they should never be public so pretty much I don't think I generally don't think I've ever seen a use case for public well the exception would be on scriptable objects so for those I usually do make them public because on a scriptable object which I always deal as a readonly data container but yeah for regular variables yeah they should never be public there's no reason to be public why never is because I actually cover that in detail so if it's probably best to watch a dedicated video instead of me repeating the same thing over again but pretty much when you make it public you are enabling both read and write access from anywhere so if I can actually go here can I create something uh there you go I think I can all right so let's see if I can if I can do something like this okay so basically you shouldn't do it because you are enabling read and write access from anything so for example over here I got a public a float for the move speed and let's say this is the character script and then I've got another one so public class for the enemy so the enemy is doing something and over here the enemy has a reference to the character so the character so this is the player character and then on Fred void update for some reason the enemy decides that it wants to mess up the character so it can go into the character set the move speed equals zero and there you go this one is perfectly valid code so the enemy can suddenly modify the move speed on the character and everything breaks and your player can no longer move because you accidentally modified something when it should never be modified so basically by making it public you are enabling both read and write axes from any other class so if you have a thousand classes in your code base then that's a thousand points where you might be modifying this which might cause all kinds of breakage things in your game so you don't want that whereas if you make this private then you know for certain only the code inside this last can actually modify this field this one cannot access it because that one is private so this one no longer can cause that bug and suddenly break everything because the player has no movement so that's the super quick explanation of it but definitely go ahead and watch the dedicated video if you just follow this one room then that's one of the simplest things you can do that will massively increase the quality of a code so definitely make sure you do it okay all right talking about an absolute is quite wrong well I would love for someone to tell me generally I would agree there's uh most things in Game Dev they aren't really absolute so there are best practices and so on however when it comes to public variables I generally do not see there is a single possible positive use case there really isn't you are enabling both read and write access from anything it just really makes everything much worse it just it just makes the code much harder to read much harder to understand so yeah when it comes to public variables I have never seen a positive use case so yeah for this one I would definitely use the absolutes definitely never ever use it that's pretty much it all right not get bruise on your hand by constantly forcing the water bottle to close I mean this one is pretty soft so yeah or I guess maybe my head is a bit too hard that's maybe it yeah but is there a video on lecture it covers this integrated chat voting scene I did make some cover some there's some tutorial links down here at the bottom of this page but basically uh it's just really working with the YouTube API so the YouTube API has a way to get the live chat comments so that's what it does I'm doing an HTTP request from inside Unity so there's a dedicated tutorial here so I do that in order to ask YouTube to get me the in live chat comments then I use that to spawn some characters and show some nice chat bubbles so that's pretty much it pretty soon hey thanks for being here on live that's nice yeah these live streams are are a bit random So yeah thank you all for for being here all right okay so let's go on to the next question so this one's gonna be on lecture eight so let's create the quiz and let's see this question a b and c now that I'm noticing yeah I think all the questions only have ABC I don't think I include any anyways okay all right so let's get once again thanks for the Super Chat and there's a cute Super Chat all right hey clippy that's nice I miss clippy it was fun thanks for being awesome hey thanks for being here uh that's nice all right so for the next question so let's create the next question okay so this one is going to be on lecture eight so that is the lecture on the character Visual and rotation so in this lecture what is the difference between lerp and slurp so his difference that slurp sounds bad which I guess maybe a little bit uh is it that LARP works with vectors and smaller ports and directions or layer ports with directions and similar ports with vectors by saying all this is a bit tricky all right so go ahead and vote and let's see oh boy there's seems to be a lot of mixed feelings about this one okay so let's see how many of you get this right this is one of those things that is actually super useful and it's also something that I have a dedicated video on well sort of dedicated it's actually a short video because it's something super simple but yeah if you want to learn about lerp or slurp which both work pretty much the same way definitely go ahead and watch this video so let's see how many of you get this right okay so it seems the nice majority is going with b and a bunch of people think that slurp sounds bad which I don't think I can disagree with okay and let's see so vectors or directions so which one works with which so let us see all right our vectors directions that depends on each person I guess for directions what I mean is kind of like a vector always with a magnitude of one whereas with Vector I mean a vector that can have any magnitude so maybe it's a tiny Vector maybe it's super long whereas the direction that one always has the same thing and just rotates points at different positions so that's kind of what I mean but yeah technically not possibly not the correct technical term but yeah I'm not a mathematician so yeah I don't know turn on for slurp well I covered LARP over here and slurp works pretty much exactly the same way except for one tiny difference which is this difference so is it vectors or is directions all right so let's go ahead and end the quiz and see which one is it and just make sure that I don't make the mistake myself alright so let's end the quiz and there you go yep the answer is over here indeed being solar works with vectors whereas slurp works with directions now the important thing with this one is for example if you make a interpolation between a vector pointing right and then a vector pointing left if you do that and you use slurp then basically it's going to rotate because it's going to work with directions whereas if you use it with alert then basically this Vector is going to shrink and then pretty much do a 180 and stick around there so that might sound a bit confusing so maybe this but yeah pretty much on if I can I make some quick testing code so if I write this testing just you show you in action let me just quickly make this so testing like void update Motel transform dot forward okay so let's do over here so with a nice testing script so basically transform that forward let's do a a math F dot slurp slurp what's up nothing at that I want the vector three which by the way there's Alert in both meth F and that and let's go into new Vector three four let's go on left so minus one zero zero and then find that Delta time okay transform Dot forward equals this okay so let's do a basic lerp and let's see what this does and over here let me just create an object put the testing and just let me okay actually I probably should have prepared these testing scenes beforehand but uh ah crap it already has okay yeah I'm trying to figure this out trying to make this trying to show the the thing in action uh right yeah I definitely should okay all right so let's see okay yeah pretty much so let me just rotate this okay something like this so let's see the okay so here is the demo that I'm showing so basically what matters over there the blue arrow So currently this one is using slurp so let's see what this one does so if I hit on play look at that blue arrow and let's see what it does and there you go it rotates around like that so look what it does next one like this I'm not sure if it's going to but let's see now let's swap it out for a lerp and let's see with LARP what this one does and if I go ahead and I hit on plane foreign okay oh is it not moving yeah I should probably add a log so we can see transform dot forward oh right because yeah so actually with this uh yeah with this demo actually work isn't going to work because transformer.4 is always going to be in normalized value so so that's funny so for the thing that I wanted to test doesn't actually work so let's do a vector 3 for the test vector and over here on what's instead use the test vector and print it out okay so I can't really see it visually because yeah you can upload before us back yeah exactly I forgot about that because it normalizes automatically So based on like this we should be able to see so there you go so this is the alert which that one should probably start off on you one zero zero okay so let's see what this does using lerp slurp always looks better than my experience yeah pretty much if you're handling rotations then lyric won't probably always look better so slurp sorry okay so this one is using lerp and basically the starting Vector is one zero so a vector point to right and look how this the vector basically becomes shorter and shorter until it gets into zero and then flips around to the other end and then becomes so basically we can shorter and then goes out whereas if you use slurp this one actually use directions instead of using a vector so if we go into this one let's see instead of becoming shortened let's see what it actually does so let's look at the vectors and there you go so it starts off in one and instead of becoming shortened this one actually rotates so this one goes down on the set so it goes down like this and rotates around instead of becoming shorter and pointing the other way so basically that's pretty much the difference so alert works with vectors so it works with multiple magnitudes whereas slower ports with Direction so if you're handling rotations you should probably stick with using slurp since that one is going to rotate around even when you do 180 degrees whereas with more the character would suddenly flip around so that's pretty much the answer okay so that was a bit a bit tricky trying to do a demo live but hopefully for those of you who didn't know about the differences between slurp and lerp hopefully that was educational and thanks again clipping thank you all right okay so let's go on to the next question so where is it let's go into this one so let's create the quiz and with this one and this one and this one okay all right so let's create a brand new question okay so this one is on lecture nine so this is the lecture on animations so if an animation has a property in yellow saying missing what exactly is the problem so is the problem that there is no child object with that exact name is it that the animation file is corrupted or was the animation not added to the animator State machine so now let me as you try to answer them let me quickly try to showcase the problem in action and I've got a visitor right now okay so let me just IDK that I alright so this is what I'm what I'm talking about there that one is in yellow so what does that mean go ahead and post your questions so there you go what does that one in yellow mean putting D for doggo yeah it's almost it's almost dinner time so that's why he's starting to get stressed all right what's his her name his and it's Tico and sister Tekken she's over there sleeping so yeah she usually stays sleeping and he's the one that that comes out all right okay so let's see which one is which multiplier Coast do you know if it's going to be Photon engine nope it's going to be using netcode for game objects so that's unity's uh the builtin official multiplayer solution so that's pretty much my digging from Japan all right okay all right okay so let's see and see which one is the answer so the answer as to why that one is in yellow saying missing so let's end the quiz and see which one is the correct answer and drum roll and there you go the answer is indeed over here a so the answer is there's no child object with that exact name should I have the same name in fact yes correct yes uh yeah basically when this happens is because there's no sound of this object named exactly head this is one of the annoying things about animations is that it's actually based on strings so it's all based on names so most of you probably already know that I hate strings for identifying things and basically the reason why this one is saying missing is because I went ahead and I modified this one so I renamed this one to head 2 so now if I play the animation that one isn't actually going to play the animation because it doesn't have any object named exactly head so the solution to this is either go up here and you can click you can click once you select and then wait a bit and then click again and you can rename the object so if I go over here and I rename this property to head 2 to match the one over there there you go now it's no longer in yellow so now it does fine now if I move there you go it does oh boy this is really it's really why is this so yeah I don't know it's very strange uh yeah so like this there you go the head is indeed moving up whereas if I put it back into that one where it says missing now I move around now the head does not move so this is always based on strings it's always based on the exact names that is one annoying thing so if you ever have this problem you just have to make sure to rename so that it matches exactly as the child was named when the animation was recorded So if you do that then you have the animation plays correctly all right okay so that was a fun one so most of you apparently already knew that so yeah it's not completely free yep it is netcode itself is free then you've got the very easy GS tools those are paid for but yep netcode itself is indeed free their idea work being stolen copied I would say if you're talking about game ideas everybody has a million game idea so definitely definitely do not definitely don't worry about that about people stealing your game ideas everybody has ideas ideas are diamond doesn't what really matters is execution so definitely don't worry definitely share your ideas with people talk about it and so on if you put head under body yeah exactly uh oh boy I'm moving the wrong window uh where's my other one if we have way too many windows open so it's quite tricky yeah if over here this one is a prefab but if I try moving can I try moving inside a preface yeah it breaks the whole thing can I duplicate this one and go into where's my prefab unpack completely yeah and now if I go in here and let's rename this one or let's remaining this one so put it on head if now I put the head inside the body and there you go now that one's also missing because yep like CPU mentioned it has to be the correct pass so this one is missing this one actually has the correct name but there's no direct child of this object named head that one is a child of the other one so if I were to make this one a channel that one there you go that does fix all right okay so that was a fun question all right now let's see what else okay so it was the electron animation so that's actually pretty fun I actually made the animations on this game myself so I'm correct I'm talking about the the kitchen counts so they're pretty pretty happy with how those came out these are simple animations but they worked pretty well all right so let's see another question this one is a quick and simple one so let's put it let's put it just 30 seconds because it's the super simple one so let's go on to the next question can I move my character by chat no it goes automatically it goes randomly and then as you vote it goes there specs of the equipment you choose let me just post the quiz uh specs well my GPU is like a 30 90 I think my monitors are like 10 years old my keyboard actually just bought it recently because my other one actually died so yeah my CPU I have no idea I built it like two years ago so my specs aren't anything I mean I guess my GPU is the only thing uh 3090 is definitely overkill for a lot of people but since I have to do a lot of video rendering for me it's really helpful to be able to render a video and not have to wait hours on end I mean even with that rendering the the course which is a 10 hour video rendering that one took quite a long time took like three hours which is actually pretty fast uh three hours to render a 10 hour video but then uploading that's the main thing that took quite a long time all right specs do you think a person needs to be able to start making game the answer is anything literally whatever you have right now as long as it's a computer because ENT doesn't run on mobile as long as it's a computer then yep all right so yeah this was a a simple question can you use an orthograph camera in a 3D game and the answer is yep you can so let me end the quiz and the answer is a yep you can use an orthographic camera even in a 3D game so there you go congrats to all of you tunic using orthography camera yeah probably it's a definitely a gorgeous game technique that was that was awesome I think for the course yeah that's great if you're gonna run the potato you're going yeah minimap tutorial yep that one also use a yeah but basically if some of you don't know what exactly is an orthographic camera so here is my demo scene so this one is for the main menu for kitchen chaos and if I select the camera where's my camera there you go my main camera and over here it set as perspective so this is like a it's what you usually think about when you think of a 3D camera but you can put it as orthographic and basically orthographic means that it doesn't I don't know the technical concern doesn't go out to the sides so pretty much any object in any position doesn't get distorted it always gets it always looks exactly the same so over here the characters they all look perfectly the same even though they are at different distances whereas with a prospective camera this one up front is much bigger and the ones on front are more squished I don't know the technical terms that's pretty much it but yeah so yeah even with 3D meshes you can still use a orthograph camera or even with two uh 2D Sprites which by the way over the characters over here these are all actual flat these Sprites so I can actually show the the if I can show here is the scene view that is running the game right now and if I go over there there you go look at that all of the characters they are all flat Sprites look at that they're on flat pointing straight at the camera so yeah this is a 3D scene so the characters are moving on the zaxis and yep there you go they are flat characters with a perspective camera which I can zoom in and zoom out and for the zoom in method this one is modifying the field of view so like this lower field of view and back out and a wider field of view so you can see a bit of uh on the corners there becomes a bit more like that right so that was another fun one so we put just this one on the side like that so there you go you can definitely use orthographic cameras in 3D games that does work and can definitely be good all right can you add subtitles yeah sorry but getting subtitles for multiple languages for the 10 hour course that would be quite tricky to do so yeah ideally I'd love to but yeah that would be quite tricky I mean even adding just in Portuguese the amount of work that it would take to translate in 11 hours that would be quite tricky so yeah how you learned unity and programming well back when I started learning back in 2012 YouTube tutorials weren't really a thing so I learned by trial and error just try to build something then it doesn't work it breaks so then go on Google and find some mysterious forums talking about things so that's pretty much it so back in my day I learned pretty much based on trial and error trying to do something doesn't work finding an error I mean the good news that Unity uses csharp and csharp is widely used so even back then so I couldn't find Unity specific things but I could definitely find C sharp related things so yeah that's pretty much how I learned so nowadays all of you are very lucky that you have lots of tutorials to teach you guided step by step yeah basically the videos that I make nowadays are the videos that I wish I had when I got certain which was yeah 10 years ago yeah over 10 years ago because I started using Unity it was in December of 2012. so we are now in 23 so yep it's been over 10 years since I've been using Unity so yeah definitely quite a lot all right why didn't you use an async method to load the scene just because the scene is is super quick so in order to unload the loading scene the loading scene is super small so yeah I'm loading that one without async doesn't really matter so yeah if you want to do something more complex then yeah definitely use the async method but for simple use cases the regular nonasync method that works great only multiplayer course be phone server authoritative and nope I mean the goal of this game it's really a a casual Coop game so for that one I'm probably going to keep things simple and just stick with using uh client authoritative because there's no it's a coop game so there's pretty much no issue with cheating but yeah that is one topic that I very much would like to cover in a feature dedicated tutorial all right okay so that's fun so let's go on to the next lecture uh all right so let's go with this one so let's Create a quiz and this one is a big one so let's see well let's see if this one actually fits the UI I hope so otherwise it's going to be tricky so let's go create the quiz for the next question so there you go this one is on lecture 12. so there is one over here on collision detection so the question is what is the difference between overlap box and boxcast so is it a overnight box sets if there's a collision on the target area and boxcasts if there's a collision anywhere between two points or is it being overlapbox the CD boxcast is reading or is it seeing over on that box is better suited for characters and boxcast for objects so go ahead and post your votes in chat alright so let's see so this one is a slightly tricky one I've seen a bunch of comments I've been answering comments for the course and yeah a bunch of people do have a question similar to this so let's see and let me prepare a simple testing scene where's my oh it's over here on this side okay all right so let me just okay all right so go ahead and vote I'm just preparing a simple testing scene okay all right so on Chats on vote and look at that seems people are convinced that it's a so is that correct and some people think that overlap box is 2D boxcast is 3D okay so let's see so this is the on the Collision detection and once again the FAQ actually the FAQ is kind of answering the question here so I guess that's a good thing about the FAQ but yeah kind of screws up the the quiz here but anyways go ahead and vote the whole point is knowledge it's not really it's not really about and look at that still tons of people getting 100 so getting all the questions right so on that's awesome congrats all right so let's go ahead and end this question and let's see which one is the answer and indeed the correct answer if there you go the correct answer is indeed a which is overlap box this if there's a collision just on the target area whereas the box has tests if there's a collision anywhere between the two points so yep that is the difference between those two so let me pick up a simple testing scene so here I've got a testing scene so let's say this is a wall and this one actually has a leather and let's say you've got a character over here and the character wants to move to this position so if you do if the character is here and you do an overlap box over here on this position then two on returned phones because it won't find any colliders because there are no colliders directly on this position whereas if you use a boxcast basically what the boxes does is it moves a virtual box or a virtual shape depends if it's a box has sphere cast and so on if it's a box gas then basically the physics system will move a virtual box in the virtual physics space and it will move from A to B and in that movement it won't find anything that collides within between the points A and B so in this case if you do an overlap box it won't just as this position and return false but if you were to do a box cast it would start from here and move a virtual box onto this direction and it would find this wall in the middle so that would really turn true because it would indeed find something so that is the difference between those two if you had a big distance and you want to make sure like for example for a a bullet if you want to fire a bullet you don't want to just test on point a and point B you want to test if there's a Wong or a character or anything in between point a and point B because the bullet is probably going to move a ton of distance between one frame and the other one so for a bullet you really want to do a cast instead of just an overlap because you want to test if there's anything in between the two points so that is the difference between those two and definitely knowing those differences are very important and once again it's over here on the FAQ on the website so if you're following the course definitely make sure you check the website page okay right recommend paying your model or musician or attempt to find somebody for free I mean I guess depends on what is your goal if you're trying to make games commercially then yeah you should definitely pay for for the essence but if you're doing it just for fun just as a hobby then yeah definitely find someone who also wants to we also want to try out their improving their modeling skills and build the game together with no goal of profit so pretty much depends on your goals both can definitely work my custom character yep let me just check this out so let me refresh the page which actually takes a little bit but okay so let's see I can't speak of any English very because I'm from Egypt but I can understand some words alright that's awesome I mean we always uh it's always a learning process for me I learned English by watching Cartoon Network as a kid that's pretty much how I learned so yeah so yeah if you're here if you can understand a few things and yep over time you will definitely learn more and more so yeah just keep exposing yourself to English things yeah you will eventually learn that's how I learned so yeah uh okay so I'm just checking the the validation thing trying to see yeah I really need to update this code because it's quite a bit slow uh I'm just looking at things uh so far okay there's a bunch of okay so let me validate these new characters okay so I'm validating a bunch of them by the way there are some that uh some people have included custom characters but they did not link their YouTube account so some of these won't show up but the others should let me just update the character customization so that should be updating now I hope there you go there's a nice new custom character so there you go if you just joined recently so you can draw on your own character make your own character and let me just where's my chat what's my chat there you go like that you can follow the tutorial in order to customize it and so on there you go another nice custom character Never Their CPU with a nice character anyone else there's me with a nice character and there you go Timbo Jones with nice Rayman and anyone else there was a SpiderMan a while ago no I guess no more all right okay okay how'd you manage to pay the bills while making games you mentioned never worth nine to five well I mean first of all it helps that I live in Portugal where there's a relative low cost of living so when I started I could make a living on something like six or seven hundred bucks so by the time that I was also well the more important thing is I was living with my parents until I made enough money with my games to move out so that's the first thing so I was making games for there you go SpiderMan's back uh yeah so I was making uh flash games for about five years and I was still living with my parents because that couldn't pay enough but yeah by the end I was already making about five or six hundred bucks a month and then I went on to see him and that started actually making some decent money so yeah pretty much the answer is low cost of living plus living with parents plus having a nice ramp up of experience so for about five years that I was making games I wasn't really making enough so that's pretty much it Super Chat thank you do you have any predictions on when multiplayer won't come out I I'm hoping by the end of this month but honestly I don't know I mean I I've done a bunch of research I've done a little bit of the Prototype but yeah they're still still a lot of work to do I still got to research a lot more I still gotta finish the Prototype then I got it right on the lectures and I gotta record them then I gotta edit them and then finally publish them so I'm hoping I can do all of that within this month so maybe on the last week of this month or maybe the first or second week of March so I don't know but yeah hopefully hopefully it won't be too long hopefully all right great and there we go uh all right okay so let's go on to the next question so where was I okay so let's go with this one so this is a fun one uh yeah it's almost dinner time so I'm going to have to close in a little bit okay bye okay so let's just go into the next one all right so there you go brand new question so this one is on lecture 15. so let's see lecture 15 that is the one on the selected count original any Singleton okay so what is the cause of the flickering bug and let me actually show that book that I mean uh oh boy I need that uh is it two objects don't worry about the time I'm going to yeah because I actually need to uh let me just make a quick a quick testing scene yeah because I probably should have prepared the testing scenes beforehand uh just need to pick up something okay oh okay uh trying to oh boy it didn't yeah I didn't plan this this demo ahead of time so me like this like this just select a different material anything duh boy oh actually oh because I remember that I saw this a little bit uh yeah sorry for the a bit of chaos right now I'm yeah because I did now I can't find it uh where's my where's my I'm trying to find something and I can't find it there you go that's the one there you go okay so that's the that's the bug that I want to show Okay so let's go in here so there you go look at this look at this flick ring so this is what I mean so what is the cause of this flickering bug where the texture is smiggling back and forth so is it that two objects are on the mathematically exact position is the GPU broken or is it a physics solution so there you go this is debug so if all of you if some of you didn't know what I mean by that go ahead and vote and let me look at chat yeah this one is a bit tricky and oh boy there's even a fully ring over here yeah someone over there does have the the right answer there you go oh boy let me end this because this flickering is driving me crazy and yep the answer is indeed a it is two objects are on the mathematically exact position or like these people mention more the more technical term is Z fighting so it's more in the Z buffer so basically since this quad is literally on position where's the position there you go it's literally on zero just like the floor object these two are on the exact same thing so this is a very nasty visual issue so if you have this one solution is super simple literally just put this a tiny bit off there you go just like this just by moving it by 0.01 and now no longer got the problem so Yep this is called Z fighting because both are on the exact same depth so that is what makes it quite annoying so if you have that now you know just make sure that one of the objects is not on the exact perfect position and everything will be nice and fixed all right okay so that was a bit a bit tricky to set up the demo I guess next time I gotta prepare demos ahead of time okay do you have a Discord Channel I don't but uh CPU over here has a nice Discord channel so if you want to it's called United programming so just found it find it in Discord so if you want Discord go ahead on there basically I tried having a Discord and didn't work because I'm already insanely busy trying to answer all the comments course questions emails all those things it is always super difficult to keep up so I really couldn't keep up with one more thing especially since Discord is real time so that is why I couldn't do it alright so thank you so much for the Super Chat and got another one did not get the YouTube notification arrive late oh well this one's going to be saved and this one is hopefully a bit educational so hopefully for people who are catching this after a while so hopefully that's nice yeah stream announcements post on Discord hope you have a great time thank you uh there is an email on the website so if you log in if you go into your user page you can sign up to be notified and yeah it won't send that okay all right so let me do a bunch more questions because it's already 6 30 so I gotta stop in a little bit okay so let's see this one this one is a a fun one so let me copy the options that one and that one and down all right so there you go another question this one is related to lecture 18 so that is an electron player pickup and csharp interface so the question how many interfaces and base classes can a class implement or extend so is it a multiple interfaces but only one base less or is it being a multiple base less but only one interface or is it c as many as you want so if you got basses and interfaces how many can you implement slash extend so what team and thank you so much talks for the Super Chat thank you another one cute oh boy there's even more cue thank you so much sorry if I I miss them yeah I'm trying to keep up with everything uh subhari yeah that's a nice name thank you for everything you do for asking you hey thank you for the Super Chat and thanks for being here yeah I mean these live streams really it's a twoway thing so it only works if I'm here and if all of you are here watching so thank you all so much for being here on this random is it using I don't even know what day it is it is using right yeah I think so uh yeah so so thank you all for being here when I make every correct answer it's not exactly I think I did try to yeah I tried to change it a little bit so yeah uh your program C sharp for living that to think about it for a second yeah I mean that that is a perfectly natural thing even for me I've been making games programming and using entity for so long and if there's still many things that I have to use my brain think for a little bit so yeah so much for the videos you make that's awesome all right so yeah it seems there's literally nobody else on the other one so if I end the quiz and in the quiz any up there you go it is indeed correct so basically you can Implement multiple interfaces but you can only extend one base less that is one of the limitations and one of the reasons why you should use interfaces over base classes and also inheritance is always a I talk about that in actually don't remember which one is it on the kitchen object but I don't know I talk about it on the on the course about the issues with inheritance and how it can definitely become quite tricky quite quickly so it is something that you can use because it is a very powerful thing but definitely you have to be careful when you use them whereas with interface personally I'm a huge fan of interface I think they are awesome especially since with uh so C sharp 7 you can use default implementations so that means you can write an interface and actually write the code so if you don't know what I'm talking about here's a quick test so instead of making a public class you can make it an interface so I my interface you can do this and then inside you can have a function my function and do something and then on a class you would implement this interface and again as it says on the question you can Implement multiple interface both of the csharp 7 you can also do something awesome which is over here you can do a default implementation so if you have an interface and already have a bunch of objects that Implement that interface and you want to add something new you can add a default implementation and everything won't work perfectly so you don't have to actually add the implementation but you can if you want to so interface are super awesome for example if you got a game and some objects have an inventory and some objects don't you can use an interface to say I has enter I has inventory and Implement that interface on any object that has an inventory so interface are super powerful and there is something that I definitely use quite a lot in the course and I've got a dedicated video on them so if you don't know about interfaces definitely watch the course and then definitely watch that video okay so yeah another awesome thing so I hope some of you are learning something new from this even though I'm looking on the side most people got 100 right so I'm not sure maybe I should have made the questions quite a bit harder maybe okay uh all right so let's do one more and then I think that's gonna be it because my voice already messed up how did you sell your first games well my first games were made with flash and back with flash that was uh basically it was sponsoring so basically a a company a sponsor would uh pay the flash developer and then it would show up a logo of that company with a link to the website and so on so usually those were flashy importance so I would make a game I would put it on a website for selling flash games then a company who contacted me say we'll give you 300 bucks if you put the link the logo with our custom animation and so on yeah pretty much kind of like a publisher that's that's kind of what they did yeah they had the game portals so for example a lot of you probably already know armor games so that was one of the big ones back then yeah pretty much uh okay right so thank you so much for the Super Chat and there's another one oh boy there's even more I'm sorry I'm trying to keep up uh Olivia I'm assistant engineer and thinking of going into coding games on a task apart from coding for your games did you work as a coder somewhere else and nope the answer is nope I didn't I pretty much just I've never had a regular job so if any of you have questions with regards to finding a job in the industry I am not the right person to to answer about that because yeah I've never had a a job anywhere else doing anything else although I have done a lot of things by myself so I've done some some regular applications I've done some websites a bunch of things so I have done a lot of things but not professionally and professionally making games that's pretty much the only thing I've ever done so thanks so much only VA for the super Channel thanks so much another one whatever you're saying and is it was this a hey yeah because my overlay does not support the what is it called the stickers I don't know but thank you so much Tech vir Singh Is that how you pronounce it that's a nice name nice chess lab that's one uh okay so let me put another question here so one more question okay so this one is hopefully a bit trickier so let's see this one how it goes okay so this one is actually related to lecture 14. so this one about csharp events and C sharp events you use something called a function signature so the question is what is a function signature so is it a the function name is it B the return type and parameter types or is it C the return type the function name the parameter types and parameter names so which one of these is correct so which one of these relates to the function signature so let's see go ahead and start to vote and let's see you should probably add a nice clock what is that oh boy now I don't remember countdown is that the thing the British game show which has a a nice timer with a nice sound that was fun uh uh all right so there you go lots of votes I didn't even see it's gonna be funny looking at this uh the chat rate for this for this stream is quite interesting lots of spikes lots of things anyways uh yeah all right it's countdown I only know countdown because of the skit on on uh the IT Crowd that was really funny where Moss becomes really hardcore into countdown becomes a famous person within that Circle that was fun all right okay so people are voting seems the majority thinks that it's C the return type the function name the parameter types and the parameter names how do you make better character design I mean that's an art question so I am definitely not the right person to teach about art so yep nice to netenba uh that was really funny yeah I still I still memorize the uh what's it called the the replacement to 999 what's that one oh one one eight nine nine nine eight eight one nine five nine one one nine oh God no I forgot 723 oh God no I forgot the last numbers uh anyway that was fun okay uh I had a spin pen like you you search for pen tricks and so on and that's uh what's a b bone not Super Chat cute thank you so much hey CPU it's live quiz seems to be very fun thanks for doing them yeah this was a fun idea that I had and so far it's working great I mean this is a UNT window and so far it hasn't crashed everything is working so yeah I'm very I'm very pleased with this so if all of you are enjoying this I will hopefully be doing more in the future all right so yeah the function signature so let's go ahead and end the quiz and let's see which one is the correct answer and for this one I really need a drum roll so I should probably have a drum roll and there you go and there you go the answer is B so now the majority was actually wrong for the first time wow that is interesting so yep the answer is B for the function signature what matters is the return type and the parameter types meaning that the function name and the parameter names that does not matter so you can have a function with different names different parameter names as long as the types are correct that is the one thing that really does matter all right so look at that yeah for this one I won yeah that definitely got a bunch of people off 100 so there you go rookie at 100 with 16 right answers what do I win I'm not sure I should probably come up with some prizes some things yeah remember that from here download gets video yeah that's nice awesome yeah because that is for delegates so if uh some of you don't know what I'm talking about for example let's make over here a delegate my delegate returns an INT an INT and has a string for some kind of parameter and now I can make a private void uh up right and my function with a string my string and this one is a function return minus one just to get rid of that error and basically over here this function does match this delegate signature so basically what matters is the return time so they both return end and they both have a string parameter now the actual name the delegate does not have to match and the actual name of the parameter also does not have to match so if I make a private a field of type my delegates so my delegate field if I do this I can do my delegate equals my function and yep there you go that does work because this one does have the exact same signature as that delegate so they both return in they both have a string and it does not matter that this one is called parameter over here is my string that does not matter for the function signature all that matters are the types of this so yeah look at that so A bunch of you actually got it wrong so that was fun so that means that a bunch of you uh learned something new so hopefully that is the positive takeaway so nice training your streams are so creative yeah thank you so much thank you for the super Channel thank you for being here thank you for watching that is fun another Super Chat you and there's even more Hey whenever you have time search and watch this video speed up compile times in unity with assembly definitions yeah I do have a lecture about assembly definitions on my ultimate TNT overview course so this one who made that is that a a oh look at that there it is live right now that's one uh oh times in UNT with simile definitions is this an official oh it's the one from Game Dev guide yep definitely assembly definitions if you have problems with compilation time definitely use them basically that's one way that you can split your code into multiple assemblies so if you modify just one line of code on one file you won't actually recompile the entire game which if you don't use assembly definitions and that's what happens you modify a single file and it won't recompile every single file whereas if you use assembly definitions by modifying one file will only recompile that assembly so if you have a huge code base it can still be really fast to compile as long as it's nicely separated into different assemblies on different parts so whenever you modify something only that assembly gets recompiled so if you use tons tons of them then even on a huge project it can definitely be super fast all right so yeah thanks for sharing for that tip so those of you who don't know similar definitions definitely watch this video Game Dev guide usually has great videos or if you have my ultimately in the overview of course I also have a lecture on that so yeah that is really awesome thank you not Super Chat tuned sorry about the name or your tutorials yeah that's great make journal series on how to host your multiplayer game using unity's new cloud game server hosting multiplayer yep that is definitely one of the things that I do want to cover I'm hoping to cover that on the upcoming multiplayer course and I'm also hopefully hoping to make a separate tutorial just on that subject so yeah that is definitely something that I definitely want to cover although I haven't done any research yet so I'm not sure I'm not sure when but yep definitely on the plan definitely something that I want to do so thank you so much not a super chat okay winner can choose a video idea I mean that would be a fun one a fun prize but I already have way too much work so I'm not sure that would be very doable I think if I made that the price I'm not sure I could guarantee that I would end up making it so yeah that would be fun but yeah I've got I have to say like a video ideas definitely something that I don't have I've got a billion things that I wish I could make if only I could clone myself so that I could work on 10 different ideas at the same time I'd love to do that so yeah that would be that would be fun thank you so much another Super Chat yeah there you go choose a video idea that would be fun so yeah thank you so much all right okay so that was a a fun question all right so I think that's gonna be it because I'm already my voice is already pretty messed up I can't talk way too much some people are at 100 last question yeah the 100 is just questions uh answers versus the total so yeah so for example over here barricade answered 15 and got 15 right even though there were apparently at least 16 questions so yeah that's the the percentage is not percentage of total questions it's answered versus correct okay all right so I think that's gonna be it I need to go eat something drink something and my dogs are okay all right okay so I think that is gonna be it okay so let me just put this I'm Gonna Leave This on for a little bit and then let's see all right so let me just organize everything and it is correct all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here on this live stream this was a different thing it was an experiment and well so far it went pretty well so I'm pretty happy with how it went so hopefully all of you enjoyed it so hopefully a bit more in the in the future so my plan for this year is definitely doing a bunch more live streams and experiment with different things kind of like this so hopefully you enjoyed it so thank you all so much for being here so let me just prepare things and I gotta go like this all right all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here thank you so much and I'll see you next time foreign thank you thank you foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign
