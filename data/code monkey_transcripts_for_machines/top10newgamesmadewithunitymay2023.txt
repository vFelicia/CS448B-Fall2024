hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with NT launch in June 23. there's lots of variety this month some very chill and calming games others are very dark and Moody some surprising hits and lots of unique interesting mechanics the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all of these games are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way I'm currently working insanely hard to get my game demo ready for the Sim Festival next week I've implemented something like 10 different mechanics this week really productive the game is really starting to take shape I can't wait to have you on play it I really hope you like it make sure you add it to your wishlist stay tuned for a testing live stream this weekend and go play it on Monday alright so starting off at number 10 with a very successful Indie sequel here is darkest dungeon 2. this one builds upon the original if you don't know this game features a very punishing but also very satisfying road trip through a very dangerous world where you not only fight some creatures but also your own inner demons you fight with some nice turnbased combat using all kinds of abilities and spells that also take into account positioning each hero is also unique with their own story that you can uncover in every run and it's also a roguelike where each run lets anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours and you keep getting some persistent upgrades every run is unique and every run leads to different encounters with different Heroes as you'll learn more about this world the reviews were actually a bit polarizing in the beginning when this came out plenty of FIFA did not like some big changes from the original but the recent reviews are much more positive so it seems like they will listen to feedback and improve the game significantly during Early Access next series a very good looking puzzle Adventure game called planet of Lana this was one of the big standouts of e3 two years ago visually it has a very unique style very flat colors which looks surprisingly great it's an adventure puzzle platformer which this is usually a genre where it's really difficult to find success you really need something that looks excellent just like this one to stand out it also helps how the game has a really cute catlike creature that follows you around it features some excellent design and music really fantastic visas and some cinematic scenes so if you don't like story Focus games and this one looks great already has over 700 reviews at 94 positive so people seem to love it for something quite a bit more hardcore with a nice mix of genres here is silica it's a nice mix of first person shooter combined with an RTS personally I always enjoy this mix in theory even though in practice sectionally real and difficult to make it work in the Australian layer you can guide your units placed on buildings set some orders and harvest resources then you can dive down into first person and engage into some intense first person combat you can fight as in infantry or drive around some very weighty very powerful vehicles and engage the aliens and one really awesome thing is how you can also play as the alien faction you can control some weird buglike creatures to take out the Infantry really interesting you can play either Solo or with friends in either Coop or PVP it's made by Bohemian interactive the armor developer it's out now and already has almost 2 000 very positive reviews then for some VR here is requisition VR this one caught my eye right away because it has a fascinating mechanic where you duct tape objects together to make some weapons definitely a very unique mechanic which is actually perfect when combined with VR for the actual physical action of putting on duct tape then each object has tons of attach points you can attach pretty much anything anywhere you want like for example you can attach some kind of rotating machine to a shovel to make a really nice offensive weapon or perhaps you can simply attach a spike to a wooden pallet and use it as kind of like a shield slash weapon combo everything is on physics based so you can throw objects or pick them up you can use a crowbar to break doors or use pistols to take out the zombies you can explore this interesting town or dungeons in either Solo or KOA the reviews are mostly positive so there's a little bit of Jank but the core concept is really unique then here is macabellon this one is an epic Auto battler where you command an army of awesome customizable mechs you create your units you can select their gear and type so you can make some light or some heavy units then you set up their placement really think strategically about where each unit goes then you watch as the mam happens as massive amounts of units destroy each other in a really satisfying manner visually the game looks really excellent the units feel really weighty and the explosions are really explosive the game is all about tweaking your units to defeat the enemy you can play another single player or against humans in PvP mode it's got over 1500 very positive reviews despite the launching in Early Access so this one is off to a very strong start then here's something which I would have guessed is pretty Niche but it's actually finding massive success it's called tape to tape it's a ice hockey game and one twist is how it has broken Light Elements which is certainly an interesting addition to the sports game and at the same time your players also have abilities and Synergy so it's really not meant as a serious sport game you've got a fun grappling hook you can throw to grab opponents you can throw your stick and knock people out or you can even bribe the rep so it definitely takes a more wacky approach there's a nice progression where you go from game to game trying to restore your team to its former glory it also has both online and local multiplayer which is actually pretty rare nowadays it has already got over a thousand very positive reviews even though it's only in Early Access so this one looks like a huge hit next if you enjoy building colonization then check out occupy Mars the game like name implies the goal is to colonize and occupy Mars you arrive at a Barren Wasteland and it's up to you to colonize the planet and turn it into a second home this is very much a Sandbox game you gather resources grow food repair some complex equipment build and upgrade your base and explore the World the game is highly technical with lots of very realistic systems you need to take care to generate enough power you need to use that power to generate water and oxygen you can conduct mining operations set up some greenhouses and be careful with the temperature you can also work on your Rover you can change the Hydraulics operate the robot arm modify the mining rig and much more so the game really has an emphasis on realism and physics there's a little bit of Jank with 800 mostly positive reviews but if you don't like hyper realistic sandboxes then give it a try next here is an interesting one with a strange name it's called above snakes it's a chill Wild West inspired RPG with lots of items lots of crafting building and survival elements the most important mechanic is how you explore and build the world and you do that one time at a time as you approach The Edge you can decide what the next time will be will you add a fur style for some food or maybe something with some enemies for some combat it features a really nice and complex house building system you can build your own house from tons of different tiles to get it looking exactly as you want it you can add a crafting station to craft some food and some weapons you can smell some iron weave some clothes or cut some wood if you want to learn how to make a husband building system just like this one I actually made a fun tutorial quite a while ago then sometimes also have unique NPCs which you can chat with and get some quests all in all it's a really nice mix of building an adventure with an interesting unique mechanic I saw a spider cat play this game a few months ago and it seemed really enjoyable it is out now and is doing decently well with 600 mostly positive reviews then for something very relaxing here is Panorama it's a very peaceful City Building puzzle game you've got a set of tiles and you place them down one by one some are just a simple forest or river others have some tiny houses and some occupy multiple tiles with an interesting structure some buildings also have bonuses like for example I'm placing down a windmill will automatically place down a bunch of wheat tiles there's also some cute animals and of course you can get points just for petting them one thing that really stands out to me on the trailer is how satisfying are the sound effects every time a new town was revealingly feeling so calming and so satisfying I'm personally not someone who usually notices sound effects too much so the fact that I noticed these really says a lot so if you want a very chill times then definitely give this a try it has almost 300 very positive reviews and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is an interesting simulator called flashing lights the simulator games are sometimes very janky but this one seems to be well made you can play as either a cop firefighter or medic each with unique missions and gear as a cop you can engage in car chases criminal incidents or hostage scenarios or perhaps you want to play As A Firefighter and put out some dangerous fires or simply save someone's life as a medic the conjunction of all three separate roles is really interesting when played with friends I assume this can be quite a lot of fun you can play either Solo or with 10 people for either fun or some serious roleplay each of the three let's say classes they all seem to have quite a lot of actions so police can stop carches with spikes firefighters can carry people and Medics can place them on stretchers I'd love to try this one out to see how they made all of these Mechanics Work there's also an interesting Universe of player created mods to keep you and your friends playing the game for a long time the game has been massively successful with over 10 000 very positive reviews alright so that's 10 awesome new games made within team launch in June 23 I hope this list helped you see how the engine is capable of building
