check out some highlights for December 23 even if you don't pick up any of these still great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these ass is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid ass and effects I've only made two videos covering the best free new assets and the best ones in systems as always there's links to the ad in description and as bonus you can use your coupon code monkey 10 to get 10% off your order before we begin just a quick mention the unity Humble Bundle is ending in about 2 days this one is a great deal with a ton of tools and a bunch of visual assets and the unity asset store is also having their new year sale pretty much all of the top sellers all of the best assets and tools all of those are discounted and there's even a coupon for an extra 10% off or specifically if you're looking for low poly assets and the cint sale is also having their great holiday sale as usual it's their excellent style so if you're a fan of it definitely check it out all right so starting off with a really gorgeous nature environment it looks really calm really inviting it's got a great semi stylized look this could be the perfect starting point for some kind of wilderness Adventure game something like breath of the wild or if instead you need some really cool looking robots check out this one they are all really unique there are some that look quite cute and some that look very imposing all of them with tons of unique animations for movement and using their various weapons it includes a minigun flamethrower and even some homing missiles I think this pack looks absolutely gorgeous personally I'd love to use this in some kind of game maybe an RTS or maybe some kind of open world game where these are the enemies populating the world you can get this bundle with nine robots or each one individually then if you're making something in first person and you need some animations check out this one this features a pistol and a knife so this would be great for some kind of stealth game you've got animations for walking running jumping shooting blocking inspecting the weapon and so on this dev has tons of awesome animations including separate knife and Pistol animations and then of course if you have some shooting you're going to need some targets if so check out this fun pack this would be perfect for one of those tutoral stages or maybe some of those target practice score attack modes this features lots of cardboard targets with everything personally I'd love to pick this one up and try making some kind of VR shooter demo and of course if you have shooting maybe you need some modular assault rifles if so look at this one this is a really impressive pack with an insane amount of customization you've got lots of stocks barrels Scopes grips lots of cartridges and tons more for example you can use this with my weapon attachment system to get a near infinite amount of weapon variation the models also include all kinds of parameters for modifying the amount of dirt or metal or plastic damage next here is a fun effect with some Edge detection this is a great post pressing effect to make your game really stand out personally I'm always a fan of outlines I think it always looks great it's got lots of extra features like angle detection and depth fixes to make it look great in every scenario you can mask which objects have edges and which don't and even customize it alongside custom shaders then if you need some environment fire in VFX check out this one it features 25 particle prefabs there are some campfires some torches bowls candles or really just some fire areas including both with and without smoke the fire can be in different colors to symbolize different things next here's another pack from an as publisher that I really like this one features some wood industry this publisher has some really strange very Niche but also great looking asset packs this one would be great for some kind of logistics game or perhaps it could simply be an interesting level in a shooter or an RPG game it features lots of wood forests and some big heavy machinery then for another fun effect here is some color transition this one looks really unique it spawns thousands of scales and changes from one color to another the demo is using a car but this works on any 3D model it's using a comput Shader so it should be pretty performant or maybe you just need a huge environment for your post baly the game if so look at this one it's a realistic environment everything is broken down and rusted looks like some kind of desert I assume this is what the remote sit is in the middle of nowhere in the US look like personally I suck at level building so I really love these assets with some prebuilt worlds filled with some really interesting props there's also a free link where you can try out a free demo to see the whole huge scene or if instead you prefer something more medieval check out this war camp it looks really cool if you add some fog and some color grading this could look straight like the intro from Gladiator naturally this would be perfect for some kind of RTS or maybe something like valheim or really just as a fun environment in an action game kind of like R son of Rome personally I really enjoy that game then if you have some water and Bose in your game check out this visual effect it features some really realistic Ripples and waves it includes individual effects for all sides of the boat it says these are to the elements so it's primarily meant for a relatively calm water and looks great in this video or if you're making something more stylized here is a nice fantasy Village it looks very mystical very inviting this one is a huge pack with over 800 assets it features both exterior and interior so you can pick this up and build a huge sprawling fantasy Village then if you're making some third person shooter and you need some animation check out this one this one includes over 300 humanoid animations it features assault rifles pistols grenades RPGs jump death animations and tons more maybe we can combine that one with this next styed environment and buil some third person shooter kind of like fortnite this has some really nice Gardens very unique bright colors everywhere definitely a unique environment this one also includes the characters with a shaman and a villager or if you're making something inspired by James Bond or Austin Powers if so then look at this cutting laser VFX this would be great for a scene where your hero character is about to be cut in half or maybe your hero could use this to cut some glass to do some kind of heist it looks really good with tons of extra tiny details then if you need some 2D characters look at this one this contains 100 unique characters it says that this is an addon for some kind of character creative system although I assume you can just use this pack by itself since it's really just some Sprites you could download and modify my character Crea system to make it work in 2D or if you're working in 3D check out this character it's a really nice shadow Mage definitely looks dark and very imposing this could be your hero in some kind of antihero game or maybe an intimidating enemy if you scale this up it kind of looks like soron it includes both the character and multiple colors or maybe you're making some kind of resource Gathering game if so check out this crystals and gems pack it features 90 models there are some blocky crystals some are spiky some that look in case in stone and and some that look like some really polished gems all right so there's are my top 20
