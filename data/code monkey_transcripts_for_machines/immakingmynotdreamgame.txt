hello and welcome I'm your kid monkey so here's a question for you do you have a dream game if so what is your dream game basically what is something that you would build if you had unlimited time and resources this is something that I see quite a lot of people talking about if you search for a dream game on YouTube you won't find a modern videos on people making their dream game some people are making some huge RPGs others are making some survival games or some complex metroidvanias personally I always really enjoy watching these one really nice thing about the Indie Game Dev Community is how everyone is so supportive if you say that you're working on your dream game there won't be lots of people cheering on for you hoping to succeed now for me I'm currently working on my upcoming steam game dinky Guardians it's a really fun Colony building automation defense game I really love working on this game I'm enjoying both developing it and playing it personally I can't wait to finish it and have tons of people employ it and hear what they think although at the same time I would not say this is my dream game now that's not a negative on the game like I said I'm really enjoying working on it this is going to be my ninth steam game I've been making games since 2012 and before that I made 40 Flash game games so I've made a ton of games and I've really enjoyed making every single one of these they're all unique and interesting in their own ways the simple reality is I generally don't really have a dream game I don't know if that means that I'm weird I generally do have a mountain of games that I would love to build I just don't have a single one dream game basically if you gave me unlimited time and money there's not a single idea that I would love to build instead there's tons of them that I would love to build I think the difference in this question might also be how some game devs are very artistic people they recently see themselves as artists making a masterpiece whereas for me I've only seen myself as more something like a toy maker the games that I like to make and that I like to play are more focused on systems and mechanics rather than some beautiful stories and characters that's really just my personal preference so really for me I don't have a single thing that I would love to make instead I've got hundreds of mini toys that I would love to build for example last month I was playing Desperado 3. I'd love to one day build a really nice sound strategy game just like that one but again I also wouldn't call that my dream game then next year I'm also planning on returning to the development of my game total world duration that's a game that I put on hate as well I worked on Tiki Gardens I'm also really excited to work on that game making a really nice exxonlike and a persistent horn with some zombies I think that idea sounds really awesome I definitely can't wait to play it but again I wouldn't necessarily combat my dream game I'd also love to one day explore making a survival crafting game something like valheim I'd love to spend some time researching card games and make something like Marvel Snap I've also never done a first person game previously I stuck with 2D games simply because I didn't know where to get 3D models but now that I do know how to use the answer sword and get a bunch of 3D models now I'd love to try something in first person related to that I'd also love to explore VR for a bit then open world games are some of my favorites to play with today's tools it would be possible for you someone would ever like me to make one so yep like I said I don't have a single dream game instead I've got tons of ideas that I would love to build over the course of my entire life I guess it does come back to that artist versus toy maker distinction for example someone like Quentin Tarantino he sees himself as an artist he famously stated in how he only wants to make 10 movies and that's it whereas for myself I imagine when I'm 90 years old I really hope to have a portfolio of more than 50 games all of them interesting of them unique so when I see all these videos talking about people making their dream game I do wonder if I'm a bit weird or maybe it's simply a case of survivorship bias it's just the fact that if you make a video and you title it by saying you're making your dream game that makes for a more compelling video so naturally those get more views more clicks I made two posts in the comments so use those to vote on whether or not you do have a dream game should be fun to see the results and if it turns out that I'm weird for not having a dream game if most people have one if that's the case then you yourself also don't have a dream game well then at least know that you're not alone because I am the same and even though this is not my dream game I'm really excited for the Guardians the release date is coming soon so go ahead and edit your wish list and stay tuned for the final game alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
