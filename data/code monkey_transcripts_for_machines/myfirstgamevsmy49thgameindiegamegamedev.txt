so this was my very first game it came out in 2008 so that was 15 years ago it was made in Flash and it's called freeway it's a super simple game where you just control a car and try to avoid the other cars in the edge so just go around extremely basic stuff and this right here is the game that I'm working on right now as you can see it's got a ton of Interlocking Systems it works in both multiplayer and single player the dinkies have lots of very complex AI there are lots of resources to be gathered objects to craft and research to unlock so tons of stuff Game Dev and programming really is all about experience the more could you write and the more games you make the more skilled you become in these past 15 years I've made 40 flash games and 8 Steam games having that much experience is exactly how I'm now able to build complex games like this one but if you're just starting out and don't compare yourself to where I am right now compare yourself to my very beginning and you're probably doing much better
