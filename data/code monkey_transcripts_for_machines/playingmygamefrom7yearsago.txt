e e e e e hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day let me just is this a little bit off like that yeah hope you're having a great day today on this nice Monday uh right think set up yep so basically just yesterday I was looking at my steam page and I figured out I haven't played this game in many many years so I figured it would be nice to have a bit of a relaxing time I was working the whole morning so now would be nice to do a little bit of play time and I haven't played this game in quite some time how many of you know this honestly this is actually one of my favorite games one of my uh action games let's actually play the trailer and see if that works oh nice I know the special nice Ah that's nice I got to say normally I hate making trailers definitely one of the parts about game development that I most dislike but making this trailer I think it's actually the best trailer that I've ever made I think it's actually pretty nice pretty interesting uh it showcased the game showcases a bunch of things about the game so yeah normally I hate making trailers but this is probably the best one that I've made at least I think so that is actually quite a nice thing um start learning unity and coding just about two weeks ago I was wondering should I care about dots or something I should care for the future yeah dots is very much an advanced thing so I would say do not worry about dots if you just literally just start just focus on normal game objects making normal games uh make some like flppy Bird Space Invaders PacMan that kind of thing so make simple games just using uh just using regular Gam object just using regular Unity UI so yeah dots is very much an advanced thing so unless you're already a advanced programmer with interest in performance if that's the case then sure go ahead and use it but if not if you're just a beginner in general then yeah definitely do not worry about dots you can make many many games like for example this game this game actually has quite a lot of units and it was not made with dots so yeah it's a really awesome tool but it's definitely an advanc you so definitely do not uh do not use it right away if you are a beginner have you used red Twitter for marketing I've tried it but honestly to very little results I mean doing those uh red and Twitter those are very very difficult to find success on Reddit basically they have tons and tons of rules on all sorts of uh selfpromotion kind of things so that one you can't really do it I mean you can do paid marketing which maybe that could work if you find some very Niche subreddits that relate to whatever your game is like if you're making like tycoons there's a tycoon subred so it probably would be wise to do some PID advertising there but in terms of organic things it is very very difficult if you can make it if you can get past the mods and you can get millions of views and of course that does work but for the most part if you do some kind of post uh advertising your own stuff on Reddit chances are it won't be removed so yeah and Twitter Twitter is more for uh finding Publishers and cont creators as opposed to finding players there are really not many players on Twitter so if you're looking for a publisher and if you're trying to contact a content creator to maybe play your game maybe that can be useful but in terms of players themselves Gathering wish list usually Twitter is really not all that good so yeah a good idea to use dots for mobile uh yep definitely I mean dots uh basically helps your code run much faster and the faster your code runs actually the uh less battery to consume so in terms of mobile where things are very performance limited it definitely helps to have something that works much much faster at the same time if your code runs much faster even if the device doesn't have S needed it also means that it takes quite a lot less battery which people usually quite prefer so yeah if you have a game that is suitable for Dots then yeah mobile is definitely one of the things that uh benefits quite a lot from from dots paying for advertisements to Market worth it uh that is a really tricky question and usually the answer is no not really uh simp because indie games are usually very cheap like five 10 15 bucks and it's really hard to get a return on the ad spend based on that amount of money because even if your game is like 15 bucks steam is going to take like 30% so you keep like 10 bucks maybe less than that so yeah can you sell a copy using advertising with just 10 bucks that is usually very difficult unless you have a really great game so yeah for the most part for India developers paying for advertising is usually not going to be worth it is really tricky uh okay so let me go ahead and play the game and if later on if any of you wants to play it it's actually on discount just for the next 6 hours so if any of you want to pick it up on see you can do that okay so let me actually start it on the other thing it's actually been many many years since I last played this game so it's going to be interesting to replay it yeah put it just just put it kind of like this I think this should be good oh it's oh my controller just vanished I hope it didn't die that would not be nice uh let make sure that the audio levels are good let me try to put it just a little bit okay just making sure okay I think the Audio Level okay I think it's actually way too low it's always tricky to handle the audio make sure that my voice works but it doesn't uh okay so like this B like the game music is at like 40 Deb that one is on 20 okay so that should be good how' you get the menu art for this game I worked with an artist so most of the uh art in this game uh was handled by an artist so I contract an artist to do all kinds of Sprites the menu the logo and all kinds of things and it's actually really awesome I mean I wonder what yis is doing I mean uh right now I just have his name haven't spoken to him in ages but yeah this uh I was really happy in terms of visuals cuz usually my games suck at the visuals just because I suck at doing art so for this one hiring an artist to do it I'm still a big fan of this nice little uh scene for the main menu I really love the logo I think it is perfect exactly for what the game is about really fast night's playing around so yeah basically if you have very limited art CS kind of like myself then working with an artist can definitely help quite a little bit okay let's start a brand new game oh yeah these are the uh the um uh the Workshop support that I had for my game which is actually pretty nice which actually over here on the main menu over there on the top right corner does show and it does open up the thing and Y so I I added uh Workshop support to this game it's really awesome so people can make all kinds of Hero characters all kinds of Sword Shields and so on a bunch of people made some really nice stuff so something from Attack on Titan and yeah there's a whole bunch of characters really interesting things see look at that sounds really awesome to add some uh implementation for Workshop support and then see what the players do they do all kinds of things so some Minecraft stuff and yeah so yeah work shop support is actually really nice yeah and something that is actually not that difficult to do and I don't know if I yeah I didn't cover uh steam themselves but uh I did cover some modding so if you want to add modding to your games there's the uh ugc platform and this kind of thing so if you want to add mod into your game it's one of those things that sounds very intimidating but in reality it's actually uh quite doable so oh just uh and yeah adding modd into your games is always quite fun okay so let me go new game do a new game and yeah let me include all of them just have all these fun things new game all right oh yeah the character creat nice okay let's choose a name yeah the this Randomness was actually quite fun so basically I randomize uh I have a bunch of adjectives an array with a bunch of adjectives and an array with a bunch of first names and basically just randomizing all of those did anyone mod your games uh a bunch of people made some characters over here so yep that type of modding it did okay so let me pick a random name that was The Fearless okay I think that works uh and over here oh that's customizing all the there's the soldier and demo man that's fun uh let's go with default and let's randomize and tons of randomization lots of options one of them is the Ghost in the Shell face thing that's nice uh okay let's pick one not too spiky so may like this but different yeah I like this just the okay different weapon uh oh nice okay I think I like this one nice and big so like this all right so let's go yeah I have I don't know how long it's been since I played this game oh that a nice intro yeah about to break through and little characters I actually did draw these characters I didn't draw the main character and the swords and all that that was made by proper artist but these little minions I did draw them myself and I think they actually look quite nice uh and over here this actually something that I'm very proud of is the combat system for the for the game which is all based on hitting different buttons on the on the game pad so basically these little minions got attack three times on the X if I attack on the Y it doesn't deal damage and then there are other ones that have to mix YX and so on it's not the Buster sword I think it's kind of inspired by it I don't know where the uh artist took get inspiration but yeah definitely has that little shape all right go and these are yxy and look at all the characters fighting on the other side those are actually just dummies so they are not actual characters this is lost we have to leave oh and I also have a nice Dash and the stun counter oh yeah that's also fun oh oh yeah the combos nice this another thing that I really love about this game having some combos Zooms in I can aim in this case let's do the spike and look at the characters boom and they all fly away this is actually something really awesome I really felt that the moment that I added all of these blood particles and flying bodies that was the moment where the where the game kind of became quite a bit more special so that was definitely something that I enjoyed and the nice little overall map this also something that I really enjoyed making okay we managed to get out but the trasers to cover our lands so the whole idea is yep you look at this times and think like wow how did I make this I do honestly I I really enjoy uh playing my games from a long time ago because I mean it's very far in the past so I'm no longer at the uh mindset of okay I'm working on this non up now I can look at this as if it was a game that someone else made and it's really awesome it's a it's awesome when I look at a game that I made many years after making it and I still enjoy playing it I guess that tells me that I that I did a good job when I was making it so yeah this was fun uh now we need to fight and get it all back when reach that time yeah so basically the map control that is actually really cool which language did you use to code this I mean this made in unity so it's all in C uh we will need resources so we should begin by ring that Village okay so I can control my my little hero character over here in the overall map and there's a nice Hideout it has some characters some gold and some things okay so let's go oh and the map uh revealing actually don't remember how did I do this oh I think this one was uh cuz there are many ways that you can do some kind of fog of war effect for this one I think for this one I did yeah I think it's all based on a ren attack so basically there's a second camera from Top looking down and the characters they themselves have some kind of invisible won spread on top of them and as they move they are basically drawing on top of that render texture and that render texture is then used to basically create the mask for the showcasing the hidden areas and the visal areas and I remember that it was tricky for handling the saving and loading I don't know how I did that I'm guessing I just saved the screenshot as kind the uh the render texture as some kind of PNG but yeah it works pretty well it's actually very very nice and smooth it works quite well so yeah another interesting mechanic that I definitely really enjoyed okay so let's go into a battle how old are you I'm currently 35 which for some people apparently that's old but I definitely don't feel old so yeah okay the civilian know Must Destroy all the enemy camps oh yeah and the map so this game is obviously also very much inspired by hey Super Chat super serer thanks so much uh blet thanks so much uh so yeah this game was also very much inspired by Mountain blade I love that game so I definitely wanted to do something like it so that's why you control a hero character and there's all kinds of minions and you can also control minions guide them to go somewhere you control the overall map and so on so kind of like the tagline one of the main tag lines for this game was basically M blade in 2D that was kind of the rough idea that I was trying to do and uh I think it actually came out quite well so yeah okay let me just just move the super stier thank you so much uh okay so yeah so here I we got the world map close the map and now all of them are going like that so now I can move around and there's all the vages and take down all of those oh yeah and there's also the the counter nice this was a a fun one to add Bally I can counter the characters and I can also counter the arrows we got that one okay anyone else I really enjoyed making this the uh the uh units controlling the units and controlling the hero character having them all attack they all destroy all those things and again all these Sprites i hir n to do them that is why they I think they still look really good and the particles over here this looks really nice okay let's attack the next Camp go there oh go say a bunch of houses bunch of trees everything nice so okay there's another one another one okay the last few while they're shooting me nice I really enjoyed this uh combat mechanic system maybe one day I should I should make some kind of sequel to this game because for the core mechanics I definitely do think they are quite nice so nowadays I would probably be able to make this in a I don't know better production value make something a little bit more interesting even though I still think that this still I think it's one of the best looking games that I've made considering my my uh skill set uh but yeah doing something with my skills nowadays maybe in 3D that could be a fun thing there you go Victory nice got some gold experience level up and got two kills and no deaths nice took some L we should grab more units from The Hideout actually I don't think we took any losses but sure uh okay let righty to guess how long would a sequel take to make oh that's a good question I I have no idea I mean this game took I think it was a bit over a year like maybe 13 14 months something like that so yeah nowadays nowadays I'm much more skilled but if I were to do a sequel it would be a bit more complex it would be building upon this so on the one hand i'm skilled I also know the design that I would do but I would probably try doing in 3D with a bunch of different things so yeah I don't think it would take me 13 months though so I don't know maybe like six seven months to make a nice sequel something that takes this basally converts into 3D and that's a a few more mechanics that could be could be interesting make seal 3D environment 2D characters ah that would be nice that is actually one of the uh art styles that I very much would like to do someday in one of my in one of my games cuz I always enjoy that basically having a 3D world but you have flat characters I think that s always looks really nice so that could be interesting I mean in fact uh these characters actually the hero character it's actually the exact same animation system that I have for the characters down here for the uh live stream overlay so that overlay these characters that code I actually made that oh crap I actually made that all the way back in uh when was this game like 2017 so yeah the code for the the characters that I'm using down here here that did come from this game from this long ago yeah basically on this game I had to do so many things in terms of optimization in order to make it actually work correctly in order to make it functional so so yeah it was a it was definitely challenging because of how many characters I want to have on screen that was a big challenge so I having to make my own custom animation system just because all these characters in the beginning they were each set up of different body parts like the head would be a game object the body and another the game object each fit would be another game object the weapon and so on but that would make it very terrible in terms of performance so usually what you want to do is render the whole thing in just one mesh so that's pretty much what I did that's why I built this animation system that I'm using for the characters down here all of these characters these are just one mesh basically just one mesh of multiple quads and the fact that it's all just one mesh means that it all renders very quickly so all these if I have like 20 characters on screen that's just 20 draw calls or actually just one or two or one per typ because of the uh same uh same material but yeah it makes it so much faster as opposed to having each body part on a separate on a on a separate thing okay let's grab some more units info what is the info oh yeah it's the upgrades nice uh speed I'm always a fan of speed how do I okay nice oh yeah and the combos oh yeah yeah I also I also remember this uh UPG upgrade system this upgrade window this one went through tons of variations tons of iteration cuz it was really tricky to get something that I wanted and the end I was really happy with this I think this is the first time in one of my games that I use a uh basically animated gifts in order to show the upgrades and I really like it so basically you can scroll down through all the upgrades and over there see a nice little window of exactly how they work so yeah I remember this was very tricky and when I figured out that you can actually make some animated videos inside of inside of unity and put it somewhere in your UI that was definitely the point where I where I got the basically the final iteration for this one and was interesting yeah the super slash the super sties are all really nice off topic but if you ever played prey was playing through and thought it was a good example of great level design I haven't but I've definitely heard very good things about it are you talking about the recent one I suppose so I definitely haven't played the one from like the early '90s but the Remake from like years ago I haven't played it but I've heard excellent things about it especially the DLC apparently DLC is really good the moon breaker or something like that so yeah that's definitely one of the games that I very much would like to play whenever I have some time just to just to research because yeah that one being a uh systems heavy game it should be quite interesting okay let's take down some more bad guys yeah the one by arinos yeah actually shame yeah that was the studio that just went down so oh man those are sadly sad H uh all right go take them all down don't get any nice oh yeah I can also stun them nice all right good can I try doing a castle Siege so the castle is 32 and then there's a bunch more around all right any big bugs in this game that you know about but haven't fixed no I don't think so I mean normally whenever I publish a game I stick with that game for at least a few months in order to make sure that everything is nice and B free as much as possible so as far as I know there's nothing uh gamebreaking so but yeah right and there's the little hit counter also forgot that I made that one nice and actually made tutorial on that one yeah basically if you get hit there you go now I'm 20 okay I don't want to get hit go three can I get more all right any more enemies okay there's just one over there o okay all my units go ahead take in and let's see many kitchen cha score serve save my Unity final project oh that's awesome hey uh I mean great job on learning from it it and going through it I mean the only thing I do is really just provide the knowledge it's up to you to actually learn so if you manage to go through your final project that means you actually learned so congrats on that that is really cool can you make all the asses for this game yourself nope for this one I very muchard an artist for pretty much all of the art assets I did draw the tiny little characters so all the Minions I did draw myself but the Hero characters all the environment art all of that I heard an artist this is actually one of the most most expensive games that I've made specifically for that because I hired an artist specifically to make uh pretty much all of the art oh so yeah but yeah I did hire artist which in turn is what helped make the game actually look quite decent which I think that nowadays it still looks quite nice okay go ahead and push it actually don't remember what's up top there I think it's just the like the uh throne room go go go oh yeah there's just the throne room I think on some maps cuz this is also this game also has quite a lot of uh prision generation oh there are more reinforcements coming will they get here in time they do nice okay that's fun see I really like the system cuz basically if I look on the map yeah I can see over there the uh basically the Overworld that one is still is still running even when I'm oh crap even when I'm inside a battle the Overworld is still running so that is why these can do can come with more reinforcements cuz all those characters are still moving around on the overall map okay so let me just take down these guys what is my oh I got hit once woo nice a bunch of gold experience and upgrade points and combo points all right nice that was cool here your game development journey is very inspirational nice been working hard in my own game however I have an issue where I commented on your Members Only video oh okay I won't I haven't I haven't gone through any of the comments today so yeah if you post something in the last 24 hours then I should be able to answer in a in a few hours probably after lunch so so so yeah definitely just a little bit and hopefully I should be able to help with whatever you're trying to do uh reminds me of the battles you can do in Assassin's Creed Odyssey that's actually one of the systems that I also enjoy I don't I don't remember how it was in Odyssey but in in uh in a Brotherhood when you could send out different uh assassins to do all kinds of missions over here on this one you can also hire uh hire allies to hold you and you can then send those allies to go into different places and yeah you can also take care of region so now this region is now ours nice and there are some Knights okay so like I was saying yeah let's go ahead okay so who should we recruit Simon the violent or Lance of fearless so this one has Earth shatter I really like that skill this one has Inspire and mortars that one is a little I really like Earth shatter so I guess let's or can I recruit both or I don't have money oh yeah right I can't afford okay yeah it would be nice but I only got 200 bucks yeah uh thanks so much for the Super Chat okay so yeah so there you go version 1.07 B so like I was saying a while ago usually when I make my games I try to update them constantly as soon as I can oh is that one going to attack that's one uh so yeah basically uh I had at least seven or eight different uh oh yeah I forgot that I could move the camera that's also nice uh right o and yeah the uh little hit counter window over there got 11 hits 24 hits oo nice that is actually something that I did I mean part of the reason why I started this channel was basically uh to share the knowledge that I had gained through making my game so this was the hit counter soas if you want to know how I made the hit counter in that game you can watch the tutoral where it shows exactly that so yeah basically especially in the beginning uh when was this this was in in 5 years ago in May 2019 so yeah back in May 2019 I made this and yeah it is basically showing how to make that little hit counter window just like I have in my game so yeah basically when I when I started this channel now I was looking for tutorials of things to cover that was kind of it I was kind of going through okay what are the things that I built in my own games how can I teach how to make them so yeah that was roughly the thing how many months did it take yep about 13 14 months something like that I uh actually on the did I post on the I don't know I probably post the change log but or actually can I see my little I still have the all right I look in that hero conquest yeah I don't yeah so basally this is the change log for the game yeah but this doesn't doesn't show when I oh yeah right I went through Early Access totally forgot about that yeah this game was in Early Access was actually so the first version was in uh February of 2017 that was the first version lots of updates lots of of upgrades tons of constant updates as I was building the game in Early Access and yeah that it was in version 1.0 when I got the phone release in 2017 so it was in Early Access for about 3 months yeah I guess so that's interesting it's fun to go back and see basically how how did my how did I handle my projects back then so that was actually quite interesting uh okay just there how did you do fun of war in the global map draing on some Mex texture yep exactly uh so basically got a camera up top looking down the characters have an invisible circle around them so as I move the character around you can see that the render texture is being revealed so basically basically the camera on top that is rendering onto a render texture that camera is set up in order to uh not clear on every update so basically that way the uh the uh Circle that is on top of the character here that Circle basically expands the area that I can see because it is not being cleared so it is constantly being an additive thing onto the fog of War texture and yeah that oh yeah and the the little the little things trading back and forth I forgot about that mechanic that was fun nice oh yeah right cuz the villages generate I just bought the game this shall be a fine piece in my large collection nice yeah I hope you enjoy it I mean I think this actually one of my games with the high review score so yeah I'm definitely still very proud of it 88% I'm pretty sure it was above 90 for a long time so yeah this is definitely one of my own favorite games and even right now playing it I'm still enjoying it so that's definitely always a good thing okay so let's try going out ruit Knights nope can't afford just yet okay so those are okay can I try let's go ahead and Ambush the Convoy are you planning on making a sequel if I had infinite time definitely I would love to cuz I really enjoyed making this game and it's actually the only action game that I've made all my other games are more strategy management things and this one was an action game and it was that way very much oh oh crap oh crap and it was that way oh ah cuz I don't have the thing I need the combos combo Fly Away boom nice uh so yeah basically this was my pretty much the only action game that I've made and the reason for that was actually intentional basically after making so many management Tycoon games I wanted to make something that could be played with a controller that was kind of the main idea that was kind of the main goal so that is why I made this one and it was actually a very interesting challenge although at the same time it was also one of my goals was to make since it was playable on a controller the goal was to Port it onto a console and that is one part that I didn't quite do uh so yeah that is some one of the things uh actually for my latest game Dy Guardians that is kind of the goal that I that I want to try to make it playable on a console since that game is also playable with a game pad and I've gone through a little bit of the process for signing up as a uh Xbox developer account but it's a really tricky thing so I haven't made much progress on it but yeah definitely would like to definitely would like to continue working on that at some time yeah oh and I've got some upgrades Dash recharge I like Dash recharge but yeah let's go with a combo to do a bunch more Combos and can I afford any of these nope the cost two so nope can't do it all right oh and there's another okay I only got 23 guys I should probably pick up some more oh let me pick it up uh take some units okay now I got 50 guys okay let's see 50 versus 50 can I defeat this guy okay let's see oh and there are some rein oh oh I just called in some reinforcements totally forgot about that mechanic and nice little intro for the thing this was very much uh inspired by uh uh oh God the uh Battle for Middle Earth game the uh shadow of War Shadow Mordor yeah definitely very much inspired by that I mean the Nemesis ISM was really awesome so this one is not exactly Nemesis but the characters are very unique they have random stats random names random things that was actually quite fun and I don't remember how it is to okay so they show where they are going to attack so he's now going to do an earth shatter oh right so the blue thing is basically their defense area so I got to hit them like that okay nice nice see again as I'm playing the game again many many years later I still enjoying the mechanics that I made back then so that is always a good sign okay take down this guy this guy St him anyone else quickly before he respawns boom nice they got a one combo bar that's cool shadow war was one of the first games I ever played wow nice that's a that's a good start yeah that was definitely really awesome game I played that one nonstop yeah that was really cool shadow of mortar yeah mortar was the first one war was the second one both them were great I really enjoyed both them it's a it's a shame they didn't do more of it recruit a knight okay I think I can afford Knight and there goes the guy with zero enemies and he's going away oh TJ hey how's it going thanks for being here morning Pros to write a patent dyamic system yeah that that's one of those things that is really stupid hey hey Phil you're here as well hey nice uh yeah that is really really quite silly I mean it's such an awesome system that could benefit from so many games but yeah they patented so nobody tried doing anything similar so that is definitely one of those H very annoying things like the entire industry gets all messed up just because one random public sh decided to uh decid to uh patent some kind of thing that was the same thing as when I think it was Sega which for like 20 or 30 years they patented the idea of having mini games and loading screens which that actually only expired like two or three years ago it's kind of crazy how can you patent something that is so so I don't know so normal that so many games have so yeah that is definitely very very strange my brother nice start learning Game Dev with your course a year ago nice and now we are releasing our first game on Steam oh that's awesome that is cool hey congrats on taking a game to release yeah I hope it's a I hope the release goes well so yeah congrats nice all right okay so can I recruit them uh let's go with Simon the violent right cool going to need all the help we can get can tell the Knight which region he should defend or attack open the info window okay and now on to the knights list okay nice so now I can tell him what to do okay Simmon the violent what do I want do I want you to stay here or attack or follow me well let's go okay let's go ahead try to attack I mean he's got 70 units so hopefully he should be able to handle that okay let's see where he's going and he's going up there into that battle and he's fighting and he actually winning along with those okay now he's going there and now I think he's going to lose so let me give some backup okay let's see hey there he is Simon the valent hey nice actually implemented a a uh twitch implementation where basically the names for the things would be names of people actually watching but sadly I didn't do it for uh YouTube uh YouTube live streams I don't think YouTube live streams exist back then in 2017 so yeah basically just say twitch integration so yeah I wish cuz that was actually really fun it was something where basically people watching their name could show up on one of the characters then they could also vote for giving like different bonuses to essentially the streamer that was playing the game so it was actually it was a really fun thing it's really a shame that I made it just for twitch and doesn't work here on YouTube so yeah it's a it's a shame on that okay so let's go and let's attack yeah just go attack all the way up there that's the only one right yepy there he goes Simon Okay Simon let's go oh crap oh and he's gonna oh he's gonna throw the traps nice and he's doing an earth shatter and stunning all these guys nice oh yeah and the tower attacks I totally forgot that the tower also attacks and basally the hero character cannot destroy cannot damage buildings so I made that that was a clear design choice just to make it so that you also have to depend on your oh crap on your little minions oh oh just got to block all of them okay let me ah I thought I had let's do Spike boom byebye nice oh crap there's actually a lot of them these little yeah making the ey for these guys was also interesting making the eye for the oh making the eye for the uh oh all the archers to stay in place stay behind and all of these guys to rush ahead that was also I remember an interesting challenge okay so just those nice and there's the tower going down you often use sck systems in your game yep pretty much on every single one of my games so yeah t systems are really awesome in order to be able to uh what's the name of this game this is hyperight so it's one of my games so yeah if you want to pick it up actually it's on sale for another five bucks for just for another 5 hours for just a box if you want then yeah uh and yep uh tick systems are really awesome they basically allow you to do it's a really easy way to get a ton of extra performance by making sure that code that does not have to run on every single update you can run it just whenever just 10 times a second and so on so yeah I'm pretty sure pretty much all of my games I've always used uh uh tick systems because yeah they are really a super easy way to get a ton of extra performance so yeah I definitely encourage you to learn about them nice to see you live I really like your tutorials hey nice yeah I I would like to do some more live streams uh if only I could find a schedule that would work so right now it's still very much uh a bit random in terms of times but yeah every time I do it I enjoy it so I definitely would like to do it a little bit more it's always it's always fun to talk to people in real time as opposed to just the comments so yeah all right let's go why boom nice oh okay take out oh nice Victory course on need me Tower Defense isn't that some muchat this game me a few mechanics like Tower actually the tower visual is literally from this game so yeah what I the Sprites that I used uh in that course indeed a lot of them came from this game but that game is more like a uh tower defense strategy kind of game whereas this is more action so it's a very different gen but actually in terms of the uh the logic for controlling the units basically the logic that is not just controlling the action on the main character yeah for all of those that course does teach quite a quite a few things similar to that so a lot of things related to uh strategy games Tower Defense games RTS games so yeah if you want to learn how to make those kinds of games and yeah uh making though uh picking up that course should hopefully be helpful okay let me pick up some units just because I'm quite a bit did you draw this as yourself or had help with them nope this one was I very much H an artist to do pretty much all the all the Sprites so yeah CU myself I could not really uh draw this so although actually the little minion creatures I did draw those because they are so so tiny and so simplified but yeah all the all the trees the background all the Hero characters uh all of those were made by an actual proper artist this was probably the game that I invested the most in terms of hiring someone to some art uh cuz I've used uh a bunch of Assets in my own games but in terms of hiring an artist in uh Yep this was definitely the main one cuz I really wanted the game to look consistent look nice so yep definitely hard and artist for this one and I think it really helped the game look quite a lot better you have a tutorial on take systems I do actually it's been quite a long time but it's still very much a valid thing on the time TI system yep so this video when was this back in 2018 so yeah a very long time ago when I was basically covering the things that I learned from making my own games that was when I made this so the video is old but this still exactly the exact same system that I use nowadays it's really super simple you basically just have a class that constantly counts up with time do down to time and every x amount of time it just fires a tick and a bunch of other classes can listen to those and so on uh was making night game and a t system seemed like an obvious way to handle the amount of things that generate per second I'm guessing you do this guns although with that one be a bit careful uh it depends on the scale of the idle game that you're making cuz there are a bunch of idol games that generate things like if it's generating 60 times per second basically on every single update then at that point it doesn't make much sense to use uh a tick system because you're going to basically take on every single update so if it is something that doesn't happen as often definitely use a tick system but if it is something that is generating literally on every second cuz basically a lot of those idle games especially when you get into the late game it is constantly generating tons of resources and for those having the overhead of the events that might actually be a negative as opposed to a positive but in most case yeah if it isn't something that that happens every time then definitely use a t system and for that yep definitely use events so just firing off an event on tick something usually I have like on tick that uh happens on every single tick and I think usually I make the ticks like uh2 seconds so there's five takes per second but then I also have other events so I have an event on Take Five and that basically takes that fires off that event on every five tick that I have on take 10 and so on and so I can easily attach logic that runs at different rates and that helps make the game quite a bit more uh quite a bit more efficient so so yeah once again I really love T Systems definitely one of those things that is always really awesome would you ever release a source code to your own game so we have more code to phone games see how it all interacts uh probably not because uh this one still even though I made the game there it still used a bunch of third party tools so basically trying to so like for example on this one back then back when I made this game the uh unities input system did not exist so over here for oh there you go go uh so for handling all the controller Logic for this one I had to use a third party tool so so basically if I were to open source the code I would have to go through all of those I don't know like 30,000 lines of code in order to make sure there's no third party code over there so yeah that would be quite tricky so yeah that is why I don't think so there any estimate when the course will be available I don't know I was researching in in fact I would I still have it open right here so uh I've been researching a ton of stuff trying to get it all working and I've managed to get quite a few things working so I got the selection I can place down buildings I can queue up some units spawning the enemies have some Patrol they walk around they attack each other and so on I've got bullets and all kinds of things uh so yeah I've already made quite a few things but there's still quite a lot uh more to research and the main thing that I was researching is actually the animation and basically making dots animation is actually quite tricky because dots does not have any uh builtin animation thing so I was experimenting with different things and basically this is the option that I'm going to have which is I basically just baked a bunch of meshes and then using dots I'm basically just going to swap out those meshes one for the other and that's how I'm going to end up uh implementing the animation in the course so so yeah that was uh so basally still going through the Prototype the research stage so in terms of time no idea maybe just uh I don't know maybe maybe late next month something like that uh I don't know but it's going to be some quite a bit yeah oh hey Mia hey how's it going nice just woke up yeah really it's a midday 40 here it's always quite interesting how there are so many so many different time zones people from all over the place it's always a a fun thing to see I believe Minecraft also runs heavily on a TI system oh is it oh that is cool yeah I mean the game does have a huge world and especially when I have a built world with tons of tons of things all over the place with tons of redstone then yeah I guess they would need some kind of take system in order to make it quite a bit more efficient buing a game using construct 3 is it easy to transition from construct 3 to Unity really don't know how to code well I I've never used construct so I don't know exactly what is the thing but so do you just use visual things because if you just use visual things Unity also has visual scripting in fact I actually have an entire course so I'm making three separate games using nothing but visual scripting so I'm a I'm a big fan of visual scripting I think it's really awesome as a learning tool because basically by learning visual scripting you're essentially also learning programming because visual scripting is really just logic so if you use that as kind of like a stepping stone you can definitely learn quite a lot in terms of lodging that can be a good way to progress you from not knowing how to code to learning the basics of it so that can definitely help but at the same time you can also just make games entirely with visual scripting there are a bunch of games that work with those so so yeah I don't know the specifics about construct 3 but I would say definitely just just try it just uh open up Unity maybe go through my uh my uh kitchen chaos course which a lot of people have really enjoyed this one so maybe go through that one and try to see if you enjoy it and who knows maybe it's actually pretty easy to upgrade I'm not sure okay let me just let's try to take over a v oh my guy needs help okay let's go and try to give him some backup so he's against Leon the fighter okay let's see okay this game has nice game feel yeah I hope so that was definitely something that I spent quite a lot of time making it satisfying of the uh the combat system the movement The Dashing and so on that was definitely something that I worked very hard on and honestly I really enjoy it just playing it right now uh it's been 70 years pretty much since I last played this game and I am enjoying it so I think that is definitely good news and even the mechanics oh crap oh crap there's way too many guys so yeah I do think the game has a really nice design for all of those dodging them trying to stop boom nice okay there goes the hero let me go here go boom nice now just sto The Archers come here nice oh I got a 54 combo oh is there another her oh no it's nice Okay cool so I lost 14 guys and uh really so my Ally only took out one guy well I think he took out the hero so I guess I guess that kind of Mak sense okay let me do some upgrades what can I upgrade oh Army size would be nice but oh this one takes two but yeah I do want more more combos I think that's fun and down here oh the worldwind I really enjoyed making this one yeah this was definitely a fun one oh and the flurry this one is really awesome for attacking the enemies bues Dash bars uh oh let's go with Whirlwind and one of Spike cuz I really enjoy the I really enjoy the spike let me just oh my gu is continuing to attack damn he only has three guys why oh no it's the other one so why is he oh there's another one crew the bond okay let's try to do that very familiar with Thor from Pirate software seeing you two talk The Game Dev having come from very different path I've definitely seen a lot of his uh shorts he's constantly on my shorts feed and yeah it's always it's always really enjoyable to hear what he has to say cuz yeah he definitely did take a very different path a path more of a triple A games with security and so on and yeah oh so yeah I definitely would love to talk to him someday cuz yeah definitely looks oh boy okay there's way too many nice okay down that one yeah okay use one more niceoo cool uh's that recently started your kitchen chos course nice is there a reason you created the Caps CL by code rather than just attaching it as a component was it because the movement uh BAS the answer is there are many many ways that you can always make uh pretty much any kind of system there are always a million ways to make it so technically yes you can just uh you can use a um a character controller the buwi one or you can do it via VIA just having the coll and listen to collisions or you can do it the way that I did by doing a a ray cast box cast you can do basically all of those are valid options all of those can can achieve the exact result uh so yeah in my case we only just uh personal preference I like doing a rast in order to find where are the things well actually the main thing that I like to use is actually to use physics and move it with physics and that way you don't have to deal with cisions but for that game I want for that uh for that course I want to make then the followup course using multiplayer and multiplayer using physics makes everything quite a bit more tricky so that is why I intentionally went with an option that does not use physics so that is why I that is why I went with that option of just sing the boxcast and so on but yeah pretty much you can do uh always remember there are many many way to solve pretty much any problem is that guy still fighting oh no he's getting more reinforcements okay let's attack that Village is that wind sound effect also used in battle round Tycoon good question maybe it is I don't actually that might actually very well be the case yeah I've reused tons of things in many of my games so anytime that I need sound effect or visuals or so on yeah I definitely I definitely oh that's a nice big map okay team X go there team y go there and yeah it should go through that one uh so yeah basically reusing tons of stuff is always one great way to be a lot more efficient boom give him a nice stun and don't take care of him there's another one up here take him out let me go up here oh there's actually the guy okay let me try soloing The Village Captain okay let actually just take down the minions first boom nice okay okay now let me solo this guy obviously I got to hit him on the other side otherwise oh YX y y nice see I I don't remember how long it took me to come up with the the combat system for the heroes but honestly I really enjoying I think it is still really nice ah crap messed up do I have a healing oh nice okay so my guys are now yeah they should be destroying that one and then come over here right uh would be really cool if you make a tutorial of this game I mean many of the elements over here I've covered in many many places so like the one that I uh talked a while ago the one about the hit counter so the hit counter that I use for the uh every time uh hit something so here I've got a hit counter of three so I've done that one for the character controller in 2D so yeah this one is basically the exact same controller that I'm using over here so yep this one is made using physics just move the character and so on it's actually using the exact same Sprite so you can see those are the same Sprites so so yeah many of the things here and for the animation system uh cuz I was telling you a while ago how the uh not animation mesh the mesh animation system so basically the way that this game is so performant with so many units at oh crap he respawned uh basically the way this is so performant with that many units at once is because of this mesh animation system so so yeah basically many of the systems that I'm using in this game I've covered in various tutorials long time ago can you speak Portugal Portuguese sure yeah so speak Brazilian uh I don't know what what are the specific Brazilian things I mean Brazilian Portuguese are very similar so so yeah basically by speaking Portuguese if you are Brazilian hopefully you can understand me uh oh crap no ah crap take out this guy okay nice all right good are that you're awesome keep up the great work nice thank you uh would you make a tutorial on how to make tutorials in your general process behind the scenes that is an interesting one I have thought about that topic several times before but it's also a very oh yeah they're going to reinforce I forgot about that uh yeah that is an interesting topic but it's one of those it's kind of like optimization which is an interesting topic but it's really tricky to to make a compelling video about it so yeah in terms of the process for how do I make tutorials I'm not sure how how good that video would be in terms of being a compelling thing to watch and to watch and and enjoy and learn something from it cuz yeah it's a very very Niche thing so but yeah it is definitely oh reinforced nice uh so yeah definitely one idea that I've had many many times but yeah if I can fix figure out some way to make it compelling engaging then yeah maybe one day oh Spike boom nice take him out take him out take him out no that guy uh yxy triple leg niceo how old is this game yep 7 years old so say when was this back in yep May of 2017 oh it's actually literally I didn't even notice but yeah I guess it is literally seven years and one day on I didn't even I totally didn't even notice that but yeah apparently came out in 19 of May so yeah literally like seven years and one day ago so yeah that was that was fun did you ever get deep into Shader and techart uh not deep I mean I've made basically just the just the basics of it so anytime I need Shader fact I learned how to do it but yeah I don't normally don't normally do shaders for fun I do them to learn something and that's oh yeah right I forgot that I can upgrade totally forgot about the upgrades and why is my guy constantly getting into fights okay let's help him how old have you been when your first TNT project I mean I made my first TNT project one wasn't like in oh that he's firing a warwind uh so I got into unity in 2012 so I guess by then I would have been like 25 I don't know I I can't do math this is way too much pressure uh oh so but yeah it was in 25 uh uh it was in uh 2012 and I'm currently 35 right now so I don't know you do you do the math I don't know I don't know how old that was um does this game use dots nope this was back in 2017 where dots was not a thing so nope does not use oh look at that I've got quite a bit of M quite a bit of gold so let's hire another one lance to Fearless okay and for Lance let me okay so he's defending that one and Lance yeah you start both of you start attacking that one so you go that one you go that one okay all right and for the village yeah let me upgrade oh yeah how much can I upgrade oh level three okay nice that is cool and on this one can I upgrade okay just got 100 bucks and do I got any upgrades uh oh Max friendly nights oh nice the over map speed so many things are oh gold per unit this always something that I I love in pretty much every game basically any kind of upgrade that gives you either more gold or more experience that is always something that I love so definitely going to pick that up and for the upgrades uh B can be fun okay let's try bolt you make the overall maps in this game seems like good video idea for King Town Maps if you're planning an RTS series uh for this one I mean the map is pretty simple it's literally just a huge map and the camera is zoomed out then for the fog of war that one is basically a camera looking down rendering onto texture and then each unit has a circle around it so basically that's how it sees the uh basically that's how the fog of War extends and uh reveals which is actually something that I'm going to cover in the RTS course so that that is one of the things that I still have on my two research phase I'm still not sure cuz there are many many ways that you can do fog of War so that is one of the things that I don't know uh still don't know exactly what method I'm going for but yeah definitely I want to cover that in there let me just attack those guys when do you stop updating a game with content when do you decide that you did enough for it uh I mean that depends on what exactly is your goal like uh is your goal just are you just enjoying making the game or are you doing it for some kind of financial success cuz basically what ever you answer that is going to depend boom nice it's going to depend how much you do so do you want to just do bups I mean I always encourage you to do bug fixes like if the game has some bugs that you can fix definitely go ahead and fix them so don't move on to another game until the game is at least solid but beyond that in terms of adding extra content it depends do you want to continue working on it yes or no and if so then definitely do uh keep adding on to it but yeah cuz like on this game I actually also experiment with making some some DLC for it it was pretty much the only time that I uh tried it out just doing some simple basically extra modes tried out some free DLC and some pay DLC just to see how it would go and it was an interesting thing trying to make that but yeah in terms of conversion didn't really convert too much so it was an interesting experiment but yeah in terms of DLC really need a really massive user base in order to make it worthwhile for the uh DLC but it's a it's an interesting thing again depends if your goal is just to have fun then yeah maybe constantly adding more content that could be quite fun quite interesting uh Val ability creates a large green Cloud area of smoke the area changes shape depending on position deployed could this be done with some kind of mesh generation I haven't played valant so I'm not sure but isn't like the um the uh smoke grenade then smoke grenade Counter Strike too cuz that was an interesting one that was basically uh doing oh yeah I think ice R did a video on that so that was quite interesting um see basically basically how the how the smoke expands so that is basically using voils in order to figure out what is the area that the smoke can expand to so I don't know if valant is similar to that but yeah this actually this one of those systems that I would love to spend some time just research just for fun because yeah do seem quite interesting yeah put out the smoke and it acally grows the voxel and so on yeah definitely I've got tons of ideas that I'd love to do in terms of voxel game development all kinds of systems that you can do with boxel that is actually quite something that I would love to try out okay let me just grab some some extra guys and let me actually upgrade this one hey got another Village oh this guy's attacking a tower by himself okay let's give him some help uh okay so let's go ahead and yeah just both of you go there just straight up and let's see okay they got 65 guys oo nice oh it's a tower I to only oh oh yeah that's my that's my guy doing that okay good okay the captain and he's got a deflect and mortars oh crap he hit me okay take him out take him out y y YX oh YX y y nice and all these guys in a row boom nice I still haven't tried the let me do the worm wind so let's ex boom nice oh crap oh crap oh crap don't only forgot how did I die okay I got the second chance nice get out okay I have no idea did I I get oh I think I was getting hit by the Yeah by the tower I totally missed that I'm make sure not to die and just do a little bit of healing okay take more out okay that was tricking a crap another one hit me yeah I forgot that getting hit by by arrows actually causes uh let me try just deflect all the arrows so my guys can finally do it there's the captain out out nice okay there you go game Jam wi I would love to that's definitely one of the things that I've thought about doing many many times before but yeah organization is really tricky so I would love to do to organize a game Cham at some point but yeah got to figure out how can I organize it how can I make it interesting fun and doable so yeah definitely an idea that I've had many many times oh are they attacking my this one fighting a bunch of people fighting here uh see eventually I definitely would like to uh do a game jam oh crap do I this gu qu okay two guys okay crap a crap cuz there's two of them that's freaky [ __ ] boom okay y y XX oh oh crap another one oh boy oh oh boy do I have to retreat oh crap oh oh am I out of guys where my where's all my guys go go go get out oh no no okay I suffer the defeat okay get away get awayo that was tricking ah just oh crap they're going let me pick up some guys from here that was that was tricky uh you think compete shaders are outdated due to render Pipeline and Shader graph uh not really I mean compete shaders are great whenever you need insane performance they're really tricky to to build but yeah you definitely need uh definitely need insane knowledge to make them but no they don't really uh get replaced by R Pipeline and Sh I mean if you if you want to make something insanely efficient then using computer shaders is definitely the way to go that's actually an an uh a topic that I've wanted to research for a long time CU yeah you can do a lot of really interesting stuff with comput Traders so yeah how do you create the animated people below you mean the uh little overlay I actually do have multiple tutorials on that so if you want go on to that page and at the very bottom you can see so basically this down here the characters this is a transparent UT window so I cover that in this tutorial then the way the characters move about and animate these are mesh B animations and the way that it's interacting with YouTube API is through an HTP request from inside unity and the characters themselves the way they are random is exactly the same way that I did in my game battle round Tycoon for the GU spres so yeah if you want to learn how to do this thing just follow these four tutorials and you'll get there okay let's see if I don't hold this one okay ah crap messed up go this come oh it's not the healing no no oh crap I messed up boom nice okay oh that I got a combo of 80 nice be interesting to see you remake this with what you know now including a nemesis system for captains yeah that would definitely that would definitely be fun I would I would definitely love to I would love to be able to find a time machine in order to in order to be able to pursue all of the various projects that I very much would like to do so yeah remaking this game would definitely be quite fun oh yeah let's do the Inspire they move and attack faster so that is always really good to bed have a great night yeah have a great night thanks for thanks for being here uh is that guy attack oh no he's grabbing units okay that makes sense oh there's a lot of guys here oh okay let's try fighting a bunch of them okay let's see Leon the fighter and he's got hert shatter okay okay stop let me do a ah crap I thought I had enough I don't oh Spike boom nice uh what is it the worm wind boom nice okay take them out take him out take them out okay just I just stun them all woo nice that was cool can you open this in the editor just to see how things are organized uh I do have the project files but I don't think I have an editor version that can open them so that could be fun trying to uh try opening these own projects in a recent un version see how it works that that could be could be an interesting one so yeah I definitely have to spend some time doing that basically uh converting the the games because yeah I still have all the source files all the things so that could be uh quite interesting okay someone is still fighting here why are you fighting there's a book called the unity Shader Bible yeah I've heard great things about that book I haven't read it myself but yeah from what I from what I've read the feedback seems to be very positive so if you want to uh study on shaders then yeah definitely get the unity Shader bball which seems like a great book to learn from okay oh nice okay let's try attacking another Another Castle actually okay it's kind of I guess it's one thing that I would wish I had made for this game some kind of Zoom because I can't see just how many fights are having here so apparently Leon the fighter he's there crew the ball he's got 40 guys for the patient so who is my other guy attack attacking I don't know okay let's go with the the biggest one and try to see if we can win this okay there screw the bones prepare to die oh get out oh crap yeah okay like that like that nice take him out good nice okay you take out that guy who W can I get the uh bolt y yxx boom nice woo okay come on pick out this guy nice woo oh I still lost 20 guys that was quite a bit okay so cuz I want to attack the can't I attack the I don't remember if I have to take down all things before the castle guess let's try fitting this one and see mod games what feature do you look at thinking I have no idea how to make that how is a very good question uh I don't actually know I mean there are lot of things in which I have no idea how it's done but I have a rough idea on how they could be done mainly all kinds of things of being like [ __ ] effects and all kinds of things so yeah I'm not a Shader expert so if you ask me to do some kind of weird Shader effects like for example the uh the uh Two Worlds that exist in that level in Titanfall 2 that looks like a really awesome Shader effect really awesome thing so I have a rough idea for how that could be done but doing it specifically not quite but yeah in general any kind of thing that I have no idea how to do that is uh that's an interesting question because for me usually whenever I see some kind of mechanic I know how how I could have done it I don't know exactly how it might have been done but I can always figure out some uh some kind of way for how I could do something like that so so yeah I don't know cuz basically when you have enough programming knowledge everything is really just a combination of different systems so so yeah basically for me whenever I see some kind of game I can always sort of figure out how might this thing be be done so okay I need a lot more guys grab bunch more guys cuz those are constantly reinforcing okay so I got to defeat them very quickly in order to take down that castle okay yes Frederick go ahead oh okay nice nice okay go come on nice okay all right that was good I don't think I lost many guys K let me uh yxx oh this one is a tricky one YX uh x y y nice you're feeling that knowing how to make stuff ruins the mystery and wonder like learning how magic tricks start honestly no I know a bunch of people do feel that way uh fact I saw a post like just a few weeks ago talking about some I don't know some redit post on some guy who was in extr movies and felt that seeing things behind the scenes kind of ruins the magic of movies but for me I've never really felt that I can I can play a game I can think to myself okay I can I understand how this whole thing works in the background but I can still really enjoy it so yeah that is definitely one of those uh personal things for some people that really bothers them but for me no for me I really I enjoy learning how things are done and I let me take out I think I need to take out the rest before I can go there uh so yeah for me I I can enjoy playing it while also thinking about how it might have been done background so for me basically seeing uh how the sausage is made does not really bother me at all so yeah I guess that's a I guess that's a good thing so it does not does not impact my enjoyment of all kinds of games so yeah a crap crap way too many crap I'm taking so much damage on Boom nice oh man they're quite a lot of them okay take out nice ooo nice okay good just can I get a little bit of healing nice my favorite TNT devs hey nice hey thanks for being here Jen that's cool Trav or attempt to do VR Dev uh no not exactly I've done some research for it in fact I was actually going to uh make a tutorial on it I was actively doing the research in order to make tutorial but then I I got way too busy cuz unit6 came out so I started doing research on the dot scores so I kind of had to push back that that go with that uh VR tutorial so yeah I haven't done any serious VR work but I definitely would like to uh cuz yeah it's a very interesting area I think it's a great area I think it's something that is uh growth is definitely very slow definitely takes quite a oh I need to upgrade to get more Knights where's my Knights Max friendly Knights okay um so yeah growth in VR has been slow but I do think it's a really awesome area and I do think it is something that will increase over time so oh yeah I told them to come here and attack this one so let me try let's go to this one with 90 okay I think this is going to be tricky so let's see uh so yeah I haven't really spent much time in VR but definitely is something that I would like to experiment because I do enjoy playing VR games whenever I whenever I get to do them so learning how they work would also be very fun okay one goes there one goes there oh yeah I did oh I may the Inspire but I don't start okay let me get some combo bars a crap ah just one more okay for all of you let me Inspire oh I need two combo bars in our to inspire okay uhoh another guy joined it's going to be tricky oh crap I shouldn't have split them up okay you both of you go onto that one because I don't think I got enough guys to be able to okay stop hitting my guys all right me just try to protect them okay he stop stop stop o nice okay one more oh yeah I think I can can I damage no yeah but I think with Earth shatter I can damage buildings on take out that let me do the Inspire so a y y a okay nice they go ahead take out all that Oh Captain what is he doing oh I think he was doing Inspire boom oh there he goes oh he's got a lightsaber that's nice okay Outpost Captain I don't know what you're doing but oh oh go go go go boom nice okay I've got to take him out oh x x nice okay good good good oh boy these are way too many guys okay good nice both of you attack there yeah first they have to Le rush or it's Prett Calon for you and don't stress on making a patch of first day uh usually my extreme stress comes on the day before it's like on on dinky Gardens my last game I worked like I don't know I think I worked like 16 hours on literally day before release so yeah for me usually it's really stressful constantly thinking about things but after it's out as long as I did a good job be before it and the game is stable as long as I do that then I can not necessarily relax too much but definitely uh be a bit more calm so yeah for me usually day before really stressful and then the day of release things do calm down a little bit okay go ahead keep defending my guys PR dots how would you approach projectile Trails that's actually a good qu okay a y y a uh projectile Trail is actually a good question that is one thing that I still haven't uh research in my prototype is how do you handle oh crap how do you hand on trail effects oh crap no guy um so yeah cuz I don't think that the trail oh crap another guy oh boy this is going to be tricky uh cuz I don't think that uh the trail render has that support although I haven't tried it so I don't know but yeah I think basically I will have to manually try to build the projectile Trails would you look into build board Sprites as an option yeah probably I mean I think if it doesn't support the trail run by default then then basically you have to create your own trail render so basically you have to create the dynamic mesh and then updating that Dynamic mesh updating the vertices that should be very easy so it's quite annoying to not have a builtin way as far as I know again I haven't tried it but if you do but basically trails are really just meshes and you can very easily create thousands of meshes update vertices on dots so it requires an interesting uh different way of implementing it but hopefully that can definitely quite work asset makers take an idea of Trail R for Dots yeah I guess that would be a good idea cuz I have no idea when uh when oh Trail R Works in dots oh doesn't oh okay so if so then that is awesome so is the issue just in terms of performance oh okay so yeah like I said I haven't yet uh researched that oh crap researched oh no no no no okay let me just let me do some healing so I don't die uh yeah cuz I have no okay that was is way too optimistic trying to take down that castle by myself that was definitely quite tricky okay I need to generate more converts gold into units faster okay so yeah I've got to upgrade this guy can I upgrade this guy oh that one just holds more units uh okay me is really just Dynamic mesh yeah exactly so yeah moving the vertices yourself is annoying but it can be done so yeah so if it is Implement by dots I'm very curious to to try out and see exactly what is the uh limitation for it yeah how do you organize accur packs do you copy the items you need into dedicated folders in your project if so how do you handle updates and dependencies uh for me usually the thing that I do is basically import the entire asset pack onto a separate project then I basically export a Unity package on just on just uh the things that I need and then basally so I made a video on that but I'm trying to remember what was the name uh oh crap what did I call it it was like keep your project there you go keep your project clean with no unused assets so basically that's my process basically import like a giant asset pack onto a separate project that just has the assets then I pick up the one or two prefabs that I want and I export just that onto my thing so yeah in terms of updating yeah that's uh usually I just get normally uh Vision things so I normally don't do too much updating but if I did then yeah I I guess I would do the same thing so basically update it there and then uh copy it back and in terms of organizing I don't know if that was also what you were asking but uh asset store.com uh in terms of organizing Assets in case you buy assets from lots of plac oh yeah by the way this thing is still live like if you not asset s asset inventory if you like me have a bunch of of assets from various humble modles and so on and you want to organize how you keep track of all those assets that you bought from various places then I can high recommend this asset I've picked this one up and it's really awesome you can basically import all the N packages that you bought in in various places like for example the cinti store is currently having a a sale so if you buy things over here then you can import them into the asset inventory and that basically helps you manage all kinds of things and actually C store I think this is the link so in case you want to buy any low poly acids then check out that that link that's my affiliate link so if you pick up anything I get a nice commission and you get some really awesome assets so yeah those are all really nice is there genre you do not enjoy playing uh I would say uh puzzle games that are way too difficult basically I suck at puzzle games so for me if it is something very very difficult very complex then I'm definitely not going to enjoy it so yeah puzzle games I suck at them I'm not good at thinking about it and oh I did not know why did I did I I don't know why the beginning of the game is being so difficult so so yeah puzzle games where I suck the witness I haven't tried it but yeah I assume when I play it it will probably not be a super enjoyable experience although I've also heard that one starts with a very nice smooth uh difficulty curve so yeah it kind of depends on how intense Oh no I got three squads nice it kind of depends on how int in is the difficulty curve cuz like for example portal I really love portal it's one of the best games of all time and technically it's kind of a puzzle game but it's not a very intense puzzle game but all those things that are like there's tons of like uh platformer puzzle games yeah I really do not enjoy those just because I really suck at them it's really difficult so yeah for me usually that's the thing or things like for example visual novels with a ton of reading ton of stuff like I don't enjoy uh doing a ton of L reading in in game so those are roughly the genres that I don't enjoy but at the same time there are so many that I do enjoy so it's not really a problem winess is hard to 100% oh yeah I imagine to get to 100% that would be extremely difficult yeah oh there you go nice they took him out let's see if now I can finally take this guy out crap don't me group them up together and it's the warwind boom nice okay good all of you when you are done go there uh where was I when you finally make your build do un not remove all the unused uh yep it does so what I was saying what I was saying a while ago about importing onto a separate project and then come back that is really just to help you keep yourself organized as you are building game because yeah when you make a build it does not matter if you have gigabytes of Assets in your project they will not be included in the build so it's really just something to organize yourself as you are building the game hey Christian hey thanks so much for the uh super sticker real nice real nice thank you yeah thank you to you all right uh oh crap I'm almost about to die go go boom nice that was cool okay I need the a little bit of healing okay a crap no no no boom nice oh man this is being really difficult woo go o wait this was a tricky where oh my guys decided to go to the other side that is why I'm alone here okay oh come on they've got a bunch more my guys are constantly dying no stop defend oh crap no no no get done okay yeah I really need a bigger Army in order to fight these guys a crap no no no no don't hit my guys okay this I don't think this is going to end well oh yeah I think I really need to no no no no and there's another guy coming in so nope also going to lose this one no oh the game is more difficult than I remember H that's fun by boom nice that was cool boom nice yeah I won't be able to take down this guy so difficult no okay so I think I probably need to uh give more backup to my guys so I so I don't keep uh doing that uh get much thought to games and influences other than video games chess Sudoku board games D andd Etc that is interesting uh I mean everything can be an an inspiration so for me I don't necessarily play many board games so not quite that but anytime I'll watch some kind of interesting movie some kind of interesting uh show I always think about turning some of those elements into gamees so yeah that would be uh yeah in terms of board games not so much but pretty much anything that I do I'm constantly thinking of game ideas game things so yeah definitely inspiration can come from pretty much anywhere so yeah ever make a mod for a game nope not really uh I did make a few things with uh with hammer back in the day I made a few Uh custom Counter Strike Maps but no never made anything too intense so it's uh something it's been three years since I started working on un project before I knew the size grown to 250 gigs wow wondering should I delete the library depends if you are using it or not I mean but yeah that that definitely means you've got a mountain of uh a mountain of assets within that project so are you using all of them I'm guessing probably not but at the same time trying to figure out which ones you're using I think yeah I actually don't know if the the asset that I was showing you a while ago asset inventory if that one does does tell you what assets you're currently using I actually don't know but you can use the uh un build size report I always forget where this one is but Unity has a it's not a build resport basically when you make a build you can look in the is it this no that's the package uh build report I think just build report basically when you make a build you can go onto your editor folder and you can see there's a text found there so showing the logs for the uh for the build and it's going to show all the s that you're using and all thing so I guess yeah build report but but I'm looking for the uh the text file so I don't know but yeah I'm guessing you're not actually using those those 250 gigs so yeah definitely try to do game is addicting oh yeah I'm I'm glad you're enjoying it so it's definitely I'm enjoying playing it again so yeah you make good money from Dev uh yeah I mean it took me a very long time like I started making Flash games in 2008 and took me like four or five years until I got to the point where I was making minimum wage minimum wage here in Portugal so I was making like uh 400 bucks a month so yeah definitely took me quite a while but yeah that was since I've been doing this for I mean since 2008 that was what like 17 years I don't know I I can't do math now but yeah it's been a very long time since I've been doing Game Dev so yeah through that time my definitely took me quite a long time to to grow my skills and start earning enough to pay for uh my own living but yeah nowadays thankfully things are going quite well going try Unity 6 with all new features making a video about that I definitely would like to that's one of the things that I oh that's one of the things that I have on my to do list but at the same time right now I'm so busy trying to do research for the dots course so so that's on my queue but not sure if SL when I'll be able to get it but yeah I I very much want to try out a crap no no no no no I very much want to try out the uh new graphics features cuz I haven't used them yet and they look quite interesting so oh no no no no no uh so yeah I very much would like to try that out and see how they work because at least on paper they do seem very useful uh are you planning your next team game uh not yet although I would like to go go back to Total World Liberation uh later on this year yeah thanks so much Christian for the super chat um later this year total World Liberation Liberation there you go so yeah I'm still a huge fan of this idea oh look at that Rel dat yeah I'm not sure it's going to be uh in 24 but yeah I I announced this game like over a year ago but yeah then I had to switch gears I had to switch into something a bit more simple but yeah I I'm still a big fan of the of this game idea the whole thing So the plan is on the later half of this year like I don't oh crap am I dying y from uh on the later half of this year to get back into that game so hopefully uh I won't be able to do that cuz that would be that would be quite fun um are you doing good from games revenue or more from YouTube I mean for the past oh there you go uh oh I got so many points uh for the past I don't know like three or four years I've been focusing much more on YouTube than than on Game Dev so basically when I started this channel back in 2018 it was uh like 100% my income from from there and 0% from YouTube and over time since I've been focusing more on YouTube it's kind of been flipping around so but nowadays uh my games still sell uh quite a little bit which is actually fun uh so so yeah nowadays definitely uh make more from the YouTube side like uh YouTube affiliate links courses and so on nowadays I make more from that than from my games with my games they still that's the great thing about when you make a game is basically the game stays there for for a oh the passive bonuses nice uh when you make a game basically the game stays there it continues making money for a long time automatically so that's actually one of the one of the fun things oh let me upgrade that's nice uh so yeah okay let me just I've got yeah let me upgrade Spike to the max cuz Ione like Spike it's simple and interesting oh let me also upgrade the hry or the Earth shatter cuz this can actually damage buildings nice that's okay that's exactly what I want nice how show that kind of Clips is it video files are you talking about the upgrade uh yep that is the video player empty video player where you can basically play a video and you can play it anywhere so in this case I'm basically playing the video in some UI component so so I recorded some video of the various upgrades and all and all those things that they do then yeah just have a video player and surrendering the video directly on that thing so that is actually something that is really awesome I really enjoyed uh making that when I made the uh the upgrade system because took me quite a while to get this UI and yeah when I when I figured out that I could use a little video in order to Showcase what the upgrades actually do that definitely helped quite a bit so yeah definitely video player if you don't know about it definitely use it and I'm pretty sure I have a lecture on it in my ultimate unity overview course so if you have this one then go ahead and check out because I'm pretty sure I do have a lecture on the video player don't I pretty sure I do video play yep I do so there you go lecture 16 on the video player super simple to use and super helpful super useful hard is create something multiplayer in dots that's a good question I haven't yet looked into uh net code for game objects I mean they made an entire tool stack specifically for that specifically for making multiplayer with net uh specially for making multiplayer with entities so technically they are working very hard on making a tool for that making the tool nice and usable but I have haven't uh tried it myself so I don't know the specifics I have no idea if it is super easy super hard but hopefully it should actually be uh quite quite usable oh that's a nice map okay let's go all those guys go like that uh I thing after completing your 10 hours which course will you recommend me uh if you want to oh let me just pause if you want something on more of the uh more advanced level then I would definitely say check out my turn based strategy course that one is really awesome if you want something more intermediate SL advanc but if you want to stick on the beginner side then I would just recommend you just do a ton of uh small projects so I always recommend build something like Flappy Bird something like Missile Command something like PacMan Space Invaders do those super basic games and if you make those you will gain quite a lot of put a lot of knowledge so yeah if you don't have money then definitely go ahead and do that and go ahead and watch my my uh uh C uh free videos if you want something so C so go watch I've got the intermediate and the beginner the complete courses all the video lectures are free over there on YouTube so if you want something definitely go ahead and follow that one okay let me just right oh the village Captain all right take out all of you boom nice and all of you go like that and now I've got Earth shatter so that should help okay let me do earth shatter what is it yxx y boom nice okay that's going to help oh okay nice okay nice all this okay good let me use the Earth shatters so that's yxx y did hell divers steal your button combo system does Hell divers have a button com I haven't played it yet so I don't know but uh I'm pretty sure there are many combo systems so I definitely wouldn't say that but yeah it's something that I really enjoy I definitely enjoy making the combos from here I mean I think my original idea was like from uh fighting games which always have interesting combos so so yeah it's definitely something something oh look that reinforcement uh yeah if you want to make something more interesting definitely make a lot of uh combo systems always take inspiration from pretty much anywhere you can find it okay my X let me just boom nice ah no okay warwind warwind boom nice okay nice take down all of them nice okay nice ni plan on doing the 20 Game Challenge soon to shake off some of my r my skills oh what is the 20 Game Challenge is that making 20 games that sounds like a very interesting challenge yeah I mean making 20 games will definitely teach you quite a lot uh cuz yeah basically I'm big believer in experience constantly learning new things so yeah if you make 20 games you will gain a massive amount of experience so definitely that definitely sounds like an interesting challenge okay let's go ahead send them all all of you go up oh yeah and I can't oh I can't use Inspire I need to do things okay okay let me gain Just One More Bar be able to use Inspire okay let me inspire all these guys so a y y a boom nice Oh Captain okay boom nice nice okay take out the captain X oh there's so many okay okay go we win boom nice that's always enjoyable all right okay I'm always taking way too much damage okay what is the earth shatter yxxy boom nice okay do another Earth shatter oh no no no no no a crap yxx y boom nice come on take out that guy oh no no no no no no oh crap oh boy that was annoying um playing the game for almost 1 hour is only worth it nice I'm glad that I'm glad you're enjoying the G that's cool uh you ever triy playing lethon company uh no not not really I mean I my playing habits are very random so it's really hard to find something that depends on other people but yeah i' I've seen about the game does look like a very interesting design very very compelling so I mean definitely a lot of people love it so it can definitely work oh you cannot construct over map buildings okay I forgot I forgot about this feature okay oh yeah I can create the trets and the mons again oh nice okay oh yeah to oh crap I probably should not have built a tret there but oh that my guys took over the region well that's nice that's cool okay yeah they took cover but this thing is now going to be attack so let me actually I got to clear up these guys quickly so that they don't take over my castle do you provide mentorship uh not really I'm already insanely busy with so many things I would love to cuz in idea uh in theory it sounds really awesome being able to actually Mentor someone but yeah finding the time for it is quite tricky I'm already super busy with so many things that I want to do so doing something that is oneonone with a single person it sounds really awesome in theory but yeah finding as with so many things finding time for it is always the tricky part oh nice okay cool there was another one right there okay let's take out this guy so that my Outpost is nice and safe when you play your own games what is something that you know would do better or change in death terms that's a very good question uh I don't know cuz honestly I'm really enjoying playing this game so I don't know I mean I think I would uh I think I would improve like adding a bit more life to the levels like the levels are a bit too empty like it's got some the Sprites are nice but they're a bit too empty I mean there's just some random bushes in the background everything is green everything is super basic so I would definitely add a little bit more variety on there over here on this Victory screen I would probably make it a bit more flashy for all the all the bars increasing so I add a little bit of Polish onto that but yeah I don't know on this game I'm still very happy with how it came out nowadays so yeah I'm not sure I would change too many things on on this one I mean the main thing is nowadays I would probably do it in not necessarily in 3D but do that 2 and a2d style so I would make the characters still in 2D but put the Waring 3D add some really nice uh depth field uh Shader effect and I think that would actually make the game look quite a lot better and send out quite a bit so but yeah there's always many things you can improve on pretty much any game you make if you come back to it in the future you can always think of ways that could be done better and hopefully over time you are gaining the skill so your Gam are constantly hopefully improving so yeah um I'm being honest the UI visuals are one of the weakest aspect in your games mostly black boxes yeah I'm definitely not skilled at uh creating UI can I just okay let me give some units just to make sure this one doesn't have uh yeah UI is definitely not my strong point so for me yeah UI is definitely usually very big like over here it's just a nice texture that I I don't know that I picked up from some random asset pack in order to get the in order to get oh crap there are no more units uh just uh oh crap they're attacking that no no no no uh hey you stop attacking that uh so yeah but that also comes with uh my lack of uh knowledge my lack of ability of being able to see what is what looks good what does not look good so so yeah in theory I can I can definitely see that my UI is not as good as many other games but I don't have enough of a critical artist Eye in order to be able to see what I would change about it so yeah that is definitely one of those things where collaborating with an artist can help quite a lot because it's someone else who has a different View and can definitely see things that I can't really see for myself so okay most woo nice uh I want see M you offering to do translation for Norwegian for free I don't know if you saw the email I sent to you even though it was a long while uh I don't know I maybe I saw it maybe not I don't know it's a I get so many emails I try to go through all of them but yeah there are some that every once in a while I don't uh I read them and then I forget that I read them and then yeah but in terms of localization crap uh in terms of localization I normally try to keep a bunch of languages so that's the thing is that even if someone offers to do it for free having to set up all that can be quite a bit tricky so uh so yeah localization is a bit of a tricky thing okay hey again oh what time is it oh it's almost two oh crap I got to go eat lunch and take my dogs outside okay so just Le bit more uh at your ultimate M overview nice but it's on me is there a way I can transfer this to your website account uh there's no automatic way but send me an email uh and I will see so yeah definitely uh use the contact form or just email me directly the contact form on my on my website so you can go up here and let me know your email and then I will uh try to see because yeah I'm pretty sure that I can manually do that so yeah uh interestes in data management is the world map scene information always loaded as a Bas scene uh I don't remember the specifics for how I did it but yep it is always running CU if I if I go into a fight and I open up the map there I can see exactly what is going on on the Overworld so there's now that little 20 is coming out is going to reinforce that 42 is coming in so on so basically the entire world is constantly running but honestly I don't remember exactly how I implemented this I don't remember if I did kind of like I did on dink Guardians where I have just basic SE classes I don't know if that's how I implemented but yeah basically the entire world let's go worldwind boom nice uh so yeah I don't remember exactly how I implemented it but yeah I'm guessing all the logic is running all the time in order to be able to have those so yeah um I prefer the plan UI a lot of games now put too much info into UI yeah when it comes to UI design you can definitely go way to overboard and yeah there are some AAA games that have so many awesome animations but it looks really awesome but then it's very not very uh usable so yeah with UI you definitely have to balance that give the player a lot of information but don't overwhelm them with tons of things but also make it look good so yeah that that is that is why UI designer is an actual uh discipline it's an actual thing that people focus on doing just that all the time so yeah currently following your kitchen chaos course plus multiplier nice planing to watch your turnbas readyy course oh that's that's awesome yeah I that's a great learning plan and I hope you're learning quite a lot nice uh let me just crap isn't it triet oh I forgot that I had to manually build it I totally forgot about that okay let me just take out these guys see now talking a while ago about uh the things that I would change well right now playing the game I haven't played this game in like seven years so I don't remember all the mechanics and I totally did not notice how apparently I need to manually build the truchet so that is why that thing was not building I thought it was just time base but nope I have to manually build it so so yeah clearly that means that part is not very well explained because well because I didn't think about it I didn't think that I had to manually build it so I would definitely add some kind of indicator saying you need to build this especially if the player does not build for for some time at a little notice saying you have to interact with it in order to build it okay let me actually Army size yeah I think that would be nice I got two more oh building speed well that would be good oh and the building upgrades nice I forgot about that yeah right cuz I made different uh different units oh SC oh I can't afford that one so just minion upgrades uh let's go with the flurry so I can attack all the knights okay let me go into that one and just give away all these and hopefully okay that guy now that guy is chasing me okay fine let's fight okay I got to go in like 5 or 10 minutes so I'm already way too late and I haven't had lunch yet it's already 2 p.m. no no no nice go go go boom nice okay nice that was fast thing are you from Portugal so do you love Christian Ronald I'm actually not that much into football but sure he's one of the most uh successful football players in the world so yeah I guess a lot of people like him but yeah I'm not much into football so don't only have a a specific opinion on him yeah been helpful for Designing UI making mockups and they'll be Illustrated before important them in yeah definitely doing some prototype of the UI before you actually spend the time to build it that can definitely save you quite a lot of time so that is definitely a worthwhile thing right in the middle and warwind boom nice boom nice niceoo I only got seven guys left well boom when Rel the the advanced section of the C course I'm not sure I'm trying to right now split my time between doing research for the upcoming dots course and working on the advanced section for the cop course so I'm kind of jumping back and forth between those two so I don't know but I definitely plan to have uh another update I don't I was going to say by the end of this month but it's already like the 20th so I'm not sure but yeah definitely basally for the next update I want to cover specifically uh multithreading in C which is a very tough topic so yeah that one is definitely going to take quite a while to do a bunch of research on uh so yeah I don't know on exact timeline but I definitely very much uh want to get to it where are these guys constantly ah he destroyed my my cier okay let me destroy this guy then uh where was I did you make the Sprites for the rock trees building yourself nope I hired an artist to do all this so basically this uh oh yeah now I've got four teams that's nice uh basically I hired an artist for this game for doing oh can I no I can't uh hir an artist so all these uh Sprites for the for the the background the trees the main character I did do the ones for the minion characters so the tiny characters those are really uh super simple so I did those myself okay let me just do an inspire a y y a boom nice uh so yeah I did do those but for the for the tent I could not draw a tent like this for the little uh uh fire pit sort of thing for all the characters all the weapons all the ammo and so on for all these character sprites yep these were all contracted an artist to work on and and I'm very happy with the result yeah I think visually this game is one of the best games that I've made so I'm definitely quite happy with that okay put all in there and let's see can I promote my YouTube here uh nope cuz YouTube automatically deletes links so I would say don't try that because YouTube might might do something to your account YouTube really does not like links in the comments oh boy this is starting to become a big fight okay way too many people joining right now nice nice Frederick the patient and he's got a red lightsaber okay oh crew the Bal and he's got a nice axe boom okay nice you want to fight okay boom nice oh yeah I haven't tried out the flurry what's the flurry xyxy boom okay see now that that attack could use quite a bit more uh feedback quite a bit more game feel boom nice oh oh no no no no no uh b b a y a okay oh man that is way too many okay let me go next to all of them boom nice oh woo this is a tough fight no no no oh man I don't know ah crap where are all my units where are you why are you all Isle right here help me oh it's funny okay let me Inspire okay all of you go on get a nice buff go on help me boom nice got all these guys by myself okay there's another guy boy this was a big battle uh yxx x y y x YX yxx woo nice woo I killed 83 guys wow that was that was quite a lot that was quite a lot all right so yeah it's already to yeah I really gotta go I gotta say I really enjoyed playing this game so yeah this was definitely definitely fun make sure to save I mean it Autos saves but still yeah that was definitely quite fun could your grid system be used for procedural 3D match generation yep definitely I mean uh you can use it my mouse uh yeah you can definitely use it to do some like uh wave function collapse this is one way of doing procedural generation and this one is specifically based on having grids and position grids with different positions and then you randomize all kinds of things so you could definitely use this with with a grid system and for making it 3D yeah you can definitely have multiple grids stacked on top of one another and you could do all kinds of things so yeah I'm a huge fan of grd systems they are very capable very uh possible to do all kinds of things so yeah okay okay so yeah I really got to go cuz it's already 2 p.m. so anyways if any of you want to play the game it's currently on discount for another 4 hours and it's only it's only a buck at 75% off off so if any of you want to play it go ahead and play it it's a honestly it's a fun game I really I haven't played it in like seven years so I really enjoyed my time and I think I'm going to play a little bit more so who knows maybe I'll do another live stream in the middle of the of the week just playing for it having fun because it should be interesting what's your method regarding game design aspects like how do you create systems and balance them the answer is tons of iteration so I normally write down on paper what exactly kind of mechanics I would like to do and then I would oh for future s you should pin a comment oh that's a good idea I actually totally forgot that was a thing yeah thanks for the tip yeah I tot totally forgot that was saying uh so in terms of game design usually just start writing down on pieces of paper and then doing tons and tons of iteration lots of things so yeah okay so yeah I really got to go so I hope you all enjoy this uh this little live stream I hope it was fun for you it certainly was fun for me uh okay so I hope you have great rest of your day rest of your week and so on and let me put it like this and yeah all right so yeah have a great day and I will see you next time all right bye everyone bye
