hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and right now you can get three awesome particle facts completely for free and on top of that there's many other particle effects and other assets you can get for 50 off so for the free ones you've got the realistic particle effects it's got lots of interesting visuals a bunch of fire water all of them with a nice realistic scale then for something a bit more cartoony you've got the action rpg effects it's got lots of portals chess auras and so on and finally the aoe magic spells pack like name implies it's got lots of aoe spells so this one is perfect for any sort of fantasy game you can get these three commonly for free by using the coupon product on party all you need to do is just add them to your cart then during checkout apply the coupon in total will be zero this one is a pretty quick deal it ends already this weekend so definitely get it right away you can keep these assets forever personally i didn't have any of these three myself so i picked them up right away so go ahead and get them now but keep watching this video i'm going to show you how to upgrade some of these to urp okay so here i've imported them into my project i'm using unity twin 20.3 lts and the universal render pipeline now starting off with the action rpg effects pack as usual this pack starts off working with the builtin router pipeline by default but inside if you expand the folders you see an upgrades folder and inside you've got an unity package so just doubleclick and import this and it will be working in urp which is what i'm using here then you can just load up the demo scenes they've got tons of them so just load up demo one and as soon as you hit play you can already see a bunch of them working so here's a real nice chest a really nice move a bunch of auras bunch of icons a bunch of things all of them look really nice then down here you also got a bunch of buttons for swapping between each scene now this works by loading a scene so if you click on them you might see this error if so just go up here into file build settings and then just select all of your scenes and just click and drag them onto the build list so just for that you hit on play and now you can easily click on these buttons and load every single scene individual so with this you can see tons of stuff over here some really nice portals then you've got some really nice god rays a bunch of smoke and things there's a nice explosion then a bunch more things all of them looking quite mystical so perfect for any rpg then you've got some fire as well some rain a bunch more effects applied to a bunch of orbs as you can see tons of color variations then tons of circles lots of colors and a bunch more fires looking really nice a bunch of icons nice and shiny even some effects applied to some liquids and a bunch more nice explosions nice gathering power and so on so this one is really nice i'm a big fan of this type of style then the next pack is the aoe magic spells pack now for this one if you're using urp there's actually a text file so open up the demo folder and inside you see agrp and urp so it's a nice text file and over there you see a link where you can get the upgrade asset it's this one so just go ahead edit your assets and open it up in unity then you get this render pipeline support and all of these assets and just go ahead and unpack the one for the version you're using so over here i'm using unity 2020 and then once you unpack that just go up here into tools and open up the rp changer for the studio assets and just go ahead and click on the universal rp with that done you can now simply unload up the demo scene and now everything should look correct so you should be able to see all the effects but there's still one thing missing some postprocessing now this one does include a postprocessing profile but it's for the older postprocessing v2 which is meant to be used with the builtin render pipeline if you're using urp then it's using a different system so for that you just create an object and you add the volume component then you create the new post crossing profile and then you can just copy the effects from the included post crossing profile so just add a bunch of bloom color grading and so on so it's what i have here so i added a bit of volume a bit of color adjustment some contrast saturation and so on and with that yep all of these gorgeous effects are now fully working in urp and some of them also have sound which make them precomplete so they look really nice and they sound really good as well all of them got multiple color variations so you can easily change it so instead of a nice blue there you go nice green making it maybe a nice red there you go so all these are very adaptable and you've got all kinds of things so a bunch of things falling from the sky a bunch of really nice some explosions some more meteors falling a bunch of things falling from the sky a really nice particle explosion and so on all right so as you can see all of them look pretty nice so it's a great powder compact and finally for the realistic effects pack now this one has some gorgeous looking effects lots of them with some distortion which makes them look pretty great however one big downside is that these are made using the builtin runner pipeline and since most of these are custom shaders custom made shaders they don't automatically convert into urp so sadly that means that if you're making a game using urp then you can't easily use these ones now if you're a shader programmer yourself you might be able to convert the shaders directly all the files are included here so you can manually go and try to convert them now for me i'm not a shader program myself so i'm not sure just how difficult that is or maybe you can just open them in a project using the builtin writer pipeline which is what i'm using here and then simply have another project with urp and try and look at visually and convert them basically the only thing that does not work between the render pipelines is just a renderer so just the specific shaders that they're using so this specific shader does not automatically convert to urp but the particle system itself does work all the textures and so on all of those work so you really just need to convert the actual shader itself so anyways if you can convert it yourself or if you're making a game using the builtin runner pipeline then the effects themselves are pretty great this distortion effect especially looks really nice so you can see you've got all kinds of things a bunch of things coming out of the character then for this one a really nice healing effect and over here really nice laser then a character running and dropping some fire as he runs some more lasers a really nice explosion a really nice jet pack so as you can see tons of really nice really awesome so the ones on this pack look really nice just keep in mind that limitation all right so those are the three packs that you can get but then the sale also has tons more of them on sale of them at 50 off there's tons and tons of packs so i'm sure you'll find something specific for whatever you're looking for now most of them are particle effects but there's also a bunch of other things so for example right up here you see a really nice water rendering system so just in case you want to have some really nice real realistic water in your game there you go you can look into this one there's another one over here for some volumetric bullet fluids so if you got a very gory game this is also really awesome then a pack with some really nice muslin flashes and bond impacts then you've got some rain effects then over here a bunch of really awesome explosions then you've got tons more cartoony stuff a bunch of portals a bunch of cursors for an rts style game and a bunch more fire smoke and tons and tons of parties as you can see there's a really nice list tons of things on sale here so if you want to improve the visuals of whatever game you're currently working on just go ahead and browse this list adding some great looking particle effects can definitely help take your game to the next level now like i said this sale ends really soon so at least go ahead and grab the free assets right now you just add them to your cart and then don't forget to add the particular party coupon and the total will be zero alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible
