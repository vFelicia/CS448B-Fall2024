hello and welcome I am your code monkey and in this video we're going to learn what a game object is and what it's used for let's begin so a game object is the base class for all entities in unity in the scene hierarchy in here you can create a new game object by rightclicking create an empty which creates an empty game object and in here in the inspector you can view the stats for an empty game object you can rename the object either directly in the scene hierarchy in here so my game object or you can also rename it in this textbox in here so let's name the subject sprite as you can see it updated in there okay up here you can choose an icon for your game object which will make it very easy to find in your scene so select an icon and as you can see in here in the scene the icon is visible and it contains the name of the game object if you're working in 2d make sure you go up here in the gizmos and decent like 3d icons so with the icon you can view the name of the game object and easily locate it in your scene window and if you go to the game view you can click this button here to turn on gizmos which one display the game object in your game view you can also give it a custom icon if you really want to customize your scene click on other and in here you can see the list of all the images in your project and in here you can see the icon of our game object this can be quite helpful especially during all level design a game object always has a transform component by the font and also has the ability to add more components you can for example click this button and add the sprite renderer component which gets added to this game object which enables you to display a 2d sprite you can drag a texture into the sprite field and now you can visually see the texture ingame this checkbox up here and lets you enable and disable the game object if I disable the game object all of its components get disabled so in this case you can see the sprite disappearing when I disabled the game object and reappearing when I enable so let's look into what we can do with a game object through code let's make a new csharp script and name it my game or script inside as you can see by the phone this class extends the omona behavior class and has these start and update functions a class must extend the amount of behavior in order to be used as a component in a game object the start function runs as soon as the game object starts and runs only once the update is called once per frame so in order to test on our start in here let's do a debug log game object I'll start debug dialog simply prints a string into our console so let's go in the editor select our game object and in here we can either click Add component and locate our script or we can simply drag the script on to our game object and now the script has been added to this game object okay so let's run the game so far as you can see in the console in here it is this playing game object at start which means our script is correctly executing alright so now that we have some code running let's try to dynamically create a game object so on our start function in here let's simply make new game ok let's run the code and see what happens as you can see in the hierarchy we have a new game object in our scene this is game object that was created through code alright now let's modify it so in here when constructing we can give a argument for the game object name so let's call it my new game object as you can see the game object has been created and has the name my new game object adding a custom name to your dynamically queried game object is very useful for easily finding it in your scene ok so now let's add a component through code so first let's story reference to the new only create a game object so game object my game object equals the new game object so using the reference to my game object let's use the function add component and we're going to add a component of type sprite renderer this will add the sprite renderer component to our newly created game object so in here as you can see we got the new game object and you can see in the inspector it has the transform which is only spawned when you create new game object and has the sprite renderer component that we just instantiate it if you already know what components you're going to need in your newly created game object you can add them in the constructor like this type of sprite renderer and this way is much better for performance and as you can see the result is exactly the same there it is sprite runner ok great so there you have it we covered what is a game object and the many ways you can modify it both in the editor and through code game objects are at the base of everything you see in a Unity game so by understanding them you can now begin to experiment with components by looking into the default ones and making your own if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best
