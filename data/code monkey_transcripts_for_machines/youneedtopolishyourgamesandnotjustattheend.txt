hello and welcome I'm your code monkey now if you're regular on the channel then you've certainly heard me talk about the importance of good polish how polish is what separates a good game from a great game of those tiny animations those sounds and flashes that make every action in the game feel really satisfying it's all those same things that make the players think wow this game is really high quality even just while interacting with a simple main menu one game with an excellent amount of polishes valheim just Gathering basic resources in that game feels so satisfying another example is Hearthstone placing down a car or doing some basic attacks just feels awesome and more recently Marvel snap technically it's a simple game with just some cards but again every action has tons of animation and effects to make it feel really powerful so since polish is so important the question is when should you do it now the first obvious answer is we're at the end of the project when the game is saying 90 done and all of the mechanics and systems are implemented then it's a great time to go and publish and add all kinds of tiny things to the game this is another reason why I always encourage you not to just make games but actually finish them as well if you just jump from unfinished prototype to unfinished prototype if you just do that NonStop then you never take a project to completion and you never learn the super important part of how to make polish that is a very important stage and learning that comes with experience learning what is Polish or how to polish a game all those tiny things which one should you focus on that is a skill like any other and as with any skill it's a skill that you gain with experience I can say that my very first few games were definitely very unpolished so when your game is close to finish definitely make sure you spend some time doing nothing but polish meaning don't add any more mechanics whatever you have just polish everything to Perfection so the first stage is at the end of the development that is an obvious stage for when you should add polish however there are similar case but it also makes sense and what gave me the idea for this video is because right now I'm actually going through one of those keys myself lately I've been working on polishing demo for my own game Thinking Guardians I published the demo last month and I have kept it up as I update it as I'm going through the development now the game is still quite a bit far away from release the launch it is meant to be just in October so there's still quite a lot of core mechanics that need to be implemented before the final game is released so with that in mind you might question why am I now spending time doing some Polish before all the mechanics are input and the reason is because the demo is still live people are playing the demo and either giving me their direct feedback or I can just look at the analytics to see what parts I need to improve feedback is a crucial part about how to make a great game and if I want to get more feedback then basically I need to ensure that the demo for the game is as polished as can be if people drop off in the first few minutes and I don't really get much feedback so if I want to get more feedback basically I need to make the demo better and right now if I were to work on the missing mechanics that I still need to build things like the interplanetary logistics system if I work on those right now it won't really help me get more feedback if people just quit in the very beginning of demo then they will never reach those points so that is why right now I'm spending some time not a lot just a little bit of time just one to two weeks spending that time just focusing on polishing the main menu and the very beginning of the game I promise the buttons on the main menu so instead of some boring static buttons they now have some nice satisfying animations and sound when you Mouse over and click on them the buttons now also have some proper Sprites and sound effects for the single player menu I also published that instead of just instantly popping in there is now a nice smooth rate of black and then the single player window just comes up really nice with a nice animation again all of these tiny tiny things these are small but these are the kind of things that players notice at least subconsciously which leads them to enjoy the game for quite a bit more which leads them to play longer by the way for handling all these tiny things I'm using the super useful asset calls feel I made NASA review on it in a previous video it's a really awesome asset for example this stage for Polish it makes it really easy to add all of these tiny flashes and animations then I also published the game itself for the tutorial previously just had some boring text on the side whereas now I have some proper tutorial videos and also made a proper UI for it also added some flashing images and a nice animation along with another sound effect again small things but you can see how it makes a huge difference and then I also made some minor tweaks to the tutorial itself to make it more easy to follow like for example the denkis now stay still for one longer while they Patrol an area where I want the player to start Gathering resources that way they never go far away and leads to a lot of confusion for the players there's also a bunch more indicators on various Citron stages again making everything as easy to understand as possible so am I going with this polish is really to help the players enjoy the game as much as possible and keep playing longer which in turn will give me more data and more stats and more feedback to help me make the final game much better so that is the other stage where it also makes sense to have some Polish if you have a public demo like for example if you are participating in a steam festival at that point even if there is still quite a lot of content that you need to build to make the final game instead of working on those missing late game mechanics it might be wise to spend some time just publishing the very beginning of the game in order to ensure you have a great demo in order to get more feedback from your better players in order to help you make the rest of the game better and better now the other stages where it also makes sense to publish are honestly really just variations of this same stage like for example if you're making a Kickstarter nowadays Kickstarter is really crowded it is really difficult to get funding especially if the only thing you have is just a video a lot of players really want to play your game before they decide that they want to fund the game and again for this it is your best option to put your best foot forward so even if only a sliver of the game is actually done it is very wise to spend some time just publishing the part that exists instead of working on lighting mechanics if the players enjoy the kickstart our demo and adding some Polish will help them enjoy it more if they enjoy it then the chances of getting funding go up massively another similar stage is when trying to get funding from a publisher nowadays pretty much you know publisher won't fund you with just video or concept art that is unless you already have a massive pedigree if you have preexisting contacts or an excellent complete Game portfolio if you don't have that then it's really difficult to get funding without something playable so once again for this use case take what you have and polish it to the maximum once again doing that will greatly increase your odds of signing with the publisher and getting some funding yet not a similar stages when you have a slot on some kind of ingame convention something like the in the mega booth for these you need to have a playable demo that players can actually play on the show 4 and once again this is another scenario where players aren't really going to play your demo for 20 hours straight they're not going to play the entire game just the very beginning so it doesn't matter that your only game mechanics aren't the moment yet what matters is that the very beginning of the game is as excellent as can be if they enjoy the beginning they are going to go home and wishlist the game which then increase your odds of finding success with the final game so yep if you're going to participate in some convention where your game is playable then when preparing the bill for that convention make sure you take some time away from regular development in order to punish what you have to Perfection that will increase player satisfaction which will increase your odds of finding success in that convention so hopefully this helped you see how there are more stages when you should publish your game rather than just at the very end and speaking of Polish go ahead and try out the free demo for my game which now has quite a bit of Polish I hope you'll like it then go ahead and add it to your wishlist alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
