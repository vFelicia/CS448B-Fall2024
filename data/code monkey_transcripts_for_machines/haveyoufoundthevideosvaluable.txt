here on quick video here so I've been running this channel for over 20 months now in all that time I've made over 250 videos covering all sorts of topics from beginner to advanced this has been a very interesting journey I really enjoy making these videos and sharing my knowledge and reception has been great so first of all thank you for following the channel and I hope you've learned a ton from all those videos now I've got lots of topics that I still want to cover and I want to keep making free videos for as long as possible to do that I need your help so if these videos have helped you if you found them valuable and if you can afford it then you can now directly support the channel on patreon I've been running this channel by burning through my savings but in order for me to continue doing this in the long term then at some point it needs to become sustainable but again I also want it to be optional so first of all if you simply cannot afford it then that is perfectly fine the videos won't continue for as long as I can and will always be free I've actually been thinking about this for a couple of months now when I started making these videos something that I felt very strongly about was how I wanted to give as much as I can for free especially the project files in utilities my main goal has always been to help you by sharing acknowledge I've accumulated over the many years I've been making games and I wanted to make it available for everyone that's why I started making free videos instead of paid courses so I really want to keep providing tons of free content for everyone to learn from but at the same time I need this to become sustainable and I want the people who support on patreon to feel like they're getting something so in thinking long and hard about that problem the solution I've come up with is simply oneweek exclusive project fallacy whenever a new video comes out the project files will be exclusive to patreon for one week for just five bucks you will greatly support the channel and get the project files as soon as the video is out but if you can't afford this then you can still follow along with the video or just wait one week and the adi project files again i've been thinking about this for a very long time and i believe this approach makes it great for everyone if you really find the videos helpful and valuable then for just 5 bucks you'll be helping the channel a ton and get everything as soon as the videos come out if you come across one of my older videos then everything is free as it's always been any fee just simply cannot afford it then you can still get everything by waiting at most one week so that's the basics of how patreon is set up there's a bunch more tiers like if you want to use AdMob but not feeling bad about it you can just support at the two dollar level which already helps more than by watching a thousand ads or if you have a game yourself and you want to promote it in a video you can support that that tier and also if you're uncomfortable with a monthly payment you can still support the channel with a single payment by picking up the game bundle you'll be helping the channel and get some cool games for you to play with your support I can also attempt some logic projects if I know I'm not as dependent on ad views and having to massively grow the channel I have a lot of ideas that take time to make like complete games from start to finish a complete csharp course Q&A doing reviews of your games doing a game jam with modular elements weekly challenges and more there's tons of cool ideas I can make that don't really work with the ad model but with your support I can try them out and you can benefit from more interesting in that videos so again if you found the videos helpful and valuable and you want to help keep them coming and keep them free for everyone forever then check out the patreon page as always thank you so much for watching thank you for your support and I'll see you next time
