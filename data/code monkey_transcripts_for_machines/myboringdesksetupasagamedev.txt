hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so one top video that I'd like to watch are Studio or desk tours in those videos people always seem to have these really awesome setups with lots of phantom lights and all kinds of stuff everything always looks so great look at all of this this is all so clean so perfect and of course all the equipment this is usually always highend expensive stuff there's usually never something old that simply just works for example Mark has a setup it's really just so beautiful and clean it really looks like it could be an art piece there's nothing messy nothing extra nothing is out of place so when I look at those and then I look at my own desk I always ask myself does everyone have these beautiful clean highend setups and I'm just a messy boring person or is everyone closer to the setup that I've got over here and these are actually the outliers I'd love to see where you work I'm going to post on Twitter so go ahead and show me your setup and this video is also meant to Showcase how you don't need a super highend super clean setup most of what I have right now I've had for many many years and it has enabled me to make eight Sim games which have grossed over 1 million dollars in 10 years and I'm currently working on my next team game called leaky Gardens it's a fun automation Colony building defense game go ahead and edit your wish list so that said here's my normal basic test store foreign so here is my desk setup starting off with my main monitor here so this is a bank XL 2420 Zen I bought this ages ago some like eight years ago back then I was really into CounterStrike so I really wanted something with 144 Hertz so technically it's pretty old it's ATN panel but still works perfectly then next to it I've got a super basic Dell no idea what this is basically when I moved into this place and started using two monitors I just went into the Welcome Store and picked up just the cheapest 1080p monitor there was and again so this one is also still about seven years old and still works perfectly oh crap the zombies are attacking so let me just clean them up okay so back to the tour down here I've got my keyboard so this is a Logitech g915 pretty nice one and I really need the wrist rest otherwise my wrist get all messed up then next to it for my mouse this is in Logitech Pro something something it's actually the first wireless mouse that I've been trying out and actually works surprisingly well I thought the wireless was somewhat noticeable but nowadays the tech is awesome so the wireless is really not noticeable at all this was definitely a great upgrade my mouse pad as you can see has definitely seen better days again this one was also something like 10 years old but hey some works perfectly so there it is then down there is the main thing that I've spent money on just go ahead and ignore the cable management off to the side so in there is a RTX 3090 definitely super expensive but it does help pay off considering how much less the videos take to render so definitely expensive but a worthwhile purchase and for the CPU I've got a ryzen 5950x again lots of cores really great for editing videos this PC is definitely much much better than the previous one that I had previously the renders took about 30 minutes to make for a simple video whereas now it takes five minutes so definitely very worthwhile alright so then up here for my camera I've got a super basic Logitech webcam I think this is the 920s again really basic but it does get the job done although I wouldn't like to upgrade to something a bit better I think my biggest issues with the green screen I think it simply comes from the fact that this camera doesn't really render too well so I definitely would like to upgrade to a proper camera then speaking of cameras the other important thing are of course lights so over there I've got a super basic super simple light I literally just bought the cheapest ring light that I could find and it doesn't really work very well doesn't have much life but then behind it is the Elgato light that one is definitely much better definitely provides a lot more light to go along with the lights I've got my green screen down here okay it's really nice Definitely it's green so definitely works my chair is also super basic you can see it has definitely seen better days I definitely would like to upgrade this one to a proper chair sometime soon next up over here I've got my microphone so this one is a Blue Yeti basically I did a bunch of research before I even started this Channel all the way back in 2018 I did a ton of research and pretty much the consensus was this one was the best one at a pretty reasonable price so I bought it back then in Silver's personally so definitely happy with this one then for some more random stuff over here I got some basic speakers again yeah on those zest tours they've got tons of highend equipment whereas I've got a lot of super basic stuff for this one I don't even have the other one the other one has been broken for quite some time so I just got this one I have no idea what brand this is I bought the cheapest set of speakers about seven years ago but hey some works it's only gives out sound so that's perfectly fine for me then for something very much not technical over here is my daily design list so my mini whiteboard that I write every single day with my to do things for the day very low Tech but definitely helps me keep track of my daily tasks then over here I've got a real nice Unity notebook they gave me this in a swag bag all the way back in GDC it's real nice so I haven't used it yet I want to make sure that when I use it I use it for something special then over here I've got my watch this is a Samsung Galaxy watch 4. really nice really useful to keep track of workouts and running pretty nice next to it is my stack of books so I've got the daily stoic so really nice to read just one passage every single day nice way to start the day then I've got the Dragon Ball Z manga this is the first manga that I've ever brought and I've been really enjoying it even though I haven't read as much as I would like next with is the swelling Bible this is the book by the channel and Bro Science live so just some fun gym comedy book and then next to it code complete 2. I've mentioned this specific book several times in my videos I genuinely think this is one of the best books that has greatly helped me increase my programming skills everything that I know about writing good clean code most of it came from this book then next to it I've got some eye drops for my dog sometimes his eyes get messed up so he needs a few drops then I've got some pills for my other dog she's getting up in here so this helps then next to it I've got my Samsung earbuds so when I go walk my dogs and I want to listen to some YouTube videos some podcasts something so this is what I take with me then I've got a nice kunai next to it I've got a really nice fat boo then I've got a really nice tiger a real nice Unity ducky and a really nice Gogeta so just some super basic decoration definitely no RGB and lights everywhere next to it I've got a bunch more todo lists I've got lots of biscuits for my dogs and I've got my general calendar this is definitely not fixing some of this changes a lot but this is roughly how I keep up to date with which videos are coming out when and on there I've got my tshirts I definitely should have a problem place to put them but so far they're just in a pile and then I've got my own laptop this is an LG gram I have no idea what model this is pretty basic but really nice I basically just use my laptop to reply to comments or do some researching or writing a video so I don't need anything too special I don't normally do any Unity developing or any editing over here so some basic works and I think that's it so hopefully this video helps give a more realistic view of what a setup is like or perhaps not perhaps everyone has those beautiful high and clean setups and mine is really by comparison very basic and boring I definitely look forward to seeing what your setups look like and don't forget to add dinky Gardens to your wishlist alright thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
