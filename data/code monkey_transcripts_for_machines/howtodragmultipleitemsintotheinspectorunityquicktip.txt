hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this is a quick tip for dragging multiple items into the inspector so let's say you have a script like this one in here where you have a field for multiple values like an array the script takes an array of sprite renders and flips them so down here I have a bunch of goal nodes now if I try some like multiple of them as soon as I click on one you can see that the inspector changes and if I now select all of them I can no longer see the original reference in the first script so it would seem that I would need to select my original script so that I can see the array reference on my inspector and drag them one by one this works but it's obviously not the best way to do it so like that only if you were flipped but I want to flip them all so the trick in here is to first select the game object with the script that you want and now we can go up here and lock the inspector with the inspector unlocked you can see that it doesn't change when I select other things the inspector is still showing that even though I'm selecting different objects so now you can freely select multiple items so some like all of the goal nodes and now I can drag them all and drop them in the array and as you can see the array is instantly filmed with all of the selected objects so with all the references in here I can run the code and there you go all of them have been flipped this is very useful if you have for example a spreadsheet animation and want to drag a bunch of frames or like in this case you have a bunch of objects in your scene and want to drag all the references into an array so there you have it that's your quick tip for how to drag multiple items into the inspector if this tip was helpful give it a like and subscribe for more videos alright see you in the next one
