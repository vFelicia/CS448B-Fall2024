hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights that were released in july of 2021 in this first video i will be covering a list of free assets and in the next ones i won't be covering paid assets and tools check out the phone playlist to see all the highlights every month you might find something that would be just perfect for whatever project you're currently working on let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them and by the way right now there's a mega bundle happening it's a massive discount at 95 percent off it's pretty nice in terms of variety lots of systems props particles and sounds these bundles are always great value if just one of these assets interests you then the home bundle is worth it check the link in the description to see it and by the way check out my own assets on the store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your games and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out i'm currently working on converting more videos into pro systems so stay tuned for that alright so starting off with a really nice low poly fps pack this one is pretty great it's got tons of variety for a free pack you've got a total of 10 weapons shotguns pistols smgs sniper rifles and more as well as a bunch of throwables like a flashbang and a frag grenade every gun also has a bunch of animations for shooting reloading idle draw and so on i have to say this free pack is really very impressive so if you have any idea that requires some low quality weapons then go ahead and get this one then for a cool effect here is a cube map blur it's pretty simple does exactly what it says so you can use this for example to power your sky boxes in order to highlight whatever object is in front of the screen next up if you need some ui check out this dark theme pack it's got quite a lot of unique elements so some basic buttons and a whole bunch of icons all of them really nice really clean designs they would look great on pretty much any game if you need some more low poly assets here's actually two packs in one there's the low poly swords pack and the rpg weapons pack there's quite a lot of variety here on the swords back you have a total of 15 unique swords some of them look pretty simple and others look quite unique and on the other pack you've got a bunch more rpg weapon types so axes staffs bows shields and so on with these two packs and some lowpoly characters you can already build tons of unique medieval or fantasy games then for an interesting tool here is desktop streamer it does exactly what it says it streams your whole desktop to another machine so it's definitely a very niche thing but if you want to work on your project while using another machine that might be very useful next if you're working on a racing game here is a stylized car a really nice and simple design comes with a bunch of color variations so very simple and perfect for your next racing prototype maybe you need some buttons to make your game playable with touch then check out this virtual buttons asset features some simple buttons some dpads and joysticks i recently covered the new input system which has support for very easily adding some onscreen touch controls so you could combine that with these visuals and easily make your game play one with touch for some sound effects here is the fantasy stinger sfx pack features 40 interesting sounds some of them are very mysterious others very gentle others very scary so put a bunch of these when some events happen in your fantasy game and really make it stand out next up a potentially very interesting tool it's the serialized interfaces package you can serialize interfaces and drag their references in the editor so you can define the exact interface type instead of making it just a game object reference and trying to get that interface then using the finder it will allow you to drag things that actually implement that interface so interfaces are always a great tool so maybe get this one and see if it helps you write better cleaner code and finally here is a really cool stylized pirate ship maybe you've got a pirate game idea you've been thinking about if so this is a great starting point it's a stylized asset but it's also pretty detailed so you could use this to make a topdown game something like sid meier's pirates or maybe something in first or third person something like sea of thieves really good looking asset and very versatile alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unity asset store for july 2021 there's links to all in the description stay tuned for the next video
