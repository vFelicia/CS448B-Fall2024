hello and welcome I am your code monkey and in this video we're going to review the videos published in July 2018 let's begin so in July we start by continuing the waiting queue in battle round tycoon first by adding the ability to modify the waiting queue which adds positions in a grid based logic essentially examine like in rollercoaster tycoon which was my goal the other video a few days later completed the waiting queue by creating a specific class to handle they guess AI and cleaning up several issues that popped up the waiting queue is a really cool system and if you're working on a tycoon game yourself I believe watching that series won't help you out a lot there were two completely beginner focused videos one on how to set up a 2d scene and another one on how to set up the UI if you're completely new to unity these videos won't help you get up and running fast they start off with a completely empty scene and walk you through the whole process which ends up with what I use in my own games then we continue creating our UI graph first we have the support for a dynamic yaxis which automatically scales the graph based on the value on Mount then we added the ability to have a dynamic xaxis to support an infinite number of values afterwards we converted our line graph into a bar chart which was relatively easy since we kept our code clean throughout the whole series and finally we created a visual interface to easily display our graph values in any way we want adding more display types is very easy given how we set up the code and swapping the visual representation is also extremely simple there were a couple of videos on the subject of a character portrait it's a really cool effect that I've used a lot in my games we created a UI window that displays a render texture which captures a view of the character we also added support for multiple windows following different characters and finally we create a generic character class and use it to display some stats on our window the quest arrow pointer is a great simple element that is useful for a great variety of games anytime you have a game where you want to direct the player to a position you can use this code in the following video we added support for multiple arrows to be able to have multiple pointers pointing to multiple positions and finally we customized the Congress and sprites making the home script very robust and adaptable we began work on the simple resource gather a I this is also a series taking you through the making of a resource gather a I and like you might see in something like Age of Empires the goal is to make a unit that we can direct to gather a certain resource and keep track of that resource the AI and resource manager will support multiple types and in the end we're going to construct a building using those resources they started off very simple by creating a gather a I script with a simple state machine di I asked the game handler for a resource node that he'd and mines after mining he has the game hammer for storage where he moves to and drops the resources in the following video we expand upon the AI and create this script to keep track of our resources the resource storage class is very clean and simple in a way that does not depend on knowing any other classes this is what we will later use to test if we have enough resources for cased constructing a building unity color as a hexadecimal string was an interesting video it contains the code to be able to use hexadecimal strings when setting callers in your code for me since I create my games mostly through code this is extremely useful just open Photoshop and get the EXA decimal string then paste it in code and everything works great there was a video on the time.take system which is a relatively simple system that i find super helpful in my games it essentially fires an event after a certain amount of time this makes it extremely simple to keep track of timed events without having timers on every single object the example in the video was a tower being constructed instead of having a timer on each tower it would similarly keep track of how many ticks were left in construction this system will help readability and performance especially if you have a game with lots of units so that was it for the month of July 2018 I hope you found the videos home phone and learn something along the way if you have any questions regarding any of the videos feel free to post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
