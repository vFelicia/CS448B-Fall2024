hello and welcome I'm your code Mon and in this video I'm going to cover why you should or shouldn't create a game design document let's begin okay so should you take time to create a game design document or is it a complete waste of time this is an interesting subject and different people will take on different views a game design document is essentially a blueprint of your final game it can be very simple with is a high level overview of the entire game or it can describe every single system and item and skill in the game in excruciating detail essentially you can go as simple or as detailed as you want the benefit of a highly detailed design document is that essentially you do all design work and then you do all the implementation this helps you separate completely between preproduction and actual production so as you're implementing Your Design you don't need to think about how it will work you just follow the blueprint and be confident that at the end you will have a good game in in a highly detailed design document you would have something like a list of all the enemies how they look where they spawned how their AI Works how much health and what weaknesses they have what weapons they hold and so on for a weapon you would Define the name the look how much damage it deals and how it fires maybe Define a type of ammo and what type of damage it does and so on so at the extreme point you end up with a huge document hundreds of pages long that supposedly works great as a game when you play it in your mind however for me making my small oneman indie games I have never had much use for a super detailed game design document a very detailed document essentially works against iteration if you have 50 pages of highly detailed systems you can become a bit uneasy over making changes even if you can clearly tell that the current design is not working so I find that the answer to the question of is a game design document a waste of time is mostly dependent on scale if you have a AAA game that involves involves 300 people working towards the same goal then yes you need every step of the way to be clearly detailed so everything comes together in the end in such a large project you really cannot have someone just randomly try implementing a completely different system and break everything for everyone else however if you're like me working Solo or even as a small team I wouldn't lean against going for something super detailed you should still have some sort of document that contains a high level view of the essence of the game in my case I normally have have lots of pages with Concepts that define an overview of what I'm trying to achieve I do most of my design as I go along iterating on what I create with only a very high level overview being done before I start production of a simple prototype for example when I was working on what would later become blueprint Tycoon my first thought was a game where you're building weapons to supply an army it was intended to be some sort of a mercenary supplier management game the code name for the game was actually the Army supplier wi so the player would get a contract from someone that needed let's say 100 swords of a specific type made of a specific material then the player would craft the final item and deliver it to complete the contract however as I iterated on the simple prototype I figured out that the best part of the design was gathering the raw materials then turning them into something else and then another thing and so on and so on so the player need to gather a base material like iron turn it into a sword much like the supply chain from settlers or ano as I went deeper into the object Tech Tree I decided that keeping the mercenary theme would limit how far I could go since with that theme at the end I need to have some sort of weapon or armor so as I iterated on design I scrapped the mercenary theme and made it more focused on getting contracts for specific products and figuring out how to make those products in making the various products I expanded heavily into how each one was made which made me go deeper into the blueprint concept where you have inputs and outputs which then lead to the final game with the name blueprint Tycoon so again for my specific process I prefer to keep it loose and iterate on design as I go along however such a loose design would be tough to work with other people since I don't know exactly what steps I'm going to do in order to reach my final goal one way to keep it somewhat loose but also focused is to Define some pillars that make up the foundation of what you're trying to achieve so for example let's say you're making a stealth game and you Define as one of your pillars that the player is weak and direct confrontation is discouraged however then you go through implementing your design and you figure out that one of the abilities you design caused the player to be very strong in direct confrontation it was not the intent of the original design but the end result is that so if you had an item that was a smoke bomb that made enemies blind and you're going with this item would be for the player to use it to get away but then you also give the player a takedown ability that could kill enemy all of a sudden the best way for the player to play would be to throw the smoke grenade as an offensive tool approach the enemy while he's blind and kill it so just like that two separate abilities in your base design would combine into something that would easily break one of your pillars so again by using those pillars to guide you you could iterate on that design and change it so that for example the smoke grenade makes them blind except when the player is too close at that point the smoke grenade would once again be back to being a defensive tool inside of a offensive tool so that's an example of something that you would not necessarily think of during preproduction while you were writing your game design document but it would end up destroying your final game if you were following a strict game design document that prevent you from iterating upon it you would end up with a worse game so a game design document like so many other things is mostly a tool if it fits with your workflow and your team then sure go for it how detailed you go is also a variable thing start staring a game completely blind with no idea as to what the final game will be isn't very helpful and on the other hand having a 100 page straight design document that leaves no room for iteration also isn't very helpful so figure out what works for you and your team in order to figure out what works best you can start off with a similar project make a small one month game and try doing a game design document before you start production if you find that you design too many specific constraints then you know the next time you should be a bit more loose with your design so there you have it some food for thought for you to consider if you should write a game designed document and if so how detailed it should be if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
