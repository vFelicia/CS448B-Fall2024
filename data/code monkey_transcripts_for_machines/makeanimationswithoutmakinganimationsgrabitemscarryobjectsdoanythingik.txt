hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this video let's check out how we can take animations that we already have and pretty much create new dynamic animations starting from those this is a great method especially if you're not an animator just like i'm not i'm going to showcase a specific example but this method is extremely versatile we're going to look at how to take a basic idle animation and make the character move the arm to grab an item but like i said with this exact same method you could also make a character wonk or idle while carrying a heavy object or maybe start from an idle animation make it point towards something or many other unique animations again this is not an animation tutorial but rather learning how to start from basic generic animations and then dynamically apply some changes to get the unique animations you want do you want to learn unity blender and programming patterns then check out my curator code monkey bundle with a link in the description this is a collaboration with game dev tv all of their courses have the highest rating possible i got in touch with them to specifically select three courses to make a nice complete bundle to take you from beginner to advanced i chose their ultimate unity 3d course this one will teach you both unity and csharp both starring complete from scratch then the blender 3d modeling course i picked this one up myself a few months ago and i've learned a ton thanks to it and the final one is a more advanced really interesting programming course all about programming patterns it's excellent for helping you massively improve the quality of your code which in turn helps you make better games faster i chose all of these courses myself to really give you a nice path to go from beginner to advanced the bundle has a really nice discount so check it out with a link description okay so like i said i'm not an animator so when i use animations in my videos or my games i have to go to the store and buy them for normal things that's great it's very easy to find some generic walking or idle animations or even some using weapons but sometimes i can find the exact animation that i'm looking for so in that case you would assume that you need to make a new animation yourself so maybe unload the model into blender or maya and build the animations from scratch however another approach you can take is to use an existing animation that is close enough to what you're looking for and then use animation rigging to get it exactly as you want it if you're not familiar with animation rigging this is one of the most useful unity packages i've ever used i made a full tutorial video on it you can go watch it if you have no idea what the package is and what it does the main thing is it will help us achieve the examples that i mentioned in the beginning okay so here i am with my character i have the usual basic animations you expect so i've got an idle animation i can walk around and go anywhere very basic also this third person control that i'm using here is the one officially made by unity it's free it's part of the star assets that i covered in another video and for the ss themselves over here i'm using the cinti studios heist pack there's in the film link in description in case you want to get it okay now let's say on this game i'm controlling my character and i want to move up and grab that money over there on that desk so i want to approach the object and press a button to pick it up right now i can actually do that so i can move forward and as soon as i'm close enough i can press a button and yep there you go i grabbed the object however as you saw the object just vanished from the world while my character stayed perfectly standing still so technically it worked it grabbed the object but of course this looks pretty bad it would look 10 times better if the character actually grabbed the item with his hands so let's learn how to do that but again remembering that i'm not an animator if i was then i would just load whatever animation program i have and just make the animation by hand but i have no idea how to do that thankfully i do know how to use the animation rating package okay so first of all here's the basic logic this is my character script all it's really doing is just doing a physics dot overlap sphere in order to find all the atoms around it tries to get a component to identify that it's an item then if it's close enough it shows the icon and on a key press just destroys the item so over here is where it would add it to an inventory or something like that so as you can see the logic is very simple now let's see how we can handle the animation so over here the first thing that we're going to need is set up the rig so let's go into animation rigging and make a rig setup like i said i made an entire video on the animation rigging package really going into detail how it works and all the things that it can do here i'm going to assume you know the basics of that package go watch that video if you don't know anything about it over here on the rig let's begin by creating a new constraint so a new game object let's call it right hand and let's add a new component go into animation rigging and we're going to want a two bone ik constraint now we need to drag the hand onto the tip so let's find the right hand so here it is the right hand bone so let's use this onto the tip and auto setup okay so just like this if we hit on play and yep just like this the hand is already going straight towards the target now let's just rotate this so that it makes sense so put the hand kind of like that now let's copy these values and back in edit mode and let's paste the component values and same thing for the hint put it more to the side the the elbow should be right about here okay so that's the basic setup and now we've got the target so this is where the hand will touch now we need is to actually place this target on top of the item so here we actually have two options one is very simple and one is more complex but looks much better either way we're going to need to make an animation so let's make it this character is using this animator and over here i've got an idle animation so it's a one right here so let's duplicate this one let's call it grab item and drag it onto the animator okay so with the character selected let's just go and select the graph item animation by the way like i said this animator and these animations are straight from the freestyler assets i mentioned a while ago and just one quick note here in order to make this absolutely perfect we would probably use a separate animated layer to override just the arms instead of copy pasting from the anal animation but i don't want to make this video too complex so let's go with this method if you want to learn about animation layers it's one of the things that i cover in detail in my ultimate unity overview course so here for the two options that we have we can record this animation and bring the target to the front so we can just press on record and then we grab our target and we can move it around and essentially record the target position directly on the animation so there it is the target position we would place the item here then on a couple more frames bring the atom back and back so this is one approach however with this you can already probably guess the issue the issue is what if the atom is not exactly here what if it is slightly to the side left or right now in reality most players wouldn't notice that so you could definitely use a method just like this one but since we're using animation rigging we can make it perfect so let's actually make it perfect what we're going to do is we're going to dynamically position this target so it's going to be set through code so let's actually remove this keyframe from the animation now on this animation we're not going to have any position keyframe for this target object all we're going to do in descend mission is just increase the weight so the animation rigging system will smoothly move the hand to grab the item so let's press on record and let's go into the right hand constraint let's start off at zero and after some time let's say one second let's bring it up to one and after grabbing the item we're going to need to bring the hand back but let's handle it later let's get this first part working first so we just have this animation and then let's also extend it a bit in order to handle transition later okay so that's pretty much it just an animation increasing the two bone constraint weight by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks then on the animator let's just make a transition from the idle onto the grab item and this one is not going to have an exit time but rather we're going to trigger it through a trigger so here on the parameters make a trigger called grab item and on this trigger we're going to run this transition okay so far so good now back in our code here we have the grab item logic now instead of destroying the object right away over here let's place the target exactly on the item position so we need a reference to that so we place the target directly on top of the item and then we just need to trigger the animated transition okay so that's it as soon as we press the button if we have an item we're going to set the target onto that position and trigger the animation so let's see if the character approaches the target then grabs the atom rather than seeing the item just vanish instantly okay so here we are and let's approach the table with the item and let's press the button and yep there you go it did indeed bring the hands straight towards the item okay so far so good so you got the hand raising to reach the atom now we need to handle the second part so we want the character to actually pick up the item and take the arm to the back and then we want the item to vanish so since for the second part we want to record the target position let's actually make a different constraint so let's just duplicate this one now let's make another animation so let's duplicate this one call it grab item back and now here on this animation we're actually going to record the position for that so instead of the right hand let's remove this one so let's start recording and for the right hand grab item we're going to start off at zero after a while let's bring it up to one and then when that is one let's actually start moving the object so the target let's say it starts off here then after a while let's say go off to the side and then a bit more and go to the back okay so kind of like this so the arm raises up so it starts activating this constraint and then it moves the arm position and puts it on the back so we do that and then we have to reset so after a while when the arm is there let's go into our constraint put it on one and after a while bring it back to zero and back into idle okay so that's it now one very important thing is like i mentioned in that animation breaking video the order of operations for the animation rigging system that one is based on the order in the hierarchy so we need to make sure that this second constraint is under the other one so it ends up overriding that one and like i said the reason why we had to make two separate animations and two separate constraints that is because the first one we want the target to be set dynamically whereas on the second one we want to be animating so it actually pulls back you cannot stop animating one part after the animation starts so that's why you need two animations one moving the target and one not okay so with the animation setup then over here on the animator let's just make it transition going from grab item into grab and back and then going backwards so for this transition we do have an exit time we just need to play around this one so maybe at point nine maybe lasting for about point one need to play around these values then same thing for the grab item back let's also put it something like that okay so just like this and let's see if it works okay so here we are let's approach the item and press the button and yep the character moved the arm to grab the atom perfectly and then pull the arm back to the side back to the back and yep it behaved exactly as intended now obviously the last thing missing is bringing the atom wouldn't so we can do that easily by just changing the parent however first we need to know when so for that we can use some animation events first we need to make two functions so on animation graph item and stored item then let's go into the grab item back animation and over here right in the beginning let's add an animation function and let's choose that one so this one is on animation grab item so we're going to trigger that one in the beginning and then let's see when the character brings it to the back over here let's add another animation event this one on animation stored item now back in the code let's change the apparent to the hand bone so let's add a reference to the hand bone and when we have the grab item let's change the apparent and finally when the item is actually stored then we can finally destroy the item okay so that's it let's test once again here is my character let's move close and approach the atom and press the button and grab the item and yep the atom went back all right great so as you can see the character grabs the atom pulls it back and picks up the atom so if you compare this with what we saw in the beginning where the atom just disappeared it's obvious that adding this tiny animation makes things feel much much better so here you see how you can make animations without actually having to make animations remember that throughout all of this all we have is just a standard idle animation so we didn't have to go into another program to make the animation and the final result is even better than if you had taken that route because it targets the exact item perfectly so with this similar example you can see just how powerful it is the animation rigging package and you can imagine using the same process to make something like starting from an idle or wonk animation and making it hold an object or maybe one core idle while pointing at somewhere or maybe carry a briefcase or weapon or anything like that so you can see how powerful this method is you can make animations without actually having to make animations like i said in the beginning i'm not an animator but thanks to this package i can create some animations to fit whatever unique game ideas i have now go ahead and make some custom dynamic animations for your own games alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible
