hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity in launch in April 23. this month is an interesting one in terms of results there are sons of variety it was tricky to pick just 10 games but at the same time there's not many massive Mega hits only two of these have over a thousand reviews although at the same time depending on your cost if you get 100 reviews which means roughly 4 000 copies that can definitely be enough to make it a success so not necessarily good news for big teams but great news for some of devs just like me and this monthly game that I ended up selecting as my number one was actually a very surprising one the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just here on skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts that to the test all these games are uniquely impressive so there's only no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal favorite mode by the way I'm currently working on my own Sim game called dinky Guardians it's a fun Solo or Coop game with some automation building and defense elements where you must keep the tiny defenseless dinky safe from hard check out the steam page and to your wishlist and funnel for that one alright so starting off at number 10 with a nice in the sequel with a great visual style it's past part 2 to the last artist here you play as a struggling artist on your journey to regain your Lost Art career pick up a canvas in your brush go outside and start painting meet the residents of this town and learn what they like Draw Something That appeals to them in order to sell paintings and make some money then with your heart and cash you can acquire better different tools and canvases use a paintbrush or Draw on heart shaped canvas and eventually you can buy your own studio and start drawing some Masterpiece to be showcased in the Museum of the Mask my one big question about this one is how does the game decide what is quality I assume the game is accessible to anyone so I assume someone like me with no art skills can play and enjoy it so I'd love to try this one out just to see how they calculate pinning quality and what actually defines the preferences for the various resins I really like the visual Styles it's got some very unique characters and cars even the UI has a really nice animated Style finding success within the sequel is usually quite tricky but this one seems to have done it so far it already has over 400 very positive reviews then here is a very chaotic super fastpaced FPS called meat grinder the name is caps just like you expect it seems to be some kind of mixture between doom and cluster truck definitely looks very fun there's no hit scenes No story lines it's just you a ton of weapons and a ton of enemies you're constantly jumping around using a rattling hook to get the next weak one which can be trucks or trains or even planes pick up a weapon find the enemies and take them out without falling it looks very simple and also very well made honestly this is the perfect example of what I would encourage you to achieve with your first game something with a small scope really tight and focused despite being relatively simple this one has managed to find quite a bit success with over 100 very positive reviews if you're into card games then here is one trust it's a tactical roguelike deck builder rescue and recruit Frozen card companions along the way and equip them with purple charms to Aid you on your quest Master a dynamic counter system where each card has a specific cooldown which cause you to really think strategically you can keep an eye on the enemy's counter to essentially see the future and prepare for it so it's all very skill based this is a roguelike so after each run you can upgrade the town and get some permanent improvements to help you on future runs it's endlessly replayable with daily runs and challenges the game has a really excellent presentation everything is super well polished it's out now and has over 4 000 mostly positive reviews up next here is one worm this is an interesting sidescrolling mining roguelite explores the world and dig for all kinds of resources however it's not on Peaceful your ship won't get attacked and you must get back to your Robo spider ship in order to defend it's definitely unique in how you are digging sideways into a wall rather than down into the ground the mines are positionally generated so it's a new one every time it includes various fantasical biomes where you can mine multiple resources to then bring back to your base to buy all kinds of upgrade there's a nice wrist reward mechanic so are you going to go deeper and risk not making it back in time or do you keep it safe and never really go too far it's a similar design to the game don't keeper which was another great game this one appears to be well made it's out now and already has almost 3 000 very positive reviews then for some VR here is a massive release that just came out after an open Alpha its breachers this is a tactical 5v5 vrfps one team defends and one attacks basically it's VR Rainbow Six Siege which does sound awesome plan your assault or defense repel down some walls set up some C4 to break some walls coordinate with your teammates and execute the plan phones you have tons of gadgets at your disposal things like drones looking devices and flashbangs or some more technical ones like door blockers proximity centers and trip mines of course all alongside some deep weapon customization everything from pistols to SMGs to assault rifles only with tons of attachment the response to the open Beta was very positive I heard great things about this game and really seems to be doing very well already has over 500 very positive reviews which for VR game that does mean it's a huge hit up next here is a very anticipated one called roots of fashion it's a live Sim game in a very unique setting it's all set in the Stone Age so their real limits the kind of tech you have available basically just Stone and wood but you can still research and create all kinds of unique tools and objects now I have to admit something I still haven't played Sardi Valley the reason is simple everything that I've heard about the game sounds like it's the perfect game for me so I know know for a fact that when I touch the game I will spend 50 hours on it and I'm always way too busy to have that kind of spare time that's what happened to me with the game graveyard keeper which is a similar game and this game right here gives me the exact same Vibe I know if I play it it's going to consume my life for a few days your goal is to be a good member of this Stone Age Community go out and find some seeds come back home and plant them to grow some crops explore the Wilderness and domesticate some animals you can go fishing and if you're curious go explore the deep dark caves get to know the other members of the community develop some friendships and overcome hardships he can play either Solo or with friends it's out now and already has over 500 very positive reviews next up here's a funny and weird one called organs please in this one you manage a nice recycling facility except what you are recycling is actually Some Humans visitors come in and you screen them in a paper spleaselike manner make some of them your employees or convert them into resources deal with various factions meet their needs in order to keep your job the machines are on quite simply you can rotate people around turn them into drinks or tickle them with feathers it definitely is a unique concept with a dark sense of humor looks to be well made with over 100 very positive reviews then if you'd like something with some automation elements here is magical mixture Mill this one is all about creating potions first you go out to gather ingredients for your potions bring them back to your potion seller and set up some automated production lines of on chemical workstations it's all up to you to balance the ratio between potency and liquid and flavors try to get the best potions with the Unleashed side effects your customers come in all shapes and sizes some are hero Knights others are basic dungeon dwellers they all need potions and it's up to you to brew the perfect potion to help them it also has a really nice trailer with a fun song very enjoyable and the entire game looks very nice and inviting it's out now in Early Access with 100 very positive reviews next if you're looking for some Survival action here is Survival on Fountain of Youth this is a single player open world survival game where you explore various Islands scavenge for resources and craft bigger and better things so the usual in survival mechanics being based on islands is interesting you can craft a boat and roam around from Allen to Allen looking for more resource courses and uncovering the mysteries of this world the world is pretty realistic so there are no zombies or anything inside there's all kinds of animals from crocodiles to Tigers chicken and fish then there are also some interesting environmental mechanics such as you need to survive the intense heat the Relentless storms and the malaria infested swamps honestly despite them looking well made this game to me feels a bit generic a bit too much like every other Survival game and not too much is new but it does have over 300 very positive reviews so they must be doing something right and they do have a pretty detailed roadmap promising more regions story chapters Islands Firearms farming housing and tons more and at the number one here is honestly a pretty unexpected personal pick it's called Shadows of doubt this is an interesting one it's an immersive detective stealth game I say unexpected simply because usually I'm not into Adventure detective games just because I usually suck at those but this one does have some very interesting mechanics you play as a detective in this scifi Noir City full of crime and Corruption you take on various jobs as a private investigator and earn some money so you can continue on your path to find a dread the serial killer before they kill again although this isn't a fixed storyline the city is all precisionally generated only with all of its citizens they all have a name they all have a job in their own routine the city keeps on Living With or Without You the simulation never stops you can use tons of tools and whatever you find the world helps of your case for example if you find a discard received on the floor you can go and look at a CCTV camera and you see timestamp to find out who dropped it visually it looks quite interesting nice pixel art 3d and low poly sound looks great alongside the SciFi and wire aesthetic now I'm really interested in this one I love deep simulations and the way this one promises to simulate entire city with unique people all walking around sounds really exciting usually I'm not into Adventure or detective games just because I suck them but the Deep simulation in this one does have me really intrigued these kinds of games also usually struggle to sell many copies Adventure itself is a pretty Niche genre but this is one of the standout hits of this month already with over a thousand very positive reviews so if you're interested in deep systems or detective games then definitely don't miss this one alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with the until launch in April 23.
