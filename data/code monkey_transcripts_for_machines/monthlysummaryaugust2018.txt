hello and welcome I am your code monkey and in this video we're going to review on videos published in August 2018 let's begin so I will start off with the task system from battleground tycoon it is a really interesting system used for creating tasks and have workers execute them when possible we start off by creating a simple task and set up the workers who periodically request the next available task from the system then we modify the code to be able to support multiple task types with different executions after that we set up a complex task where the workers go to a position play an animation and execute an action that was set up in the task itself continuing that we added the ability to validate and queue tasks we can create a task and periodically test to see if it is valid and able to be executed then we put it all together and made a nice complex task to take a weapon into a weapon slot but validated it so that the worker only executes the task when the weapon slot is empty there were also several beginner focused videos covering the basic components of unity and how to interact with them both through the editor and through code we covered what is a game object what is a transform along with parentchild relationships and what is a sprite renderer also focus on the basics where two videos related to making a healthbar first how to create a health bar in the editor setup the transform so that it works in an easy way and then how to control it through code after that we set it up to construct the entire health bar from code along with some extras like an option on border with color and thickness this is another very clean class that we can easily drop into any project and make it useful there was a video on the website update which added suggestions that you can vote on this helps me figure out what videos to focus on so if you haven't already please go there and vote on your favorites also start sending out a weekly email containing that week's videos so if you're worried about YouTube not notifying you when new videos go live this is a great way to catch up and see what you might have missed the current most voted suggestion is with regards to a safe system related to that there was a video covering what is Jason how it's formatted how unity has some helper functions to deal with it and how we can use it for setting up a very simple system on the subject of a safe system there was a video on how to save and load using the player preps this is part of a series of videos where we will later use JSON and file saving to create a nice robust but simple safe system a quick video on taking our previous time.take system and cleaning up the code to have a very nice and simple clean class we can easily copy/paste the final class into any project and use it then we continue the gather AI that we start in previous month first by cleaning up our code with a dedicated resource node object to keep track of resource amounts and when the node is depleted then we added player control to be able to order a worker together from a specific node with that code we then added support for multiple workers so we can have many workers independently gathering from different nodes we then added multiple resource types to our system so we can all gather wood and gold but setup the code in such a way that adding more resource types is extremely easy and finally a short quick tip video for how to drag multiple items into the inspector I want to make many of these short videos covering some very simple but helpful tips that you might not be aware of so that was it for the month of August 2018 I hope you found the video is helpful and learn something along the way if you have any questions regarding any of these videos feel free to post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
