in this video I'm going to over some highlights of what's coming up to unity in 2020 more stable releases improved visuals and performance tons of quality of life improvements and lots lots more let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing okay so here I won't cover my highlights of what was recently announced for unity in 2020 in three different places first there's the Unity 2020 point one beta and that just came out then the blog post talking about the state of unity and lastly the roadmap Tom that premiered earlier this week all the links are in description in case you want to go through them yourself there is still one more roadmap Tom coming up in a few days entirely focused on multiplayer and live games also right now is your last chance to get the grow your skills mega bundle it contains $1,000 worth of assets for 90% off lots of these assets are extremely cool and this is an excellent deal the bundle ends in just a few days so check it out the link in the description is also an affiliate link so if you pick up anything through there you'll also be helping out the channel this video's patreon sponsor is bad Adventure bad adventurer is a game development duo currently working on their first game Wayfarers edge it's a RPG focused on exploring and settling unknown frontier lands in a low fantasy and Wild West theme check them out at bat Adventure calm thank you to the patreon sponsor and thank you to these awesome supporters for making this video possible go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone so couple of days ago the new version of twenty twenty point one just entered beta this is the first of the new release cycle previously you had three type releases and then the in long term support release now for 2020 it won't be just two tech releases pause DLTS so this should allow for more time in alpha and beta phases which will result in more stable releases they mentioned that their focus this year is more stable releases validated with real world productions so you can be confident to use the tools in your own projects so this is excellent news instead of getting tons of new features in preview this year you can expect more features to be stable and fully released previously there were also preview packages being released very early on in process well this was great because it gave you a sneak preview of what's to come it also costs confusion and instability so now they're reducing the number of preview packages and keeping experiment on packages limited to just focus groups so this should ensure that in general unity should be more stable across the board also I love the new format of the roadmap chunk it split up into three separate areas released prerelease and in development so this should help clear some confusion regarding what is currently fully released and what is being pre released as a preview package in order to validate the tools with realworld products unity has been doing more complete demos previously unity has tested their releases with the FPS sample and the may city demo currently there's the dot sample which is the testing ground for the dots net code that's animation and that's physics and they're currently in development of a largescale open wall shooter to ensure everything works at scale with triple equality so this is how they are validating all the tools they're working on by making sure they work in a realworld scenario the universal render pipeline now supports camera stacking which is awesome news although it doesn't yet work with a 2d renderer the development continues to reach feature parity with the builtin renderer the goal is to end up making the universal the default render pipeline the high definition render pipeline will also continue getting improvements with better performance and stability related to that is the hybrid renderer which has just recently been updated to version 2.0 the hybrid renderer uses bursts to bring performance improvements across the board so they show that with 100,000 dynamic entities they went from 37 milliseconds with version 1 to just 6.9 milliseconds with version 2 so that's an insane 5x improvement on something that was already very fast so rendering as the home continues to be faster and faster 2d has also been suddenly improving with each release lately with two delights spreadsheet PS importing and tons more it's really great to see on both given 2td over these past releases in 2020 point 1 there is more improvements due to the physics along with a new physics demo project you also have the ability to refresh physics at the same rate as rendering for smoother physics and visuals and in the future the goal is to continue improving on performance and workloads they're also currently working on a new and improved to the template that combines all of those awesome 2d packages so that should really help out when starting a new project to have instant access to try out all of these awesome 2d features visual scripting is currently in development I covered it quite a while ago but since then they've been working on a massive update which should be coming out relatively soon I'm very interested to look at the new update and will definitely be doing a video as soon as it sound several very interesting AI base tools I haven't touched any of these but the concept behind all of them is extremely impressive first there's a tool to use AI to easily generate and modify textures then using the cloud and machine learning to test your game on a massive scale and continued improvement on ml agents by making those tools easier to use so this is a really exciting area that will definitely be extremely important in the future so it's great to see unity build on all these awesome tools there's a bunch of small but awesome qualityoflife improvements first when you copy some game objects and then right click to paste you will now have two options paste and paste this child it's tiny thing but it's really useful whenever I copy/paste the objects I always have to stop and think for a second if it will end up as a sibling or a channel another small thing is dragging to swap the position of array elements and folders for the heart now this means extremely awesome and most people probably missed it right now the only way to organize your scene is using game objects as containers which has a slight performance cost and can confuse you with the unlocking transform values so being able to create just an empty folder just to organize things is going to be a huge help then there's generic splines these look great and apparently can be used with just about anything so it should really be a very versatile new tool regarding animation kinematic it is still in development and it always impresses me when I see it in case you don't know that's a a I based animation system so you just move the character and it automatically reacts to the environment certain looks super cool then more in improved animation tools to make a really solid animation workflow also work is continuing on dots animation again it promises extreme performance from being flexible and easy to use it's still very much in the development but the future looks very bright it's already been used in the dot sample and will be used in the openworld game they're currently working on a coming is the ability to open a prefab in context right now if you hope in a prefab for editing it will open it in the endzone scene so in the future you won't be able to open it directly in your scene so this should really help when you're trying to edit something relative to other things in your scene and in general the editor should be more performant in 2020 point 1 the profiler is continuing to get tons of improvements you can now run it as a standalone desktop app so this should really help reduce the noise when testing your games the memory profiler is also getting tons of improvements and you have some nice visual flow events showcasing what jobs are being scheduled the previously named UI elements is now renamed to UI toolkit and it's going into a package this is a very interesting feature that I've looked into but I haven't covered in a video yet it allows you to create UI in a very nice way by separating hierarchy and styling from logic it uses a very interesting subset of CSS in order to localize everything the UI builder is also a very visual tool for creating the UI so when combined with vector graphics this should make your UI work on just about any resolution and any aspect ratio so it all looks very promising and I look forward to covering it in a future video Senna machine continues getting more improvements I just recently started using it I made a video covering it and then I made a game that actually uses it so it really is extremely easy to use so it's great to see it continue to get improvements and come out of preview currently in development is a dots version of scene machine which again promises extreme performance in this demo each boy has a virtual camera so with that many Boyd's you can see it's insane performance now in terms of lighting the GPU unlike mapper is currently in development I've just recently made a 3d game and in it I had to play around with like baking and it's insane just how much faster GPU and white matter is it bakes at literally 100 times faster than the CPU and white matter so this won't be a huge help to cut down on iteration times they will also provide out of the box and lighting presets which won't be great starting point then tweak to get the perfect lighting for your project project honey continues being worked on this is a fascinating piece of tech focused on trying to make games with the smallest size possible it's all dots based which makes it extremely performant so it should be excellent for making tiny little web and mobile games definitely look forward to some videos on tiny as it gets closer to release there are tons of improvements coming related to multiplayer and connected games lots of tools are already available and being used in release games for example on Phivolcs the voice service is already being used in apex legends there is multiplied for hosting your games Delta DNA for analytics lots of dots net code improvements and lots lots more they will be covered in detail in the multiplayer and live games roadmap chunk on April 1st alright so that about covers my personal highlights of what's coming to unity in the future these are just the things that I personally find most exciting but there's tons more stuff coming so check out the two blog posts and watch the complete world mapped on point in the description there's also an awesome Q&A thread on the forums who it tons more information I've been using unity since 2012 and it really just keeps getting better and better it's already an excellent engine and the future looks very exciting with development of dots new multiplayer and netcode AI tools and so on so let's all keep making awesome stuff and best of luck in your own projects this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code McKee to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone subscribe to the
