hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and I've just added a free expansion to my turnbased strategy course this one is all about taking the game built in the course and converting it from a square grid onto a hex grid this was the most request topic by students thanks to how all of the code in the course is written in a really nice clean way this actually super easy addition it just requires modifying a handful of scripts and everything else already works perfectly so there's no need to touch the AI the actions the visuals are really anything because all of the code is really clean with as few dependencies as possible this change only requires changing pretty much just two classes the grid system and the pathfinding so this expansion is also yet another excellent example of the power of writing good clean code and how it makes expanding upon your code adding more features and changing things and how that becomes so much easier if you already own the course then this is a free expansion so you already have access to it it's at the end of London lectures and if you don't yet own the course you can get it to the link description it's a really awesome course that will help you take your skills from beginner to Advanced their views have been extremely positive so I'm really happy with how it came out throughout the course I'm constantly talking about writing good clean code and focus on keeping a good code architecture so because of that the final state of the course is very adaptable and easily Expendable this is the first expansion so do let me know what other mechanics and systems you'd like to see in future expansions alright I hope you enjoyed this free update thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
