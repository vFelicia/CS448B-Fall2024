hello and welcome I'm your code Mahi as you might know a while ago there was a Sim Festival that lasted for a week now I'm a bit late with this video I was quite safe for the past two weeks so I'm a bit late but but only never I definitely want to make sure that I make this video my goal with this devlog series is phone transparency so first let's look at the raw number of wishlists Impressions play duration and more then I'll give you my analysis on whether the festival was a success and in the end I'll also mention what are my plans with the game going forward okay so first for some raw numbers I believe this was the biggest Festival of all with over 1200 demos so that means quite a lot of competition for players in just one week during the festival my game demo was played by 1591 people and 5 300 added it to their account it got 855 wishlists taking it from 1550 to 2405. the average General play time was 50 minutes and the median was 13 minutes in terms of views during the festival the game got 600 000 Impressions and 11 000 visits during the festival I also did two live streams and use teams event future sure to promote them and show the live stream on the same page and I also constantly updated the game with 12 updates over the course of that one week so those are the hard numbers now before I get my analysis first of all if you're a native Dev what exactly is a steam Festival in terms of indie game marketing steam festivals are an absolute must nowadays they are a great way to get a bunch of exposure and hopefully gather tons of wishlists to ensure you have a successful launch there are multiple scene festivals per year in order to participate in one your game needs to have a working demo it needs to have a probably coming soon page and importantly you can only participate in a single Sim Festival before release if you're new to indie game marketing I highly recommend you go watch my marketing video if you want to find success with your games and marketing is an absolute must nowadays so you must know about it okay so now here's my analysis on whether this was a success or not the answer is honestly it depends some parts of it went great and some parts not so great first for the positive the most positive thing was the responsive demo the feedback that I got there were obviously tons of issues since the demo was only in Alpha but in general the general concept of the game people did seem to enjoy it I've also had some publisher interest from some preseries Publishers so that means the core game idea is solid however at the same time while the response has been very positive I have to be very careful about how I take that most of the people that play the demo I assume more people just like you meaning people over here watching this channel now I assume that if you're a regular viewer in this channel I assume that means that you enjoy what I do I assume that means my videos have been helpful to you in some way so that means that the feedback that I got is very likely biased towards the positive side whereas on a final release regular steam players have no idea who I am so they will not have that bias so personally I have to be very careful not to be caught up in all of this positive feedback and assume that it represents the regular steam audience because it might not this is the same advice that I would give to you whenever you ask your friends or in family for advice and feedback on your game when you do remember that your friends are not really going to be brutally honest with you they're always going to be a bit more nice than the usual so always keep that in mind when receiving feedback now speaking of the regular steam audience that brings me to the other side that didn't go quite as well and that is actually the numbers I was really hoping to get a bare minimum of a thousand wishlists so getting just 850 that is quite rough with a slow mount it makes a goal of launching the game with at least 5000 wishlists that makes that go really difficult to achieve I'm going to talk about my future plans in a little bit and also 1500 players playing the demo that is also a really small amount I do wonder how many of those are actually people over here watching this channel I would assuming sectional Advanced majority which means the demo really did not get any organic visibility at all for some context one excellent source that I've mentioned a few times is Chris zakowski from how to Market your game he made a real nice post with a ton of stats from last year's Festival in general the median number of wishlists were about 1100 and that seemed to be on an uptrend so getting quite a lot fewer than that amount is definitely not ideal now as to why I think the demo got subpar performance I think the answer is simply that I was way too ambitious with a super tight deadline on the one hand the massive improvements that I managed to do in the 12 updates that I put out once the game demo was live on the festival that was really impressive but on the other hand that really puts into perspective just how we week the very first build for demo ones the median play duration was under 9 minutes that is really low without the updates that did improve massively but that didn't seem to matter by that point I'm not entirely sure how exactly the Sim algorithm works for this case for scene festivals but perhaps launching with a subpar demo caused the algorithm to essentially ignore the demo for the rest of festival and that is why it did not get much or any organic visibility now an Ideal World I would obviously delete the demo until I had it working exactly as I wanted but I cannot control the timing for the Sim festivals if I didn't participate in this one then I would have to donate demo until all the way over to October so in general the question was he seem first of all a success now in terms of numbers the answer is no not at all but in terms of feedback I would say the answer is definitely yes the feedback was very positive and personally I'm still very confident in the game I do think the game is in a really great state right now and I'm really happy with how it's going I'm really excited for the future and for the final phone release if I can build everything that I have in my head then I do believe the final game will be great and now let's see what are my plans for the game for the future her honestly at this point I'm not entirely 100 sure the initial plan was to prioritize this project over the many other things that I would like to do if I focus primarily just on this project I'm pretty confident that I could get it done by some time to Mid late August I know that I can be extremely productive if I focus on one thing and one thing only but with the current wishlist rate of just about 10 wish lists per day with that if I were to release a game in about a month and a half that would mean really just about 300 to 500 wishlists so the total would be just about 3 000 which is a very low amount launching with so few wishlists really makes it difficult for the game to find success regardless of quality now I'm really enjoying the game I do think it's in a great place right now I'm really enjoying the design and testing it so I do believe the game has a lot of potential to turn out really great so the question is do I launch a game with a low wish list amount and potentially risk it becoming a flop even if the game ends up being great or do I take a bit longer to gather a few more wish lists and hopefully launch with better numbers so I can find more success now I really really want to launch a game this year so unless something really drastic happens I am not planning to push generally say it anyway past something like October but I do have those two options so do I focus primarily on this game and work on it essentially full time and get it done by about mid to late August or do I work on it more parttime so kind of mixing working on the game with working on other projects like exploring dots or random tutorials or working on more multiplayer videos I could potentially make a more advanced multiplayer course based on all the things that I learned in this game and at the same time keep working on the game essentially parttime and launch much later on something like October so those are the two options and like I said right now I'm still not sure I'm trying to put myself on the other side of this equation if someone had this exact dilemma and they came to me for advice what would I say I think that what I would say would be if this is your first game then just go ahead and launch it don't wait any longer launching your very first game is super important you won't gain so much more knowledge and it's Helen likely to ever find financial success so for your first game you should just launch it but obviously that is not my case it's not my first game so what I would say if this is not your first game if you're going with this game is to find some level a financial success if so then my advice is if you believe the idea then you should keep working on it and keep slowly Gathering wishlists so after thinking like that maybe I should take my own hypothetical advice and do exactly that honestly making these devlog videos is hopefully interesting to you to see the inner workings behind a proper steam game but these are also extremely useful for me to essentially put my thoughts on on paper and really think through that really helps with decisions like this one so after spending all the time running this video I think I know though the answer I think I will keep working on this game parttime alongside all the other projects that I want to do I won't keep doing devlogs and experimenting with other formats I know some other devs have found tons of success on Tick Tock and Instagram so I'm definitely trying out that format I will keep doing that and essentially plan for release around October with that I should have time to release something like 10 to 15 devlogs and perhaps 20 plus shorts and with all those hopefully some of those will go semiviral and gather tons of wish lists with that then hopefully that won't turn into a total wishlist amount that is really nice by October and then I can launch a game and hopefully the final game is great so it does find success so that's it that's my current plan alright so that's my results and my analysis of the scene Festival I hope you found this interesting and I hope this helps you when you go to participate in your own scene Festival now I get to get back to working on the game as well as many other projects and of course go ahead and add dinky hard as your wishlist and try out the demo alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
