hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so here's a challenge making open World Games is generally really difficult that's one of those genres where it really takes a triple A team so kind of similar to MMOs however nowadays there are tons of really awesome tools that can help you make a game just like that so the challenge is using all of these tools and assets at my disposal can I make an open world game in one week that's the challenge that I attempted so let's see if I manage to achieve this goal stick around to the end to see the final result and check the link in the description for a list of all the essence tools that I used in making this a reality and actually right now all of those are on sale as part of the UNT summer sale on the S store you can find anything from visuals effects tools game templates Shader systems and a bunch more tons of awesome stuff all that any nice discounts so check it out with the link in the description also this video is sponsored by unity so I start my challenge with the most obvious thing which is actually on making the map this is actually a topic that I've wanted to research for quite some time making large worlds like this one requires connecting multiple terrains together and actually streaming them in and out of memory so for that this was the perfect excuse to learn how to use the tool that I've been meaning to look at for quite some time that to only this guy which is a warm building tool it's one of the highest rated assets on the store it has thousands of five star reviews although I was always a little bit intimidated because it's such a powerful and complex serial so it takes a bit to learn but if you want to make an open Run game then a tone like this one is absolutely perfect and actually after diving through the documentation learning how to use it it is actually surprisingly easy it has tons of options to enable you to get the exact open world that you want to build but if you just want something basic then just following the guided setup that will make you quite a really nice world now importantly this also handles the thing that I thought was going to be extremely complex which is the world streaming and guy already handles that automatically we need to find the world size you define it as the size per each terrain as well as the towns for how many terrains you've got on the X and the y axis then when you generate everything is already generated split per each in rain and then it automatically streams those pieces in and out as you move through them so here is a huge open world that I can fly around and all of the various pieces as you can see there are all automatically streamed it's really impressive how easy this was to set up if I were to build this whole system by myself it would have taken me months whereas over here by using this um I just spent a few hours reading their documentation doing some testing and here it is a nice functional open world so this is a really great practical example of how using great tools can massively speed up your development and help you save months or even years of development then with the basic map working I got it set it up to unlock example like I wanted I wanted something like a dark alien scifi planet and for that the first thing that I did is one of the things that I've talked about many times previously in the channel one of the simplest things you can do to greatly improve the vision for your game is just changing out the Skybox for that I use the on Sky pack which is a huge pack with over 200 skyboxes everything from some hyper realistic ones to some anime ones in this case I picked one that looked nice in scifi nice and dark just change the colors for the directional light a little bit and everything already unlocked immediately different and now that the map was done it was time to work on the player I wanted a first person player with first person hands this is another topic that I've been meaning to look at and finally this was the perfect reason to do that I found a nice pack with some first person hands and animations now it is very important that the hands are actually ringed so that I can actually build some animations although the animations included in this bag those are already right it already includes some magic animations which is perfect for example what I want then with the animations working I needed some kind of character controller so yet again I took this opportunity to look into another asset that I've been meaning to look at it's the kinematic character controller and this one actually used to be paid then was made free just a while ago this is one of the highest rated character controls on the store it supports pretty much any terrain so it works on slopes edges steps and so on it even has custom inverted gravity so it's really adaptable so anyways I just imported this one into the project I added my first person hands on top and with that I had my nice first person controller with that done I then just took my working character controller with the hands picked it up from my testing scene and drop it on the map scene and just with that here is my character working falsely I've got a character with my nice hands and animation perfectly walking around this fast huge open world terrain again it's really impressive how I got this far this quickly just by using a ton of really useful tools and assets then the next thing that I wanted was a plane to travel long distances in my mind I was thinking something like just cause where you can essentially spawn a plane that spawns in front of you and you can use it to travel long distances so I grabbed a plane visual from the sentient military pack however I also did not want it to look like a regular plane this game is meant to be kind of scifi and for that I actually used another Super useful tool called colorize this one lets you easily change colors for specific parts of the mesh and it works especially well on low poly meshes you can change the color and importantly you can also change or add a mission so in my case I spent a little bit of time just reading documentation learning about this tool then I just changed the color of the plane on various parts and added some emission to the engines yet another excellent way of improving the visuals for your game is just using a nice custom Shader for this use case there are tons and tons of excellent examples on the store there's many really useful really creative shaders personally I always really enjoy the anime aesthetic so I pick quimly this one is a great asset with tons of options to help you make your game sound Shaden which by the way this is also the exact same Shader that I'm using in my own upcoming steam game dinky Guardians go ahead and edit your wishlist so I have this Shader to the plane and the character's hands and everything looks great then while the player is in first person the enemies are going to be in third person so for that I need some third person animations and for the enemies I wanted them to pretty much just use some melee attacks and for that I found this excellent pack with a bunch of fighting animations the character I'm using is taken from another city pack and it's a regular humanoid character so it already Works automatically with any humanoid animation however for this particular pack this one with some funny animations this one only has fighting animations so it actually doesn't have something basic like a basic one for the animation now thankfully Unity actually has a third person accent it's a character controller that also includes some basic animations so I just use the basic wonk animation from that pack and all the attack animations from the other pack then I get to work on the plane controller this is another thing that I could probably use an essay from the store but I wanted something pretty basic so I just built it myself the tricky part was only handling the rotation since planes can rotate in any axis I did it like I normally do by just changing the Euler angles and that actually caused it to break down completely although thankfully this solution was pretty simple just rotate using quaternions instead of Euler angles and with that yep the plane was working I just added some forward movement I made a basic script for spawning the plane grabbing onto it and jumping out so pretty much the exact same logic that you see in some games like just cause it's a great mechanic for large open World Games next was making some basic enemy AI I use a super simple State machine pretty much it doesn't like I covered in a video a long time ago it just finds a Player move towards it and attacks the animations are triggered so all of it is pretty simple for the player it also needs some attacks so I made it shoot bolts out of the hands for the awesome particles I use the allinone VFX toolkit this one isn't actually an asset with just a bunch of particle effects but rather it's a tool for making particle effects although so it does come with some premade particles so I use some of those and only added some slight modifications the other part is the animation for shooting bolts out of the hands the hand animation did have some handshoot animations but the wind up was a bit waiting long so here's a quick empty tab that also covered in a previous video if you have some animation that you download from NASA pack chances are it won't show up as readonly so you cannot modify it but you can select the animation duplicate it and now the duplicate the animation that one will be editable I did just that and then I cut the first three frames to make it nice and snappy then since I have attacks I also needed some way to deal on damage and for that I actually use my own free has it the health system it's a super basic account system I just attach it to the enemy added some basic Collision logic to the projectiles added some extra particles on hit and that's it it's done also the main part of this open world game is in our Castle's place all over the world the way the player captures those castles is by destroying the castle heart so for building this once again I use a bunch of prefabs from the allinone VFX pack I just played with some settings to make it a little bit more chaotic so added a bunch more Distortion then I just made a nice animation with a cinemasion camera to make it rotate around go up and increase the size of all the facts just did something like that and the end result looks pretty nice with that part down then I polish the logic for jumping on the plane this required making some slight custom animations for example the pack that I was using for the hands is to have any animation for bringing the hand down and for editing and creating animations directly inside Unity for that I use a super useful tool called umotion it's a really great asset if you want to animate directly inside Unity it's especially great because for example with humanoid animations you cannot edit them inside Unity by default but you can with this asset so I made some simple animations coupled with some simple effects I also made a simple Trail render that is shot towards the plane and without jumping up to the plane looks pretty great next was handling the logic for when the player captures a castle I want the world to essentially change color how I did that was some basic logic that played around within light and the volume weight it's just some basic logic checking the player distance to the castle and seeing if the castle has already been captured with that done I got busy on manually placing castles all over this huge world then I made a minimap although this time since I won the full map I did not actually do it like I covered in a previous video where I use a second camera instead of over here I just took a screenshot of the entire world and made a texture then manually placed all the castle icons after that I also used my own asset the mouse cursor system Pro this is a super easy to use asset that allows you to add custom animated cursors to your game in this case I just attached some basic components and use a nice attack cursor on top of the castles and a move cursor elsewhere it's a super simple addition but looks really nice then I also implemented a nice Waypoint mechanic I can click anywhere in the map and it will spawn a huge Waypoint that is visible from very far away this is great for navigation in this huge open world then I populated all the castles with enemies and I use the excellent astar pathfinding project to make them avoid walls put it all together and here is the final game alright so here I've got my player character I can walk around I can shoot volts from my arms I can also open up the map to see where I am in this huge open world and I can see I'm right next to a nice Castle so let's go into down so let's fall straight there and if there's a castle right there so let's approach it and as soon as we go inside yep we do see a whole bunch of enemies so let's try to take them out and avoid them as they try to attack me all right on the enemies are down so now I can take out the castle heart so just fire tons of Bones get it down and there you go a really nice death animation there you go shaking going up any of the castle heart is gone the castle has been captured so the light up there turned green and the visuals on the post processing don't also change so instead of being very dark now there's quite a bit of light now I can use the map again and see okay there's another Castle up there so let's go there I can place the Waypoint and if there's the Waypoint so let's summon in my plane and let me go straight onto it and again I'm on my plane so now I'm traveling a nice long distance super fast and right now the color has changed because I entered into enemy territory and there it is my Waypoint and the castle so I can now jump out and there you go the plane these pawns and here I've Got Another Castle that I can now capture so now you go inside I take out all the enemies then I take out the heart and if there is another Castle nice and captured alright so that's a game that I built now looking at this I would say that I did complete the challenge successfully I did indeed manage to make an open world game all by myself in a pretty short period of time so this is a great practical example of just how powerful and great tones can be how a solo Indie Dev nowadays can do something that previously would have taken weeks and a team of hundreds of people all the stones that are used are currently on sale on the SSR as part of their summer sale so if you'd like to make a game like this one definitely look into those Hills and check out everything else on the sale you can find anything from visuals effects tools game templates Shader systems and a bunch more there's tons of awesome stuff all of it with a nice discount so check out the tools that I use Link in the description and perhaps challenge yourself to build something that would have been previously impossible and use all the tools at your disposal to bring your vision to life alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for
