hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the assur is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for May 24th in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid asset and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also if you need some mes the cint sell is having a sale right now pretty much all of their packs are at 50% off you can build an infinite amount of games with all these and right now the SciFi worlds is 70% off this is the one that I use quite a lot in my dinky Guardians game or if you want a bundle then there's a great one on the asset at 97% off you can get 30 assets for just 30 bucks so there's a bunch of environments a bunch of materials you've got some effects some tools some systems and so on there's tons of stuff with a super deep discount so definitely check out this page to see if anything is interesting all right so on to the top 10 list starting with a nice onscreen pointer that can point to anywhere this is a 3D element so it can point to wherever you want and show it correctly on the UI you can set up the offscreen arrow and also the target indicator when it is on screen so it's a very nice very simple tool and you can also read the code on GitHub next for some fun UI icons here is an animation pack using animated icons can be an easy way to add an extra bit of Polish to your games you could make them for example static by default and then animate them on Mouse over these have various shapes so it's really up to you to decide what exactly do they mean if you like this pack of animated icons if so then then this dev has a paid pack with a ton more then here's a simple question do you need some bread if so then here is some stylized bread you've got 17 prefabs I would think that this is really just a demo of an En larger pack but no not really this is really just a pack it really is an asset pack with 17 pieces of bread definitely very odd but if you'd like to make a game kind of like a bread shop Tycoon if so then this would be great or perhaps if you need some AOE effects here's a nice free pack it features eight effects with shad graphs you've got some lightning there's some geysers some heel and some meteor effects these could be really great if you're making some kind of diablon like action RPG game something to down with tons of effects tons of skills or perhaps a fantasy RTS game with lots of abilities next for an interesting system here is an interaction system it features item pickup it has an inventory there's atom inspection it also has the ability to interact with objects like opening some doors you can either do that automatically or on button input so quite a handful of interactions within this asset this can be a super simple and very quick way to add some interactions to your protypes then if you want to break some stuff if so here are breakable jars vases and pots by breakable it means how you have a normal game object with the object perfectly built and then you have another one where it's broken into pieces now this is really great it's the simplest way to make some simple destruction it's when I covered in my destruction tutorial video If you have a game kind of like Zelda you can just listen to when the player attacks objects like this and then you just instantly spawn the prefab with some pieces spawn them maybe add some explosion with collisions and rigid bodies and just with that everything will fall apart into pieces in a very satisfying manner next for another nice tool here we have a minimalist notepad this is exactly what it sounds like it's a simple notepad like window directly inside of Unity by being a Unity window it means you can dock it anywhere inside your project so you could have for example a notepad right under the inspector this is pretty simple and can be potentially quite useful you can write notes for whatever you want this one is a free version and there's also a paid version if you want to handle multiple notes or perhaps if you need a pixelated character if so look at this one it's a nice soldier with an axe and a shield it features some interesting running jumping climbing animations so in total there's over 30 animations this could be a really great starting point for learning how to animate pixelated characters you can use this pack in order to learn how to figure out how to make the animator work and in the future you can replace it with your own custom pixel characters or perhaps pick up another character from this same developer next if you're making a racing game here is a nice free car model very simple it is literally exactly what you expect it's a nice low poly sports car so really perfect if you want to make a quick prototype of some kind of racing game and if you like this style and you want tons more cars just like this if so this St has tons more or maybe you're making a giant open world game if so and you need some stamps look at these height Maps I believe these can work with pretty much any kind of terrain system so I assume it works with unities builtin system or even Gaia these are stamp so it's really height maps you can just click in order to place all these interesting mountains directly inside your world so you can use these to add some really nice variety directly onto your terrains all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the UN assur for May 24 there's a link to in the description and also check out my own fre p on store all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome awesome patreon
