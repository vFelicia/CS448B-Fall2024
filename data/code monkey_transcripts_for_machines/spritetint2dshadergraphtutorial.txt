in this video we're going to make a nice Brighton shader using Sheila Brown we're going to make both a multiply tenth and a soliton this is a great shader to make Hill and damage effects for your sprites let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with nf2 torrents made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing okay so this is what we're trying to make over here is my normal sprite now I can press this button and there you go you can see how it flash green as if I consumed a health item and I can press another button and there you go it flash red as if to display damage so here we have a nice add color effect but we can also use the other shader for the salutant so I stopped the shader and hit the color and there you go now we have a flat solid color tint the tin color and the script are set through code the script for handling this is very simple we just have this simple script which has a color and a fade speed and on an update we simply lower the Alpha and apply to our tint properly and here in the inspector we can see the shader has two fields one for the base color and one for the tent and in here with an alpha of 0 you can see these pride is normal and as we increase it becomes fully tinted so this is one effect that applies an add tint so there it is very nice and this is the other effect that applies a solid color tint and again we just move the Alpha alright so this is our goal let's get to it ok so here I am in my scene now let's go over here into the project files and create a new shader go down here to the 2d renderer and make a sprite lit graph let's call this our tint ok here we are inside of shader graph now let's begin by going over here into our properties and make a property for our first texture let's set the reference to be underscore main text so this is our main texture and for default I'm going to select the spreadsheet there's a default spreadsheet okay now let's write texture all the way in here and now we simple it so with a sample texture 2d and just connect the texture in there ok now we simply connect the RGB a over here to the master color and you can already see it in here and let's just replace this with a quat ok so far so good we have our nice quad now let's just test this so in here we click on say facet and now back here in the editor let's make a material to use our shader so over here make a new material and in here we can select the shader so we go down into shader graphs and we select our shader okay there it is it already has default texture and everything great so now let's see this in game and if there is the character just standing around looking perfectly normal okay so far so good now let's apply a base color just like any sprite has its base color so back in here let's make a new color properly well let's call this the underscore color and by default set it to white with foam alpha okay now drag it into our graph now we have here our color and here our texture so we can simply multiply both of them multiply the color 2d texture so you can see on the preview that if we change the color there it is we are changing this sprite so now let's test this out and send the out straight into the color in there let's save the acident test any appears our character with our tint so you can see here on the inspector that we have our color field and we can change this in order to tint our sprite all right great however this is not really the tint that we want to make this is just the base so with this one we can modify the base color as well as the base alpha so just like that these prior two vanishes what we're really trying to do is build a tent on top of this one so let's do that so we're here let's make a new color call this our tint and make the reference underscore tint let's set the base color to phone white okay normal and 4/10 let's set it on green and half alpha okay so up here let's drag the property and I mean here it would seem that we simply multiply the tent by the texture down here so the multiply node with this color and this texture just like this however if we do it like this then we end up with the same tent as before as the Alpha goes down the texture becomes transparent so that's not what we want we want the tint alpha to only apply to the 10th color so in here before we multiply these two let's first split our tint color so in here we make a splint node then we input our color and now we have the RGB and a fields so then we take a combined node and combine just the corner so the are G and D B so we don't touch the a so we're here we have a corner without alpha and now we can simply do a multiply and we multiply the alpha by the color that comes out in here so what we've done here is we're applying our alpha to the color and not to the actual transparency so if we modify the attending here if we modify the alpha and go down this one does not become transparent but rather it becomes black so put it up and we have the full color put the Alpha down and we have black alright so with this we can now take this and make a add node and here we add this color on to our texture in here so it really this multiply and instead we have the add add it with this one and then we put her out in here so now you can see over here on the preview our effect as we increase the alpha it becomes fully tinted in green as we decrease the alpha it just becomes the base color so this is exactly how we want our effect to work however if we test this out and just like that you can see an issue now the tint is actually working as intended so in here as I increase its fully tinted as I decrease we have just the base right however the tint is also being applied to the parts that are supposed to be transparent so we need to apply transparency separate from the tent so back in our graph let's go down here and we want to grab the Alpha Channel from our simple texture then we want to take it on to a multiply node so we take the Alpha then we want to multiply it with the color alpha so that means we need to split these four values into four separate values so we use a split then we can take this alpha and multiply it in there by the base alpha and just like down the preview you can see our alpha channel so if we decrease the base color it becomes transparent and on fall it has fun white on the Alpha okay so we can finally take this alpha in here and combine into the converse in here so let's make it combined now in order to combine first we need to split this into three separate values so we split this color then we combine it with these and we use the Alpha from down here and that's it so over here we have the main base code we can use this to apply a base tent and more importantly make the sprite either visible or transparent and then we have our tint collar and in here we can easily define how much tint we want to apply by simply modifying the Alpha so just like this we have max tint applied and just like this we have note into play okay so let's test okay so here's the character with no tenth and as you can see the transparency problem has been fixed so now in here on the inspector we can see our tint field so we can take this and apply a green tint and all we're going to do is simply increase the Alpha so just like this it becomes couple of like tinted now we go down and becomes empty so just like that we have our tint working perfectly we can use any color we want and make it very tinted or not tinted at all so I can use this with a simple script and apply a fading tint on keypress so I press this key and there you go there's a nice green tint as if the character was healed so there it is and press another key and there you go there's a nice red tint as if the character was damaged so with this shader and a simple script you can see that we have a very nice effect over here is the script as you can see it's extremely simple it's only a couple of lines long up here we have our field so film for the material the tint color and the fade speed on awake we simply grab references to our material we initialize our tint color and a basic fate speed then we have a function to set the tint color and set the fade speed and finally over here on the update if the tint color has now a bigger than zero then we're going to lower the alpha by D fade speed multiplied by time to time and we simply apply the tint color into our sailor so this is how we modify simple properties in our shader here in the shader we have our tint color with a reference of underscore tint and that's exactly the name that we use in here in order to modify that property so just like this we have a very simple color constantly decreasing on the Alpha and here on the testing script we simply test for some input keys and we set it in color so this one two green red and blue and again here is the effect pressing key and there you go we have a very nice flash right awesome so now that we have this basic shader working let's make a second version that applies a complete solid tint using this as our base we'll make it very easy so here on the project files let's simply go to the ten and duplicate it and let's call this the 10th solid okay here's our shader now in here this is going to be mostly the same the biggest difference is up here on the x combined and add notes so in here let's get rid of the multiply node and we're also going to get rid of the and so we connect this one directly and now up here let's make a blend node and we modified the mode in order to be over right and now this node blends a value into another one based on a certain value so we have the base the blend and the opacity so you can use the base as our texture just like that now for the plant we're going to plant with our color and for the opacity we're going to use our tint alpha so you can see the node preview and if I increase the alpha on the tenth there you go it becomes a solid color and if it goes down it vanishes right so this is our solid tint so and with this we simply take this one out put it into this point then we point it combine it with the Alpha from down here and we have our output okay so here we have our graph and now here we simply go into our material instead of using the tint let's use the tint solid and let's test and okay there it is and I press the button and there you go there's a nice foam solid tint so press it on green on red and on blue and if we pause and look at the tint and let's put it on green and we increase the alpha and there you go there's a foam flat solid tint so we can apply this to any color and with the alpha it is full and we down it goes back to normal so here is the effect and again let's change for the previous tenant and here is the other effect so with these two it's up to you to decide which one best suits your game
