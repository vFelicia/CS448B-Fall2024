hi there this is a quick tip for how to show custom classes in the editor so let's say I want to set up an array of enemies to spawn and I want to set that array in the editor I could just have three separate arrays like I have in here and as you can see all three of them are there and now I can move around my scene and set my valance here in the code it is set up like this however this is obviously not a good idea we have data that is supposed to be connected but it's split over multiple arrays we could easily get an error if one of these arrays is a different size than the others or if we just put a value in the incorrect index so naturally what we should do since all of this information is meant to be connected is create a class or a struct to handle each specific spawn info so in here we define a private class and we're going to call this a spawn info and now up in here we're going to have each individual field for what we need instead of having all these arrays we should replace all these with an array of spawn info so just like that we have our data correctly grouped however in doing this if we go back into the editor as you can see nothing appears this is because the editor only shows the default data types but we can go back to our code and in here on our private class we're going to add the attribute serializable which is inside the using system namespace when we apply this attribute to a custom class we can now go back into the editor and yep there's our spawn info array since our class has been serializable so now I set the size of one there you go an element and yep it contains all the information in my spawn info so now I can add as many elements as I want and now they are correctly set up element 0 has this position the South must read and so on so the data that we need is now grouped logically and again our array is private and serializable instead of being public and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
