Hello and Welcome I'm your Code Monkey The Asset Store is full of awesome tools and has to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for December 22. In this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and the next ones I'll be covering paid assets and tools Let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them Also here's some excellent news the two best bundles that I've ever seen that happened a couple of months ago they are back for the holidays There is an excellent tools bundle with all kinds of systems and tools So you've got an engine for making a topdown shooter a tool for setting up some light probes You can set up some weather effects set up some 2D lights a better UI and some really awesome fluid animations So lots of excellent tools on this one And then here is the excellent art bundle with tons of visuals and some interesting shaders This one has quite a lot of variety quite a lot of things for example here you have Quibli, this is an excellent cartoony Shader Then a really nice Synty pack a whole bunch of music tons and tons of sound effects You've got some more Shader effects so to pixelize them which looks really interesting You've got some fantasy nature a realistic template A bunch of cute animals tons more animations a bunch of effects and a bunch more So if you've missed these two bundles when they first happened a few months ago then I highly highly recommend you give them a look with the insane 98% OFF discount the entire bundle is worth it just for a single tool or acid And of course the Synty Sale is also still happening So you feel like their pack included in that bundle you can check out the sale and see everything they do Alright so on to the Top 10 list starting off with a simple but possibly very useful tool here is editor autosave It does exactly what you expect you can define a safe time and every once in a while the editor automatically saves It also says it has scene Version Control which is an interesting idea being able to go back to an earlier version can be useful you can limit how many scenes are saved you can do a backup and enable or disable it with a simple click now for me I pretty much subconsciously hit Ctrl s pretty much every few seconds so I don't really need this but if you don't have that habit then this can help you avoid losing a bunch of data next up some great looking props here are some wooden swords I quite unlike the visual on these ones looks really nice you have a sword dagger Katana big sword Roman sword and medieval so these would be perfect for any kind of sword game where you have some kind of training scenario or tutorial up next here is an interesting weird effect it looks very strange very interesting I could see this as being a fun effect to add to something like in loading screen if you have some kind of scifi game then if you're making a game with some roads check out these props you have a bunch of signs some traffic cones a bunch of concrete walls and even some speed bumps after that if you'd like a quick character to add to your prototype check out this cute penguin it comes with 5 Sprite based animations you have I don't walk attack jump and slide so this looks like pretty fun if you're working on some kind of side stronger game then for another interesting tool here is auto level it's a procedural level generator it comes with some editor tools so you can build it directly inside the editor you can rebuild certain sections to find some connection points and a bunch more next up here is a nice pixel art pack features quite a lot of objects lots of variety although no animation so again this would be great if you're making a quick prototype then for another interesting fun tool here is Rainbow playmo Tint it does exactly what you expect it changes the color while in play mode with a nice rainbow color if you're the kind of person who regularly forgets that you're in play mode or not then this can be a bit more visible than just using a solid color next up if you're making a 2d side Roller One easy way you can make your game look much better is just by adding some nice parallax here is a bunch of separate backgrounds to help you do just that it's a simple effect but really helps push your game to the next level and if you want to know how to do it I actually covered it in a video quite a long time ago and then if all you want is just a nice simple and Forest more texture here's one it's seamless so it turns well and has some nice variety Alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the Unity Asset store for December 22. there's links on the description also check out my own free and paid Assets on the store Alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome Patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
