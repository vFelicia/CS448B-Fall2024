hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here's a super quick video of a feature that won't pretty much always improve the look of your game this feature used to exist but then was removed and finally was added back in with unity 2020 which is the version that just recently went into lts you set it in a weird place so some of you might not even know that this was added so for example here is a scene this is from the polygon city asset pack it looks pretty good all the models look pretty great everything looks great so this is how it looks by default and as soon as i enable it if there you go it looks quite a bit better so here is on off and on so what i'm talking about here is called ambient occlusion specifically screen space i mean occlusion what it does is it gives a bit of shadow where there's some geometry so for example on all of these corners in the city you can see as i toggle it yep there you go you get a bit of shadow so the whole thing seems to have a bit more depth same thing over here on the cars without even the collision you can't even tell the car interior but if i enable it if there you go all like that so again what it does is gives a bit of shadow where there's some geometry so it makes it look especially great where the scene is already in the shadow so if i disable it all of these objects that are currently within the sun shadow none of them get any extra shadows so the whole thing seems very flat and with it enabled yep it looks so much better so it makes the whole scene feel much more grounded and i think it makes pretty much every scene look better unless you're going for a very specific channelless look now previously this was available in the old postprocessing stack so in the package postprocessing v2 it exists as an effect but when unity changed to the universal rendered pipeline it came with a new post crossing stack and ambient occlusion was not included as one effect but as i said now with urp version 10 it does have immune occlusion however again if you go into post processing and over here i've got my volume script so this is where you add all the normal effects so i've got a color adjustment and something yet so some very basic post processing however if i go into add another override go inside and nope over here i do not see anything related to eminent occlusion so it has been added but now it's in a different place now the first thing you need is make sure you are using the universal render pipeline version 10 or above if you're using unity 2020 then that's the version it should install then with erp as you know you've got the universal render pipeline asset here it is with all these settings and then you need to select the actual render object and then over here you see the renderer feature so it's in here you click on add a new one and over here you see right away the screen space and mint occlusion so here it is and you can play around all these parameters so increase the radius like that that's way too intense so you can play around with all these values this is a realtime effect so it's really simple to see the changes happen in real time so there it is looking great also since it's a renderer feature it means that it works separate from the volume system so that means that it doesn't work with any of the volume bounds or weight or any of that so i can completely disable post pressing and yep i still got ambient occlusion so that's a good thing because for this effect you really wouldn't want a different intensity in different places and now just in case some of you are wondering there is another type of ambient occlusion this one as it says here it is a screen space image occlusion so it works based on what the camera sees and nothing else so objects outside of the camera are not considered when rendering this effect but the other type of image occlusion that you might be familiar with is the one with baked lighting so if you go into window go into rendering and lighting in here on the light mapper settings you can go down here and see indeed ambient occlusion so you can enable this and there you go set on settings so this setting has always been here but making the lights only works for static objects so you first scene has tons of static objects like for example these buildings then this type of image occlusion does work great but if all these cars were moving then you couldn't use back lighting for them so that's where the standard screen space aiming occlusion comes in so it works on everything like your player moving cars moving objects moving anything it makes all the objects feel much more grounded and in terms of performance over here you can simply down sample so just take this and it will run much better or over here on the source instead of that normal is just going to depth then you define the normal quantity you want so you can go down to low and for the sample count you can also bring it all the way down so even if you're targeting some low end mobile devices you can also include this as a nice setting so i said this was now added back in unt 2020 so now that 2020 is in lts this is the version that i will be using going forward so it's awesome to finally be able to use this effect once again i really think this makes pretty much every scene look better here is the demo again with off on off on so it looks great definitely look forward to some more bet on looking videos in the future all right i hope you found this quick video useful thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
