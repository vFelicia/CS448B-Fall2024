hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this is my highly detailed Day in the Life video of a solo indie game developer and YouTuber my day starts off at 6am through various experiments I have found that my brain works so much better in the morning than night there's no noise or any instructions the whole world is really calm at this time which makes it super easy to stay focused being able to set your own hours to work when you're most effective is definitely one of the main benefits of being selfemployed if you can I would definitely encourage you to experiment with different work schedules figure out what works best for you I get up I make a cup of coffee I sit down and the first thing I do is write my todo list for a day I find it very important to work from a list so I've got todo lists for all kinds of things everything from daily work tasks the only personal tasks things to do on my game videos to write record research and so on I write my main list and I pick up my laptop and I start working now one thing that I won't mention quite a lot in this video is how I like to change things constantly most of the day I tend to work on my desktop but when I wake up I like to work on my laptop just sitting on my couch for me keeping things different is crucial to be able to stay at maximum productivity throughout the day so I open up my laptop check my emails and check Twitter where I pretty much only follow unity and gamedaf people just see if anything happened or if there's any interesting posts then I answer all the questions on my courses and comments on YouTube this is something that I've done since the very beginning of this channel five years ago and I still keep doing it as Channel grows more and more this does become more and more time consuming but I still love it if it grows too much then one day at some point it will become impossible to answer everything but so far it's still manageable answering questions is a great way for me to get my brain certain sometimes there's some really interesting questions that really force me to think about some problem differently or learn something new it also forces me to put into words where I made some choices that I made so it's always great for both the person asking to get a very specific answer and also for me to get better at communicating why did something the way I did and what are the pros and cons then when I've answered all the questions if it's on before 7am I go research some topic or write some upcoming video I always have a near infinite amount of videos on my queue there's only so much stuff that I'd love to cover in research then at seven I take my first of many many breaks I take my dogs outside my dog Tico he's already a bit old and he has a small bladder so he really desperately needs to outside quickly we go out to order the tree and come back inside now I open up the desktop and like I said I like to work from a list personally I prefer to keep a physical todo list so I really just write down by hand I like it physical so it's always right next to me instead of being on a desktop window as the work I'm currently working on my upcoming steam game thing Guardians it's a fun automation Colony building defense game it's coming out next week so go ahead edit your wishlist and stay tuned for the final release I really hope you'll enjoy the game now since at this time I don't have too long to do some work I make sure to pick some simple tasks while this day I worked on updating the theme store Page I rewrote the description and got some translators to unlocalize it in various languages then after two hours of nice focused work around 8 AM my brain is starting to become a bit too drained so it's time for a change and that's when I go to the gym this is another thing that is very crucial to me I generally believe that the main reason why I have never really suffered from serious burnout is simply because I never sacrificed my gym time or my sleep this is something where it's not just nice to have a break to do something different for me it's absolutely essential to keep functioning so I go there and lift some weights get a nice pump get my heart rate running and really just enjoy myself by doing something very different from just sitting in front of my computer I'm also currently training to run my first marathon so most days I also rent a gym and back it's been a nice challenge to combine both lifting and running I come back around 10 AM and as soon as I get home my dogs are always very excited so it's time to go for a walk I take my phone with me and this is a great time to catch up on some articles specifically the two game marketing newsletters that I've mentioned many times game discover KOA and Chris akowski going on a 20minute dog walk is the perfect time to read a little bit and just enjoy nature or simply catch up on regular news for the game industry normally I check polygon for more gaming mainstream news and rock paper shotgun for more PC specific news as soon as I get back home it's time for my very first meal again find out what works best for you personally I really don't like working out with a heavy stomach so I normally work out fastened I only eat after I get back from gym I make my usual breakfast just yogurt with some protein and an apple it's about 350 calories pretty nice with that ready it's usually around 10 20 so it's time to get back to work on my game again I go through my tutorial list and this time pick some more complex tasks this time I was working on finishing up the scripting Logic for the starting spaceship level this is pretty much where the game starts where something bad happens before of the mechanics actually unlock normally at this point this is where I get a nice chunk of undistracted work time which is usually very productive I normally keep my phone on silent and off to the side so there are really no distractions I like to put some music on the background lately I've been listening to either the chainsaw Man soundtrack or some 41 Greatest Hits then around 1pm once again my brain is starting to get tired so it's time for another break this time for lunch in reality I'm a pretty boring person when it comes to food I eat mostly the same thing almost every single day so my usual lunch is really just some nice round chicken with scrambled eggs very simple to cook very high in protein and taste great usually I eat at my PC and usually I eat while watching some YouTube videos either it's something random or I watch videos from other Unity video creators oh and by the way I also tend to watch videos on 2 or 3xpin this is something that I started doing a few years back and I slowly increase the speed nowadays for me watching a video at one time speed just normal speed that makes the person sound really drunk I use this plugin to set YouTube to any speed with this watching something at 2xp it means that a 10 minute video really only takes 5 minutes and since I slowly increase the speed over time I can still fully understand everything anyway so with my online Cheatin it's time to get back to work and at this time I normally work on something a bit different usually writing a video or doing some editing maybe recording or researching something again switching tasks is really one of the main things that allows me to stay productive the whole day it's honestly one of the big benefits of making both games and YouTube videos at the same time it can definitely be a ton of work doing two huge things but being able to jump between tasks is really nice so at this time I'm usually working on some videos but sometimes I'm simply doing just some admin work I am mostly just a one person team behind this channel my games my courses so if there's any bills that need paying or invoices to create it's up to me to do that I have to download the various receipts for my expenses and send them my accountant I need to check any taxes I need to pay and make sure that I pay them on time it's definitely annoying work but this is a proper business it's something that needs to be done so I can keep my job and keep doing everything legally around this time I also like to try reading a bit although honestly I don't do that as much as I would like I definitely need to schedule some time just for reading I'm pretty much constantly reading or rereading code complete too I highly highly recommend this book if you want to take your clean code skills to the next level and for fun earlier this year I picked up my very first manga I already love dragon ball so this was the perfect pick I've been really enjoying it although I haven't read much yet I'm only on the fourth chapter so on the awesome Goku Vegeta fight from the sansaga definitely want to keep reading it now it's time to take the dogs for another one this time might take a longer walk usually around 30 or 40 minutes and I usually take my earphones with me I download some podcasts or random videos onto my phone and go for a walk for gaming news I like to listen to the easy analyze podcast for General gaming videos I like to listen to game ranks for some industry insight and listen to the factor factor the and just for fun and listen to some Dragon Ball discussion videos or from learning more about YouTube and listening to Conan and Samir or creative support and every week I listen to the gamedev show so plenty of options to choose anything to enjoy on mile long however sometimes if I have some bug in my game that I just cannot solve or some random game design problem when that happens I don't take anything with me I find the time walking my dogs is absolutely excellent for General thinking and problem solving sometimes there's a problem that seems impossible to solve and suddenly after walking for a bit the solution becomes crystal clear as soon as I come back home it's back to work I might make some popcorn if I feel like a nice snack I eat lots of plain popcorn the whole day and also a bunch of this I don't know what is the exact name in English in Portuguese it's called Latina but in English I think gelatin is something completely different I think the correct word for this is jello anyways I'm definitely addicted to snacking I'm constantly eating so I try to eat low calorie foods come back to work this time it's pretty serious so I check out some nice complex sets on my game on this day I was working on the mechanics related to the operon system this is the world representation that is running while you're in a different world it's how the game keeps track of resources being generated in every world and transferred between them and when my brain starts to get foggy once again I change how I work usually in late afternoon I just grab my laptop and go somewhere else to work I go to a random coffee shop or the supermarket pretty much anywhere I can sit I use this time to either catch up and answer some more comments or research and write an upcoming video although once a week I don't actually work the whole afternoon something that I've been doing for over 10 years now is volunteering adding local dog shelter it's yet another thing that I do that does not involve sitting in front of the screen so it's yet another way that helps me avoid burnout I love dogs so it's really great to be able to go there help with the cleanup and feeding and of course play with them and here's a bonus fun fact the dogs that I have right now Tico and Teka they actually used to live in this shelter so I actually knew them for years before I ever adopted them I think they first went to shelter in about 2015 they are really great dogs but they are inseparable and there are not many people who want to adopt two ducks at once so they didn't live that the shelter pretty much their own lives and I saw them and played with them every time that I went there and then when my previous dog suddenly passed away in 2021 that's when I decided to adopt him so yeah doing this volunteer work at the shelter is really nice playing with dogs is yet another thing that doesn't inform screens at all and really helps me refresh so once again I really do believe this is yet another reason why I've never suffered from burnout then at the end of the afternoon at around 6 PM that is usually when my videos go live although this part is pretty automated I I watched a video and validate everything in the early afternoon then just set it to schedule to go live on both YouTube and my website the video emails on the website they're all sent automatically if you don't want to depend on the YouTube algorithm showing you videos you can set up your account on the website to receive emails at around 7 PM it's roughly dinner time although I don't actually normally eat a regular dinner like most people once again over time through experimentation I have learned what works for me and what doesn't growing up with my parents we always had a really heavy dinner around 9pm and I just found out that always made me really sluggish which then massively impacted my sleep so nowadays usually my dinner is really just some popcorn and some yogurt so something really light although keep in mind that definitely does not mean that I starve I simply eat a lot throughout the day in fact my big problem is always eating too much every day I normally eat around 3000 calories I then maybe do a little bit more work usually something wrong light perhaps just watching some videos for research or just entering some more comments and questions nothing too intense then at about a 30 I try to stop working although I still do some things somewhat related to work usually at this time it's when I like to watch videos from either a spider cat or wonderbots or orbital potato since I don't really have time to play games myself watching someone plays how I can keep up with all the awesome games that are coming out these three specific channels are really excellent if you're interested in the massive amount of indie games that come out each month again I watch them at about 23 X speed so a 40 minute video really just takes about 15 minutes I watch those as well as some random videos I like to watch a little bit of everything then around 9 9 30 then it's time for bed like I said I really don't sacrifice my sleep for anything so even though I do wake up pretty early I also go to bed very early I fall asleep and just get ready to do it all over again the next day all right so that's a day in my life I like making stepbystep tutorials so this is probably the most detailed in the life video that exists I hope you found it interesting to see how I managed my life hopefully some of this can be helpful to you although my main advice is really just experiment with yourself and figure out what works for you definitely do not just blindly copy my routine everyone is unique perhaps you work better at night perhaps it makes more sense for you to work out in the afternoon perhaps you prefer some like yoga overlifting or perhaps you prefer playing games instead of just watching them or perhaps you prefer solid and broken chunks of work instead of many breaks so really my best advice is really just do some experiments and figure out what works for you when you unload alright so now I gotta finish editing this video and get back to work I'm working really hard to make the best game that I can make the only state is just next week so stay tuned for that thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
