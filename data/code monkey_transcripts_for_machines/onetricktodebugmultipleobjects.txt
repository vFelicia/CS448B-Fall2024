here's the tip for debugging when you have multiple objects of the same type now usually you write a simple debug.log to see what is going on inside of script but if you have multiple objects of the same type it can be really hard to see what object is firing which message for example here in my game I want to inspect just this one Dy right now the console is showing messages for every single dinky so here's the tip add a string field and expose it in the editor you can add a text area to make it easy to read now instead of doing a debug. log I just set the debug string field on that dinky now with the game playing I can inspect that individual dinky and see debug.log for that one diing this is super useful for debugging individual objects when you've got a ton of them
