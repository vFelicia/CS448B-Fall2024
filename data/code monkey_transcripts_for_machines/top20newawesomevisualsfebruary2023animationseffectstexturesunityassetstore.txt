hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the ssaurus full of awesome tools and asked to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for February 23 even if you don't pick up any of these it's not great to unlock them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these asses is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all of the kinds of games that I could build this one is unless of paid ads and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new asses and best tones and systems as always there's links to the apps in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off it or humble has just launched a new bundle full of cinti assets as you probably know I live there in low poly style the bundle has tons of variety with 20 packs with the usual super dip discount at 97 off or if you prefer something more realistic there's another one with tons of highres military Assets Now this one is technically an unreal pack but you can just import it into unreal and then export the meshes which you can then import into ENT do you want to learn from a veteran in the AAA industry this environment has just launched the game developer bootcamp which is a massive course covering on last civilian development great for both beginners and more advanced users importantly there is a live q a every week alongside scheduling office hours so you can jump on live call and ask any questions you have learn about DNT fundamentals in csharp learn about multiplayer to the lighting 3D physics Safe Systems game design patterns and a bunch more the lectures are going to be released on a weekly basis and the weekly live q a will be focused on making sure you understood everything for that week so instead of binging a course and not learning anything this way you make sure you truly learn the contents of each lecture although of course some of the lectures in the QA won't be recorded so you can always watch or rewatch everything at a later time so if you want to learn how to make games from a veteran in the industry and join the live q a then check it out to the link in the description alright so starting off with a really nice Shader for easily adding outlines and highlights it looks really good with lots and lots of settings you can easily add certain effects while invisible and a different one while included it even works with Sprites and up next here is an asset to add something that honestly I wish Unity had by default that is screen space Global illumination this adds some really high quality and lighting that definitely improves how your game looks it's a screen space effect which means it's not as detailed as Ray tracing but still looks pretty great and it's obviously much more performant than using actual rate tracing looking at the video it does produce some gorgeous results next if you want to populate your world with a bunch of birds here's a bunch of them as a nice particle effect making them as particles is a great way to add some extra life to your game without requiring a big performance hit and despite being particles they actually look very natural flying around randomly with some nice animations then here we have a really nice animation pack all about fighting with the staff definitely a very unique weapon and with all the trails it looks really great this dev has tons of excellent animation packs with all kinds of writing next for some 2D here is a nice top down town set this one features an insane amount of tiles in total over 15 000 so that's huge it also includes a thousand animated tiles so if you're working on a 2d game and you don't like building worlds then this is pretty much all you need or maybe you're working on a horror game if so here is a spooky Corridor personally I am not a fan of horror and I definitely find This chords are pretty scary so that means it's good I could see this being really useful for making a game where the player isn't looking at the corridor and when they're not looking the corridor suddenly changes just without one mechanic and with this asset you could build a huge game for your player to enjoy if you're working on a football soccer game then check out this animation pack it features almost 250 animations so that would include everything you could possibly want in a game of this type so if you've ever wanted to build your own FIFA then this would be a great starting point next for some particles here's a bunch of beams and lasers they all look really great in total you have 17 VFX this could be excellent for some kind of Magic game or maybe some scifi for some laser weapons or maybe it could even be something like Dragon Ball Z with a bunch of beam struggles then here's a really gorgeous looking scene the screenshots look absolutely stunning the S themselves are nice but the scene setup is really truly excellent so this has a d screenshot this really showcase the power of unity herp for something a bit more cute here is a bunch of nice characters they've got a very nice blocky style I quite like it they use a regular humanoid mesh so they work with any animations it really has a massive amount of content over 500 meshes so those include base meshes as well as some attachments you could definitely build many many games just from this one pack up next here's an interesting one it's a pack with a ton of vegetables I made a mini farming game from an asset pack a while ago and I could see this asset being used to push that idea even further you have 10 different vegetables each with 5 growth stages so if you want to make a farming game then this is definitely a great starting point then if you want just one really cute character and look at this one very nice style cartoony with a nice big head also includes some props swords and shields so this would be the perfect style for some kind of nice RPG or maybe you just want one giant animation pack here's one for female animations includes more than 500 animations so you have everything from some basic animations some emotions a bunch of dying animations lots of idols and some weird ones that I have no idea what they represent if you like this pack then this tab has another one for male and a bunch of others next if you're working on a SciFi game here's a modular space station interior features some super high quality meshes 4K attach measures with PBR materials it's all for egrp so they don't look great on the pieces easily snapped together so you can have some fun building a nice space station then here's an interesting one it's a bunch of voxel meshes with a Roman Greek style it features over 400 buildings and almost 100 ships the interesting thing is they are only as dot Vox files which apparently includes all of the voxel data which you can then export into a regular mesh definitely very interesting or maybe you want some gorgeous fantasy box if so look at this one they are all really gorgeous I definitely love how all these look tons of detail on all kinds of elements you've got lots of different books as well as some nice boards ingredients so if you have some kind of magical game these would be some gorgeous items up next here is a nice slime monster it's rigged and animated with 14 animations definitely a strange mesh it's definitely a slime if you like this then this dev has lots more unique looking monsters then for some UI here is a giant scifi pack looks very futuristic lots of glow everywhere it includes all of the UI as well as a nice UI manager script and a bunch of custom inspectors then for some interesting sunlight characters here is an nice pack they include some blend shapes so with that you can get tons of variation it's an interesting style cartoony but not real and low poly or maybe you need a gorgeous environment if someone look at this Village the screenshots look absolutely gorgeous very appealing look lots of saturation so very animallike it also includes modular building Interiors so you can build your own alright so those
