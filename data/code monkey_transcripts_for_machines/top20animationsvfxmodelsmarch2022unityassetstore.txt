hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the assessor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for march 2022 even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them and see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all the kind of games that i could build this one is a list of paid ads and effects i've already made two videos covering the best free new assets and the best tools and systems check out the entire playlist if you haven't seen it as always there's links to the ass in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order and there's also a sale active on the store right now it has a time travel theme and a bonus coupon for an extra 10 off there's quite a bunch of interesting assets on this sale for example the allinone vfx toolkit this one is excellent it's from the same developer as the allinone sprite shader that i covered in a review then if you need more cinti assets over here is a really nice modular fantasy hero you have a complete game template for making a colony simulator there are some portals some fog a nice shader effect and a bunch more stuff so check out the sail and see if anything you're interested in is currently this gun alright so starting off with the latest cinti polygon package as you know i'm a huge fan of their style however i'm definitely not a fan of horror games i scare way too easily but visually the pack is excellent as usual so if you're working on a horror game and you need a spooky mansion with tons of creepy things then check it out and up next a bunch of character effects it's even using cinti characters to demonstrate it but this works on any mesh quite a lot of effects you've got some basic ones and some more interesting ones like making a character turn into stone then if you want to build a realistic city with some highend realistic assets look at this one it looks really gorgeous really high in models and textures has a simple scene with day night cycle and even a rain toggle right now it's hdrp only but apparently there's a urp version coming soon or maybe you want to do some work in game so here's a bunch of power tools very high in models with a really nice look it has tons and tons of variety i don't even recognize half these tools then over here is a fun one it's a whole bunch of textures meant for making visual effects over 600 textures you've got lots of slashes explosions wind icons and more for me this one actually showed up as free i think it's because i already have the allinone vfx toolkit pack that one is an excellent tool for making visual effects and these textures are part of it and this one is also by the same developer that made the allinone sprite shader which is an excellent asset that i covered in a dedicated asset review video then if you're having some shader performance issues maybe look at this one it's a great looking mobile optimized shader it's got tons of features tons of texture maps you can add to make all kinds of visual looks and again it's supposedly extremely performant then here's a fun one a fantasy map creator it features more than 100 different landscape elements and objects lots of types of paper both with and without patterns in a huge resolution and if you're making a game with some aliens then this one looks like the perfect environment you've got lots of weird shapes with some pulsating animation and visuals all of them with some really high end textures looks really great especially when pointing a flashlight and if you have an alien game then chances are you also need a spaceship so look at this one it's a spaceship with fully built interiors it's got a nice realistic art style some sliding doors a cockpit thrusters and much more up next here's a great looking aztec temple this is the kind of thing that would fit perfectly in a tomb raider or uncharted kind of like game these are very highend models with tons of modular pieces then for some vfx here's a bunch of earth skills there are some hits falling rocks raised walls spikes and more i really like the puffs of smoke on this one they've got a really high frame count makes it feel really satisfying for something pretty unique here is a clothing store i guess if you have some kind of open world game in a large city then this one could be the interior to whatever clothes shop you have up next if you want some orcs with some modular pieces look at this one lots of parts you can enable or disable so just with this pack will give you pretty much infinite variety it's a nice style it's low quality but not made by cindy studios and i think it looks great or maybe you just need some vfx look at this one features 60 projectiles you've got tons of orbs spells fireballs arrows and much more then over here is a nice looking forest with tons of vegetation these are some high quality world scan assets so they all have perfect scale and great textures up next over here is a modular soldier the proportions and material makes it look like this is taken straight from fortnite so definitely that style if you want it it's got quite a lot of parts and if you like this specific style then dev has tons more then for some 2d here's a bunch of parallax backgrounds they contain several layers so you can really give your 2d game lots of depth features various styles including forest desert swamp and more for some more 2d if you're working on a pixel art game and you need some tiles here's a nice pack it's got over 700 tiles lots of variety you have caves buildings inside and outside and much more up next here's an interesting one a bunch of old school cars all of them from the 50s 60s and 70s they've got new brands but they are very much inspired by american cars and then here's another unique one a super highend gorilla model this is really highend with some 4k textures and also includes a bunch of animations this dev also has tons more animals so if you're making some kind of zoo tycoon game then check it out alright so those are my top 20 new assets on the int astasor for march 22. there's a link so in the description and as a bonus you
