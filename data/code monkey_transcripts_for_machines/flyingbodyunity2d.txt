hello and welcome I'm your code monkey Lin this video we're going to make a very satisfying flying body animation we're going to add it on enemy death to make it very impact on satisfying let's get started so I have my scene here I have a pointer character enemies are currently being spawned and I can damage them with my sword now right now when they die they simply disappear let's make them fly now I have a prefab here with a sprite of the enemy dead body so when an enemy is killed after the enemy is destroyed we want to spawn the dead body and send him flying what so let's begin by creating a new csharp script and name it fly body ok now in here let's remove this and add a public static void a create function that won't create our flying body so inside we're going to receive a transform for a prefab of our dead body a vector3 for the spawn position and another vector 3 for our fly direction so in here let's instantiate our prefab into our spawn position with a quaternion dot identity this will be our flying body transform ok now on this transform we want to add the component for our flying body and now we want to call a setup function on our flying body component for that setup we're going to send it the fly direction okay great so now down here let's add a private void setup on our setup we're going to receive a vector 3 for our fly direction and we're going to store it as a member of the variable so now on our private void update we are going to move the transform towards the Phi direction so transform that position as equals Phi direction I'm dot double time okay so this class looks good for now let's go back into our game handler script and in here you can see I just have a pretty basic code I got the camera which is following the player I got a reference to my player on this for my enemies in here the players being in Senshi ated I'm setting up the list setting the camera to follow the player and I'm using function periodic to spawn an enemy every 1/2 second function periodic is part of the code monkeytales which you can grab at Unity code monkey calm and the camera phone script is part of a previous video which you can check out so now in here my player Hammer script is actually sending an event for on enemy kill so we're going to use that to spawn our dead bunny so since this is triggered after the enemies kill right here is where we want to go into our flowing body dot create we're going to send our prefab for the enemy dead body which will set up soon right here this event passes the event arts which contains the enemy handler and the enemy handler contains a get position so this will give us a position of the enemy that was just killed and for our fire action we're going to calculate it y direction which won't be based on D enemy's position mine is the player handler dot get position now we're going to normalize it okay and send it in here it's now up here let's set another serialized feel private transform PF enemy dead body okay so now when this event is fired we're going to create a enemy body which won't call this function so let's see if the enemy if the body is spawned and flies away back into our scene here with the code compound going to here and we're going to drive our reference to our enemy dead body so let's test it okay I'm here when an enemy spawn going to hit them three and there you go that body was spawned and moving very slowly we obviously need to make that go a lot faster but the bodies are currently being spun okay great so back into our script here and let's first make a float for our fly speed and let's say about 150 should be good we're going to multiply okay and now right now this game object is just flying until infinity so let's make sure it gets destroyed after some time so appearance my a private float timer and an update simply increase the timer was equals time dot dot the time now if timer is bigger than let's say one second that's probably more than enough time for the body to leave the screen and we're going to destroy this game object okay well let's see if the game object is being destroyed and if it is moving faster okay here I am worse there he goes boom he goes away any vanish as you can see on the hierarchy that the dead bodies get spawned and get destroyed after some time and they are correctly moving in the correct direction with a decent speed calling freeze that a little bit more okay well it's good for now so back in our code here we're going to make him move a little bit faster and for a better effect let's also increase the scale going to transform local scale and we're going to increase it by vector 3.1 times the scale speed times time dot dot the time for our scale speed let's make it about twentieth okay let's test it out okay there goes and boom there goes it's a bit too much but yep that's the effect we want okay back into our code let's reduce this for a little bit and actually for start we're going to want to start a little bit more so transferring all on scale equals let's make our vector 3.1 times let's increase at double the size so the starting scale is already bigger and let's see okay there you go it's looking pretty good now the speed actually has to go a lot faster but it's going good so for our speed and here we're going to make it 30 for scale let's just make it seven but it's looking good for now okay so for another effect let's add some rotation so let's store our Euler load the owners end and here on transform dot local Euler angles we're going to set the new vector 3 0 0 Zed and our Euler's end won't increase by your speed times time Delta time so for our your speed let's make it 360 which is one rotation but that's not enough that would be just one rotation per second we want this to make a bit faster so let's say four rotations per second okay let's test it out and see how it's going okay here I am and I can hit them boom there goes flying away and the speed is actually still one a bit lower let's increase the speed a little bit more this is all about tweaking values to make it as satisfying as possible ok now in here in this scene I also have my blood handler class which is spawning those bullet particles that you see so let's add that while he's so fine so I'm going to go into my handler class and spawn one for the amount let's say five particles on location transform dot position and for Direction will be the opposite of our flight direction so ydirection times minus one okay let's seek those particles are being spawned okay there's the enemy I'm gonna hit him boom oh look at that there you go they're always going and leaving a trail which makes killing the enemies quite satisfying okay so as a final effect let's add some screen shake I have a function here in my camera and when enemies come let's just create a new shake I have an intensity let's EQ and timer for 100 milliseconds and let's give it one final test okay here's my player there's an enemy boom boom boom there he goes and there you go we made a very satisfying flying dead body so if you want to add a very overthetop effect on enemy death you can use this to make your game feel much more satisfying to play ok so there you go if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them alright see you next time
