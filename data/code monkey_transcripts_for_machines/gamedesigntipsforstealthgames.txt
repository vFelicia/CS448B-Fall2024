personally I'm always a fan of gorilla style gameplay where you control basically a small team and you have to sneakily take out a very large enemy Force the game basically has a mechanic where you start off hidden and as long as you are hidden you can take out tons of enemies silently although there is also a really nice noise radius I like how the game gives you perfect information so before you attack you can see okay is this going to make me discovered or not as a game designer you always have both options do you want to give the player perfect information or do you want her to be some Randomness involved in both options are personally valid it just depends on what kind of game you're trying to make
