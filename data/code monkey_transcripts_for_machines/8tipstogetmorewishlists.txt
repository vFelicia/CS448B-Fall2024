hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so last week I made a video analyzing the results for the Sim Festival I looked at the raw numbers for my game and I analyzed what they meant now in this video let me tell you some lessons that I learned some very practical lessons as well as my advice for when you participate in your own scene Festival so you can find success okay so starting with the most obvious actional advice which is simply make sure you participate in a steam Festival if you're an indie Dev and you want to find success nowadays then a Sim Festival is definitely a must it's an excellent opportunity to have players play your game get a lot of feedback and hopefully get tons of wishlists a good demo can get you tens of thousands of wishlists which can massively increase your odds of finding success you can find the various dates for the various upcoming Sim festivals the next one is going to be in October you can only participate in a single Sim festival with your game so make sure you choose the one right before release and the reason why you should choose the one right before release listening to my second piece of advice which is you should make sure your game demo is as published as can be ideally it should be very close to the final game with quite a lot of Polish everything must be ready now in my case I did not follow this advice which actually ended up hurting the demo quite a bit and the reason why I didn't follow it wasn't out of ignorance or anything it was simply because this game is on an intentionally short death cycle so I really had to rush to get any demo running I couldn't really publish something properly but for your games for your serious projects my advice is definitely make sure you make a nice polish demo even if the full game isn't yet fully polished itself definitely make sure the demo is as polished as can be so think of it as kind of like a super polished vertical slice it is much much better to have a small but highly polished like 30 minute gameplay demo it is much better to do that than have like 10 hours of something that is just meddling the next advice is also related to having a great demo which is make sure you also have a great tutorial this is another thing that my game demo lacked and once again for the same reason like of time demos are super short and super quick so your players need to be able to learn how to play the game super fast with literally thousands of free demos available during any of these festivals your game players will not stick around if anything is even slightly annoying so a great guy the demo that slowly teaches your players how to play your game that is of the utmost importance one very important snack to keep track of this is essentially play time now on Chris zukowski's website how to Market your game there's a really nice Benchmark page in there there are tons of data including a really nice Benchmark for demos basically for bronze You've Got 7 minutes for silver you've got 18 gold is 38 minutes and diamond is 65 minutes now also remember this is median this is not average that is a huge important distinction you can see just how insanely good your demo has to be in order to keep the players engaged in a free demo for 65 minutes that is extremely difficult now in my case because my game demo did not have any sort of tutorial when the demo first came out the initial average was actually pretty bad it was a pretty bad nine minutes however after implementing a proper tutorial and tons of changes the average did shot up to about 13 minutes and that's just the total median for the entire play duration of all of the players if I look individually at each day I can see a really nice upward trend line so this really shows you the importance of having a good demo to easily teach your players and easily guide them to know how to play your game do make sure your demo has a really nice smooth difficulty curve so your players keep enjoying the game again remember during these festivals there are only thousands of games available so if your game has just one slightly thing that is slightly annoying or not very well taught to the players they won't very easily just quit and go on to the next game another piece of advice is make sure to implement analytics this is another one that I didn't quite have at lunch although I did manage to implement it by about the 10th update analytics is excellent for helping you identify how players are actually playing your game remember that most players won't actually take the time to leave some written feedback so in order to figure out how the silent majority is actually play your game then having some analytics really helps wouldn't very obvious use case is ADD analytics to your tutorial make sure you want tons of events at every single stage of the tutorial in my example I noticed there was a big drop off in the stage for creating a free crate container now I didn't add tons and and tons of analytics events so I need to do some kind of guesswork in order to figure out why this dropoff happened based on this data in my case I just added lots more flashing arrows in order to make that stage in the tutorial make it a little bit more straightforward and with that I did manage to increase the complete percentage on that series return from 91 to 94 so that's a pretty nice Improvement ideally you want as many players as possible to go through your entire tutorial and complete your phone demo and hopefully at the end which one is your game although honestly I don't know what are some stats for that I don't know what is a good percentage between players and wishlist added but obviously you should aim for as many as possible so in order to keep track of how the sound majority is actually playing your game make sure you implement analytics related to that another advice is make sure you implement Cloud Diagnostics now this is one that I did Implement right before the demo in live this is a Unity tool that helps you very easily see all kinds of crashes and bugs that happen in your game and it's all automated which again helps you update the game in order to fix any bugs even without getting direct bugger reports directly from your players you can see what went Kronk and either try to figure out the root cause and try to fix it or maybe just add some safeguards add some ifs in order to make sure that if whatever issue happens again it does not break the entire game another advice on another useful tool is add some kind of feedback form directly inside your game like I said very few people will actually take the time to write some feedback that is why it is so valuable when those people take the time to do so most people really just quit the game soundly that's why I'm always so thankful for any kind of feedback that I get it is extremely useful and because this because of how valuable feedback is you should make it as easy as possible for players to give you their feedback this is way to do that is to have some kind of feedback window directly inside the game that way players don't have to go into YouTube comments or scene forms in order to give their feedback they can just type in directly from the game and you receive that feedback now this is another thing that suddenly I didn't quite have the time to implement but I do know there are a bunch of very useful assets on the store that do exactly this so you can experiment with one of those or of course you can always build yourself some of those assets are pretty Advanced and they even let you include a screenshot which can make it super easy for debugging then some more advice based on wishlist there is one theory that some part of your visibility during the Sim Festival is actually going to be based on your performance before the theme Festival I don't think this theory has been confirmed but it does make some sense basically games that are already showing to have some interest before the festival won't be shown much more during the festival based on this what you should do is really push the game right before the festival so in the one to two weeks leading up to it now in my case I did end up trying that I did do a bunch of shorts and a bunch of devlogs in the week right before the festival so in the week right before I did manage to gather 150 wishlists although I have to say this was really stressful it was really difficult to be able to make these videos these shorts at the same time as I was desperately trying to finish the game demo on time and on this one like I said this is just an unconfirmed Theory so there's no way of knowing if this matters at all or not maybe I did get some extra visibility during the festival because I did those videos or maybe didn't end up doing anything but still if you can do it if you have a nice process for promoting your game a little bit more then maybe try doing that right before the Festival begins another piece of advice is make sure you do some live streams during the festival theme lets you create two Live Events where you can go alive during the festival and they will be promoted on the festival homepage this can cause a nice little extra bump I did that myself although in my case instead of actually playing the game I spent the live stream building the game which honestly I think is probably a better thing since all the other developers will likely be playing their game so making it a development live stream might make it a bit more unique a bit more standout personally I use restream in order to stream directly to both YouTube and on scene for some stats on how those seem live streams went I end up making two of them for the first one it got 6000 views 300 concurrent viewers and 17 average seconds viewed and for the second one which I published literally just one hour before the theme Festival end which was a bit too late but still on the second one it still got 5K views 600 viewers and 3 minutes and 17 seconds average view duration honestly these numbers are actually pretty good these match what I get on YouTube and on YouTube it took me five years to to build up this audience so on Steam you can get similar numbers without having to put in all that much work so that does seem to be pretty good however at the same time I'm not sure if that translated into any wish list at all looking at the stats I'm really not seeing any individual bumps but still it's a nice bonus it's one of the main features for the festival so do make sure you do some live streams when you do participate so all of those those are my apiece advice for you when you participate in your own Sim Festival like I said participating in a steam Festival nowadays is definitely a must it can literally make or break your game a good demo can get you tens of thousands of wishlists which can massively improve your chance of success when the game finally comes out hopefully if you follow all these Subs you won't greatly increase your chance of finding success in the final release so I generally hope this advice helps you and I wish you the best of luck with your games alright so if you found this useful you can go ahead and help me by adding dinky Gardens to your wish list thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
