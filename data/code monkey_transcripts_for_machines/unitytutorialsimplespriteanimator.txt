hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to create a simple sprite animator let's get Sir ok so I have my basic scene here and in my textures I have a wonk spreadsheet which contains four frames of animation since this animation is based on frames we want to display frame 1 than frame to frame 3 etc so in order to set up our sprite to support frame animation that is change our sprite mode to multiple hit apply and on my sprite editor going to slice by cell size and this spreadsheet contains frames that are 170 in width and 256 in height so slice it and there you go I got my first frame second frame third frame and fourth room okay hit apply and okay our sprite sheet and frames are now correctly setup so let's make a new C sharp script and name it sprite animator so in here we want to cycle through an array containing all of our frames let's set up that array which will be a private sprite array and call it frame array we're also going to need to store the current frame that is being displayed so a private game for any frame and we need a time where to store the time that the current frame is being displayed so private float time okay now on our private void update we are going to first of all increase the timer by I'm dot Delta time and then here for now let's just make one frame per second so if timer is bigger than 1/2 then timer minus equals now and we're going to increase our current frame so after one second we're going to reset the timer and increase our current frame and then display our current frame so getcomponent the type sprite renderer dot sprite it won't be on the frame array in the sprite that is in the index current frame okay so we are increasing our frame every second and this point let's see what it looks like back into our scene here and create a empty game object let's say our sprite anim going to drag our script and in here we actually need to make this serialized so that we can set up in the editor there we go I have my frame alright and here just a bonus tip you can unlock the current inspector while you select all your sprites and drag them in there add the sprite renderer so we can display our sprite well it's serif by displaying our first fright there's my object and let's see it there your first frame second frame third frame fourth firm and now it crashes because we went array index out of range okay so let's make sure that when you reaches the final one it resets back to frame 0 so in here instead of just increasing the current frame we're going to current frame equals current frame was one and then get the remainder of the division by the frame array length so this way when current frame reaches frame array dot length which in this case is four you won't automatically reset to zero okay let's see if our animation is now correctly looping okay there give a first for any secondary fourth frame and yep exactly it is now working correctly ok great so now instead of increasing every second let's make our frame rate into a variable so make a private float frame rate and let's say a hundred milliseconds and in here instead of testing bigger than one second let's just test if it is bigger than the frame rate and decrease by that amount okay let's see it okay there you it is now running at a hundred changing frames every 100 milliseconds which equals ten frames per second now let's clean our code and make it a bit more performance by storing a reference to our sprite renderer so we don't have to constantly do get component on every update so up here a private sprite renderer call it sprite renderer and we're going to grab it on void awake it makes sprite renderer equals game object active component a type sprite renderer okay and now in here instead of constantly using getcomponent we're just going to use our cache sprite render great and there you have it a very simple class that takes a set of frames and place them sequentially as always you can download the project files in utilities for free from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best Internet okay see you next time
