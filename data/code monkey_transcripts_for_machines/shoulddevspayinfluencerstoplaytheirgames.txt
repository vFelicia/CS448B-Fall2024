hello and welcome I'm your K monkey So lately on Twitter there's been a really interesting discussion about whether or not Game Dev should pay for YouTube coverage YouTube or twitch any kind of creative coverage it's one of those things where there's been quite a bit of backlash but if you look through it there's actually quite an interesting discussion going on also before I go any further on this video let me just point out that Mike himself he posts out an apology he realizes now that he completely missed the mark and that he says that he absolutely does value the work that YouTuber and cont creators do and his original words did not reflect that at all so let's see what this whole discussion is about to learn from it but please don't go in ahead and harass any developer in the publisher the whole thing started off from this post from Mike Rose talking about the recently released game Spirit here and talking about how apparently it got zero coverage on YouTube at all and then the main one was right here which is basically YouTubers want you to pay them to cover your games but I just don't want to do that it feels weird and icky and disingenuous so this is the thing that caused a lot of backlash a lot of people got rightfully upset at this comment it does come across as quite a lot tonee especially how if you go to the top of this post this whole thread is basically broadcasting just how successful their game is how it made a million dollars in sales in just one week it was profitable from day one so this is a hyper successful game made tons and tons of money and Mike he's the CEO from no more robots this is another hyper successful publisher with tons and tons of very successful games so the senders was a big one hypnospace Outlaw that was another big one yeser gray very successful let's build zo very successful so tons of very successful indie games and again over here talking about just how successful the game is so yep that does come across as quite a lot toned def when then it says okay we made a ton of money we made millions of dollars but we don't want to pay any money to anyone covering our game on YouTube so because of that there was quite a lot of backlash for the most part people saw it as pretty much just disrespectful to people who cover indie games for a living and do it pretty much for free that is a really tough business it's nearly impossible to make money covering indie games but people do it anyways they do do it mostly for the love of it so the fact that those people are trying to get paid for the work that they do a lot of people consider that pretty reasonable so a game that is hper successful being unwilling to pay for any coverage at all and just calling it iy that does feel quite a lot tede honestly on this issue I think I can see both sides of it meaning I can obviously see that creators are extremely useful a Creator can definitely make or break in any game so I think creators especially nowadays are extremely valuable for the entire indie game ecosystem but at the same time I can also understand this feeling of making it feel icky and disingenuous I think the split over that comes basically on time Aaron who is also a very successful in developer made the very successful game race the Sun and many others he post what I think is pretty much exactly the reality which is how it's interesting how expectations around game coverage have changed in the last decade and Mike is really coming at it from the old school point of view that paying for coverage is considered scumming now for me I can definitely understand this point I remember when I started getting into game development and any games in general about 10 years ago ago and back then pay of for coverage did seem quite a bit disingenuous back then during the total biscuit days people covered games just were in love of it just for the love of indie games back then if a indie game developer sponsored a YouTuber to cover their game people would consider that to be pretty much selling out they would consider that to be a very negative thing I think the issue is back then players considered these kinds of videos to be sort of mini reviews so it definitely felt a bit strange to pay for a review it is also the simple thing that 10 years ago being a content creator that was not really a job nobody can that a job whereas nowadays it is a very viable career path then of course over time especially when the whole at apocalypse thing happened over here on YouTube when that happened it became hard and harder to make any sort of money by covering games especially indie games that don't usually get millions of views so because that content creators had to start taking things more like a proper business which in turn means obviously getting sponsored to do kinds of things so they can keep making videos so nowadays do seem pretty normal to pay for coverage if you go on Twitch anytime a big triaa game comes out now people do accept that those streams are going to be sponsored usually EA or Activision they always sponsor some streams when one of their new games comes out and nowadays players do accept that they don't consider that solid Behavior they just see okay that's just the Creator economy the Creator system nowadays one of the biggest people in this area specifically so indie games on YouTube one of the big ones is Splat cat gaming personally I really like watching this channel it's one of the main ways that I keep up to date with all the tons and endless games that are coming out the amount of Indie Games is just insane and all of these are really awesome so his channel is really important in order to help those IND developers stand out from the tons and tons of games that are coming out and he posted basically about that original thread how it's really disheartening to see some of the replies to that original post basically there are some people that got really upset that the original post said YouTubers shouldn't get paid and in turn there are some people really upset those people who don't consider YouTube to be a real job so they think they shouldn't complain that they don't get paid to play games which completely ignores the fact that being a content creator being a YouTuber a takes a lot of time and B is really Val valuable for these Indie Games hence why the publisher really wants the coverage but for some reason doesn't want to pay for it something that I've thought for a real long time that seem should really have are pretty much just the fil Lings one huge example is how splatter cat covered vampire survivors back then the game had like zero reviews nobody knew about the game and right after he made this video that's when the game really started to blow up so it is in pretty large part thanks to him that the game ended up making millions and millions of dollars but personally he probably only made like 200 bucks I mean indie games on YouTube they get a very low amount from YouTube ads so 200k views this might not even be 200 bucks so personally I really think that steam should add some kind of aili Link some kind of way for Content creators to be directly paid for the effort that they do and for basically driving eyeballs to the tons of IND games that exist on Steam I can say that for myself as both a game developer and a YouTuber I really value all of the YouTubers that ended up playing my game as soon as it was out I'm really thankful to these people who both played my game got some eyeballs onto it and seeing someone play actually really helped me as a developer being able to watch someone else play my game directly that is really helpful for being able to improve things that I didn't even know needed Improvement so I really really value the videos where people play my game then one very important thing that caused this backlash to be much worse is pretty much exactly the title and the screenshot that he chose to say it simultaneously says we got absolutely zero YouTube coverage at all whilst at the same time the screenshot does show 40K views 10K views 10K views and so on so once again this really comes across as toneev for most indie game devs getting someone to play their game and have 40,000 views on that video that is an insane amount that is really helpful but when you are a pretty massive indie game publisher 40K views is nothing so when he thinks about YouTube coverage she's thinking in the millions of views so once again that also comes across as really toned de you got tons of views but since they expected a ton more they completely devalue all of these content creators that are making videos on the game Aaron goes on to say I remember when the idea of a sponsor stream just seemed inherently Sleazy and some people even suggest YouTubers should be paying developers to use their content because in a lot of cases the videos made with content were hugely profitable this this back before the ad Apocalypse on YouTube where the ad rates for games were much much higher and his thre there's actually a really interesting comment related to this talking about the video in the original image and saying that video In His Image with 10K views probably took that created tons of time to make and they probably made 180 bucks on it now by itself that sounds pretty bad a ton of work to make just 180 bucks but the reality is actually much much worse than that and someone actually corrected them on that 10K views is nowhere close to 180 bucks I can speak to my own sets for example my list videos where I talk about the top new games and these videos the ad rate is usually a bit above $2 meaning 10K views literally mean just 30 bucks definitely not 180 bucks so the economics for streamers and YouTubers are even worse than it seems at first all in all I think this post by wonderbots is really the most accurate take on this whole situation he's saying in Mike's defense paying creators for coverage is iy game coverage is better when it's organic and while buying video streams will guarantee that they happen it also makes them feel less genuine which yep I would say that most viewers would agree with that if they see something that says sponsored by yay they're probably not going to take it as seriously as something that is organic but like it says here on the flip side sponsorships are becoming increasingly necessary covering IND the games is really not sustainable when it comes to just based on YouTube ad Revenue The Only Exception are super large channels like splattercat and even then the amount of money that he makes is so tiny compared to how much he could make based on the actual impact that he has on the games all in all this whole thing is an interesting discussion and I think the main takeaway is really just a time difference 10 years ago this comment would have been definitely accurate but nowadays it is definitely no longer accurate nowadays content creators are very much part of the whole indie game ecosystem and what they do is extremely valuable and I definitely do believe that they should get paid for that work the amount of value that they bring can definitely make a game like vampire survivors into a mega multimillion hit so I think it's perfectly reasonable for account creators to ask for some money in order to get some coverage although it's also perfectly reasonable if they don't want to take anything in order to satisfy their own personal Integrity requirements and it's also reasonable that some devs don't want or simply can't afford to pay for coverage basally in this whole thing I really just think the the only problem the only reason why this became such a big backlash on Twitter was really just because came across as really toned de talking about how successful your game is how many millions it made while also saying we really value the work that the YouTubers and twitch streamers do to cover our games but whilst we do value them we don't want to share any of these mels with them this is certainly a very interesting discussion and something that is definitely ongoing let me know in the comments what are your thoughts on this so should devs pay for coverage is it reasonable for a con Creator to ask for money in order to cover some kind of game it's kind of interesting to think about these topics and see how the whole Indie Game Dev industry this whole thing is still very much in its infancy and everyone is still learning as we all
