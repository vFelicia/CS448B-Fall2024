hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey and here let's check out the top new games made within the launching January 23. this was an interesting month for some reason there were tons of Chinese games released and a bunch of them actually did quite well I guess maybe in lots of people wanted to launch before the Lunar New Year whatever the reason it just means more awesome games for you to play although of course it also means more competition for you as a developer so pros and cons the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts onto the test all of these games are unequally impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way I'm currently working on my own steam game called turnover Liberation it's a game with tons of systems open world survival crafting automation strategy check out the SIM page edit to your wish list and follow for that mods and actually before we get to the unte top 10 list let me give a quick honorable mention to a game that is actually made with unreal that just came out this month it's called punch a bunch this was made by YouTuber pontypants it has been in development for almost 3 years I've enjoyed watching the devlogs all this time and thankfully the release is actually going really well already has almost 500 very positive reviews so I'm really happy to see it succeed humble has just launched a new bundle full of cinti assets as you probably know I love their low polystyle the bundle has tons of variety with 20 packs with the usual super dip discount at 97 off or if you prefer something more realistic there's another one with tons of highres military Assets Now this one is technically an unreal pack but you can just import it into unreal and then export the meshes which you can then import into ENT okay so starting off the top 10 Unity list and at number 10 here we have a very spooky and very unique game death and water too visually it looks great definitely one of the best looking games made with yinty it said in deep water with lots of sharks some weird creatures hunting it down for me I'm absolutely not a fan of either horror or the deep sea so this one is most definitely not for me but if you do like horror games and this seems like a really nice new entry in the genre the game features in large open world you can explore to discover all kinds of Secrets and give them Loot and then it also has a wavebased mechanic where some very spooky creatures hunt you down and on top of that there's a very scary Kraken that mind controls the creatures making for some really tense gameplay the atmosphere for this game looks really perfect for exactly what it was trying to achieve so if you're a fan of horror or the deep sea then definitely check this out up next here we have an interesting one called Juno new Origins you might know it by its previous name simple rocket Zoo so it's a sequel to that very popular game from years ago but in the meantime the game expanded so much as the devs felt it in a brand new name it's a Sandbox building game features very realistic physics you can build your own spaceship you can build a car a plane or just about anything you can also write code to get the vehicles working exactly as intended you can even customize the solar system itself you can play in sandbox or a nice career mode and of course it has excellent modding support so you can see what the community has built and share your own Creations so if you're a fan of complex very deep games definitely give it a look I'd love to play it out to check out just how deep that programming goes next here is yet another one that also has a nice devlog on YouTube it atrio the Dark World the first devlog was three and a half years ago and right now it just left early access it has a very distinct visual sound it's a bit strange but it certainly does stand out the game has some nice Automation and survival elements you spawn a brand new disposable Android body every time you go out and explore the world set up machines to automate farming crafting forging and a bunch more you dodge some creature attacks and capture them to use in your own factories definitely has a very unique very strange theme and people do seem to like it with already over 300 very positive reviews for some VR here is a recent huge hit it's gorilla tag I still haven't gotten fully used to this much movement in VR so I'm definitely envious by how much fun all of these people are having the game looks simple but also really awesome the movement is on based on your arms so RAV4 then pull back in order to move or jump just that movement system gives you a ton of Freedom the levels are all very unique and look very fun to move around in the game modes are simple either run away or catch someone but despite being simple it looks like it really works there's tons of positive feedback and already has 800 very positive reviews which is definitely a huge amount for a VR game then here we have one that I'm actually surprised that it's the first time that I've seen this idea it's called definitely not fried chicken so right away excellent Name the name alone combined with the game ID won't definitely ensure this game finds some success basically it's Breaking Bad the game you have a business growing and selling some let's say less than legal goods and then you have various fronts including obviously a chicken shop it's definitely a very good idea having a front makes for some nice easy comedy and the game itself also seems solidly made you have tons of options for all the kinds of goods you can grow and sell there's lots of building types you can own not just restaurants you can make money legally or illegally you can manage your employees manage the growing delivering and selling of all the goods it just launched in Early Access so there are some rough Parts but the core of it does seem solid then for something a bit more chill here is selling era it's a RPG with some gorgeous art you see on the Seas do some trading business fight some Bandits or find some love in a Tavern there are multiple characters in your party each with their own levels and skills it's one of those RPGs where your party follows your character in a line then you can fight battles out at sea or board their ship and engage in some nice turnbased combat it's already a huge hit with over 2 000 mostly positive reviews then if you're into card games here is Theseus protocol really gorgeous art and animations the music also sounds excellent It's a deck building roguelike so you gather your troops and your cards in order to engage in battle it also has a nice nonlinear narrative that you can uncover more and more through every run and it also has some persistent progression for your deck the presentation is definitely excellent and so far the Early Access reviews do seem to like it next here we have farlanders it's a very interesting extremely complex looking City Builder game lots of systems and lots of buildings at your disposal it's also turn based which I'm not entirely sure how that is supposed to work so I'm certainly intrigued by that there are lots of buildings lots of complexity your job is to terraform Mars to make it habitable for your colonists you can build on the surface of Mars but then you can also dive deep underground and build some more you can explore a deep Tech Tree and make Mars your brand new home it has a demo if you'd like to try it out then here's an interesting one that came right at the end of January it's called in culinary right away you can see a very interesting visual looks like medieval manuscripts with some weird creatures it makes me wonder if they decided to the only launch in order to not only is around the same time as pentiment the game definitely does look really good the game itself is a turnbased strategy game it features quite a nice amount of verticality the levels aren't just horizontal planes so you can climb up some ladders and push down some creatures it has a nice single player mode where you explore a map and gather more creatures and skills and it also has a multiplayer Skirmish mode where you can choose an army skills a map and balance it out with a friend or a foe and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is a really interesting game called Rising front looking at the massive scale in the trailer you might think it's a multiplayer game but nope it is single player you command massive armies in World War One within first person it features a ton of Mayhem some massive scale with ragdolls flying all over the place it has intelligent AI a cover system lots of trenches some realtime building and more it's being built by a solid developer and already has over 500 very positive reviews so this one looks like it's going to be a huge hit at least mechanically it doesn't look very unique so if you enjoyed playing Verdun like I did and you wouldn't like a single Prime version then this looks really interesting I definitely want to give it a try alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with the entire launch in January 23. I hope this list helped you see how the NT engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just here on skills and Imagination check out my own Sim game total warm Liberation and add it to your wishlist alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
