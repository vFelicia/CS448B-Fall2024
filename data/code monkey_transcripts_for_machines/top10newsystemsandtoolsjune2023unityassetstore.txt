hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus form of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for June 23. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I'm already covered the best renew assets and the next one I'll be covering top visions and effects as always there's links to the description and as bonus you can use a coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order by the way I'm currently working insanely hard to get my game demo ready for the Sim Festival next week I've implemented something like 10 different mechanics this week really productive the game is really starting to take shape I can't wait to have your own play it I really hope you like it make sure you add it to your wish list stay tuned for a testing live stream this weekend and go play it on Monday alright so starting off with a very impressive verified tool it's called hot reload if you don't know what this means then basically it lets you edit code without having to recompile so you can have the game open and playing as normal then you decide you want to change something not just in the editor but actually in the code itself you can just rewrite the code hit save and the code will somehow magically compile in the background and continue running the game with the update code this is something that is usually not possible at all so this is an amazing tool this can really help speed up iteration speed I've heard great things about this tune but I haven't used it myself just yet definitely need to try it it looks extremely impressive then here is a very surprising one which is RPG Maker unite basically you've got RPG Maker directly inside UNT honestly when I first heard about it I was quite confused I thought maybe it was some kind of joke like putting unreal inside Unity but in reality it actually does make sense since RPG Maker isn't necessarily meant to be a game engine but rather it's more of a game maker tool so I'm looking at it like that does make quite a lot of sense this version pretty much integrates RPG Maker directly inside Unity so you can easily build your worlds with tunnel sets you can use all of the unity tools then you can take from their massive library of assets you can grab characters and environments and create entire games all without coding it's definitely a very surprising thing but this is a very interesting release next here is an interesting one to greatly improve performance in your games a while ago I made a video asking the question could you build Zelda inside Unity the answer is yes of course but it does take take quite some work to optimize it this tool is one of the ways you can do that you can take a bunch of individual meshes and then combine them into a single one thus reducing your draw cons the world is split into chunks and meshes are generated while using a very efficient algorithm for very low memory usage so if you're working on a game within a large open world you definitely need to use a tone like this one next here is a small simple tool that does just one thing and does it very well it's called project log and it's a way to write some kind of log directly inside ENT so there's no need to go to an external website or app it's all right there inside the empty you can write whatever you want maybe it's a todo list maybe some design notes perhaps a message to A coworker or really just something so you don't forget it's a simple tool that does exactly what you want then here's an interesting one it's AI texttospeech however the important part is that it's all fully offline texttospeech can be an interesting feature to add to your game but making it require an internet connection is usually a Dion breaker so the fact that this one runs internally locally that one is great it supports over 15 languages with over 900 English voices it works on platforms except for some reason on webgl next here is one that looks extremely complex but potentially very useful although I'm still not entirely 100 sure what it does it's called texture studio and apparently it's a layer based texture Creator so you can have tons of layers with all kinds of data like different skins for your characters or Vehicles then during run time you can choose which layer you want to be active and easily blend between them you can dynamically modify the elements in all the layers and do all kinds of manipulation the results in the video do look quite impressive you can almost run something like Photoshop directly inside DMD I could see this being quite useful if you want to make tons of variations for your game and do it in a more Dynamic way then if you need some hyper realistic physics here's an interesting one this one caught my eye right away because it has physically accurate propellers meaning they rotate and in turn that rotation actually generates lift when I look at this one the idea that comes to mind would be making a digital twin of a drone then perhaps use ml agents to train that drone inside Unity to fight itself and then build an actual drone in real life and run that code assuming the physics here are indeed accurate that would be a really fun project next if you need to populate a huge world with tons of vegetation then check out this one you've got tons of tools at your disposal to add all kinds of rocks bushes trees and really anything the important part is that all of these elements snap to the train so it's really easy to position them you don't have issues with objects slipping the terrain it all works kind of like a decal so you can place all the objects then you can Implement wins Seasons wetness height blending and a bunch more up next here's a nice one for helping you make tutorials one thing that I always dislike is text only tutorials I find that it really breaks the flow of the game if suddenly I have to read a huge round of text so I'm always a fan of short videos to teach whatever the tutorial wants to teach and this tool helps you do that among many other things you can create a bunch of categories and tutorial items then assign a video and some text then it's up to you to choose how the tutorials are spawned it could be when the player touches something or perhaps during a unloading screen and lastly here we have an interesting one strangely enough this one actually shows up as free when I'm logged in I guess this one is free if you already have some other Infinity PVR pack basically this is a dual for easily combining audio clips to create brand new ones maybe you can combine two impact sounds into another new one you can assign all kinds of layers and then to uncreate all the unique variants between them so with just a handful of inputs you can easily generate hundreds or even thousands of unique sound effects and then you can also add some dla to the clips so one example of how that is useful is on taking some character voice lines and easily combine them together into a single audio thumb alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on dnts store for June 23. there's links on the description and as a bonus you can use your coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also check out my own free impedance on store stay tuned for a testing live stream this weekend and go play it on Monday alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
