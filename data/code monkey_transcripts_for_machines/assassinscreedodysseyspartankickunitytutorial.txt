hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're going to make the Spartan cake from Assassin's Creed Odyssey it is a very powerful kick that sends enemies flying away let's begin okay so over here I have my scene I have a player with some movements in some attacks there are enemies that come towards me and attack me and I can attack them as well I can also do a dodge run to dodge attacks okay so let's implement the spartan kick so here in the player base class i have some functions to play animations specifically the one we're going to need is the police parking cake animation it takes a direction and execute an action on the impact frame and one when the animation is completed so now on the player class here as you see on awake we are grabbing the reference to the player base which is also a component on this same game object and for logic in here we have some simple States normal attacking and dodging we do a switch on state on the update keys normal we check for movement then we check if we should attack and also if we should dodge so that's a simple overview of how everything is set up so now let's add this part and kick so first here on the update on the normal state let's add a new function for handling these Spartan kicks so in here to handle spartan kick and let's go down here and make a function a private void handle spartan kick now in order to do the cake let's test for a key so if input not get it down and let's say key code e so when we press e we want to stop on the other logic so before we go further let's go up here and add another state this will be state called busy and essentially this does nothing so in here lets you case state that busy and we do absolutely nothing we're doing this so we can now go down here and when we press the e we can set the state to be state busy and as such the rest of this logic will no longer run whilst we're in the middle of our cake animation so after setting the state let's grab the attack direction so a vector3 for the attack dear now the attack direction will be towards the mouse position so let's go in computers class and grab the mouse world this position dot normalize okay so we have our attack direction towards the mouse now using that let's go into the player base and play the spartan kick animation this takes the direction so our attacker clear for the on hit and let's leave it as no and for the on end mission complete let's go back to normal so set state back to wrong alright so that's the basic setup when we press e we complete the attack direction towards the mouse and we play the animation towards that direction alright so in order to test let's go into the game handler this is our main script and then here let's simply stop spawning enemies so we can easily test to see if our kick is working ok so let's test ok Here I am everything is perfectly normal now if I press the e yep there you go that's the spartan kick animation if I press smoking me elsewhere and there you go the animation matches ok good so now let's set things up to be able to actually hit some enemies so in here before we play the animation let's see if there are any enemies near our target so first we need to define a target position and that position will become related based on our get position who is moving towards the attack direction then let's multiply it by a certain attack offset and go here and define a fold for the attack offset and let's say about xx so our target position is essentially starting from our position moving towards the attack direction by 20 units so now with this target position we need to look for an and meet near that position so enemy enemy equals we go into the enemy class and get the closest enemy essentially this is same function that we're using when we're attacking so this returns the closest enemy to a certain position so in this case and let's give it the target position and a certain max range and let's say 20 units so this will return the closest enemy within 20 units of the target position now obviously it's possible that there is no such enemy within that range so first we need to check if the enemy is not known so that means there's an enemy in range otherwise no enemy and right now if we do have an enemy let's reconnoiter the target position to be the enemy that gets position and let's also recalculate the attack direction to be directly exactly towards the enemy so equals the enemy that get position minus our position dot normal okay so in here when we are playing the animation let's now apply something to this parameter now this parameter is the action that is triggered when it reaches the impact frame so in here let's execute a function and in that function let's you if enemy is different from now if we do have an enemy let's do enemy got damaged so when the animation reaches the impact frame it should cause damage to the enemy so let's test that let's go into the game Handler and go back to spawning some enemies okay okay here I am there's an enemy I can attack him as normal if I press E if there yogi played the animation and caused damage when the animation reached the impact Frank so in here again hit and there you go they are being kicked away and it is completing the one near the mouse position so if I put the mouse in here yep there you go kick that one now and out okay good now let's also make the player move forward on the impact frame so in here you a transform dot position so transfer position increase it move them towards the attack direction by a certain amount so let's say about 10 units okay I'm let's see okay here I am and I hit E and yep there you go there's a nice little dash forward okay good so now let's see on with the enemy receiving the kick so let's go into the enemy class and this is set up in very much a similar way to the player class there is a enemy base class that contains most of the animation functions and this class is responsible for the logical level so in here let's go down and make a function called public void knocked back fly away essentially when the enemy is hit by the kick we want him to fly away from the map so let's receive a 314 knockback beer and first let's go into the enemy base and play the hit animation towards the knock back here and we want to move them towards that direction so for that instead of adding a new stages for this temporary effect let's use the function updater which is part of the code monkey Tony's that you can grab for free from unity code monkey calm now in here I can create and trigger an action every update so I can use this to very simply make him slide away towards Enoch back direction so do a transform that position increase the position towards Enoch back there multiplied by a knockback speed multiplied by time depth time so in here define a float for the knock back speed and wait and let's say 300 okay now let's also add a time to destroy so we float time to destroy and let's put it at 5 up and on our update let's reduce the time to destroy by time.deltatime and if the time to destroy if it is under zero then let's destroy this game object so five seconds should be plenty of time for the enemy to actually leave the screen so then it gets easily destroyed and now just like we did with the player we need to set the state to busy so the rest of the logic no longer runs while he's flying away so set the state to state dot busy ok so now back here on the player class when we are doing a kick in here when we are damaging the enemy instead of doing a damage let's do enemy dot knock back fly away and now the knock back direction won't be the same as the attack direction and use that instead alright so let's test and see if the enemy correctly flies away from the screen when he gets kicked ok here I am there's the enemy now if I near him and I press the kick yep there you go he was kicked away kick this one kick this one and yep there you go they are being kicked away and the normal ties to work and yep kicked this one and boom there he goes ok so we can increase the speed but yep that's the effect we want so in order to make the effect more satisfying let's add a little screen shake when the cake action on lens so in here after we knock back let's do some basic screen shake and I have a function on Utah's class to actually shake the camera so let's shake just a little bit okay Here I am there use and if I kick him boom yep there you go there's a nice little screen shake and he flies away from the screen can type in sorrow and kick him boom there he goes all right great so now let's implement it to the adrenaline system that we had in the previous video to make sure that we can only use this overpowered kick once every certain amount of time so in the previous video with the adrenaline system that we created in here we have some functions to add adrenaline in which we are adding when we hit an enemy and when the enemy dies and we have a function to try to remove a film bar so this is what we need to go on to the employer and first we test if the key is down if so then what says if adrenaline dot try to remove the film bar so you only execute the spartan kick when we press the key and we do have an adrenaline bar alright so it's that simple to implement our previous system so let's test and here I am if I press E yep nothing happens now with me hit him to get some adrenaline there we go there's the indicator now for pressing yep he flies away and no more adrenaline hit a couple more until I have and boom there you go another kick get some more and kick a boy yep there you go great so there you have it we create the Spartan capability from Assassin's Creed Odyssey as always you can download the project files in utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I will do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
