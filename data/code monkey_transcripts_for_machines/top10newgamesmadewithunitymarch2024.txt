hello and welcome I'm your Cod M and here let's check out the top new games made with unity launch in March 24 this was an interesting month there were maybe 30 or 40 games that I found really interesting but actually a surprisingly amount of them had some issues and had some mixed reviews although even without those it was still really tricky to pick just 10 for this list there were plenty that look very interesting and were well made the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all these games are in impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month quick mention I just released the free intermediate section for my C course so now both the beginner and intermediate sections are free over here on YouTube the advanced section will be coming out in about 1 to two months I hope you'll learn a lot from these free videos or get the premium version which includes a bunch of awesome bonuses like interactive exercise help you learn by doing and if you need any assets then check out the spring sell on the accur whether you need visual sounds effects tools you can find pretty much anything to help you make your own games I covered some of my favorites that I think can really help you in the last video and check out the Flash Deals page which shows what assets are going to be 70% off in the future check it out to the links in the description all right so starting off at number 10 with a very silly very frustrating game titled a difficult game about climbing you've probably already heard about this one it's been a huge hit with all kinds of streamers and it's made by YouTuber Ponty pants who also made punch a bunch this is a game very much like getting over it and other rage games like that one controls are very tight but the map is extremely difficult if you you fail you drop down to almost the beginning with only a handful of checkpoints along the way you control the hands of the character just move and grab either the left hand or the right hand and then it's all about using momentum to fling yourself from position to position as you try to climb higher and higher there's lots of Hazards like slippery walls and falling water that won't push you down as well as some areas that really just require a leap of faith now personally I'm not really a fan of this genre I don't enjoy feeling frustrating but if you are into these types of games and this is an extremely wellmade one like I said this one is already a huge hit it's got over 2,000 very positive reviews which means that has sold almost 100,000 copies which is an insane amount if that game is too frustrating and instead you want something super chill here is summerhouse it's a relaxing house building game there are no rules no game over screens you just load up a very calming scene like for example in front of a lake and then start building your dream home Brick by Brick you place the walls place the windows then put down some stairs unlock hidden characters and really just enjoy yourself there's no win or lose condition this is really just game meant for relaxing if you're into games like townscaper or DF romantic then you'll probably love this one it seems a lot of people are looking for a relaxing game to play this one already has over a, overwhelmingly positive views at 96% positive that's really awesome super high next up here we have a game all about chaos called Maniac it looks like a really nice mix between the GTA 1 and meter coupled with the game posel in theory it's a simple game with some shooting driving and some Rog light upgrades but in reality it's extremely well made the game looks really great great in motion both in terms of visuals with some really gorgeous natural lighting but also in terms of physics and effects with lots of objects and plenty of particles flying all over the place I wonder if this game is made using dots the amount of objects on screen is really quite impressive you've got lots of weapons lots of vehicles there are six unique characters with skills a large open world and even has a map editor you've got all of that and the goal is to cause chaos and follow along as he wanted meter climbs with tons of levels this game is a great example of how even with a simple concept you can't technically find success although of course that only happens if your execution is absolutely Flawless which is definitely not easy to achieve this game is indeed finding quite a lot of success it already has over 500 very positive views so probably over 20,000 copies sold in just 3 days next up for a citybuilder exploration game here is buar funer Chronicles it's a very unique Builder game the world is very much nonstandard with lots of mountains and you build tons of bridges to connect all kinds of buildings the footage of all the cities is really unlike any other game it's own very vertical with lots of interesting connections you build some ships and some airships then you take them out and explore this dangerous world with plenty of foes and Mysteries to uncover this game is actually related to the previous one that this Dev made the falconer that was a game where he control a falcon and explore an open world while Gathering some resources and attacking enemies so something like a playe flying game whereas this one is setting the same world but completely different in terms of gameplay honestly I love this sort of thing and I really wish more Indies would do this basically make multiple games with different mechanics different genes but share these same world it's really hard to do it right which is why most don't even attempt it but when it works like in this case I think it makes the game a little bit more interesting this one is being very well received already over 300 reviews at very positive so that's about 12,000 copies sold in one week really nice then if you're looking for an adventure deep underground check out subterrain minds of Titan it's a turnbas survival RPG you explore this large world and survive against all kinds of enemies make sure to pick the right stats and the right equipment or risk dying every action you do every single movement all of that moves the time forward so you have to be careful with every single action you take time is really of the essence food water and oxygen are scarce other surviving colonists also need help with their task so you need to salvage whatever materials you can find break them down into raw resources and use those resources to build up weapons and armor in order to survive your next exergon visually it looks gorgeous with some really high quality pixel art some great lighting and effects it is out now with 350 mostly positive reviews with some people disliking the turn Bas style but if you're into that then definitely check this one out next up if if you'd like to make your own spells then check out spell dis this is a Rog light action game lots of enemies to defeat kind of like vampire survivors the one unique Twist on this one is how you have a lot of control over your attacks you actually build and customize your attacks by connecting different elements and individual attacks together for example you can fire a chain which in turn triggers an electricity spell which in turn triggers a fire spell which in turn fires a fireball which in turn triggers an ie and then throws a normal dagger there's various based classes and lots of items and spells that you can combine in ways that no one has ever seen that spell before not even the developer so the potential here for experimentation is really quite insane you can easily save and load your unique build so you can keep experimenting or just go back to something that works you craft a build unlock new items make another better build go out again and do it all over again this one just left early access with a full 1.0 release it's got 600 very positive reviews next if you'd like to play a factory Colony building game but with a chill Vibe here is Stellar settler space based Builder it's it's your job to settle on five hostile alien planets and build a thriving Colony you can build both horizontally and vertically gather resources connect your buildings and processing materials then pick from various settlers with different sets and set them to work on some pod the reviews mention how it's a little bit more heavy on the puzzle side than on Colony building so you have to be careful about where you place each settler each planet is unique with different disasters and biomes and after you have enough resource to build up your rocket ship after that you can build them but you have to make sure that you do it care ly because the spaceship that one is physics based so you definitely need to make sure to build it properly if you want to actually get up to space it is out now in Early Access and they have a pre robust road map with a 1.0 release planned in mid to late 25 then here we have godsworn this is very much a classic RTS in the vein of something like Warcraft you have lots of units and buildings you can control alongside a mythical hero this definitely perfectly encapsulates the feeling of those old school RTS for me I was more of a fan of games like man and Conquer rather than games with some Heroes but this one does look great it has a story campaign that you can play in ated single player or Coop it's got a nice engaging story all about mythical gods and how their tribes fight one another you construct some buildings gather your units and prepare for battle it is out now in Early Access and people are loving it with 200 reviews at 94% positive so if you're into classic AR style with some Heroes definitely check that out up next here's an interesting one titled The Brew Barons this one is a flying and beer crafting management game a very unique very strange mix there are apparently some pirates in this world and those pirates have boats and planes and they want to control the supply of beer so your job is to essentially take them out you do some combat to take out all the Pirates planes then craft some beer and distribute it you can customize a ton of parts in your plane each part giving you different bonuses like for example letting you harvest more of a certain resource or spend less gas for Gathering the ingredients you really just fly around and shoot some trees then you buy some ingredients throw them in the pot let them ferment and outome some beer which you can then customize how you want to bottle this game is a very strange very unique idea personally I quite like it I think it looks great it is out now with 400 mostly positive reviews the one negative that reviews mention is just how the plane feels too heavy which maybe is intentional since these are really not fire planes and then at number one for my personal pick of the month if you're into some turnbased strategy set in World War II then here is classified France 44 this is a mix of Commandos which was a game that I love playing as a kid mixed with XCOM which is another game that I love and I also really love games about Gilla Warfare that is why I prefer XCOM 2 to XCOM one in this one you control some elite units as you sneak Behind Enemy Lines and it's up to you to engage in a campaign of sabotage and destruction but at the same time the more chaos you create the more attention you attract this is an XOM leg so you've got a grid based turnbased strategy you can recruit andite operatives to build up your squad make sure to make every shot count take cover and flank your enemies the game also has many features that build upon this genre for example you have more action points to take more complex actions you have more options for how your OverWatch activates and more comp Lex levels with verticality with many flanking positions the time is constantly counting down towards dday it's up to you to choose your missions wisely and help the Allies windar it's been quite some time since I played the turnbased strategy game so I very much want to find the time to give this one a try it is out now with 200 very positive views all right so that's 10 awesome new games made with Y launch in March 24 I hope this list help to you see how the Y engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just your own skills and Imagination and don't forget to check out the spring sale if you need anything then now is the best time to get it
