hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out a really cool asset called curved worlds this is an awesome looking effect that can really make your game stand out this video is played into two parts first let's look at some of the demos to see what the asset can do and how they work then after that i'll do a quick stepbystep guide on how to start using it and add it to your own games check out the entire asset review playlist where i highlight great assets to help you make your games awesome and as always there's a link to the asset in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order this one is also part of the amazing shaders bundle it adds an extra 30 off if you're also interested in the other assets so curved worlds like the name implies this helps you create curved worlds and by curved it means that it can curve in pretty much any way that you can imagine so you can do something subtle like for example the animal crossing effect where you have just a slight blend or you can do the inverse of that and do a sort of inceptionlike bending of the world or you can push it to the limit and end up with a completely circular world or you can make some really weird twisty corridors it's an extremely flexible and adaptable effect so here i've got my project and i imported the package now the package that you import from the asset store just contains the installers for the various pipelines it supports the builtin hdrp and universal so in my case i then opened up the universal pipeline package after you install it if you see some shader errors make sure you're using the correct version shown in the manual so at the time of this recording the minimums are unity 2019.4 and universal 7.4.1 so that's what i'm using over here in my project now as with many assets this one comes with some really good documentation so you've got a pdf manual with just about everything you can imagine it's got tons of tutorials so you can understand how it works and how to get it looking exactly as you want it now we're going to see the manual in more detail in a little bit and another thing it includes is also tons of example scenes so if we expand this there you go tons of examples some of them are complete examples and some of them are starting tutorials so let's first see the complete demos and then afterwards we're going to try to follow some of the tutorials now the first demo over here the bend classic runner this is the most basic example it's essentially just a runner game so you've got a car constantly moving forward and some more cars coming in so a very basic demo and then up here you see two separate sliders and by moving them you suddenly start seeing the effect in action so if you take them to the limits then you can all of a sudden see just how much this effect changes and you can also pause the game and look at the scene view to see how the effect actually works so here in the scene view you see there goes the road and goes down into the right here you can also see a key point for how the effect actually works which is if i select one of these objects and let's say something like this one and there you go the transform is positioned all the way up here so essentially all of this business that you see is simply the visual in terms of object positions the objects are all up here so if i select them all you can see all the colliders everything is up here it's only the visuals that go down there so in technical terms this is a vertex transformation shader it takes the visuals and positions them differently depending on the distance to the camera so logic for this minigame is super simple you've got some chunks with some cars that spawn at the end and they simply move backwards and then all of the weird shapes that you see are just based on the visuals so this is awesome because means that your logic can stay relatively simple so on the logic for this minigame is all just very basic so you don't need to worry about positioning your transforms in any weird positions you build your game like normal and then apply the effect on top so for example you can use normal navmesh pathfinding since the collectors are all the way up here placed exactly as normal separate from the visuals and if i move the missions you can see yep everything changes and it's the same thing for all the physics animation and so on none of this is affected by the actual visual you can grab one of these objects and move them around to see how the visual changes depending on the position to the camera by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks so here's another demo and this one is curving on the zed which again we can play around with just how much we want to carve so something really subtle or something really extreme and again this demo showcases how the logic does not change so if i fire some bullets it looks like they have a huge curvature but again over here we can see that's just the visual so here is a shell and if i resume the game there you go it goes forward so it does not curve all the way down there then this is an example on a 2d game so it's a standard platformer and adds some curvature and now it mostly is being played on the cylinder and then this demo which i think is the coolest effect so like this just a normal topdown game now let's add some curvature and there you go now we are inside a mini planet so this essentially just applying the curvature on every single axis so you end up with a cute little tiny planet it's really fun to look at and if we pause and if there we see the extreme distortion placed on the visuals but on the camera view yep it all looks great then here's a very strange demo so without the effect it's just a boring old road nothing special now let's add a spiral and there you go the road starts rotating and making a spiral and same thing on this side also rotates spiral and so on so it spirals one way and sparrows another way and this effect is also completely dynamic so in this case it is moved by pivot point transforms over here on scene view so if i move them around you can see yep how the effect changes so it's really interesting then here's another interesting one just two basic roads then apply some spiral distortion and there you go without very strange then you've got this really weird twisty corner you can curve massively one way or another way apply some horizontal twisting or some vertical twisting then this one showcases some very weird highway hills and finally this one with some very strange road spirals so you can see how these demos showcase lots of interesting effects that you can create but there's also two more demos here that showcase another thing you can do with this asset as you saw in all those demos those are just visuals the objects never actually move but you can also apply a script to those objects if you do want them to move the transform based on the visual position so in this one like it says here the red meshes are standard so they are just moving the visual so the objects themselves are placed all the way up here however on the blue ones they are actually being positioned where the visual is and again this is all dynamic so i can move this around and see the difference so here on the scene view we can actually see the difference if i select all the red ones yep they're all up here however all the blue ones there you go they go alongside the curvature and again all dynamics so if i move them they are correctly moving and you can select one of them to see if there you go with the script so the position and rotation is all being handled just by placing this so this is very useful if for example you want to use the mouse to click on one of these objects if you just move the visual anywhere to click for example on this red thing it would actually not select it because the collateral is not positioned here but rather all the way up here so to solve that you just have that so that when i click here the collider is actually indeed in here another thing that it does is it also fixes distortion so you can see these objects are relatively tall and you can see the red one over here as you can see up there it's quite a bit stretched and looks good on the bottom but on the top it is clearly stretch whereas on the blue one since the whole object is moved instead of just the visual as you can see there's no distortion and then the final demo takes it one step further so the red meshes they're all normal they're being moved just by the visual then the blue ones have the script so they get positioned and finally the green ones the visual is moved using the shader but the child game object containing the collider is moving according to the script then you've got a bunch of lights which are also a bit of a mix so some of the channel game objects are moving according to the script others are just a visual looking over here we can see everything in action if i select all the objects if there you go look that all of the lights are placed up here but then also some objects are placed all the way down here there you go look at that collateral it's down there so you can see how you have tons of control over whether you just want the visual to move or the entire object or just parts of an object so now that we've seen the demos let's see how we can use it to add it to a game the asset comes with some really useful tutorials so let's load it up tutorial one and right now this is just a normal game so there's no bending anywhere it's just a basic endless runner so the car is here i can move left and right there are cars being spawned roads and so on so so far it's just a basic game nothing in here is related to the curved ones asset then all of the instructions are up here on the manual so let's follow them and see what we need to do now as i mentioned this is a shooter effect which means that our objects need to be using that shader and right now everything is set up using the standard urp shader so that's why you didn't see any bending now in this demo here in the hierarchy we can see a correspondent in a chunk spanner this is what constantly spawns those objects so for example we go into the car and over here we've got the various cars that get spawned and for example over here we see a car it's using this material which down here we can see that it's using the basic urp lit now what we need to do is essentially change it so go in here go inside amazing assets then inside curved world and finally choose lit alright so that's it now we can do this one by one which would be quite a lot of work or we can use the super useful tool so just go up here into window then amazing assets and open up the curved window and then up here we can go into the renderer's overview and now this shows a list of all of the renderers present in this scene and all the materials that they are using so right now you can see that i changed one this one to use the curved wallet but we still got eight of them using the standard urp inlet now i can just go up here click on change go into amazing assets curved world and swap into lit and there you go now all of them are correctly using that shader so now we can select any of these just to verify selected and yep there you go it is using that shader now another thing about the shader is up here you see this so you've got a bend type and a bend id now the vent type is the type of algorithm that won't be applied so in this case we want to bend the road and all of the objects along the xaxis and then the id is just in case we want to have multiple variations so with this example let's leave it like this so classic runner x positive and with the band id of one now just by applying that we don't see any difference so right now everything still looks exactly the same in order to change the parameters for the shader we need to use a script so this tutorial already comes over here with the game object name curved on controller so let's go into this one then we go into add component and then go into amazing assets curved world and add a controller now over here we can choose the bend type so again classic runner x positive the bend id the same thing just one and then over here we've got the settings that we can use so here's the game looking normal now if i modify the size on the horizontal there you go it starts rotating to the right and rotating to the left same thing for a vertical up or down then you can also play around the offset to make the effect only show up a bit in there so there you go look at that very interesting so you can see how this is super easy to add we just use the included tool to change all of the materials in the scene then we add this script and that's it now here we can play around these values to get the exact look that we're looking for now if you want to use a different effect you just have to select a different bin type in the material so again you can do it manually or go again into our very nice tool here on the renderers just go on to this button click here then change curved worm then settings then let's say instead of classic runner x positive let's go with a twisted spiral then hit on change and this will change all the materials and now up here in our curved world controller let's go select the same thing and there you go now we've got these parameters and we move them and there you go look at that now we've got a completely different effect so as you can see this is super simple to add and if you want to take it even further you can the manual is extremely detailed and it's full of information for how you can build upon this if you want to extend upon this with some custom shaders you can do that so you can make them handwritten if you know how to write code or another thing it includes are also shadow graphs it works with both the unity shadow graph as well as the amplify shader you just go into the window and over here on manage you've got these two buttons so create a sub shader with vertex or vertex plus normal as soon as you click on it if there you go now here i've got that and you can open it and there you go here is a sub shader with an input and output so here i've got an empty custom shader and i can just drag this one and this works as a sub graph so you've got an input and an output and you can add anything else you wanted so you can combine this effect with any custom shaders that you already have again the manual is really good so check it out to see all the ways that you can expand upon this alright so that's curved worlds nowadays if you want to find success with your games it really needs to visually stand out using one of the many effects in this asset is one way that you can achieve that try playing around with everything it can do to make your game have a really very unique look as always there's a link to the asset in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10
