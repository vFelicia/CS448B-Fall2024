hello and welcome I'm your codm so one game that has been blowing up recently is man Lords it was one of the most anticipated games of all time it had over 3 million wish list on Steam and as soon as it launched very quickly it surpassed 1 million units own story for this game is actually quite interesting it has been in development for 7 years and people went crazy for it as soon as it was announced the game looks really gorgeous and really complex the talk about this game is usually about two things first is how the game actually lives up to the hype it seems like a genely awesome game and secondly how it's amazing how all this was apparently built by a so Dev now that second part is what actually started a really interesting debate I saw a bunch of ton of it on Ren and now there's a really interesting interview on PC Gamer It's actually an interview with a developer of another different city Builder game it's called Fest fronti here this is another awesome game that people really love this one is made by an indie Studio it's not a Sol Dev and this came up during the interview because apparently they start receiving some feedback from players saying things like why does it take so long for this studio to build all kinds of features when a Sol Dev can apparently do it so quickly now as developer myself I have been on receiving end of some comments like these it is indeed quite frustrating now the article does point out that there's no animosity here they just got onto this topic while talking about player reviews in general and the things that some players say is indeed quite insane the most common one is really just going to any single player game and just saying why don't you make it multiplayer as if making a game multiplayer is just a one button press thing anyways The Narrative that met Lords would built by a single person that gives ammunition to these people to say these kinds of things if that solo Dev can technically do it why can't all of you so the question is does manal Lords count as a solo Dev game techically the game does have a single Sol Dev meaning the company behind it has just one single employee and for the first few years of development it was indeed just a single person working on it then at one point he got an epic Meg rant and started hiring some Freelancers this interview over here on the enen engine blog this interview very much highlights the solo Dev part of it in there he says after receiving the Meg rant I also started hiring more freelance artists help me with various tasks whether it's cleaning map adding illustrations to events little things that all add up to make the game look more like a finished product and less like a hobby project then if you look on the credits on the final game there's naturally a lot more than just one name on there I count about 250 different names there's also a behind the scenes video on creating the soundtrack in there it showcas a composer and entire Orchestra so clearly a ton of different people touch on this game in some way the manal Lords have does say that these are all fair criticism and then in response to the farest Frontier developer he says the main difference is if I quit it's game over no more Mana Lords whereas if he quits a studio nothing changes I think that's actually an interesting definition for what counts as a Sol Dev meaning there's just one person driving development without that person nothing happens even though development itself might involve tons of contractors for doing art music sound and so on so I guess in this case for this game maybe a more appropriate title would be something like solo director there's only just one person controlling a small army of contractors I also saw a funny post on Reddit on how technically you can be a solo builder of an entire house just hire contractors to do the actual building and simply tell them what to do by this definition technically that would be a solo house Builder so solid Dev this definitely one of those terms that is really hard to Define for example in my case I consider myself a solid Dev I have built my games by myself but I've also hired artists I've hired musicians I've bought sound effects visual assets and even some tools in my game game cor DX I did all the programming and all the art myself and then I bought some sound effects and some music so does that count as a solo Dev game or another example on my game hyper Knights on this one I contracted an artist to draw pretty much all the Sprites then I did all the programming myself and bought some sound effects and music or in my latest game dinky gardiens I bought a ton of assets for all the visuals and even some tools then I also hired the composer to make some music but I still did all the game design and all the programing myself so does that count as a Sol Dev game it's an interesting question and I think there's no clear answer for it there's no objective way to define what is a Sev I think most people would consider what I did with my games to be a Sev but what if I contracted more artists and musicians what if I made an adventure game that was mainly just about visuals with very little programming at what point would it be considered not to be a Sol Dev game I've also actually seen some comments in some of my videos saying I'm not a Sol Dev because I didn't build my own engine and technically yeah that is true the games that I built those are built on top of an engine and that engine itself was built by thousands of people so my Sol Dev work is built on the shoulders of all those thousands of devs that built those TOS that I use well at the same time I think if you take that argument to the extreme then literally nothing is solid of even if you do end up building your own engine you certainly did not build your own operating system or your own PC so in order to be a complete solid Dev you need to build your own CPU from scratch build your own silicon your own bios your own operating system GPU your own engine generate your own power and so on at that point I think the term loses all its meaning but I really don't think most people are that extreme a while ago there was also an interesting similar debate on what exactly counts as an indie game the game Dave the diver was a huge hit and people called it an indie game they said that because of how it looks like a relatively small scale game with some pixel art but then people started to look deeper and they found that the developer is a small team inside of Nexon which is a giant public company so is this an IND game or not most people would probably say no because they're part of a huge company although they did get nominated for best indie game another question what about the Hitman games the studio I interactive technically they bought their independence back from Square Enix so is the next Hitman game going to be considered an indie game now probably not because it's going to be a super expensive game although if the definition is based on budget if so then what about studies like super giant games and Clay their budgets are indeed tens of millions of dollars but I think most people would consider them Indies so these are all interesting questions that all come from the fact that there's really no objective definition there's no rule that says okay you can hire up to three contractors in your ass so Dev above that you've got a team of Freelancers or some kind of rule that says Indie Games have budget of sub $1 million something being an indie game or Sol Dev is really something that is just by feel it's a marketing thing although I also feel how it's very much not binary it's pretty much a spectrum in this case manal Lords I would say this one is very much on the edge of that Spectrum but like he says it is still mainly just one person driving development so I feel that term does apply slightly on the other hand for myself I don't do 100% myself I don't normally do art or sound so I would put myself somewhere around here at the end of the day some have are in the game these are really just interesting debates to have but I don't think it really matters in the end all that matters that the games themselves are awesome in this scenario that is very much the case whether you feel Sol Dev is applicable or not regardless of the label manner Lords is a genuinely awesome game and people are loving it so I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this do you consider manal Lords to be a Sol developed game at what point does it stop being a Sol Dev once you start involving contractors I'm certain there's going to be some real interesting discussion in the comments All right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
