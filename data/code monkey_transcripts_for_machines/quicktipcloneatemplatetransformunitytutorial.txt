hi there this is a quick tip for how to coin a UI transform so let's say I want to set up a list of guests here's the transform that I want to clone there's a name and the e bar one way you could do it is obviously by making this into a prefab however that would add another file into your project list which would be unnecessary given that this is really only used in this particular window so having multiple prefabs related to multiple different windows could become quite confusing so what I normally do is create a transform in the editor just like this and then I clone it through code so in the code I first grab a reference to the template then I set the game objects that active to false in order to be hidden and then whenever I need it I instantiate it and I set the knee only created set active back to true then I can set the position and all the fields that I want so I can put this in the loop in order to make multiple and just like that there's the template being in Senshi ated multiple times there to fill up our list so now I'd say I want to add something else to each entry all I need to do is modify the template and just like that I have an icon and now in the code when I sin she ate now I can change that icon for whatever I want and just like that by modifying the template I have modified what gets created and I now have another feeling that I can easily use so another usage would be for example for buttons seen here I have the first button and I want to add a couple more and here we can copy this code into its own function so here I have a nice number function in order to help me clone and position a transform I use it to fill with a list and here I use it to duplicate the buttons so I only create one button in the editor and then I duplicate them in the code and do whatever I want with them so I think any of their it is on my guest list all following the same template and the same thing for the buttons I only defined one the editor and then I created the other two dynamically and that's it hope you found this tip useful subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time you
