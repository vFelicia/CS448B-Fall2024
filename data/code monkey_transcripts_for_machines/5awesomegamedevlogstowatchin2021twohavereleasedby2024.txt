hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this video let's check out some awesome devlogs right here on youtube i spent a lot of time just watching game dev related videos so i figured i'd group a bunch of them in a nice video since i assume a lot of you have the same interest as me and you might not be aware of some of these channels devlogs are always great both for inspiration as well as for seeing how other people make their games and solve all the usual game design questions that each game brings up there's always a lot to learn by watching someone else build a different game and by the way i'm not going to mention danny since i'm guessing all of you already know the channel he's working on carlson which looks awesome and the devlogs are always extremely entertaining also these are in no particular order all of them are very interesting and unique and in various stages of development so let's begin with the channel devduck working on a marine biologist rpg named dauphin you play as a marine biologist and your goal is to save the ocean you go through various islands and caves looking for interesting marine animals to rescue one unique thing is how the game does feature combat however you don't actually kill any creatures the whole idea is to save them so as you attack the animals you're not really damaging them but instead you're just clearing their corruption so they get back to being normal personally i always find cleaning things very compelling starting with something messy and ending with it per scene so i really like the idea of starting with a completely corrupted world and clearing it bit by bit you have various zones at your disposal there's a bunch of npcs you can talk to and you also have a ship which allows you to travel between islands i imagine the final game will also have some sort of pokemon like element as you discover and catalog all the creatures that you come across the dev logs have a really nice channel feeling very relaxing they are nicely filmed and edited with some common music and there's about 2 per month the game is being developed in godot although it did start life as a unity game it has been in development for one year now and progress has been solid he also made a very interesting video on the results of his very first indie mobile game it's full of very valuable lessons learned as well as some financial results do remember that the definition for success is different for each person depending on what you value knowledge and experience can certainly be a lot more valuable than just dollars and he also made another very interesting video on how to become a morning person he mentions the benefits of having those hours of clear focused work or leisure time as well as three very useful tips that will definitely help you if you want to give it a try for me having a morning routine is absolutely essential to be able to make my games in these videos i actually made a video about a year ago on my 8 tips from working from home and having a clear routine and waking up was definitely one of them for me if i don't take advantage of those hours early in the morning then my productivity really just drops like a brick it's not for someone some people definitely do work much better at night but i would encourage you to at least experiment and see if it works for you it seems to help him a lot in managing working on the game while keeping a normal job he also had a very unique support reward you could support him and get a shrimp added to his tank named after you very creative and perfectly fits with the nature of the game it's already in maximum capacity but that was a really cool idea next up ponte pants working on a physicsbased boxing game named punch a bunch it's physically based with some pretty deep controls essentially you move within left stick and rotate your body with the right stick and the way that you rotate your body is what defines what type of punch you throw it's an interesting system that allows for some complex moves as opposed to just button mashing and learning combos visually the game looks great he worked as a vfx artist in the film industry and that definitely shows very good looking materials and postprocessing effects the actions also have quite a lot of weight behind them with a bunch of juicy effects it definitely looks like it's very satisfying to play which is very important for a fighting game where the total number of possible actions is quite limited the videos are very well filmed and edited nicely entertaining the game is being developed using unreal and has been in development for about 10 months he actually quit his job to go full time just recently in that video he mentions the dangers of being stuck in the comfort zone which is definitely great advice for anything in life i would definitely not encourage everyone to just quit their job into game development fulltime this is after all a very tough industry but i'm guessing he looked at his analytics and youtube and estimated some sort of trajectory to profitability with a decent youtube channel any low cost of living you can definitely make it work he also showcases a very important part of game development which is getting other people to play the game as it's being developed feedback is crucial and having other people who have different interests and skill sets is absolutely necessary to make a game that appeals to more people and finds success for example he mentions how his girlfriend found a strategy of just spamming nonstop which was not the intended goal of his design so always get your friends family and really anyone willing to play your game but at the same time do keep in mind the bias of the source of that feedback friends and family are likely too nice to give you some truly honest feedback and they will probably be a lot more positive than they would be to a random game they just found on scene in the real world real players are much more brutal and honest so do keep that in mind whenever you listen to the thoughts of your friends and family getting good usable feedback is a huge topic on its own but the best way is to just watch your friends play and don't say anything actions always speak louder than words my only concern with this project is i think it might be a bit too niche fighting games is a very difficult genre to get into both as a player and as a developer the last in the fighting game that found success that i can remember was divekick many years ago which was sold based on its silly premise and if it doesn't end up with online multiplayer or some sort of single player campaign then that makes it even harder to sell it doesn't look great though very visually unique so that won't certainly help it stand out but regardless of how successful the game is the videos are extremely well produced and very entertaining so i have no doubt that he will continue growing and find massive success on youtube also the steam page just went live a few weeks ago so check it out and give it a wish list then over here we have bw dev working on a management game named lumbermill the game was inspired by two of my favorite games of all time roller coaster tycoon and factorio so as soon as i saw it i was hooked you start in a small forest begin hiring some workers placing some buildings and conveyor belts start turning wood into furniture and continue expanding your empire visually it's got a nice and clean pixel art style the world is randomly generated and very well built everything looks very natural you have clumps of trees and rivers flowing through the world it even has a power system with a second layer for managing all the power infrastructure with several power sources all in all i'm a big fan of design and all the systems and i really hope this one will do well the devlogs are about every two weeks it's being made in unity and star development two years ago he also made a very interesting video highlighting 12 years of game development which also involved trying to turn this concept into a reality with several failed attempts but as usual every failed attempt is always a very valuable learning exercise so those film attempts weren't really failures at all every single one of those gave them the knowledge and experience which makes the current iteration look great so as you go about on your own personal game dev journey keep in mind that failure is part of the process and everything is a learning opportunity and by the way if you find the video helpful consider subscribing and hitting the like button it really helps out the channel and as i've mentioned in several of my own videos where i talk about how to find success with indie games building a following is very important and the simplest way to do that is to have a public steam page as soon as possible so that people can start wishlisting your game this one already has a steam page and currently has 1200 followers so probably around four to five thousand wishlists which is already very good based on the genre and the number of followers and wishlists i would expect this game to be quite successful as always the definition of success depends heavily on a lot of factors like for example the cost of living and how long it's been in development but i do think this one won't do very well either way like i said this is exactly my kind of game so at least i'll be picking it up when it's out the release date on the steam page just says coming soon but it's already quite far long and been in development for over two years so i'm guessing it will be out sometime later this year then we have flow studio currently working on an adventure exploration rpg named lens island you can throw the titular character on this mysterious island with tons of areas to explore build the home of your dreams plant some crops and help out the villagers play around in the nice and happy island and then go down into the dark and gritty caves fight enemies and gather resources to further build your home and your equipment so it's got elements of survival crafting exploration farming combat building and so on tons of depth visually it looks excellent this one has great use of lighting the top island looks beautiful and very bright while the caves look dark and gloomy all of the ui also looks great nice and clean icons all the windows are nicely organized with multiple tabs and scroll bars it's got tons of customization the building system looks very capable you can place floors and then individual walls it even supports multistory buildings looking at this makes me want to experiment with creating a system like that it allows you to create some very unique very customizable buildings the excellent use of lighting is definitely what makes this game really stand out every screenshot looks gorgeous the day night cycle is very important to the game that's essentially how plants grow and time passes so having some good looking sunrises and sunsets is definitely a huge plus it is being made in unity and has been in development for almost three years and just like with so many devs he mentions in the very first devlog that the goal was actually to make a game in six months to one year so as you can see managing scope is always an issue for everyone this one also has a steam page and currently has 1200 followers so i'm guessing around four to five thousand wish list which is very good there was also a successful kickstarter a while ago and it managed to easily surpass the goal and get forty five thousand dollars the current release date is scheduled for july 21 so this one is definitely one to keep an eye on and finally we have thin matrix working on an unnamed city builder some of you are probably already aware of this channel he's one of the ogs on youtube and made the wildly successful equilinox that game also started as a devlog all the way back in 2015. it's got 2 000 very positive reviews on steam so that one was definitely a massive success right now he's working on this untitled city builder something along the lines of sim city or city skylines so you place down roads and buildings there are people walking around all over as well as cars on the road he hasn't yet mentioned much about the overall design so i wonder how far he's going to push it or what unique spin the game will have for me his devlogs are extremely impressive because he manages to actually fit in quite a lot of code in the videos without making it boring that's definitely a very impressive skill for example in one of the videos he goes through all the math for creating some road meshes and in another one he covers in detail how the pathfinding for the passengers and the car ai works and despite all that complexity the videos are very easy to watch he uses a custom engine written in java and using opengl i believe he's building upon the very same engine that he used for equilinox making your own engine and especially using java would definitely not be my choice but he's already shipped one successful title so clearly he has the skills to pull it off the benefit of making your own engine is that you can control absolutely everything and make the tools perfect for exactly your specific needs however the downside is that you have to literally build everything so in one of the videos he builds a guinea library from scratch which means having to build things like a text box which on an engine like unity you get by default it's been development for 15 months now and it's progressing nicely the devlogs are all extremely chill and very well edited and showcase both game development but also a very healthy lifestyle it's honestly impressive just how balanced his life is that's definitely something that i personally have a lot of trouble with city builders are always a popular genre so that's a good start his channel is also the biggest one of these in terms of views per video so as soon as he puts it on steam i have no doubt he won't gather tons of wishlists instantly and i would also say that the audience for equinox won't be interested in this game both of them have elements of management games so that's one of the benefits of having a long career as an indie game developer if you stick to the same or similar genre you can keep growing an audience and get people interested from game to game that's essentially how i managed to get 10 000 wishlists by the time that i launched my game battle round tycoon a lot of those came from people who played my previous games like game corp and blueprint tycoon alright so there you have it those are 5 gamedev channels doing interesting devlogs that you might not have known about go ahead subscribe to their channels follow their journey and let them know how you found them there's links to all in the description do you have any others that you follow if so post them in the comments i'm always interested in finding new ones there's also a bunch of awesome channels doing gamedev content other than street devlogs so i might cover some of those in another video alright so this was an interesting video to make and i hope you enjoyed it thanks for watching and i'll see you next time you
