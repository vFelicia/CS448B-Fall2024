so as you move your units you can get them behind either no cover or Low cover or High cover the cover basically impacts the hit chance that enemies have to hit you so cating that hit chance is really just some simple math when attacking a Target when cating the accuracy if the target is in some kind of High cover if so then give a big penalty to the accuracy if it's on Low cover just a slight penalty and if there is no cover then no penalty always remember how really a lot of these games are really just about simple calculations the tricky part is really just balancing all these numbers make it a really satisfying experience
