hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights for november 2021. even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them and see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all kinds of games i could build with these this one is the list of paid assets and effects i've already made two videos covering the best free new assets and the best tools and systems go watch those if you haven't seen them as always there's links to the assets in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order by the way you're not crazy we are indeed already in december but this is still november's video because of black friday i had to change some videos around so this one is slightly delayed alright so starting off with a fun unique one called paperman the most difficult part of game development nowadays is standing out so with these very interesting models it would definitely help you can use the basic flat colored paper man and the pack also includes five more skins policeman cook doctor businessman and thief they have humanoid rigs so you can easily combine them with any humanoid animations then if you need a complete setting check out this one it's a modern setting at night lots of nice neon lights and some really satisfying rain plenty of roads to drive around both in the city as well as on the outskirts you could just add some simple moving people and a bunch of cars and it wouldn't look great this is the kind of thing that is perfect just to load up this exact demo scene and very quickly get an open worm prototype up and running and next up halloween was last month but if you're in the mood for something spooky here's a grim temple very creepy looking statues and environments and it even has what seems to be some made up language to make it even more spooky these are very high end models with some high quality textures and up next here's a really nice mechabot it's a stylized mesh and texture looks like it would be perfect for some sort of characterdriven game something like ratchet and clank it includes a model with its great design a bunch of variations and it even includes tons of animations so you could use this either as the enemy or maybe even as your main player then for some vfx here's a bunch of orbs all of them with great visuals all of the ice one there's some electricity some fire dark matter plants and so on in total 15 unique arb effects with three color variations each and the home pack is pretty cheap then if you're looking for a realistic very calm looking meadow check out this one lots of vegetation grass and flowers it makes for some really good looking very calm looking scenes so if you're working on a realistic game and you need some grass to populate your environments then check this out or maybe you need some uir then look at this one massive amount of icons and objects everything in a really nice pixel art style features pretty much every element you could possibly want and if you need tons of weapons check out this bundle features over a hundred unique weapons everything from axes bows hammers shields and swords this is a bundle containing all the weapons from multiple packs so if you want you could get each of those packs individually but the bundle itself also has a nice bonus discount so if you want tons of weapons then this one is great and perhaps you can combine those weapons with this next one here is an ancient ruins environment it's got a nice cartoony art style lots of modular pieces for you to build just about anything and it also includes some nature objects like some trees and bushes i can see this one being perfect for a game kind of like tomb raider or uncharted then for something realistic here's a bunch of medieval npcs includes five human characters all with a bunch of skin color variations they have humanoid rigs so you can use them with any animations or maybe you're working on some type of game that has tons of resources here's a mining pack lots of rocks ingots and gems they feature a nice shader with some customizable colors i could see this one being great for making resources for an rts game then here's a really cute tiny dragon lots of variations and tons of animations and this developer also has tons more assets in this exact same style so if you like it then check those out if you want something a bit more realistic here's an abandoned factory very high quality models and textures the demo scene looks excellent lots of separate objects including modular building walls so this could be a great map for a realistic first person shooter or maybe even some sort of adventure game then back to something more cute here's a bunch of robots one very unique thing about this pack is how each robot has multiple evolution levels i can see that being used to make a great mechanic come to life all of them also include lots of animations really nice then for something more calm here is a campsite lots of particles and objects really cozy atmosphere looks great at night but also at dusk works on both standard and urp if you have a 2d site strong game check out these cyborgs all built with separate body parts for easy animation create and customize your characters reconquer just about anything and get endless variation save and load your characters and change things in runtime next up if you need another environment here's a canyon lots of rocks mountains and a handful of grass works in all render pipelines or maybe if you already have an environment but you want some clouds check out this pack it helps you make fully dynamic realistic clouds they change over time without repeating they also get lit by the sun or the moon with no noticeable impact on performance for something more unique here's some gift boxes pretty simple so christmas is coming up soon so if you're planning some themed games then maybe this pack could be useful and finally if you need a ton of scifi icons check out this pack features 400 icons lots of characters resources objects skills and so on very useful if you're working on some kind of scifi game alright so those are my top 20 new assets on the unity asset store for november 2021 there's links to all in the description and as a bonus you can use the
