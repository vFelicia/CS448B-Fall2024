hello and welcome I'm your code monkey 2023 is finally here and for some of you hopefully that means you decided to make this year you finally publish your first game here are some of my tips for how you can achieve that or how to set goals in general and in the end I will also talk about my own personal goals both as a steam Game Dev as well as YouTube and some more personal goals setting actual clear goals is one of the best things you can do for yourself having clear goals is kind of like driving on a race track you can see where the track goes and you know that if you keep following the track you will reach the end whereas with our goals it's kind of like driving in the desert there's no clear indication where you're going maybe you're going forwards or maybe not I'm pretty sure there have been some studies that show how just writing down your goals massively increase your chances of success so if there is something you really want to do like for example on punish your first game then take some time to write down a clear goal something that I personally find very useful is setting smart goals that's an acronym the S is for specific meaning defining clear numbers or actions rather than vague descriptions like for example launch a game on Steam DM is measurable meaning you can measure progress and completion like for example you've completed 10 out of 20 Mechanics for your game the A is for achievable meaning something you can actually achieve so don't set a goal like I want to build Call of Duty or World of Warcraft by myself if you're working solo make sure you select a project that is doable by a solo developer with your skill set Dr is for Relevant meaning goals that make sense to you for example multiplayer games do tend to do very well but if you don't like playing and making single player games then build that build what makes sense to you rather than chasing just what is popular and the T is for time bound meaning there should be a time limit on the goal for example launch your first game on scene by June 23. personally I find This Acronym to be extremely useful whenever I have something that I want to do I always think back to it for some clear steps actually made a really great video all the way back in 2020 so the video is three years old but the content in the video is really Timeless it's just as valid today as it was back then I even renamed that video just now so it's titled 7 steps to become a game developer in 2023 go watch that video to see a clearly defined path for how you can achieve article here's a super quick summary first build a bunch of super small games to get acquainted with the tools then watch some basic and also intermediate tutorials on both unity and csharp this step helps you familiarize yourself with exactly what is possible after that create a very simple game it's very important that it's a complete Game meaning something playable from start to finish so it's not a prototype then read the excellent book clean code and research clean code principles this will improve your skills as developer and programmer tenfold then make a three month game and very importantly publish it on the steam or the App Store this will help you learn the process of actually launching a game and getting player reviews after that read and study code complete this is another excellent book it's even more detailed than clean code it won't really help solidify your knowledge of clean code which will massively help you build any game you can imagine and finally make and publish a complete 6 month game you can follow all these steps in one year and if you do then in 2024 you won't look back and be amazed at how much you've grown definitely go watch that video to see all of these steps in detail like I said the advice in that is really Timeless that clear path is just as applicable now as it was back then and it will still be applicable many years from now now one thing that a lot of people struggle with is actually a word that I really don't like that is motivation I seen lots of comments like that on these kinds of Game Dev goals videos there's only tons of people saying how do you keep working on a game when you lose motivation personally I don't think you should rely on motivation at all the reason is because that word that feeling is not really in your control it comes and goes it's very random instead of motivation what you should do is you should rely on selfdiscipline which you can control so my advice to you is if this is something you truly want to do then go ahead and do it regardless if you feel motivated or not treated it with a seriousness that you feel about Disco If you really want to do it then go do it whether you feel like it or not I know that sounds overly simplistic but that really is the only way there's no magic on way to suddenly create a burst of motivation from thin air when you don't feel like it there are times when Game Dev is hard even if you don't love the game you're making there will be Parts you don't like for example for me I hate making trailers but if I want to launch my game I know I have to make it I also hate worrying about music and sound effects but again if I want to achieve my goal of completing the game then I have to push through those parts I don't want to do any of those but I know they have to to be done so I know the only way is to push through it one person whose content has helped me out a lot in my own personal journey is Brian Tracy specifically his talks on selfdiscipline the best way I've heard described is very simple selfdiscipline is the ability to make yourself do all the things you know you need to do whether you feel like it or not so if making a game is truly a goal you do want to achieve then don't rely on motivation instead remember this quote remember selfdiscipline is difficult but it is within your control if you want some more practical tips on daytoday scheduling then another great video was one I made in the beginning of 2021 everything changed it's all about my 8 tips for working from home effectively you obviously need to adapt into your own life depending on how much time you have to dedicate the Game Dev but in general those steps should help and I feel curious to know my own goals for 2023 the first one is something I've already spoken about I want to launch my next team game tournamental Liberation I want to launch it this year the plan is in Q3 so hopefully around July August and this is also a good point to mention how the amount of detail you need in defining steps for your goals really depends on on your own level of experience with whatever you're trying to do for example in my case I don't necessarily need a super detailed stepbystep guide to launch my game this is something I've done many times so it's something I already know how to do even though scope is always very tricky to get right even with a lot of experience I do believe the design that I want to build is doable in this time frame given my skill set so to achieve this goal launch this game I don't have a super detailed stepbystep guide I have a list of mechanics that I need to build and the belief that I'll be able to build them within the time limit another very important goal is one that was actually delayed it's building a complete free course on making a game and making it multiplayer initially this gun was meant to be completed in last December it was meant to be a much simpler game but the scope kind of got out of hand so it was delayed all the way to January now I'm aiming for mid to late January it will be a complete free about 10 hour course on making a complete multiplayer game from start to finish I'm really happy with how it's coming out so I can't wait to finish it and hear what you won't think then another gone for this year is something I've been waiting for ages Unity dots should be if only released around on March April so around that time I want to make a really detailed course on making a game using Unity dots I'm really excited about this tool set and all the kinds of games that can be built and that will be built over the coming years so I can't wait to explore that area during this year those are my three very clear goals for this year for some more soft goals I would like to do a bunch more live streams I always enjoy doing these but at the same time I'm not really a very social person so being on camera takes a ton of energy for me just like with game development in general this is a question all about experience I know the more I do them the easier it will be so I do want to do some more another goal is really just keeping the status quo I always aim for publishing three videos per week sometimes too this year since I have those really complex goals of making a game and two courses it won't be tricky to stick to that schedule but I will try my best in order to achieve that goal of keeping the same rate of videos one of my most important goals this year is finally hiring an editor so far I've been wearing this channel for almost 5 years and it's always been just me writing recording editing doing everything so I've recently experimented with hiring some editors if you see seen the video on is Game Dev all about luck that one is the first video on this channel not edited by me hopefully hiring an editor won't give me some more time that I can focus on doing the things that I actually want to do and the things that I'm actually good at I want to do those things rather than doing editing which I don't enjoy and I'm not good at and for some fun YouTube goals I'd love to hit 500k Subs that would mean 85k subs this year which is definitely doable and for another round number I'd love to hit 50 million total views which would also mean about 18 million views this year that would be something like 40 growth from last year which would be pretty insane so this is one of those moonshot goals even if I miss it I will still be quite happy these are my work related goals and for me something that is absolutely essential to my life is Fitness I generally could not do everything that I do without working out that really is the main reason that I've been able to work nonsav for the past about seven years without suffering burnout I don't have Vacations or holidays or even weekends I work every single day about 8 to 10 hours per day the only way that I'm able to do that is because well first of all I have my dogs I really love them and because of them I take regular breaks to take them on wonks that really helps and every day I also make a break to go to the gym to work out so related to that my personal fitness goals are to hit a new deadlift PR I injured my back about a year ago so 22 was mostly doing Physio and just recuperating now that I'm back to normal I'd love to hit a new PR this year my Max deadlift was 185 kilos so I'd love to beat that obviously all while focusing on safety first same thing on the bench press I had to do some shoulder physio so I had to phone back for a few months but now back to normal my Max was 110 kilos and I'd love to beat that lately I've been running quite a lot just recently did a 10k run in 48 minutes which for me is insanely fast the best I've ever done now I'd love to train to be able to do a 20K run and finally get down to about 10 body fat just briefly just to see what my button looks like personally I have a lot of trouble with food control I have a huge appetite so this is definitely a tough one and one that I've actually quote unquote filmed every year for many years my advice to you is make some kind of Fitness part of your life you don't don't have to take it as seriously as I do personally I love it so I work out a ton but you don't have to do it as intensely as I do but whatever you do definitely make sure you do something sitting for 16 hours a day is really not good if you want to do this for a long time if you want to still be making games in your 70s then definitely take care of your health and fitness find out what works for you what you like maybe you don't like running maybe biking maybe dancing maybe bodybuilding maybe power lifting maybe football whatever it is find something Fitness related you like and do it take some breaks go out on walks and drink plenty of water also speaking of goals related to my fitness journey here's a funny story I know exactly when I started taking Fitness seriously I know that because it was exactly when I said a clear goal and I know exactly what caused me to have that click in my brain it was a video on featuring physics Channel he was embarking on his oneyear journey of competing in a bodybu only show and he clearly outlined the plan to achieve his goal What specifically got me was when he talked about the clear plan with regards to macros how many grams of protein how many carbs and fats how many calories total and how the plan would change over time when I saw that white board that's when something clicked in my head after that I finally developed a clear plan until then I was learning about Fitness but I wasn't really following a clear plan I wasn't really paying attention to calories or macros or training splits but at that point I wrote down and defined the clear steps to achieve my goals for the next six months I tracked every food that I consumed and every workout doing that really helped me reach my fitness goals it was all because of that one video and that link in my brain so hopefully this video of mine will trigger that click in at least some of you which will hopefully mean that perhaps years from now you can look back on this video and remember that it was this video that made you set your goals and finally achieve them lastly on the topic of goals let me point out one very important thing setting goals is excellent just by clearly defining some goals you're already doing great and setting ambitious goals that are just slightly Out Of Reach is also excellent however when you eventually don't achieve one goal it is also extremely important not to be too harsh on yourself setting a goal is meant to be a positive thing something that will help you achieve whatever it is you want but if you then punish yourself because it didn't personally achieved it well then at that point it's a case of going one step forward and two steps back for example my own goal of launching third one Liberation by Q3 of this year I believe I can achieve that goal but also know it won't be challenging so there's a chance that I will quote unquote fail that goal and I might have to delay the game possibly to only launch it in January or February of 24 if that happens that will definitely suck but hopefully I won't be strong enough to not be too hard on myself because that would just not help at all if that does happen I hope I can take a deep breath and just keep working the plan so remember even if you quote unquote fail to achieve your goal you're still probably going to be better off than if you'd never Define the goal at all there's that quote shoot for the moon and even if you miss you will still land Among the Stars now go ahead write down a clear plan and make this year you finally achieve your goal with making and Publishing your game I wish you the absolute best of luck in your game Dev Journey
