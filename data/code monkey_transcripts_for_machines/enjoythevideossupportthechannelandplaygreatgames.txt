hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this is just a quick video to let you know that if you'd like to support the channel and see what I'm teaching here apply to real games then you can pick up the game bundle and been around tycoon which is currently discounted the bundle includes several games with unique mechanics the survive squad games have some interesting strategy mechanics specifically with regards to fill the view vision which is something I'd like to cover in a video it also has a procedurally generated dungeon map that I'd like to cover as well then there's hyper nights which is a really cool action game and the first time I use my animation system so the game should look familiar to viewers of the channel I've done videos on the flying body and simple character movement and which are used in the game pepper Knights battles is more of an interesting experiment essentially you can create your own units in their AI so give it a look if you enjoy logic in game development then there's game core blueprint Tycoon and ninja Tycoon all three of which are very unique management games game Corp is very short and sweet with some really nice polished elements Oberon tycoon has some really interesting blueprint mechanics where the player gives orders for how the blueprint should work and ninja Tycoon is the simplest one with a focus on managing a village and sending ninjas out on missions then there's been around Tycoon which has you creating arenas and various buildings for guests to fighting I've done videos covering how the wedding key works the task system and the modular spreadsheets is used for the guests so you can pick up the game to see the final version and then go through those videos to see how those systems work parallel tech unit isn't included in the panel since the game is still very recent but you can get it pretty cheap if you pick it up after the bundle so the cheapest way to get the game is to first add the bumhole games to your steam account then you can go to the steam page to the steam bundle and here if you already have the other games you can still get an extra 30% discount so that brings a tone for the game down to about 6 bucks so again I hope you've been enjoying the videos and if so you can vote support the channel and play some cool games if you play any of the games please post a comment about a specific system you don't like this and I'll do my best to cover it on the channel all right see you next time
