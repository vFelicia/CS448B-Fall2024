okay all right hey everyone I think this is live so just bear with me because I haven't done a live stream in about six months so let me see I think the microphone is a bit too low which way do I is that nope that's quieter and that's that's Lou okay good all right so I think everything's good all right hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here uh let me see make sure everything is working and yep okay should have a 3D model of Code Monkey that could be funny I thought about that I've seen a bunch of virtual characters virtual channels that is an interesting idea so yeah if I could do a 3D model maybe I would try that out okay so let me just make sure uh yeah so basically I mean I have to do a bit of work on my game so I figured I would play the game a little bit just in case some of you haven't seen gameplay of the game so going to play for a little bit and then basically going to try to do some work on it because I still got quite a be quite a few things that I need to do I look like Jah do I I guess I would need a bit more white hair all right but yeah thanks uh okay so I think everything set up so let me just yeah and on the characters I have no idea if the characters are going to to work does the game have coop yep it does have coop just online coop for now but yeah I'm I'm planning to add local coop in some future update so yeah that should be fun uh okay so take out the background and yeah so going to launch the game but I got to it's going to be quite a bit uh let me try to see yeah because the uh multiple monitors makes it a little bit tricky but I think everything should work and we'll see if the okay let me just make this window switch it over here okay so that should be and everything should be working now all right so yeah it's the the characters I'm not sure I can play the game with the characters on screen but see let me just make them just a little bit smaller just make it a bit fun so let's see if if like this if this is doable okay how did you get this chat system to work well if you want that I actually got a whole bunch of tutorials at the end of this page so basically this is a transparent window and on top of it the characters got some Mash based animation and then I'm really just interacting with YouTube API through an HTP request and then over here I covered how I make these dynamically generated characters so if you want there you go there's that tutorial and by the way just in case you want some nice free assets there's one right now on the asset store this asset pack is really awesome I've used this one in a bunch of my in a bunch of my videos and if you want it you can get it for free just use this coupon and apparently you can get it so this pack is really nice it's got quite a lot of things so I was quite impressed to see this one being completely free so anyways yeah just go ahead and get that one nice free asset and okay so let's play the game going to start off a brand new oh right it's the uh I wasn't thinking about the the uh sound effect is it working okay it is working just want to make sure that it's not way too loud yeah and it's probably doubling up so I got to erase my own sound just make sure that it doesn't cause Echo there be a recording of the stream yep I will make a VOD of this okay so let me just look at that just make sure that the sound effects and the music is not too loud just to make sure that it's okay I think I think it's pretty good if it isn't you let me know all right so let's go with a new game starting off on the Character Creator and let's do randomize a character so this is actually something that like I said I'm planning to do a tutorial on something like this how to make a nice character creator system it's actually surprisingly easy I mean it all depends on which asset you have but there are plenty of assets look at that that's a nice mask that's pretty fun let me change the backpack to something there you go some golf glubs that looks good okay the mask is nice but I think that's a bit too intense okay let's go like this I no something yeah something more like this for the colar I always like the yellow character that is pretty nice and for the shirt put something like this a nice little jacket and for the pants let's go uh uh something a bit more isn't there something in blue that would be nice okay or gray yep that works and for the shoes for something like this and for the mustache something like this okay so that's a real nice character there you go pretty cool like this all right that's pretty good so let's save the character and start off the game so starting off with this really nice level by the way note the the sound as the character is talking a fun thing about that about that little toning sound that is actually something that I made all the way back when I made my very first theme game Survivor Squad back then I want to have a really nice uh talking effect basically the inspiration was from GTA like the original GTA game where when the character spoke it spoke with uh that little tonking sound which sounds very strange so yeah it's really fun how I made that sound effect all the way back when I made my First Tee game which was 10 years ago I made that one and now I'm still reusing it on the game nowadays so yeah that's uh it's pretty fun okay yeah so basically the characters are down there but I can barely thanks so it sounds like Animal Crossing yeah yeah Animal Crossing does have some like that so that's pretty nice notic you don't get any income from the last C Humble Bundle isn't there I think it had the did I forget to add the a feel it I don't know but uh was it hard to make the tutal system uh not really that is something that is actually relatively simple and also something that I want to cover in a tutorial video basically Tut uh uh basically making a tutorial system like this one this is really just a saate machine that's really what it is so basically right now I've got this nice little visual just Dynamic just pointing to where I need to go and basically I've got a state machine on a simple enum I can probably show it I can just go into the it's in my spaceship level I don't know why this window is here but on my spaceship level manager there you go I've got the various stages so for example on that one right now I passed the intro message and I went into the Huard door open and over here I can see the actual State logic so I can see that when going into this one uh this is actually for the visuals on the client so it plays the music and updates the TV text so that's a text over over on there and just unlock some blockages so that the player can't go everywhere and then down here here is the actual logic so I basically find the object The Hanger gate which is this hanger gate right here I find and that one is triggered by the buttons so I find that one I find the hanger gate and basically when the hanger gate finds the unopened event when that happens and this one completes this tutal stage so basically making tutoral is really just putting together a ton of enums each of them with different Logic for completing the stage going on to the next one so that's pretty much how it goes it's super simple and over here the unopened event this is also super simple so basically I just have this button over here this button is connected to this gate and as soon as I try to interact so when the player tries to interact it goes it calls a server RPC because it's whole thing is uh multiplayer and single player and then just simply flips a bullion and when that bullion value changes when it changes it fires off this event and then over here the tutorial manager simply listens to it and completes the St so yeah in general making a tutorial is relatively simple and yep that is something that I want to cover in a future video because it should be should make for a pH tutorial okay is there a coupon code for the C for the free asset there's the uh uh which one my windows where's my there it is yeah just use the coupon cy23 and apparently you can get the Battle Royale pack for free so that's a pretty nice deal so definitely go ahead and get it that is super useful in many use Cas okay so let me play a little bit more and then I'll talk a little bit more so let's go open up the gate and go inside the hanger and there you go these are all the machines it's took quite a bit of manual work to build this entire scene set up all the logic all the things yeah it's quite complex really nice if we didn't have these machines it would take a ton of work to gather all these resource yeah that's a a little bit of foreshadowing I guess if something were to happen to this that would be quite annoying yes it would be yes it would be okay so now let's pick up some crates okay so pick it up and let's go and drop it here and here comes a nice cut scene and there you go oh no going through an asteroid field so there you go there's the spaceship boom and blows up and shields are down and there you go and we go into an alarm yeah I just want to make sure that the volume isn't way too loud now that the alarm is open so let me just go through this open up a few more Gates go in up a few more so I need to pick up some power to attitud generator so let me pick up the power approach the generator and just add power to the shield generator all right so that refreshes the Shields and apparently now we are set save so that's fun all right and now it broke the create container and something so before I do that let me just talk about a little bit what happened there just in case you don't know so let me go into the yeah over here on the game scene so if you want to know how I handle things first of all I've got multiple worlds for the various things so for example over here is the spaceship world and you can see y there you go this is the spaceship world so there are all the machines over there the defense area over here and the things in the end over there then there's a nice TV and so on and over there on the corner there you go that's where the cut scene happens so basically for the cut scene the camera is over here on the playable area it is showing here and as soon as it goes into the cut scene basically the camera shifts all the way up here so for the cutcenes where did I place did I place it on the logic component and that one is the spaceship asteroids so over here I've got a cinematic that is all just inside a simple prefab and inside the prefab I've got a virtual camera and cinematic has a simple just a simple animation so over here you can see let me just enable this and where's my where's my camera there you go there's the camera let me just enable the gizmos so y there you go so basically as soon as that it goes into that uh into that cut scene stage that stage for the to trigger the cut scene it simply enables this game object and starts playing off this animation so that is going to move a virtual camera moves it all the way over there then teleports the camera to the side as a bunch of explosions come in and attack the ship and then the ship blows up so that pretty much just enables a little particle effect something and then ends and then goes back into the regular gameplay camera so this is another thing that I very much want to cover in a tutorial because I think it's something that I don't think there are many tutorials on it basically how to make cut scenes which is actually something that is relatively simple I mean for the kind of cut scenes that I that I'm doing here they are actually quite basic so it's really just the camera teleports with certain position does a certain animation and then goes back into the regular gameplay camera mode so it's a it's a pretty fun thing so let me go back and nope no changes okay you didn't use timeline for cut scene nope I mean for these cut scenes these are all super basic the game is pretty basic in terms of story cut scenes and so on so nope I did not use timeline I just used super basic animations but yeah if you're making uh complex cut scenes then yeah I would definitely recommend you look into timeline because that one is made for handling really complex stuff all right seem like Cuts scenes are animations yep that's pretty much I mean there are many ways of doing cut scenes but yeah the way that I did it is essentially just animations all right so let's pick up a crate container and I'm supposed to build it over here just so that the tower can then get some ammo so let's place it down let's build the crate container coner and there you go so now I need to set the transport bot to drop ammo on that crate container so all the machines over here I've got a nice little setup here just mining some black crystals then it goes over here then the crafting machine is being interacted by this Autobot and it is spawning all kinds of ammo as you can see over here and then the item grab machine that one is just dropping ammo there and then there's a machine moving ammo over here and then there are various transport Bots moving the ammo to all the ones so I'm just set this one up and I'm going to pick up some ammo from this crate container and drop it on that crate container and there you go but now apparently there's another cut scene something bad is going to happen so there's a huge asteroid incoming and it blows up and the whole thing is about to blow up so lots of particle effects being being spawned all the way over there so yep there you go everything's about to blow up so let's get out of here before this whole thing breaks so got to get all the way back to the Escape pond so let's go all the way over there and interact to the Escape pod and Let's Escape the blowing up spaceship so that is the nice intro spaceship level that sort of guides the player through the basics and then starts the actual game proper so let's see this do you use abstract classes uh for a bunch of things yeah I can't remember what I use I'm pretty sure the base building class I'm pretty sure that one is abstract uh so anyways so the spaceship is gone but the plan is the same so let's begin by cloning a dinky so let's go and clone the very first dinky and there it is the first dinky and it's currently idle and of course the main goal about the the entire game is how the dinkies they're not they're not dumb they're very intelligent creatures which can actually help you so I can pick up dinky I can throw the dinky it's always fun to to throw dinkies and objects all right so let's give it an area and here is the really nice 3dy that I talked about in yesterday's video how it took me just a handful of hours to make this I really like how this came out this the way that the camera Zooms in so that is basically sin machine just calculates a camera position uh pointing back and down so just a really nice secondary camera position then of course it enables the the next volume controller which has a nice little depth of field effect so background is a little bit blurry and then over here the 3dy so this is a pretty simple uh World space canvas so this is something that actually I can instead of just stalky I can actually just show you so let me just I hope that this is not going to mess up my PC to run the game twice at the same time so let's hope my PC should be good enough to be able to uh to handle basically encoding a stream and doing this just so that I can show the inner workings behind how that works so for example over here inspecting a machine and I can pause and I can look and I can see over here is my Hier I've got my main I've got a regular canvas for all the 2D elements and I've got a 3D um canvas so this one is using a camera so I've got a render camera on thei so here it is it's a camera basically out into the world and then I've got the canvas which has just a slight rotation so inside I've got a container and over here just 15° on the Y just make it a little bit like that okay this doesn't update one it's like that but yep so basically just got a container and this one is slightly offset and then inside I've got all the various things like for example over here the crafting machine UI so as you can see pretty simple to make a 3dy and inside the game I do think this looks quite nice so I've got that 3dy for pretty much all the various things are these two virtual cameras or just one yeah I've got plenty of virtual cameras over here but uh for the basically I've got a main virtual camera so this is one that is above this is the regular gameplay camera and then for the second one actually don't remember where where this one is so that's the player virtual camera uh where's my inspect system my inspect object camera system and over here yep I've got my second virtual camera which is again can see this one places all the way down there it has a wider FV in order to see quite a bit more and then just has a look at so just look straight at the Player points a little bit back here like that so basically just this inspect object comes enabled whenever which in turn makes that camera disables when I cancel on down all right how you doing I'm doing great thanks thanks for for being here fix the interface bug when you point your cursor at the corner of UI button and starts blinking uh I think so I know that I fixed a bunch of those bugs where basically the issue is that uh the animation for the button basically first it squishes horizontally and then vertically so as I move over the button that little animation so that would cause where if you got into the corner yeah sometimes does this but yeah for a bunch of buttons like over here on this one yeah this one doesn't do that I added a little fix I had a little invisible image but yeah some of these if you go in the corner it still gets a bit odd it has to do with the animation squishing and then going like that so yeah so basically still just need to have that little fix for the rest of okay so let me do the tutorial a little bit more before I talk more okay so let's give it a gather resource nodes Behavior start gathering over here the green crystals and once again for here for selecting the area this is another virtual camera that is enabled while it's on this mode so I can move around select the area and there you go and let's start the order and there goes dinky now trying to gather some green resource nodes and I can get a few myself so I can do it manually but of course with this being an automation game doing it manually is quite a bit annoying so let's not do it manually let's get a second dinky and actually before that I guess the D wants me to make a a crate container building so let's do that actually the cuz the game doesn't have many elements down there so let me actually just increase cuz I can't really read that I always got to look on the side to be able to read chat all right so let's build another crate Contin building and start putting things there putting things in a crate and like that except like this once again doing it manually is really annoying so let us clone another free second dinky so let's pick it up and on this one I want to tell it to gather objects so let's let's go with a grab object which by the way all of these orders these are all different components so once again I can go over here I can look in my scripts folder uh where's my scripts folder there it is my scripts folder which as you can see you know being a complete steam game means that there are quite a lot of scripts and these are all just IR regular ones that I've got a bunch for the UI a bunch for tons of things and what I want to show is over here the dinky behaviors so for example I've got dink Behavior right here so for example a while ago someone was talking about do I use uh do I use abstract classes and yep over here the dink Behavior the base class this one is an abstract class because I never want to instantiate a dink Behavior so if you don't know what is an abstract class basically it means by adding this abstract uh tag thing uh it basically means that I cannot construct a brand new thinkinking Behavior so basically I can only construct things that are extending upon this so like for example the which one am I going to get like The Gather resource node dinky beh Behavior so there you go this one extends dinky behavior and as you can see over here it's got a whole bunch of logic for how this whole thing works so I've got a super basic saate machine to handle the behavior so for The Gather resource node this one is basically looking for resources then it moves to gather resources and then it actually gathers resources so as you can see it's actually super simple the uh AI implementation the way the whole thing works and only now I noticed that apparently why did my why did my camera get messed up okay was that messed up for a while now okay I'm trying to figure out I didn't even notice how did that get messed up oh cuz I probably oh I probably touched the yeah that's the that's kind of the issue yeah cuz this little camera tripod is not very it is not very stable so yeah I'll probably just touch the yeah just touch the table and the whole thing moved quite a bit okay anyways all right that was fun uh okay can I ask you something what free or paid assets you use in your game uh I use quite a handful that's another thing that I want to cover in a full video but yeah I used f for all the various animations then I use the text render uh if you saw the tutorial over there writing the text so I use that for quite a few things then I use quibbl for over here the outline for the uh Shader and I use an AET obviously I use asses for all the visual things so this little dinky this is actually supposedly it's supposed to be a bunny I just colored it pink and looks like a nice funny little creature then for the character itself also has so yeah I'm using quite a few things and I'm going to be making a video talking about all the s that I'm using okay so let me do a little bit more so grab objects so let me pick pick up a green Crystal and pick it up from this area and drop it on the crate container right over there and start the order and there you go and now that dinky is going to help me but dinkies also need to eat because of course they do so let me also pick up some food so pick up some food and I need to feed dinky and once again I can throw food that actually doesn't help very much although someone mentioned uh one little nice piece of feedback is someone someone was trying to feed dinkies by essentially throwing food on top of them and that is not intentional but I think that would be a fun mechanic so that is something that I have on my to list because I think it would be fun to just throw and have the dinky automatically jump pick up the food and eat it I think that could be fun but anyways for now let's do it manually so let's feed it just like that and yep of course being an automation game means later on we can automate feeding okay so now we need the research lab and for that we are going to need some Stone so let me try to pick up so we've got 10 green crystals so I can out craft my nice little things so let's place it over here I always build the exact same layout I mean I play the game I don't even know how many times but yeah I always end up building the exact same layout so put green crystals in there then someone over here and so on so yeah cool to catch you live oh thanks thanks for being here yeah I'm glad the videos have helped nice I literally just thought about factory factory is awesome uh I definitely want to play it quite a bit more I played it all the way back before it was even on Steam and it was one of those games that really caught me so I spent it I played it for like 50 hours in like 2 days that was okay I don't think that's possible but yeah like 50 hours in like three or four days it was crazy that game is really so awesome so I definitely if you like automation games obviously I recommend Factor really awesome okay so let's change the crafting recipe I want to craft a nice research lab and also someone else a while ago was talking about assets and uh yep I've used lots of assets but I've also used lots of things that I've made previously in the game like for example over here this little thumbnail and there you go that thing is hungry so I got to fix that but yeah so basically this little did I say thumbnail I mean tool tip uh yeah basically this tool tip another thing that I'm going to cover when I make that that video on the what assets I'm using part of the assets that I'm using are really just things that I've built previously so for example that tool tip that I'm using over there is this one over here that I made in a text tutorial quite a long time ago so yeah using code is something that I always talk about and that is definitely something that I've used quite a lot in the making of this game so yeah okay so let's craft it you are so inspiring well that's that's awesome I mean I'm glad that I inspire you to work on your gamees un like that one if you use UI elements or just the canvas systm I've I have not used UI I've done some research on it to figure out how it works but as far as I know UI elements I don't think it's yet uh set up for uh runtime use so yeah for this game this is just using just regular Unity UI okay so let me just feed these dinkies cuz these poor things they're all starving so let me try to do that here's my now created tool tip about the buttons to gra throw uh that's the exact same code that I use for the tool tip for the thing so as you can see it's just the size is dynamic based on the text underlying it but yeah it's literally the exact same code that I use for the regular tool tips so if I go over here and I go inside the recipe so here I've got a regular tool tip so the one that I'm using in the game is the exact same thing the only difference is really that it's a in World UI so let me go over here let me close this and there you go just like this let me pause let me look at the game and there you go this is the world UI so as you can see over here I've got the player character inside the player has a interact action World UI so this is a standard the canvas so this is a regular World space UI element and Y then inside I've got the interact alternate the interact and so on so I've got all those things and yeah the code for making the background match the underlying text that is the exact same code that I have on the same on the same toll tip okay all right so uh what was I doing right I need to research the crafting machine so let's go inside the tech tree and research the crafting machine so I need some experienced pellets so let's pick it up and they also need quite a bit of food so let me feed them will you add modding into the game like Tut you made yep I definitely do want to add modding I still don't know exactly what I'm going to select as modable things but yep that is definitely something that I want to do not sure when so maybe next month I don't know I still got to find time cuz that's a relatively tricky task but yep when I do I will be watching my own tutorial to figure out can you say my name please Sun Bean okay that's a nice name all right um our viewers care on the bottom also made in unity yep I I got a bunch of tutorials down here if you want to know how I made it so at the bottom of this page so basically this is a transparent Unity window all these characters over here then for the animations these are mesh based animations then for interacting with YouTube API that is just a simple HTTP request and then the Sprite sheets these are the same that I use in my game battle round Tycoon so that's pretty much how the whole thing works okay so I need to research a crafting machine I've got enough XP so let me just add some progress and do some research how did you create the sounds music oh for the sounds they came from a sound pack and for the music I hired a musician on Fiverr so that was pretty fun I'm really happy with the music and look at that research complete the ni little UI element and now here comes the zombies so this this is the defense part of the game I definitely don't want them to eat the dinkies so let me try to punch him do a nice little underground slam like that and boom there you go all the zombies all right defense success okay good so they are safe make sure to always keep them safe so obviously once again the whole game is about automation so the goal is to eventually automate them and here's the nice bonus that little Chief character gave me so as always let me pick up so let me put a mining machine to automatically start mining some things and then I'm going to need a atam grabber to pick up the food let me do basically the same setup that I do always so let me craft this one how did you decide on automation for this game how much do you lean on Market Research uh I don't know that's a bit of a tricky question because on the one hand I do a bit of Market Research in the sense that I'm always studying uh what is happening on steam what are the various things that are popular and so on so I'm constantly always searching for that but at the same time I didn't necessarily pick an automation game because it's uh popular or anything I picked it because one of the games that I like to make that I like to make that I like to play and I had never made an automation game so yep for this one it was perfect although I have to say that given how I made this game in just 6 months if I could go back in time I definitely would say do not try making a automation game in just 6 months because yeah these are quite complex games and yeah the last six months were definitely quite stressful because Yep this is quite a complex game quite a lot of lines of kill a lot of things there you go now we've got some automation for feeding all the dinkies okay so that's pretty fun can we skip the tutorial I I have that on my todo list but uh no I haven't done yet but yeah that is something that several people have mentioned so yep is that enough of the option to have the camera more zoomed out uh not really that's one of those things that I'm not sure if it would be a good addition because the game is really made for one particular camera view so yeah I don't know I guess I could add it cuz I guess it wouldn't be much of a negative but yeah the uh it was very much designed with this top down view in mind oh boy I got to see my voice already messed up cuz I haven't I haven't done a live stream in about I don't know 6 months so yeah quite a bit yeah I don't think I'll be able to go too long right now before my voice goes out anyway so let me try to do a few more things aser your inspiration for this game uh I played it quite a while ago definitely one of my favorite games so I guess subconsciously it was an inspiration but not directly but yeah subconsciously definitely it is an excellent game so let me okay let me try researching some more things so I need to build my crafting machine and for that I'm going to need so let me get this one go and gather some Stone resource nodes let me start doing that and then I have another dinky there you go you go and grab objects let me pick up some Stone some Stone from there and drop it over on this one okay nice H in Factoria you could copy the setting of the assembling machine yep want to copy this yeah I think that's one of those things that in theory it sounds useful but in reality building a good UI for that is really tricky basically one thing that I want I definitely want this game to be much more of a casual automation I definitely don't want it to be super hardcore like factorio so basically any feature that requires adding tons of complex UI elements that is always something that I'm a bit reluctant to add so yeah I can see the point I can see the potential benefit but trying to balance that benefit with trying to make it not insanely complex yeah that is that's a very tricky question do you already see what systems made apparently for this game we use for total World Liberation uh I'm not sure I mean cuz that game is quite different it's got well the main difference is how it's all very grid based so yeah I don't know I mean for that in terms of uh balancing things between I mean things like the tun tip so I'm definitely going to reuse that code in that game so but in general just the basic knowledge the knowledge that I gain from doing all kinds of let me just move this one a little bit make it a bit closer just to be able to catch the own as well but yeah in general any games that you make you always learn quite a lot even if the genre isn't the exact same and so on so let just research yeah I need to get it thank you for research and it's almost nighttime so I'm going to have to defend manually so let's see what is your next plan for the next game to be released uh I don't know I have not thought that far yet right now now there are still quite a lot of things that I want to that I want to add and improve onto this game so right now I'm trying to just add a few more things and then okay let me just take out all the zombies there you go the fence nice and easy wave so yeah basally there are still quite a lot of things that I want to add to this one before I think about what's next B my problem is always I have way too many things that I want to do all the time and that is always my issue okay let me try Gathering some more machines and I'm going to need another dinky can I get it no need more houses cuz I really want so which one of you is picking up you are grabbing objects so you interact you do some research cuz I really don't want to do manual research myself okay so I think I'm going to need some greeni to make that let's do that first time I catch you live huh thanks for being here yeah I definitely would like to do a bit more regular live streams what to learn programming p patterns from you actually I would like to make some some videos potentially a course just specifically on programming patterns design patterns I think that would be quite fun I think that would be quite an interesting topic so yep that is definitely something that I would love to do in the future okay so for the mining machine I'm going to need some green and let me just also research the Grabber machine let me do this and start crafting some greeni and I'm also going to need uh crate container so let me just craft the crate container just to put all myenum uh no nothing okay sure yeah get another one just a create container put another one there all right use any design patterns in this game sure yeah quite a lot of things quite a lot of a handful of inheritance quite a lot of interfaces so yeah uh oh boy boy my voice is already messed up I really can't talk too much okay do you use D tween for your UI animations uh no that's actually that's a really awesome M that I've heard really great things about but no I'm not using for the for example this little slide up animation for that I'm just using uh just using F which is actually one of the great assets that I'm using here so let's see one of the UI so for example let's go inside let me see one of these UI these actually don't have buttons so I got to find I got to find the UI with some buttons let me go back show the menu and yep the menu which has this little jump up doing this is super easy using something like feel so for example over here on the game menu for the resume button I've got inside the button as child I've got a feel for the mouse over Mouse click and mouse out so it's got a real nice question and stretch then it enables an image scales and so on so yeah basically if you want to polish things I can highly recommend the acid feel oh boy my voice is already messed up um let me just I did make a full asset review on it so if you don't know what I'm talking about that is a really awesome asset so I definitely if you want to polish your games I definitely encourage looking into that one all right to job system did I use the job system to make the game and nope not really I mean I always thought about I always kept it in the back of my head the job system and dots but in reality the game is still prep performant so just writing regular code that I've write that I've been written ah that I've been writing uh just that has been quite performant so nope I didn't actually need that is also something that I that I always keep in mind just in case I have performance issues but nope so far the game even on pre enlarg colonies it is still quite quite performant so oh hey K's in chat hey Cal how's it going nice that's cool um uh anyways what was I saying I don't know but yeah in terms of performance didn't actually use dots but yep perhaps in the future as I continue building upon the game okay what was I doing so I need a mining machine so let me go make a nice mining machine and I'm going to need to get some power so let me start researching the power generator so first get the black crystals so mining machine put one over there and get this one instead of mining you grab objects let me grab the stone and pick it up and just put it uh in that one okay great and zomie attacking okay so I got to got to do that yeah I got to theend from the zombies it's it's quite tricky trying to play and tonk at the same time it really makes me admire uh content creators live streams oh boy I can't even talk who do this uh every single day cuz yeah it really does not really does not work for me you should do a plushy of the dinkies yeah that would be fun that would be a fun interesting idea okay let me make some mins just so I don't continuously get attacked let me do that soon be scill with time yep they scale with the heat over here on the top right corner there's a little threat indicator so that basically increases every time that I build either new machines or spawn new dinkies so yep as you grow your Colony the zomie waves become more and more intense okay so those are our power even though I don't really need more food so yeah wow this dinky is really researching fast like crazy way too fast for me to keep up all right let me make a few more machines so a mining machine I'm going to need or let me actually make make a grabber machine let me put it all the way up here just to be able to craft things je AAR or navigation for the zombies and nope actually over here the game does not have any path finding whatsoever that is one of those things that I thought about I tried implementing it but I realized same thing with the collisions like obviously it makes no sense that the character is going through all the collisions all the things that makes no sense but I tried it and really just became really frustrating having to always go and zigzag and move all over that just became just became more frustrating than than fun so yeah in the end I decided to opt for no collisions nothing like that so in terms of movement they just move straight from A to B no no problems like that so yeah that is one of those that is just a oh boy what did I okay uh that is really just a design choice that I tried various things and yep just removing collisions was the best way the the thing that made the game more fun okay so me try and set this up and that thinging no longer needs that so theart and yeah yeah I guess you can go and research the rocket right away and what am I going to need so I'm going to need the power generator and for that I'm going to need some like crystals so let me manually get a whole bunch of them even though obviously I don't want to do this manually so oh boy my voice already so messed up yeah I think I can only do this for like 20 minutes more before I cannot talk anymore oh Super Chat super sticker A1 oh nice thank you so much that's cool and yeah live stream also has I haven't done a live stream in about in about uh I don't know like 6 months or something so yeah now YouTube has those little Arts I don't even know what that is but apparently I can now heart Super Chat so I guess that's fun and I can post random emojis that show up on the side yeah definitely I mean I guess it's nice to see uh YouTube adding more and more features to their live stream thing but yeah it's a it's an interesting thing uh yeah if you don't stream regularly then it is stupidly exhausting yeah I can definitely confirm that every time I try making a try making a stream it is always so difficult don't I really have no idea how people do this regularly because yeah I just just doing it for 1 hour feels so exhausting so insane I mean it is fun but it's also very very demanding so yeah it's uh quite tricky so let me try to pick this up and try drop some things and now I'm going to need one Binky to gather some power so let me I also need a grab machine to try to automate my power Gathering so let me go over here and zombies I got to prepare things so you pick up some power and drop it all the way over there and now I think this dinky is Idle or rather it's not doing anything so you go and no not gather you go and interact let's do some power okay so you start Gathering some power that one is going to pick up power and now I just need one more dinky I don't have anymore so let me actually try to get a brand new house what models are you using are they customizable uh yep the character I mean the character creation screen oh boy the character creation yep I'm using a really nice asset that has tons of pieces so that is why I implemented the little thing yeah thanks so much for the Super Chat okay and Zoomies are attacking so let me actually oh boy I need ah yeah cuz I'm cuz I'm playing quite a bit slower since I'm trying to play and talk at the at the same time let me get just a few mines just to help me come on make a mine let me throw a mine there mine there and I don't think there are going to be enough so yeah you just take down so let me just get the rest okay good all right so what do I need I need to make that house and in order to make the house I think I'm going to need five renum so let me actually get a a little bit of renum don't over workk your voice yeah I try not to but at the same time I always it's always a problem that I want to do way too much to the point where it becomes a bit unhealthy so yeah I would love to do live streams for tens of hours because it's it's fun but yeah physically speaking my my voice definitely does not work I definitely cannot handle that so yeah uh okay so I just need one more dinky to start automating the power and then everything should be pretty fun so let just get one more dinky like that you know how I find your stream nope I don't know I have no idea how discoverability works on the on YouTube so yeah I have no idea how every time I make a live stream tons of people join so I have no idea how YouTube does that so yeah you receive interesting bug reports after releasing the game yep lots and lots of very strange bug reports I mean the fact that this is an automation game means that it has quite a bit of complexity so where's my didn't I set up a dinky oh he went all the way over there so yeah dinkies are a little bit slow so go on grab power Yeah so basically there were quite a lot of very strange bugs that happened in very specific circumstances that I've never encountered myself whilst actually working on the game so yeah that was definitely quite uh interesting will you be live streaming a game making in the future yeah I mean the goal with this live stream was simultaneously to play the game and then work a little bit on it but considering how my voice is messed up I don't think I'll be able to go for quite a while so I guess guess on this one I will only be doing just playing the game for a little bit and then I don't know maybe tomorrow or whenever my voice recovers i w do a little bit more and more focus on actually coding but yeah for now the plan was doing playing and coding but I think think I'm just going to play a little bit okay uh all right so let me automate a bunch more things so I probably want to automate that thing on the left side so for the mining machine I'm going to need a whole bunch of renum so let me make a whole bunch more prenium and yeah I probably could use another dinky to help me automate the crafting so where's my where's the dinky there you go come here and you go and help me automate the crafting over there so craft a whole bunch of greeni so I think I'm going to need 10 do you know other programming languages except C Shar yep I've I mean I've uh I've t T quite a lot of languages but yeah definitely in terms of actual proper skill uh I would say definitely C is the one what I would say I'm properly skilled but yeah I've definitely I've done some JavaScript some Java some HTML oh God don't craft too many just want uh yeah so Java JavaScript HTML I've done action script 2.0 and 3.0 back in college I did a little bit of C I also learned a little bit of a assembly uh what else I mean in high school I learned a little bit about Pascal uh and for web design I also learned quite a bit of PHP so yeah that's pretty much it so I've touched I don't know like 10 different languages so yeah basically once you know the first language that really is the trickiest one after you know the first one learning other languages learning the basics of it it's actually quite simple okay so that one's already automating so now let me just make a grab a machine but just make one so let you go there you go back White characters have dark shadows around them H that's just a stylistic choice it's just uh uh what do you call it ambient inclusion that's really all it is just something pretty basic which I always find that it looks quite good so just a little bit of ambient occlusion to add a little bit of Shadows and everything looks quite oh yeah I still got my bonus power over here I guess I can well already got way too much power so anyways um yep you try to make a game without using a game engine uh when I was a kid I tried something called Dark basic I think that was the name which was well I guess that one was technically kind of an engine but yeah in terms of working directly with with the open gel or direct X nope I've never actually done that that is actually something that I would love to try out just just for some fun research let me get a few mines just a few mines I can only get one or two so just two mines and then I've got to manually oh boy there are way too many so yeah I definitely do need to set up some proper defenses otherwise I'm not going to be able to get the rest so let me just prepare a few mines that is actually something that I have on my te list is when the defense become a bit more intense have the little a little bonus giving you a few more mines I think that would be a fun so anyway so for mines I need black crystals so for black crystals I'm going to need you instead of doing that come here and just gather some black crystals all right so you do just that then there's another one you instead of doing that just no not together uh you grab objects and let me grab crystals in this area and put it on that great container all right so yeah and you do a few mins you sure like that all right do you use visual script do you see the use of visual script in the future of game I mean personally I don't really I love writing code so for me I don't really use visual scripting much but yep it's it's a tool and like with any tool some people can can really use it quite a lot and other people don't see the value but yeah if you like it I definitely encourage you to try it out cuz there are quite a few nice use cases yeah use default transport class for net code yep and how you create lobbies and so on I mean if you want to know the basics behind the networking for the game then you can really just watch my my complete multiplayer course because I mean the core of this game really works the exact same way as what I covered in that course so I'm using Lobby relay and and so on so yep the core of it is really quite similar well that I got a few mines okay that is way too many mines so let's go back into greeni and pick up all the mines just throw them all the way over there okay that should be enough to survive at least the next wave okay so I need another crate container let me make a crate container like that how do you store and save data while runtime not sure what you mean by store and save data you mean between scenes uh for that one usually you can just use basic static Fields but yeah I'm usual I'm using the same save logic that I've used in quite a lot so if you want to know how I do saving I made a tutorial I should probably make an updated tutorial but everything that I covered here is still exactly how I handle saving loading nowadays so yep that's pretty much it use relay or steam. net no I'm using the regular un relay uh yep so yeah I'm not using any of steam's networking uh okay let me just get this one just to get a bunch of waste gathered just put the waste in there like that uh okay so let make a grab machine and I don't have oh right cuz this one is making tons of green and that one has no power go on power it I probably need another dinky to add power cuz there are a bunch of things constantly running out of power the world goals yes yes I know I know so let me add some power into this whole area right here and for the crate container from this one and there you go that should help out a bit more with the power he's using Unity really costly to make p top here I mean it all uh really is paid based on concurrency so it really depends I mean my game uh I don't think I went past the free limit so yep even though the game has sold 1,000 copies it did not go over the free limit so I'm still not going to have to pay 1 cent for the Relay so I'm definitely I'm definitely happy with that so yeah if you got small Indie Games then yeah just using basic uh un relay is probably going to work quite well okay so yeah I got to say I'm feeling my voice quite a bit messed up so I think I'm going to just go for a little bit more did you make DFX by yourself or use some premade assets yeah pretty much everything visual is premade assets although of course that I modify all sorts of things myself but yeah most of the visuals are really just premade things that I modify and use for my own use case and so on but yeah most of it done by proper artists that's why I think I think the game looks quite good that's because the assets were obviously made by someone professional so there you go I've got eight mines is that going to be enough boom there you go that nice little I think that's from the cyti particle effects pack oh there you go okay so I still need a bunch more mines I should probably just get some towers and for that I need to start researching the tower which then I'm going to need electronics and so on so yep still quite a few things left to do so let me just put this here like that are you satisfied with the game results on Steam and steam deck do you mean in terms of sales yep and do you mean in terms of performance also yep I mean the game runs really well on the steam deck I was surprised at how performant the game was and putting it on the steam deck was actually surprisingly easy it was one of those things that really just implemented just gam pad support which is the gamad that I'm using just basic Xbox support and yep everything worked quite well so yeah so far I'm quite happy with the game both in terms in terms of the game itself in terms of results and in terms of terms of any everything really this uh this project has gone quite well and I still got tons of ideas for things that I want to do in the future uh right I don't learn design patterns and write clean code I mean the best thing that I can say is really just focus on writing clean code as long as you're focusing on that you're going to improve little by little and if you want quite a bit I highly recommend where's my camera the book code complete too so yeah if you read through this whole thing these are like I don't know 1 th000 Pages yeah 800 yeah 800 900 pages so if you read through this whole thing and if you fully understand it then yep you will massively improve your own clean code skills so I highly recommend the book I'm constantly reading and rereading it because it really is that good okay boy sry midday song use an audio solution nope in terms of audio it's prob just super basic unity audio control so really don't have anything too special in terms of audio it is all super basic oh let me just build the beginning of the rocket and I think that's going to be it so let me just put that one in there okay let me actually modify you go and pick up ingots let me pick up this one put it in there and that one in there and there you go pick up some ingots just started kitchen cows oh that's awesome yeah I'm really happy with with how that course came out seems people really enjoyed it so yeah I hope you learn quite a lot it's a book to get better in mind what about Fitness get fit with monkey G actually in terms of Fitness I did buy the uh encyclopedia where am I terms of that I actually heard great things about this book it's another one that is super massive but yeah in terms of in terms of Fitness yeah I heard great things about this and yeah definitely something that I want to learn about it's got lots of images lots of things tons of numbers lots of things so yeah I guess if you want to learn about Fitness then yeah a super huge book that this one I assume this one will do the same thing for understanding about Fitness the way that the other one did for my understanding of programming so yeah that's definitely something that I want to learn and read quite a lot as soon as I have the time so yeah uh okay what was I doing let me just make the the rocket can I build it I just need some of those so there you go pick up a bunch of those two options of books yep learn Game Dev and recently finished DD three tutorials What would would you suggest I do next I would suggest that you look at your own skills figure out what is the most complex game you can build what is just a little bit above your current skill set and try to do that basically that's how you always improve so you start off by making something like pong something super basic then once you learn how to make pong then you make I don't know PacMan then make Space Invaders then make something with a bit more complexity a bit more things so yep you make quite a lot of things um yep how did you optimize things so that is actually another thing that I want to cover in a future tutorial because I actually didn't use didn't do too much in terms of why is this thingy bug I think I just found the bug for this thingy I think I gathered that resource node and this one stop um let's see if by feeding Yeah by feeding fixes it but yeah that was a a fun but okay so I need some mines and thanks so much n the VAC for the Super Chat thank you so much yeah it's another Super Chat with oh okay so the one means the first Super on the live stream okay that's interesting uh let make a whole bunch of Mines throw them in there trying to see uh right okay I think that should be enough yeah I was trying to gather some there you go success that's nice I didn't even have to look there okay so let's try to get that one and for that one I'm going to need that so there you go tons ofone all over the place and yeah okay that should be good how is the building placement working yeah right now it is just uh yeah right now there are no limitations that is something that I want to add because yeah if you do place them on top of each other then can become quite tricky to to work with them but at the same time you can always put it back in capsule so it's not necessarily a gamebreaking thing but yeah I do need to add I don't want it to be too punishing but at least I don't want it to allow to place buildings literally inside another building CU that would be quite tricky yep for sound F mod I got to say for sound that is one of the areas of of Game Dev that I really know nothing about so yeah in terms of sound everything that I've heard yeah people recommend using fod so yeah I'm definitely not the right person to talk about that but in general I would say fod is a great tool I have done the animation on UI elements I mean the basic is really just using a field that I talked about a a while ago I'm using the F AET in order to do some basic animations so I mentioned that a while ago oh boy my voice yeah I think I'm going to I think I'm at my limit uh yeah so basically it is feel and I think I've got some regular animations as well like on my 3D canvas I thought I had an animation on this one but all right I've got the animation on each individual uh so let me actually thank you so much for the Super Chat let me just resume oh boy this gets there are way too many things happening at once uh let me go inside this one there you go the item grab machine and just go back and the atom grab machine Yep this one has an animation it literally is just a regular animation so just inside I put a container that is the only thing that I animate and then inside I put all the contents for the various things obviously different UI are going to have different contents but basically just got this simple thing and just with an animation just goes up jumps up and so on so we just modifying the position so on but it's really just a regular animation and it's a regular animated controller which over here really just has just one parameter just one animation that's it super basy you have it angled yeah I really I really like that it's a tiny tiny thing it's really just 15 degrees but I really like the the feel of how it looks like so just using a 3D canvas so just a canvas with a camera just adding a slight angle and looks pretty nice so that's that's I'm really happy that I implemented cuz the uh inspecting the objects is really something that I think looks quite nice super simple but nice oh boy okay my voice is yes let me just place down the uh did I build the rocket already nope still need one more sorry you build the rocket now let me just place down the rocket and I think that's going to be it and I don't know if my voice is working this afternoon maybe I'll come back and continue this game and actually do some game developing cuz that was that was kind of G doing a little bit of game developing but yeah didn't quite work out but anyways yeah all right so yeah I think that's going to be it cuz yeah my voice I can barely talk so yeah it's definitely it definitely is a skill to be able to do to be able to do live streaming talk at the same time definitely is a skill when that hopefully over time I won't gather it but yeah not yet all right so yeah I think that's going to be it so just wondering if there's a way to get publisher when I pish it there early access the answer is contact Publishers there are some of them that do Early Access games and some that don't so yeah all right so yeah I think that's going to be it so yeah thank you all so much for being here I hope you found this interesting and useful I try to answer as many questions as I could so yeah plenty of tutorials on various of the things that I talked about so going in a bit more detail but yeah thanks C uh yeah so thank you all everyone and yeah let me just just save just make sure that I've got this thing and yeah okay so prepare everything let me just turn on the background and I'm going to have to rest my voice for a little bit all right so yeah yeah hope hopefully live streams more in the future but anyways okay so yeah thank you all so much for being here and hopefully I will see you next time all right bye everyone thanks again bye
