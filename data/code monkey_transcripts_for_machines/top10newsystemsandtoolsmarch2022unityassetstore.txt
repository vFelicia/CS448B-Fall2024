hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the assessor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for march 22. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered the best three new assets so go watch it if you haven't seen it and in the next video i will be covering the top passes and effects as always there's links to the ads in the description as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 percent off your order also this month i just published my second free asset it's a health system just like i've used in so many videos it's super easy to use and all of the code is set up in a really nice clean way the asset also includes a code walkthrough video where i go through all the code step by step it's free so check it out and maybe use it in your next project and there's also a sale active on the store right now it has a time travel theme and a bonus coupon for an extra 10 off there's quite a bunch of interesting assets on this sale for example the allinone vfx toolkit this one is excellent it's from the same developer as the allinone sprite shader that i covered in a review then if you need more cinti assets over here is a really nice modular fantasy hero you have a complete game template for making a colony simulator there are some portals some fog a nice shader effect and a bunch more stuff so check out the sale and see if anything you're interested in is currently this gun alright so starting off with one that looks great and it's actually pretty cheap it's an arcade vehicle physics pack for me i've only done a bit of work with racing games i made a game jam quite a long time ago trying to build a working car that felt good to drive was actually pretty tricky so i just made something that was extremely simple so for me this one looks great the vehicle wobbles you've got some tire marks some smoke and definitely looks like it feels very arcadey and the price is really cheap so if you need a car controller then maybe get this one up next an interesting one a sensor toolkit this one is a collection of sensor components to detect various objects and sense the world around them basically it's a collection of tools for object detection uses many sensor types uses raycast volumetric light of sight and more works in both 2d and 3d and this one is version 2 with tons of positive reviews so it looks like a really wellbuilt asset and if you're working in vr and you want to rig your character and look at this one personally i haven't done any vr work but i imagine handling correct grab points is quite tricky which seems to be what this one is doing there are several of these interaction toolkits around again i'm not familiar with vr development so i'm not sure what's unique about this one but it does seem very complete it lets you grab objects in any way in any axes throw them with physics trigger some buttons open some drawers or use some levers grab and use some weapons and so on and somewhat related to that but not necessarily here is a fully working ingame keyboard naturally this is perfect for vr so you can type anything without needing to actually use an actual keyboard but this one can be also extremely useful for gamepad focused games where you want the player to be able to write some text or really just input their name again without needing a keyboard it's got all the keys symbols numbers and even some text emojis it includes various visual looks so you can make it fit your game then if your game is meant to have some realistic bullets look at this one you define the force and penetration of your bullets and how resistance each material is and you fire the bullet maybe it will go through ten pieces of wood but only two pieces of metal it includes ricochets some trajectory prediction you can easily set up the projectile curves and it even supports the coriolis effect on top of all that it even says that this one is multiplier ready so tons of options if you're working on a game where realism is key up next here's a possibly very useful one it's a final browser that works directly in game super useful for loading images or maybe some mod files or really just finding a save folder interestingly this one does not use any windows dll so you could get it working on mac and linux although apparently that requires some work this one is useful for games like i said for example locating mod files but perhaps even more useful if you're working on any kind of nongame application built with unity then if you have a 2d game and you want to simulate some wind look at this one basically applies a force around a certain area you can make the wind as strong or as weak as you like make it push up right down on any direction you can also make it interact with the unity particle system it's very easy to use since it works directly with all of the physics city components you really just drag the prefab and watch the one and up next here's a really unique one it's a tool for measuring and resizing objects based on real world units it extends the builtin transform component to provide fields for realworld units you can use metric or imperial so it's a simple tool that does exactly what you want could be very useful if your game relies heavily on some extremely precise measurements then over here we have a tool for making bridges in seconds first you just make your terrain as normal then you just click to add the points to make the main bridge shape then play around the materials the width whether you want an arch or not and so on it automatically modifies the terrain removes the trees and does everything and the final result looks really good so if you build your environments and then realize you need to change some things around then a tool like this one to dynamically make some bridges can be a real time saver and finally another interesting one you've got a javascript console you open up a console with a key then easily type in any javascript to interact with the world so you can move some objects you can spawn them change some materials change gravity and so on even though it's named javascript it's not literally javascript it's actually written in p or c sharp so with no plugins or no dlls it's definitely a niche tool but if you want a quick console and you're already familiar with javascript then can be quite useful alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unity assessor for march 22. there's links to on the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order check out the phone playlist to see some more lists with free and paid
