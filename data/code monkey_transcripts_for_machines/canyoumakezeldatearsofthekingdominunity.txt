hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's a quick question could you build Zelda tears of the Kingdom in unity the answer is yes yes you can alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time okay okay so here's a bit more detail on that answer now while I am saying you could definitely build a game like this in unity I am absolutely not dismissing the work the devs put into it the game is excellent and it truly is a Marvel of both design and Engineering the fact that this game with this huge scale and so many interconnected systems manages to run on what is essentially by now ancient Hardware that is truly amazing now my first reason for saying you could definitely build a game like this in unity is simply to look at other games on a similar scale that already exist this example is perhaps a game that was actually called a breath of the wild clone when it first came out I'm talking about the engine impact which a lot of people don't know is indeed made with unity when that game came out people encounter clone mostly because visually it doesn't look indeed quite similar even though they are very different games but that game does also have a huge open world it also has tons of characters and systems and it works on PC consoles and even mobile valheim is another example of a massive game made with yinty it features a huge world with tons of biomes also has some pretty complex building mechanics and all of it even while working in multiplayer and perhaps the biggest one that I'm aware of is license year program really excellent Factory building game with an insane amount of moving objects and machines you can build massive factories and you don't just build on a single planet but rather in the entire galaxy so you really can't get a bigger scale than that looking at these clearly as long as you and your team have the skills necessary the engine is definitely capable of producing something on this scale although like I said while it is possible it is not a trivial task making it work does require lots of smoke and mirrors lots of trickery in the background the most obvious one is simply LDS which Unity supports by default if you're moving in tears of the kingdom and you unlock in the background you will see the end of these change quite a lot the highest mod is unloaded when preclosed that helps lower the number of polygons on screen despite having such a huge view distance same thing for the grass on terrain that one is also very limited in terms of distance if you are actively trying to look for it you will notice these things but when playing the game normally everything looks and plays great you can Implement these features in unity another thing that I immediately noticed was right in the beginning link chips off a sky island and Float sound for me I'm playing on a projector with a fairly large image and as he was falling I could very clearly see some huge pixelation so another very important trick they're using is simply reducing the render scale if there's a huge distance visible on screen this is also something you can do in unity in various ways the render pipeline asset has a render scale that you can play with and there's also a feature called Dynamic resolution where you have very fine grain control over how exactly your game renders I have a lecture on this very obscure feature in my ultimate TNT ovary course by the way the game that I'm using here to demonstrate these tricks is my upcoming Steam games Inky Guardians it's a fun Coop action automation building game check it out the link in the description and add it to your wishlist and one thing they have to do that Unity suddenly doesn't have a builtin tool is World streaming on a huge world you can't really the entire thing at once especially on a memory limited device like the switch to build that in unity you would probably need to combine some super low rest rains for the far away parts and possibly work with some additive scene loading definitely take some work but it can be done then for the enemies I would assume they also have some kind of AI LOD system meaning that while the player is very far away they probably only run some simple walking or patrolling AI only when you get close to they start to enable some more complex behaviors note that while the game world is indeed huge you don't really have any scenarios where you encounter tons and tons of enemies or moving objects at once most of it is really just rain which nowadays game engines are pretty good at handling so if you use all these techniques then you too can build the game on this massive scale so again asking the question can you build a game like tears of the Kingdom in unity yes yes you can nowadays pretty much every engine is excellent and can build pretty much any game you can imagine you can make a giant open world game like engine impact with unity you can make a sort of 2D 3D game like Dragon Ball Fighters within real you can make a very unique game like Squad with Godot especially nowadays whatever game ID you have and whatever game engine you have as long as you have the skills yes you can build it oh and if you need assets to make your huge open World Games a reality there's a huge humble moment right now with over 5000 assets for just 25 bucks alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn
