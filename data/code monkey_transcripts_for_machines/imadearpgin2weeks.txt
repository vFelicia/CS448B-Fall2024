in this video we're going to check out a nice RPG I made in two weeks for a game jam it features an over map with enemies and NPCs a turnbased battle system and a nice small story with dialogue and cutscenes let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you will learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing so first of all this game is an entry to the easy allies Glenys countering game jam you can play the game on itch and like every other video on the channel you can download the project files from the website I've been a big fan of easy allies since they were game trailers and I've been meaning to join a game jam for some time if you're not familiar with easy unless they are a group of awesome people who cover gaming news reviews and more so check out their YouTube channel so with this being such a unique and interesting game jam I thought it was time to give it a shot the uniqueness of the game jam was in making a game with a bunch of weird rooms designed to annoy the player for example one of the rules was to make character that randomly trips up the player another one is to have the characters constantly talk about mountain dew and have a very garish looking armor the end result of all that is a nice small RPG with a turnbased battle system with various characters and enemies the game is actually quite complex and the reason I've been able to make it in such a short amount of time is due to what I always talk about the videos which is the importance of writing clean reusable code as I go through an overview of how the game was made you won't see many elements which were created previously and simply added on to this game so if you've been following the channel for some time you might recognize various elements let's start off by going through part of the game and then we'll go more indepth into how each system works if you like you can pause the video right now and go play the game then come back here to continue watching the game is rather quick only around 20 minutes so go play it right now so the video doesn't spoil anything alright let's get to it we start off in a rather simple main menu here we just have gotten to play and want to quit as we hit play we can see the recipe which are the weird rules that the game must abide by so as you can see we have an extremely annoying sidekick then the button to taunt the NPC's is the same as the used consumable the player has a different sprite in the portrait the enemy wins in a cutscene and so on okay so continue here are the controls very simple movement and interaction now here we are in the game itself and we start the story we have a simple dialogue system with some text writing once the intro text is done then here we are in the over map so here we can move around very simple movement and we keep moving in counter our first enemy we talk to him and after a while we go into our battle screen so here we are in a very simple turnbased battle system I've actually covered this in a separate video last week now we can do our simple attack there he goes attacks once it's done it's the enemy's turn and he does his own attack and in this case he missed so we can keep attack him and destroy him we go back into the Oval map and the enemy has been destroyed keep going and we go into another fight now here we are and on this battle system we also have a special move the special differs per characters so our three different classes have three different special attacks this one is a powerful kick so president boom there he goes then when it's done it's on a cooldown so we now do our normal attacks to defeat town right there it is another one now we keep going and eventually you find our character which is blocking our passage first he starts off as an enemy so we need to defeat them and now we won and now he joins our team as he joins his annoying sidekick comes along with us so just like now we now have another member in our party now sleazier again one of the rules is to trip me up and yep he does it right away so I cannot move and that is indeed quite annoying so we keep going into this nice map and as we reach the town we have to go and talk to this NPC which is the other room where another NPC just randomly has the exact same sprite as the player and it is never explained then we keep going and go into a nice simple tavern and over here we get ambushed by enemies there you go some nice particle effects and yep we go into another battle so now we have two members in our team against three enemies so I can do a normal attack with this one and now on the tank character it has a different special so we hit it if there you go a nice AoE attack any of we win when we win then the humor which is the final character joins our party alright so this is the basics for how the game goes we move around the map we talk to NPCs from a story and pattern in a turnbased battle system so this is a fully functional simple RPG that was built in two weeks and you can go to edge to play the whole game and also you can download the project files from the website so you can see how all of this is set up so now that we've seen an overview let's see how each system is set up and what systems I've managed to reuse starting with the main menu here it is very simple we just have some buttons to play and quit and a bunch of extra buttons with information on the side the way the transitions are made is essentially with different selves so we start off with the south main then we hit play then we go into the recipe play so this one shows then we go into the controls and then we go into the game so here we are in the main menu hit play and there we go and the text is animated and pops up over time and we hit play and here it is just a simple thing and hit play okay so here we are in our game scene we start off with some story exposition so in here I've made this simple dialogue system it is very simple it only has two of all characters and text being written right now there's only one character talking so the right one is hidden so we can pause in order to go up here in turn look at our UI and here it is the download window and how it's set up so we have left character than the right character which is currently hidden live chat bubble right left name and right name this is a very simple dialogue system but the game is meant to be extremely simple so it's perfect for this scenario so let me know in the comments if you'd like to see a video dedicated to building a dialogue system now one of the rules is for the player sprite to be different in the portrait and in the over map so that's why the player has that sprite and in here the portrait is different once we get through the starting story here it is our main character the movement code was made in the simple character movement video so I can move them around with a keyboard but it would also be possible to use gamepad input now over here we have some hitboxes so if I go in there I cannot leave the map so the player is constrained to the plane area and if we pause we can see how the map is set up so here it is the entire game these game objects are what defines the various events that happened over the course of the game so as you can see in here the player start up in here this starts off the first enemy that has a specific text then the second one and then the tank gets spawned in here this laser and so on so as we move you can see everything is set up the map is on inside a nice game object where we have the visuals and also our hit boxes so there yo these are all the hitboxes so here for exemple you can see there's an invisible head box here to make sure that the player correctly interacts with this enemy before going through when he defeats this enemy then this head box won't become disabled so the player can keep moving and so on and so on so in here the same thing this one is blocked then it defeats the tank then the sprite and the hitbox both get vanished and as you can see on the entire map it's pretty simple since this is a very simple game jam game so we simply have this path so the player goes here goes here then keeps moving fight the evil monster get stuck in the dungeon moves towards evil monster it was back in the dungeon then this head box disappears then he moves through into the third evil monster encounter for the enemies you can see that they have some very roaming behavior so there he is stopped and after a while he simply moves to a position nearby his spawn position and all the NPCs are simply I don't just stand or decode for the enemy overlap is also very simple since all the combat is done on a separate scene the code in here similar looks to see if the player is nearby and moved towards him so in here if the player is within a certain target range then he moves towards him and if he is within a attack range then we have our interaction which then depending on this character type you won't either unload the starting cutscenes article simply unload an enemy encounter okay so let's approach our first enemy here we are let's move to the right and there's the enemy right there he sees me moves towards and engages the cutscene now you can see that dialogue is between two characters so here's the dialogue window and as you can see the left character is now slightly faded which only means this one is on gray now we keep talking and there you go some nice text writer on the text along with some sound and after a while here we go we go into our battle now I've covered the creation of this turnbased battle system in the last video so go check that out to see how it was made here this one has a couple more features unlike for example multiple targets and special attacks but the basics are do a normal attack there you go attacks now it's his turn now he goes attacks and so on right so once we defeat him we go back into our over map and the enemy was killed so he no longer gets spawned when you go back into the over map well let's go into another battle just so we can take some damage okay so here we are we took some damage and now we need to go back into the over map there you go our health matches so the healthcare is between battle to battle how that is set up is by using a simple character class and let's see how its set up here it is the character class over here we have a type for each unique type then we also have some basic stats and down here on our constructor we receive a type and based on that type we initialize these stats so here the player starts off with 35 attack 120 health and so on gaming Senshi AIT's a character when the game starts and keeps them in memory throughout the game that memory stored here in a game data class we have the various states that handle the story state and all the characters are stored in a simple list so they had initialized just once and there you go everything is like that for adding them here it is manually adding all the important characters so the player tanks laser in the healer and then it cycles through the map which is the map prefab that you saw previously and we insensate the characters that means in order to edit the map all we need to do is go in here and modify our prefab so in here I could have mana mean here by simply duplicating that game object and having it in there the data that is used to instantiate the character is stored in this simple model behavior so it is the position of the game object and then these stats to make sure which character it should be spawned so that's pretty much how the world design works just a bunch of game objects that define positions and what character type should be on that position okay now let's continue with the game now after fighting the first two we reach the tank blocking the tower entrance now there are four types of characters on the / map there's the player then there's the enemies then we have NPCs and farmers right now the tank is an NPC so he's just standing around and not doing anything by being near an NPC and pressing the interact but I can start a cutscene the cutscene that gets started depends on the game state so the aim state is stored in here on the game data as you can see we have just a very simple state variable and we leave various states so we do a switch and if we were interacting with an NPC and we are on a certain state then we start a certain cutting okay so over here we talk to the tank very simple and again here we are back in our battle scene with a different enemy type and over here I can now use a special for a very powerful kick now he attacks he does his normal attack and now normal time okay so just like this now I've defeated the tank and we go back into the over map and again it is the state to load the correct cutscene and over here we talked some like this name and go back to the over most so here we are back in the over map and slizzer immediately does his own thing now the tank is a forward instead of an NPC so that means he keeps track of the distance to the player and if it's far enough he moves towards him and that's it sneezer has a timer on his script and after a certain amount of time there you go he runs towards a player as soon as he gets within a certain distance the player trips up plays a small animation and can no longer move until it gets back up and everything proceeds so you see we also have various chat bombs being popped up these ones related to the fountain view are simple prefabs so they simply get in Senshi ated they are static prefabs in order to be able to have an image in the middle of the text whereas the other ones where this laser says and he replies those are dynamic chat bubbles meaning that the background extends based on the text so those are very similar to how the tone tip works okay continuing in the game we also have a nice quest arrow pointer this was also created in a previous video you saw previously pointing towards the tank with an exclamation mark and right now it's pointing there to the right and if we approach there go the position turns into 1x and when we get within a certain distance of our target there you go we unload another cutscene when we finish this cutscene there you go it's now pointing into a different direction and with a different color and as soon as we go there you go we nice exclamation point again check out the dedicated video to see how that works it's a very simple element now this character here is the one that is the examine like the player but never acknowledged so we talked to him and now we go towards the tavern and over here we have a bunch of NPCs just playing a simple iPhone animation over here is a healer which is currently just an NPC so he's not doing anything and when we approach this position it won't load another cutscene where the enemies won't ambushers now how that is set up we can see over here pause and go over here and here they are they get spawned right here in this corner so they're essentially just out of view and when we start the cutscene we won't play some nice particle effects and then they won't be teleported on to their correct positions so let's see that in action here we go start each cutscene all right now see the particle effects and now those characters get teleported in there as you can see they are no longer on the court okay so now is a good time to look at how the cutscenes are set up over here is a nice static classic contains all the cutscenes so down here we can go to the tavern ambush here is the tavern ambush cutscene so in this case we start off by destroying the pointer then we show the UI a black background we stop the over map from running so on the enemy stop roaming then we set the dialogue actions the dialogue is very simple so it only works linearly so essentially every action follows another one so we set those actions then we go into the very first one where we show the dialogue window then Sheldon left character with this pride show the unlife character name left text hide the right character right tags right name then when we go into the cutscene for the enemy spawning here it is we get the player position then we position the enemies in sin she ate some smoke particles and then we hide them so they are hidden while see smoke animation is playing and after a short amount of time they become visible all the timing is handled in here by the function timer which is a class from the code monkey utilities that you can get from the website then we keep going through our dialogue the enemy says his text and then we load our enemy encounter so all the cutscenes in the game are handled by this class so as you can see all of them play thanked after join play tank before join and so on we have all them ok so back into our game let's go through the dialogue and into battle and here as you can see we have multiple enemies and also the tank is now on our team so can select target and let's hit that one up there and now again the special attack is different so we can now try out the tank special attack and there you a nice AoE effect ok let's defeat them and here we are now we meet the human so now with all the team members in our party we can carry on with our quest well as soon as sleazier wants me go so let's wait if there is he is indeed very annoying okay so keep going and we're going to go into our shopkeeper and talk to him and there you go a very simple dialogue and when it's done we have the simplest basic shop possible and here we just have a very basic UI window here it is a UI window with just a few buttons Garen button is disabled and the others add points to either our health or our found you amount so just click on it and there you go our in your goes up and the store goes out of stock and so on now these ends are stored over here on the game data we just have two very simple ends okay so we keep going with the game and I last thing that I want to show is the animated cutscenes so here we are fighting the evil monster for the first time now the rules say that the monster should somehow we reckon Slee win the fight even though we kill me so we get them down to zero HP ok let's see if he dies on this hips and there we go as soon as he dies plays the animated cutscene and here we go he goes any spawns from behind any punches to play so just like that he miraculously won even though we actually destroyed and when we're done again based on our game state we now we had teleport into the dungeon and we start in here so here we meet the other character and after talking to him for a while he decides to untie us and there you go just simple movement and destroying the rope game objects before continuing on with down there we go the same particle effect he vanishes and here we are back into the cutscene so that's pretty much it for all of the unique elements of the game so again if we pause we can see the entire path of the game so we are right here in the dungeon so now the goal is to go in here meet the evil monster for the second time and we're going to lose again then we go back here then this package gets destroyed and we can then go and find the third battle where we can finally win let's just go over here to the second chair which has a fun new armor and that is again here on the character Spandana simply a bone has found your armor so when this shopkeeper is spawn he has the armor so let's meet him and also else in the over map we can press base in order to use one of the health potions and we heal everyone on the team ok so here we are talk to him and he has the armor available so click on it and there you go we equip the armor and there it is it replaced our previous body so now the player is wearing the special armor now the way this works is by replacing pixels on the players spreadsheet so in here we can pause look at the player spreadsheet and there you go there's the player spreadsheet and as you can see it has this body whereas previously we can see the original spreadsheet here is the original spreadsheet as you can see this body was replaced and it was replaced with this one in here this one so we just copy pasted these pixels onto the player spreadsheet check out the videos I've done on the gift spreadsheets as used in battle rata kun which explains how to read and copy pixels so you simply merge textures dynamically based on certain logic so in this case when he equips the special armor alright and just for the animated cutscene how that works here it is that he is handled in a different scene so in here we have the cinematic one which is the one where they in lose and here you can see how it is set up so it's very simple there's just an animation game object with a animation and over here we have the various poses of the characters and if we go into the animation we can play it and there you go first place through that one then that one shows up then that one shows up then down goes in there and that one goes in there and after a while there we go after seven seconds we then hold back into the over map so this is the cutscene where they lose and then the other cutscene where they win so here it is with a bunch more character poses and again the same thing just a game object with a animation and we play it and goes like that the player player defeats goes but then he defeats him and then he's on the floor and slizzer picks up the weapon and then he's standing around and sleazier stabs him in the back and there you go slizzer wins the day and yep there it is alright so that's pretty much it for our indepth overview this was a very interesting game to make and I'm quite pleased with the end result it's a very nice simple oldschool RPG you can get the project files yourself and try to expand upon it by making different maps and different story as you saw out the game is quite complex even though it was built in just two weeks the reason is because I was able to reuse quite a lot of code from previously made elements so as I only say make sure you always write clean code so you can reuse it in the future many thanks to easy on ice for setting up such a silly game gem and if you're interested in keeping up with gaming news and reviews go check them out on YouTube as always you can download the project files in the Tonys from unity code monkey comp if you like the videos certain channel for more Eng tutorials post any questions you have in the comments and I'll do my best Internet right see
