hello and welcome i'm your code monkey so bitcoin is very popular nowadays along with all kinds of crypto like ethereum defy nfts and so on behind all of that is the blockchain technology which is still a mystery to a lot of people it's pretty complex but also very interesting and once it clicks then everything starts to make sense so i've been researching bitcoin and blockchain for the past few months and i made this nice demo to help solidify my own knowledge and to help you understand how all of this works i'm going to start from the most basic scenario possible and slowly introduce more and more concepts until the home blockchain system comes clear there are chapters in the video if you want to skip around but if you really want to learn then it's best to watch the whole thing and the demo that i won't be using here is also available on the website as well as the project files in case you want to dig deeper yourself all right so first let's just define some basic terms now bitcoin is one specific cryptocurrency that uses the blockchain to keep track of ownership and blockchain is the technology which like the name implies chains a bunch of blocks together which contain whatever data you want the chain from block to block is based on some very complex algorithms which is what gives it security now the key point is bitcoin does not equal blockchain bitcoin is simply one of the many possible use cases for blockchain technology for example you might have heard of nfts well that is another type of use case for blockchain technology that has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin in the case of nfts the underlying network might be for example the ethereum network which allows for smart contracts to be created but again for now let's stick with the basics so how does the blockchain work now to understand it i made this nice demo and we're going to go step by step so on my first demo here i really just have a text box now like i said the blockchain can store any kind of data so in the case of bitcoin this would be some data like for example list sends bob10btc or for example in the case of ethereum this could be a smart contract or in the case of nft this would be some unique id data is really just data remember how blockchain can be used for anything it doesn't have to be just bitcoin or just money so for now let's ignore everything related to transactions or wallets or money of any kind in the end everything is just data so here as a type of data i just have some text so now we introduce the concept of a hash so first what is a hash well a hash is essentially a signature for some data now if i type something in here like for example hello world i get down here the calculated hash based on this data so as you can see it starts with a591 now importantly the same data will always result in the same hash so if i erase this and i type hello world again yep i get the exact same hash another very important thing about hashes is if i make just one tiny change then the output should completely change so for example in here if i just change the w from uppercase into lowercase if there you go i get a completely different hash so if the data changes in any way no matter how small the hash is completely different so keep that in mind as we go along also different cryptos use different hashes like for example bitcoin uses sha 256 whereas ethereum uses eth hash but the logic behind how the hashes are used is mostly the same so with this we now have a simple block we just got some data and some hash and then we can have multiple blocks and like the name implies it's a blockchain so the next step is to chain these blocks so here it is now the way they are chained together is that each block contains the hash of the previous block so this block has discounted hash then the second block takes that hash as an input then this calculated hash goes into the previous one on this one and so on now one important part is the very first one this one there's no previous blocks so this is what is called the genesis block it's a very special first block on the blockchain which has a special value on the previous hash and all the others they contain the hash of the previous block now also note how the hash is calculated so it's a hash of the data on the block but also the previous hash so previously all the blocks with the same data had the same hash but now since the hash is currently along with the previous hash if i type in the exact same thing here all blocks have the exact same data but since the hash is calculated not just on the data but the data plus the previous hash you can see that the final hashes are completely different so all the blocks are chained together they all have a link to the previous hash on the previous block now again remember that the purpose of a hash is to work as a signature for the data contained in block the data plus the previous hash so that means that if i modify this block i get a different hash and now this second block also needs to have a different hash here so that means that if i modify this block then this hash has to be recalculated since the data changed and in turn it makes this block incorrect which breaks the whole chain so this is how the blockchain is immutable immutable simply means that it cannot change it cannot mutate it cannot modify into something else once the data is recorded on the blockchain it cannot be changed or else the home blockchain breaks the only way to modify the blockchain is to essentially recalculate all of the hashes on the entire blockchain which as we will soon see it's essentially an impossible task so now that we have a blockchain working we move on to the next level one very important concept about bitcoin and pretty much all of crypto is decentralization meaning that the blockchain does not exist on just one central authority but instead everyone has a copy of the blockchain so that means that for example if this user is nefarious and tries to modify the blockchain even if this user manages to recollect the hashes in order to make a valid blockchain all of the other users won't see it and the consensus wins so the network as a whole simply ignores the nefarious actor so in this case there are two users with the blockchain on this state and then there's one user on a different state so two versus one two wins so this one is the actual valid state for the blockchain so as new users join the network the first thing they do is get a copy of the entire blockchain then those users can go and verify all the hashes to ensure that all the data on the blockchain is valid and has not been tampered with and as soon as that new user starts to receive the latest blocks it can verify the hash in the previous hash to confirm that it does have the valid correct blockchain so next up how blocks are added now in order to add it the user creates a block with whatever data it should have so for example in the case of bitcoin it would add pending transactions as the data so for example alice sends bob10 btc so that's the data that is going to be created on this block then it adds the hash to the previous block in order to make the link and then it calculates the final hash based on the previous and the data contained in this block and then it simply broadcasts that block onto the entire network again this is how it's decentralized this is a peertopeer system so there's no centralized server anywhere this user creates the block then tells this user and this user then in turn this one tells this one and so on so the next block gets propagated throughout the network throughout its users now of course if anyone can add blocks by just pressing a button then that would make it way too easy for a nefarious actor to take over the network and generate a whole bunch of fake blocks if you could recalculate all the hashes of the entire blockchain in an instant then it wouldn't be secure at all so that's where the concept of mining and proofofwork comes in in order to create a new block on network a user or rather a miner does indeed create a new block with whatever data and link to the previous block but then it also adds one more thing called the nonce so this is just a normal number and this number is used in completing the final hash so as you can see the final hash now is composed of the previous hash the data for this block and the nonce value now the important thing is that the final hash here in order to be considered valid it has to have a certain number of starting zeros so as a new block gets added into the pending poll so again for example ellis sends bob10btc that one gets set on the pending block then in order for this to be added into the blockchain the miner really starts money and what that means that the miner must go through all kinds of numbers until it finds one that makes the final hash start with a certain number of zeros so that's what mining is it's really just a computer or rather tons of computers so all the miners on the network all of them trying all different kinds of numbers until the first one finds a valid number when a miner finds a nonce it generates a valid hash then it gets broadcasted to all the miners and gets added onto the blockchain and the number of zeros here is essentially the difficulty setting on the puzzle so if i set in low difficulty so less number of zeros on the starting hash then means that the miners won't find a valid result very quickly so you go down with three starting zeros it took eleven thousand tries in order to find a valid hash but this one with just two zeros it only took 400 tries so if you lower the difficulty then the miners find the valid result very quickly and if you set it higher then obviously takes more tries in order to find a valid result now in the context of bitcoin this difficulty is dynamically adjusted based on the number of active miners on the network in order to ensure that each block takes on average 10 minutes to mine so as more miners join the network the difficulty goes up and if miners leave the network then the difficulty goes down so what we have here is what's called proof of work that is because when a miner broadcasts a new node onto the network all of the users on that network can validate and verify that this nonce does indeed generate a valid final hash and they know that the only way the miner found that valid notes was by trying out tons and tons of them one by one so the fact that the miner found the valid numbers is proof that a certain amount of work has been put into it also one key point here is that it's very difficult to find a valid hash essentially you have to try every single possible number until you find a valid one so that takes a ton of work however it's very easy to validate a hash once you know all of the values you can very easily calculate the hash of all this and verify that this nonce with this data and this previous hash does indeed generate this final hash so it's hard to generate but easy to verify now just one note here about users and miners so a user is anyone who is using the network so anyone who has a wallet and wants to do some sort of transaction so a user itself doesn't actually need to have a phone copy of the blockchain the user simply says i want to do a transaction and send the transaction onto the pending pool and then the miners they are really just machines simply running the mining software those then go into the pinning pool they grab on transactions in there they do the money work and create a new valid block so the key point is you don't have to be a miner in order to simply use the network now based on how the network is decentralized and you have tons of miners all over the world all of them trying to solve the same puzzle eventually it won't happen that two miners come up with two different valid solutions at the exact same time because again this is just unknown so there isn't just one valid solution there's tons of them so when two of them find a valid solution at the exact same time when that happens it creates a fork on the blockchain now the blockchain cannot have forks so one block must only lead into just one other so the solution to that is to simply wait until more blocks are mined now some miners won't be mining on this block so using this hash is the previous hash and some miners won't be mining on this fork so using this hash is the previous one and after one or more blocks are mined then as a rule the longest chain wins being the longest chain really means that it's the one with the most amount of work put into it so the fact that this chain is valid and longer is proof that more work was put into it so when that happens the other fork is simply discarded as if it never existed the network consensus is based on what the majority of the network agrees that is true so once a majority of network agrees that this is a true state of the blockchain then everything keeps going from here on as normal so that's another key point of blockchain it's a system that does not require trust on one individual or central authority trust comes by simply knowing that work has been put into the network so as a new user comes into the network maybe they will receive blockchain data from two peers and one of them sends this chain and another one sends this chain that new user doesn't have to choose in order to trust one pier over another it simply trusts that the longest chain is the one with the most amount of work put into it and considers that the true state of the watching now the possibility of forks also has another implication with regards to security and truth on the network so let's say for example that on this four can include a transaction to buy an item so for example let's say that alice wanted to buy something from bob and different miners can grab different transactions from the pending pool so again let's say on this fork it had this transaction but on this one it didn't have this one it had something else and now let's say that bob only happened to receive this fork so he sees the block he sees that the block is valid which means that he received payment so he ships the item right away but then the miners continue working on network and the fork is solved and it just so happens that this one down here is the one that is selected so that means that this one is now the true state of network and this fork is discarded so if for example this fork up here did include this transaction but this one did not well that means that since this fork is discarded then bob never ends up receiving the payment but bob already shipped the package so now he's screwed and there's nothing he can do about it now this is not a bug it's an inherent property of the way the blockchain works what it means is that you cannot 100 trust as soon as a valid block is mined so the transaction analyst sends bob10btc gets added onto the pending pool then a miner mines it and adds it to the lock so this one is now valid on blockchain but again it's a very recent block so you cannot 100 trust it just yet since network consensus is based on the chain link then the older the block is the more you can trust it since there's more proof of work so again when it's the very last block you can't trust it when it's now the second block and chain then you can start to trust it a bit more then after three maybe it's trustworthy and when it's maybe five or six blocks behind then at that point he can be pretty confident that that is the true set of network now let's try to understand how everything that we have set up here makes for a very secure system that cannot be modified so here for example we have alice and bob and a bunch more users on the network now alice decides to send bob 50 bitcoins to buy a car or something so analyst sends bob 50 btc so makes that transaction adds it into the pending pool then a bunch of miners are going to mine it they're going to find a found hash and they're going to add it to them watching so everything is good now bob follows what i said in the last demo and only since the car after the block is a couple of blocks old so a bunch more blocks are mined and added onto the blockchain and after a few have been added now bob finally sends the car now as soon as alice hears that bob's in the car now she tries to be sneaky and modify the blockchain and to only send just 10 bitcoins so she goes into her own blockchain modifies instead of setting 50 just sending 10. now again like we saw previously modifying the data caused they change in the hash which means that this node has to be mined all over again and of course since each hash is using the next block then all of these ones need to be bind again as well and again the network consensus is based on the longest chain so what that means is that in order for analysts to cheat bob and modify the blockchain she would have to make modifications and mine all of these blocks herself before the entire rest of network mined some more blocks so what that means is that it's technically possible for alice to modify the blockchain and cheat the system but in order to do that she would need to control the majority of the mining power on the network this is what you might have heard referred to as a 51 attack essentially if you controlled 51 of the network then your fake chain would have more mining power which would eventually surpass the real chain which would in turn make your fake chain the real accepted chain so this is what gives blockchain its security every block is completely immutable and cannot ever be modified as long as there is no single actor with a majority of control of the network which given the current size of the bitcoin blockchain makes it pretty much impossible for someone to control that much mining power which in turn makes it extremely secure so when you put all the steps that we just saw together we end up with a basic working blockchain everything you see in the crypto space is really just various use cases built upon the same base so for example in the context of bitcoin the blockchain is used to store transaction data you have wallets with some keys used to validate that you have access to a particular wallet with a particular amount of bitcoins then you also have the rate at which bitcoins are introduced into the system they are given as rewards to miners and after a fixed number of bitcoins are created then network will transition to working on mining fees another popular network is the ethereum blockchain which instead of just transaction data it also uses smart contracts to run code directly on the blockchain the code can then do all kinds of things like wait for a particular condition to be fulfilled and automatically transfer funds from one account to another you might also have heard of nfts which again they're just data stored on the blockchain so in this case it's a sort of unique token that represents ownership of a particular thing so essentially with all this you now have a better understanding of how the basics of the blockchain works you can now go and learn about some more advanced topics like for example how account balance works in bitcoin so what are wallets and what are public and private keys and how they are used to secure the wallet as well as signing transactions you can also go research other consensus methods beyond proofofwork so proofofstake is one of the main alternatives which has the huge benefit of massively cutting down on energy usage as compared to proofofwork smart contracts which is the main difference between bitcoin and someone like ethereum it's a way to run code directly on the blockchain tokenomics which is how each cryptocurrency handles their token so how new tokens enter the system how or if they are burned how much do the funders hold and so on layer two which is how you build a blockchain on top of another blockchain in order to solve some transaction volume problems and so on so as you can see blockchain is a massive new technology and if you want to go deeper you can learn much more about it okay so that's it if this video helped you then please hit the like button it's a tiny thing
