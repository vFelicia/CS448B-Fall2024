hello and welcome I'm your KMI the asset swore is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome visual stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for April 24 even if you don't pick up any of these still great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid asset effects I've already covered the best free new assets and the best SS and systems as always there's links to the ass in description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code 10 to get 10% off your order by the way I've started working on something that people have been asking me to do for ages I'm currently working on planning my upcoming dots course I was waiting for the unity 6 preview which came out just right now so if you're interested in learning how to make a game with dots then check out the link and sign up I'll send an email when the course is reading and if you need some gorgeous realistic assets then check out the cor Humble Bundle if you're working on something with a realistic style then this publisher has some gorgeous assets you've got lots of awesome environments and most of these work with unity the unreal specific things are just these vehicles although technically could also just grab the models and the materials take it without the scripts and use it inside Unity so if you need tons of realistic awesome SES then check it out all right so starting off with a super highquality character here is a demonic Warrior it's a really cool design it looks like it could be a special character that lives in moror the character apparently has a name it's called arendel that really sounds like a very Lord the Rings like name or just fantasy it's got a sword some clot simulation and some face blend shapes this publisher makes some of the highest quality characters that I've seen so if if you want something super highend definitely check out the entire page next up here is the latest Cindy asset and this one is very different from their usual it's a UI pack it's kind of interesting to see them explore different areas a while ago they also made their first animation pack this one is called scifi Soldier and looks really awesome you've got lots of Sliders buttons weapons mini Maps portraits and so on there's some loading screens some targeting rectangles there's lots of controls and tons of weapon and item icons looks like a really great pack I definitely hope they do more of these then here here's a really cool one it's an upgradeable car pack this one immediately reminded me of a game that I love playing as a kid it was called Gearhead garage and it was kind of a car mechanic Simulator game you could remove some screws and bolts you could fix some things and put them back together with this pack you could build a simple game just like that something based on buying a car and fixing or upgrading it this pack contains multiple bodies you've got various engines hoods wheels and a bunch more so this would be really great for some mechanic game or really just a racing game with some premade C T cars then if you need some particle effects here's a nice one these are sales which I personally always love this pack includes 60 effects everything from slashes aurus projectiles explosions there's some great looking fire some awesome looking stun or sleep effects or maybe just some nice smoke that you can combine with some powerful tornadoes next if you want a nice Battlefield check out this one this is a really huge pack almost 800 prefabs it's a battlefield with a ton of weapons some cannons and some great looking towers and Tents look at this one reminds me of the first mission in The Witcher 2 you could build a castle seed just like that with this pack the video looks really gorgeous with some nice natural lighting so whether you're making a castle game or really if you're just someone who likes to build worlds for fun then this looks like it would be great to play with then if you're making a Samurai game here is a modular Samurai it's a very highend realistic model or actually multiple models being modular means that with just this one pack you can create hundreds of characters pretty much enough to populate an entire world you can make some really serious samurai or make some innocent villagers maybe some Yakuza members or some Farmers you've got plenty of different body parts and different materials to make tons of variation so really if you'd like to make a game inspired by some like ghost of sushima then this pack would be an excellent staring Point next if your game has some knife weapons and you need some animations for that and check out this one you've got over 300 Knife Animations so everything from even just standard regular walking idle and crotch animations all while holding a knife you've got those as well as some really nice attacks slashes stabs and Combos and it also has some equip animations and some nice Movement Like vaulting over a crate then if you're making a cyberpunk like game and you need some Neon Lights check out this one basically what makes something cyberpunk versus just scifi is really an abundance of Neon Lights this pack includes over a thousand prefabs that's a huge amount you've got lots of signs Holograms and glitchy screens all of it to populate your city and this one also comes in modular parts and if you want the city on top of all these neon signs if so then this St has more packs in the same style or maybe if you're hungry then here's some gorgeous Japanese food these are some really delicious looking models they are nice and stylized but not too cartoony you've got some rice some Ramen and a bunch of things that I'm really not familiar with there's a 150 Assets in this pack and this da has a bunch more packs in the same style so if you'd like to make some kind of Japanese restaurant tycoon game if so then this would be a really great starting point or maybe you're working on some shooting game if so here are some nice fantasy rifles these are some very strange very unique models they look mechanical and also a little bit organic some of them look almost religious or something so seems like a little bit of a Warhammer Vibe others look like they could belong to some Orcs from World of Warcraft so it's a very strange pack but if you want to make your game send out and this looks like it would be great or if inste of weapons you need some Vehicles check out this one personally I quite like the style it's nice and cute all very rounded this one is a pre giant pack with tons of variation you've got some regular cars some cop cars there's some industry Vehicles some taxi racing hot rods and a bunch more looking at this one reminds me of playing the game Micro Machines when I was a kid this would be a great pack for making a game just like that one then if you're more into a realistic style if so then look at this Victorian menion my iMed reaction is this looks like a house straight out of Resident Evil personally I always find this style very spooky this kind of Victorian thing it always scraps me out so this would be perfect for some kind of horror game but really horror is all about lighting so if you take exactly this if you put this this house with some nice natural lighting it would actually look quite gorgeous then if you need some icons but in 3D check out this one making 3D icons can sometimes look better than 2D especially because makes them easier to animate so these are great for things like weapon or item pickups or really just to make your UI send out a little bit more this one is a nice pack with 100 icons you've got some chests locks gears weapons and of course a bunch of exclamation points for all your quests next if you watch Dune and you wanted to make a game just like it if so here's a sand to get you started it looks very aggressive very nasty this one is a super highend model this Dev really excels at making a realistic Style with some gorgeous super high quality textures this creature can be either giant or small and it includes 20 animations for you to play with then here's some really cool looking Androids this one reminds me of the movie chappie that was a fun movie it's a great highquality model with six different skins it says the model is rigged although I'm not sure if it's a humanoid rig either way it looks really great and comes with a bunch of weapons then for some effects here are some map markers these are really great for any kind of RTS game or maybe even something like Diablo so a top down action game or perhaps these could also be great in a game kind of like hell divers you could use that to Showcase some kind of air strike location then if you need an underground map check out this one this one looks really perfect for some kind of game inspired by aliens or maybe just a fun map for some fun multiplayer shooting game it looks like a pretty large level so you can just use the demo scene as is or build your own then here's a cool generic anime guy with a sword it's a pretty nice design it's generic but it does look the part this could be really great in some kind of jrpg game only difficulty would be finding other characters that match this style but perhaps you could use this in a game kind of like Devil M cry and if so you would only need to find some monsters next here's a really cool looking effect pack this one is all about chain skills so immediately of course I would say this looks inspired by scorpion for Mortal Kombat I can almost hear that get over here line it's got a nice variety of attacks from simple to complex so definitely a very Niche thing but if you need some chain then this looks really great or perhaps you just need an entire stylized Island if so look at this one it looks really gorgeous I especially love the top down view a few months ago I played Desperados 3 and this looks like the perfect environment for a mission in that game you could just add some characters control them from a top down perspective Implement some skills add some enemies and with that you have a gorgeous level or of course just go down into first person and build your own of Thieves all right so those are my top 20 new visual assets on the unsore for April 24 there's links to all in the description and as bonus
