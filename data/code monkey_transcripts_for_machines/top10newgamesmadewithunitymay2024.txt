visual style pixel art 2D Sprints in a nice 3D World with lots of gorgeous effects I think this was first shown in some kind of Summer Games Fest or an event like that and people right away really

an old school feel here is Crow country it's got some nice PS1 sound Graphics very crunchy low poly textures and low poly assets it also has some great post procing effects and another thing that gives this look is having a perspective camera but with a very low fov it makes the game clearly in 3D but very tight this is actually a visual sound that I'd love to try out someday the game itself is survival horror so there's been a mysterious disappearance and the abrupt closure of a theme park it's up to you to go investigate exactly what happened the game features lots of unique environments you can interact with all sorts of objects you can pick up things and have a nice inventory system then of course there are a bunch of really creepy characters waiting to pounce on you

makes this one of the best reviewed games in the entirety of scam so if you like this genre PS1 survival horror then definitely give this a try then here's something really stylish called cryp Master right away you can see how it looks very unique standing out is one of the hardest part nowadays and this game succeeds right away at that it's an old school Dungeon Crawler so you move left right

some barred rap battles it's certainly very unique game not just in visuals but actually in mechanics as well and people do seem to love it it's got over 500 overwhelmingly positive reviews then if you want to run your own Esports team look at Esports Godfather it's a deck building game simulating MOBA Esports you are the team coach and it's up to you to build your team Scout for promising athletes customize how they train join some matches and lead your team to Victory you can give some ORD to your team like for example should your Jer initiate a fight on the bottom lane or should everyone just push the Top Lane the match and the opponents are always learning so you need to adapt to your strategies in order to win also interestingly enough I think this is the first game that I'm seeing with the AI generated cond disclosure on Steam they used AI for character portraits and some illustrations I was curious to see how players would react to this and it seems that the answer is actually similar to using assets in your games meaning all that players want is really just fun games to play and this case the players are loving the game regardless of what was used to build it they have over 1,000 reviews at 90% positive and at number one for my personal pick of the month here's a very unique game that calls itself an engineering Rogue likee it's called Rogue voltage it's an extremely inventive game you have a board where you can wear some circuits you build machines and chain reactions to do all kinds of attacks and actions decide where you want to spend your energy so should you do an attack or maybe use a healing potion or sore that energy in a battery in order to make a massive attack in the future another another interesting mechanic is how you actually have control over when the turns happen so you can push your units either forwards or backwards in time in order to dodge all kinds of environmental attacks explore this world and try to make it to the end one step at a time different nodes have different enemies to fight or rewards together it looks extremely unique and people do seem to like it it is out now in Early Access with 200 very positive
