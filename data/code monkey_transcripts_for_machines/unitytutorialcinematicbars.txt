hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're going to make some cinematic bars to be use during cutscenes let's get started so let's make a very nice simple and clean class cinematic bars on top and bottom we're going to go into our canvas here create a empty game object and name it cinematic bars so here is my game object and expand it to occupy the entire canvas object okay great we're going to create our bars through code rather than adding game objects in here so to make it easier to copy paste the script into any project you want that way you can just drag the script into a new project and you don't have to setup all the game objects in here so we're going to create a new C sharp script and name it cinematic bars now in here on our private voice awake we are going to create both of our bars which will be we're going to store the rect transform for our top bar and our bottom bar so let's create a game object game object new game object let's call it the top bar and we're going to give it the image component which is in using Unity engine that you are then let's go into our game object that transform dot set our parent parent to be this transform and don't keep the world position okay let's grab our image component and set the color to black and let's store our reference game object kit component type right okay now we need to set up our anchors to make sure that our top bar is located on the top of this transform and stretch to the sides so to do that we're going to use the anchormen and Anchor Max values those values are vector to use with normalized position of the lower left and upper right corners so the anchor min is the normalized position of the lower left corner so in this case we're saying that the left corner is on the left side on the top the Anchor Max is the upper right corner which we're saying is on the right side and also on the top this way we can then go into our top bar and modify the size Delta and it will modify the bar starting from the top now copy paste this code to setup our bottom bar now the bottom bar instead of having the min and Max on one on the Y it's going to be a zero since we want to anchor it to the bottom of our screen okay so this code should now create two game objects one for the top bar one for the bottom bar and set the size of 300 which from the top bar will go from top to the middle and the bottom are from about the middle so let's go into our scene drag the script on to our cinematic bars and object and let's see we should be able to see two black bars one on top and one on bottom yep there you have it so as you can see this way it's very easy to copy/paste this script into any new project since we just need to drag our scripted and the script takes care of creating all the elements necessary ok so now let us set up some functions to show and hide our cinematic box so we're going to make a public void show and in order to show the information we need is a float for the target size of our bar so we can have multiple bar sizes and a float for the time to reach that target size so in our class we're going to have a private phone for our target size and we're also going to need a private float for the change size amount which is the amount the size down that won't change per second so in here we're going to first set our target size to the target size and then we're going to calculate the change size amount which won't be the difference between the target size and the top bar dot size Delta the top bar and bottom bar are gonna have the same size so we can just use one in here and divide it by the time we want it to take so it's not the dot one of course then since we have a function to show let's also have a function to hide this one will only take time since the target size is going to be zero so target size equals zero and change size amount it's going to be the same thing okay so let's set up the animation to change the size Delta to this target size so going to go into my private void update and then here I want to modify my size Delta from the bottom bar and the top bar based on the change size amount until it reaches target size so I'm going to have a vector Q for my size Delta which will have the top bar dot size Delta this is what we're going to modify so size Delta dot y was equals to change size amount x time down time and then I'm going to apply that to my cup bar dot size dollar and also my bottom bar dot size don't okay so the basics should now be working let's add some debug buttons to make sure that it is in fact working so I'm going to up here and using the code monkey utilities which is always you can grab for free from unity code monkey calm and I'm going to go into the CM debug class to create a button on the UI I'm going to place it slightly on the right side and the function that it will trigger we don't do a show say 300 and what's it's going to take 300 milliseconds to show that and let's say the text is show and add another button for high and hi okay so we should now have two buttons when we can click to show one to hide and when we click it we're going to set our target size calculate the change size amount based on the target size and the time we want to take and on update we are simply animating it towards our size Delta let's test it okay so here I am I have my two buttons and the bars are at their initial starting point which should actually be zero but we'll fix that later let's see if we can hide and there you go they're hidden and I can show but as you can see it kept going on forever because we did not set the stop okay so let's fix those issues first of all set the starting size Delta to zero and now in here we need to calculate when we have passed our target size so in here if the change size amount if it is positive then we're going to check if our size Delta dot Y if it surpassed our target size if a surpass then set the size Delta dot Y to our target so in order to stop the animation let's go up here and set up a private ball College is active so when we start the animations let's set that ball to true and here when we reach our target we're going to set that to false and we're only going to execute this code if is active is true okay and let's test out when the change size amount is negative so if it goes under our target size you set that to our target size and you stop the animation and then obviously you refresh based on the value that we have in here okay so let's test it out and everything should be working okay here's my scene the bars are not there by default that's great so I'm going to show them there you go took 300 milliseconds to reach the target amount and I'm and there you go I can show I can hide and there you go and there you have it I can hide and show some cinematic bars so when you put this in conjunction with a camera zoomed and a specific cutscene animation you can see how you can create very nice cutscenes as always you can download the project files and utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and only my best answer them okay see you next time
