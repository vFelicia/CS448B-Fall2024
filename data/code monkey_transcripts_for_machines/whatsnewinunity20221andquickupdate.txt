hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and unity 2020.2 has just released this is the latest tech stream release if you're not familiar with how unity versions work check out my quick video on it basically you have tech and lts ideally you should be using the lts version for all of your projects that's what i do so from now on i'm mainly going to be using 21lts however it's always fun to look at the text stream to see what's coming in the future so let's see what features this one has there's a bunch of productivity and performance improvements there's material variants splines and much more also by the way one quick mention you might have noticed fewer videos these past few weeks the reason for that is because i'm hard at work trying to finish my turnbased strategy course it's coming along great i'm really happy with the final game and the quality of the code although it has been a lot more work than i thought which is taking longer than expected and this is actually relevant to the topic on this video for the course i won't be building the game using 22.1 the reason for that is to keep the course up to date for as long as possible so if you're interested in learning how to make a turnbased strategy game and writing some good highquality code then check the link in the description and sign up to be notified when it's out hopefully it's within a few weeks okay so let's see what's new in 22.1 you can download the version from unt hub on the website you can see a huge change log detailing all of the various nodes all of the individuals editions and fixes and so on and there's also a nice page showing some various highlights so let's first go through these highlights and then after that i'm going to do some of my own highlights that i found in this huge changelog starting off one of the main things is several productivity enhancements making it faster to enter play mode there's no mention specifically how much faster but any speed up is always appreciated then asset importing is also faster so in general the editor should be snappier and faster and easier to iterate and work with the package manager also got some nice improvements for example one of them is multiselection so you can select multiple packages and sell them all at once then another nice interesting change is an option to change the location of the cache for both the packages and the assets so if you click on the gear icon and go into preferences then over here you've got the location of both packages and the assets this can be super useful for people who don't have a lot of space on their main drive so just go ahead swap these out for a different drive and you free up tons more space then back to the highlights another big one is visual search queries this is this tool for very easily searching for just about anything in order to open it you can go into edit and then search all or use the shortcut ctrl k and it opens up this window and shows tons of things that you can search for you can search everywhere just in the project files just in this hierarchy you can even search in the menu settings files and so on so for example let's search on the hierarchy for anything with a mesh renderer here it is tons of things then let's say just looking for cars and there you go here's a taxi car and there you go right here on me then you can modify all these so search for any component on the hierarchy project and so on and you can even save searches so you just save a search and then you can find it again anytime you want so this is a really powerful tool for finding just about anything in your project in your assets packages and literally anything then 2d also got tons of upgrades now i haven't used many of these 2d specific tools in quite some time so not sure exactly what change but improvements to sprite shape dpsd importers pride atlas and so on so now in this section lots of tiny things to help you make better games faster then the next big session this one is on editor tools the first one that you can see right here on the screenshot is the spline tool now i made my own spine class in a previous video go watch that if you're interested in seeing how the math behind it works there's also plenty of assets on the acis or to build splines but having a proper fully featured native tool is always great for this one you install it from the package manager just scroll down and find the splines package then your scene you can just right click create a new 3d object go into spline and you've got these options so you can choose a preset shape or something to draw then you can click to place down any shape you can make solid angles or you can click and drag in order to make some really nice curvy splines now this tool and this version actually has an extra tool over here on the side so if you just deselect everything then this is a spline that exists in the world then you click the selected in order to edit it you have to click on this button then over here you can now select each point move it anywhere rotate it do anything you can also select an individual knot then click on this button and here modify all the properties modify how the interactions work and there's also this menu for not placing so you can click on it and now you can click anywhere and place any more then go back to the move tool move it and so on on the package manager you can also download some samples and for example here's one just extruding a certain mesh so kind of like a road then this one shows objects following a spline and so on so that's the spline tool it's really well made i really wish this one was available in 21lts but i guess i'll have to wait a wee year before i start really using this one then the next big editor tool is ui toolkit now this one is meant for both editor and runtime ui it's meant to be just a single tool that you can use to build both editor tools and regular game ui i've actually recently been doing some research on this topic so i'm hoping to do a video on it sometime soon it looks quite complex when you first look at it due to the fact that it uses some style sheets and the whole thing is very different from regular game objects but after you learn the basics it's actually pretty intuitive in version 21 lts the ui tonkit is already available and version 22 it's getting more and more features some more ui widgets treeview multicolumn property drawers and so on since it's the same tool that means if you learn how to use it nowadays you will automatically know how to use it by the time 22lts comes out then they mentioned the material api this looks like some advanced rendering tools so i'm not really familiar with it and up next down here we've got some really interesting ones we have something very simple but very useful which are material variants so these work just like prefab variants you've got a base material and then you can create variants with certain overrides so in the editor we can just create a regular material then just apply it to both these spheres then right click on this material and now we can create a material variant and apply the variant to this one and now we can modify the variance for example let's modify over here the base map color let's say put this one on the green and we can see that one is being overridden from that one now if we add some emission on the base one and if there you go the varian also gets some emission so really a super simple addition but potentially very useful and then some more performance insights so this is an interesting one there's a new frame timing manager to capture some more detailed stats on the gpu and frame view and there's also a visible frame stats profiler on both the editor and play mode you can see it by opening the rendering debugger so going up into window then analysis then over here the rendering debugger and up here you can see all the various frame times the frame rate frame time cpu gpu and so on or alternatively while inside the game you can press control on backspace and shows all those stats directly inside the game now i wasn't familiar with this window but apparently it's been around for quite some time it's gotten lots of interesting stats to help you debug any rendering issues and you can also play around the render modes so for example change the material override to only show the albedo only show the alpha the smoothness and so on you can even manually enable or disable post crossing and you can play around with the wireframe modes that you can see on the scene view you can do it over here on the final game so this is a really interesting option that i wasn't familiar with but apparently it's been around for quite a bit as long as you make a debug build you can open this anywhere so just control backspace and shows and hides and then as usual we have some more platform optimizations it really is easy to take for granted and forget just how awesome it is that unity can make your games run on literally anything he can make games for super high end pcs to tiny low end mobile devices and that really just continues to improve with every new version there's new package to get some more performance data from devices with rm gpus there's a new version of adaptive performance this one is a tool for keeping track of the device thermals in order to adjust quality to meet performance goals and the incremental player build process yet another tool for fastly improving iteration times so you can see just from this page quite a lot of interesting things in this new tech release but these are just some highlights the page with all the release notes is truly massive like this it never ends so let's look at some interesting ones that i found here on the line rendered trail renderer and particle system they added some more texture options so if you move around a trail render over here on the texture mode you've got these new options so you've got static so that pretty much just copy paste the entire texture over and over again and then you also got the texture sale so you can play around with the size of that texture so move it around play around make it quite a bit smaller to stretch it out this works on the trail render the inline renderer and the particle system so you get more options to get exactly what you want then the input system got added support for the ps5 dual sense controllers on mac and windows ice 11 picked up a ps5 so not sure how the controllers feel but i'd be curious to know if the whole rumble thing works with unity then mono enable broadly compression i believe this is the best compression of all so just another nice tiny improvement the undo system also got an enhanced ui so you can explore the undo history so that's over here if you go into edit over here you've got the undo history and shows up this view with all the various and new things then you can click and undo as many as you want then down here for version control got tons and tons of changes as you might know unity recently bought the plastic sem package and apparently they're integrating it more and more into the engine visual scripting also got something called the high performance interpreter this one is certainly an experimental package but the goal is to make visual scripting much more performant so that should be interesting next up the asset pipeline they clarify the behavior of resources download in the scripting api this is actually an interesting one i believe previously this used to say that resource download was not recommended and you should be using the addressables instead but apparently nowadays that they change it they no longer say that and that does make sense because while address balance is indeed great it is also much more complex so for simple things resource download still works perfectly it's something that i use in my builder defender course and every once in a while i would get questions asking about dressables because the official documentation seemed to suggest that was much better but my answer was always the same thing for simple things this one still works great so it's nice to see that the documentation now reflects that then here we do get some numbers for just how much faster it is so importing smaller files is apparently now 65 faster so that's nice then the editor also got some more game object pings in the hierarchy for a bunch more errors like when clicking on console messages so that's nice to be able to figure out which game object fired which log then unity event callbacks can now be reordered i don't use these normally i normally just use regular c sharp events but if you do use them then being able to reorder them sounds really useful and after that kind of funny one here talking about the updated unity logo in anticipation of the brand refresh on october 5th so this was ages ago but that really tells you just how much ahead of time they started working on these versions so right now maybe there's already a team working on version 23.1 working on the alpha then the online renderer and trail render gain support for sprite masks again i haven't used the 2d tools in quite a while but using sprite mask sounds like a really interesting thing the particle systems can now choose whether the gravity modifier applies to 2d or 3d i think this has to do with the fact if you modify the axis for the gravity in 2d i think previously you would only use the 3d one so not sure but it sounds interesting then a general one on scene game view improves performance when selecting many objects improve performance when using tons of gizmos and so on so once again the editor is snappier and faster then burst got support for system.span and the readonly span these are csharp types that have pretty much no garbage so if your game has issues with garbage collection then make sure you try to use these and apparently now they're usable inside of burst the editor also got some pen support i guess this would be super useful if you're an artist constantly working with a pen instead of a mouse share where i've got a sprite option on the main preview so this is the same thing as the quad but on the quad if you click on the preview you can rotate it whereas with the sprite that makes some sense so this now works also add the motion vector render pass to urp motion vectors are used in tons of interesting effects and they also added two new urp specific templates so one of them just with a basic camera in the light and another one which also has a global volume and a basic postprocessing effect so the standard one should be great for just starting impunity and everything already looks quite a bit better then some more changes on burst making things quite a bit faster so 33 times faster and 13 times faster so constantly improving performance on just about anything and there's tons tons more alright so those are a bunch more highlights from this release once again my takeaway from any new unity version is always the same unity is already awesome in the present and looking at the future it just keeps getting better i definitely look forward to playing around with many of these new features when they hit lts by next year although like i've mentioned i'm currently working on my turn based strategy course where i will be using this version in order to keep the course up to date for as long as possible i've been really busy working on for quite some time that's why there have been fewer videos lately it's coming along great i'm really happy with the final game and the quality of the code so if you're interested in learning how to make a game just like that how to build a pretty complex game the right way then check the link in the description and sign up i'm really hoping to get it done by sometime the end this month alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
