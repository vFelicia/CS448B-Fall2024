foreign foreign foreign thank you all right hey everyone how's it going all right thanks for being here let me know if everything is correct it's been quite a while since I lasted on live stream so hopefully in terms of tech everything is working correctly all right all right so hey everyone hey thanks for being here on this random Friday all right hope you're having a nice day okay so basically I got a bit of work that I wanted to do so I figured I might as well do it on a live stream so let's do this I'm basically going to try to do a weapon attachment system uh let me just hide the background all right so basically got a weapon and I want to modify the attachment so modify the stock the barrel the scope and so on so should be a fun system okay so let me just look at my todo list everything seems fine and okay all right so I'm going to be film this out and feel free to ask any questions and I'll try them keep answering keep looking at chat and doing everything okay right so for the first task that I want I really want to just handle rotating the weapon so that should be a fun and easy one so let's start trying to make this a weapon attachment system start off by making a basic script s folder and inside let's do it same name and attach it all right stream quality is only 480 not 1080. is it is it for everyone because at least on my end it should be looking on the stream Health it says that it's healthy so okay so maybe there's a maybe just takes a while all right okay all right let's do this and yep all right I'm glad that it's looking good okay so first of all let me just make a void update and on update let me test input get mouse button uh no just Mouse button basically first of all I just want to rotate the weapon so let's see about local Singletons using SOS you mean like the the Ryan hippo script on object Tonk I think that one is interesting and definitely very very good when it comes to making a designer friendly workflow but personally for me I prefer using Code so for me I don't really use it but yeah if you do definitely go ahead and for those of you who don't know let me just put up the link it's actually a really great uh uh it was Ryan hippo I think that was his name let's pick the ball objects that was it the script ball object game architecture so if you don't know about it definitely go watch a tonk really great definitely a very interesting use case for more objects and how to design your games and on those kinds of things yeah this is going to be at least I think I put on the settings uh yeah it doesn't have DVR so yep this won't be record for afterwards all right okay so up here um trying to remember how do I get the the mouse position or the most danta I think that was it yeah I think that was it so private factor is this a two or three Z3 for the last Mile's position and Vector 340 miles donta take the last Mouse position minus down let's just do a debug download just see what this says just a tub the input system is easier yeah probably I mean for me when I when I make some quick prototypes I only start with the with the Legacy input system just because I'm so used to it so just so automatic but yeah definitely that one is quite a bit all right I'm not updating are you from Portugal yep yes I am uh right so over here I need to update so the unless Mouse position equals input dot Mass position all right spider on your back wow that's scary let's hope not uh right so as I move yep okay that is working moving on the X and on the set all right great so let me grab the weapon so is there always film transform for the weapon transform so starting this one and basically I want to modify the Euler angles and I need to think how do I modify it let me go back over here so on the weapon where do I got this weapon so for rotating do I want yeah probably want the local but yeah so I want to rotate so that's on the Y and then a little bit on the X all right okay so uh so for the so for the x is going to be the most Delta dot Y and most down to dot X and then zero so something like this but obviously but uh rotate speed let's put it something really small otherwise it's going to be pretty massive so let's see it's not the interior another planet what thoughts about the ntai I think they I think it is really interesting the things that I saw behind closed doors at GDC they don't look very very interesting they're definitely going about it the right way I would say so I'm definitely very excited to see how that comes the most important thing is really how they're focusing on on owning their entire data set so that way as a game developer you don't have to be worried about being um you don't have to worry about being sued over anything because of because they don't own the the underlying data set or something so the fact they're focusing on that is actually super useful so I do think that is going to be quite nice uh oh did I make the welcome or angles but why is it did I not do because it is rotating in a strange way okay that's on just focus on the on the Y first all right make a video on full body FPS controller I would encourage you to to use the the uh what's it called the start assets I would definitely advise you to use those I mean there's no point in reinvent the wheel or at least open those and see how they've implemented for example on the third person shooter controller for that one I pretty much refactor that third person controller in order to make my own and yeah so I would say definitely do that instead of trying to build it on your own that is probably the best way oh is this not okay that's on why is it oh right so I actually need to update it afterwards yeah right I'm not updating every framing I thought that was strange yeah there you go so yeah thank you God might yep that was exactly it was not updating on every frame so like this yep now it does rotate exactly isn't done uh all right okay good so basically just something like this obviously cannot go way into that one so let me just the background the other one is going to rotate a little bit but let's see over here so I need to push it a bit more like this and just make it a a bit bigger just so that the background isn't visible all right so let's just copy this transform copy the component and paste it like this okay great all right so with that yep there you go I can rotate it like that let me also apply the other one so over here the mouse Delta dot y except for that one I really want to limit it but let's see how much do I clamp it as far as it's an out of issue with the UI I click can click on anything what do you mean click on anything with a first person controller you're not supposed to be clicking on anything so I'm not sure what you're trying to do basically in first person shouldn't be oh hey and you remember hey thank you ladies thank you that's nice I forgot that this every time I do a live stream I forget that these problems exist um yeah so basically if you're using an FPS controller then you have at some point you have to unlock the mouse if you actually want to click some buttons so you have to go into cursor and you have to set the lock State and by default you're probably going to have it as locked which means you can't see the cursor so you can't click on anything so you need to revert this one back into none so that you can actually see the cursor in order to be able to click on menus so that's pretty much the only thing you should need to do as long as the cursor is unlocked it should be able to click on any buttons so yeah I would assume that's the only issue uh right okay so this one is good except I don't want the weapon to rotate way too much just a little bit so let's see what kind of rotation is this uh let me get into the weapon I'll write this oh it's when I click on elsewhere okay sure yeah that works okay so I only want to go minus 15 to plus eight yeah minus 10 to 0.8 so I don't want to go way too much so math dot twimp dot clamp going for the float rotation y Min uh what did I say minus seven minus seven X rotation y Max let's say on plus 10 so clamp the mouse down to y between the rotation y Min and the rotation y Max so that's going to be the point for the rotation y EP and then I apply the rotation line actually it's rotation X I don't know why I was calling it y uh yep so over here let me put this one always rename your variables if something changes definitely always remember to do that okay all right hey super Channel thank you thanks for featuring minus near 10 free assets oh that's awesome which one did you make nice all right I always go through it and always pick some interesting Essence and there's usually a lot of competition so if you made something and I sound like that means it was pretty good so all right congrats nice uh okay so this one it's a bit did I do LARP instead of no I did clamp oh right never mind yeah I'm doing it wrong I need to clamp the maximum not the thing that you actually modify so yeah it's actually I'm not going to go like this no actually take this I take the Oiler angles.x and I put it down and then do a new Vector three with this one then the weapon transform local dot y weapon transform local dot Z okay so basically on that one by the mouse down to dot why and okay I think that should be it all right how did you learn ninty by yourself making things on your own or from some YouTube channels well when I started learning that was in 2012 so back then there really weren't any uh YouTube channels so yeah I had to learn by myself pretty much that was it was tricky yeah lots of trial and error trying to search things look for csharp tutorials things on sack overflow and all those kinds of things so yeah it was definitely much stricter than it is nowadays nowadays you can just look at tons and tons of tutorials and you won't find tons of stuff but yeah back then I had to do it pretty much the hard way lots of trial and error reading documentation and so on so yeah definitely tricky definitely things are much easier nowadays okay why was this one not going at is this one is it the issue yeah I'm guessing this is going to be the issue with the yeah the alerts yeah they are they are manual So yeah thank you so much for the Super Chat and thank you so much new channel member that's nice uh right so basically my issue right now thinking of making a horror game but don't know how to model well that's where assets come in which is the same thing for me I also don't know how to model so the way I do it is I use lots and lots of assets thanks only nowadays using us this yeah that's going to be the tricky thing ah crap I hate this uh damn it uh yeah so nowadays I would definitely encourage you to use some assets actually that's part of the reason why why I'm doing this is because the the Cindy store they've got a sale and basically the pack that I'm using here for the weapon attachment system is the one that is going to be on yep it's this one the military pack which is going to be 70 off next Monday so thanks did I call it Cindy store second link I don't remember uh nope dot Co Yeah so basically yeah that's why I'm doing this in order to use some assets because yeah I also don't know how to model so for me yeah I need to use some Assets in order to be able to do some interesting things but thankfully nowadays you can find assets and all kinds of things so yeah definitely buy it and use it to turn your vision into reality okay so the issue over here is that as I go up as usual always problems with oil or angles so it goes up and it snaps all the way down so how do I do this well I need to basically uh increase it by 316 Maybe that works so if I go 316f minus n360f what's that with this it should be like that I hope except no except that one is going to be ah crap actually going to be quite annoying how do you keep focused to finish a game basically you focus on using a nice todo list so you always work from a plan so you define a plan to find the kinds of things that you want to do and you just do it day by day little by little every day that's pretty much it there's no secret answer you just have to try doing things do a tiny bit every single day and yeah just keep at it day over day that's the best thing that I can say is that the most important thing is really consistency so it doesn't matter if you work nonstop 12 hours a day that doesn't really matter what matters is working a tiny bit every single day for months on end that's pretty much it yep your game is the sum of 1 000 small success that is definitely a uh okay so this oh crap I always hate working with rotations and things always the issue uh okay so how do I fix this um okay let me think s uh local Oiler angles X equals this guy so I guess they can do if this one is bigger than is going to be 180. yeah I guess if it is bigger than 180 then I can do minus equals 360. and with that like this it should hopefully be working so now I no longer need this I don't think so basically if that one goes above 180 so if it goes in like 359 then it's going to subtract so it's going to go into negatives so hopefully this should work let's see well that's Chet CPT to get some rock out yeah actually that could possibly work but yep there you go finally figured it out so it's always the issues with going by 360 then it snaps back into zero and so on that is always super tricky but yeah thanks only does work so I can rotate One Direction another one only the axis is a bit on so I need to yeah rotate it on different but yep there you go that's exactly what I wanted so I want to be able to rotate the weapon maybe rotate it a little bit rotate a tiny bit up and down and just like that okay great let me just increase the rotation speed by a tiny bit just like this all right reassuring to see that even highly experience that I've done just code everything perfectly the first time yep that's exactly it I mean remember that when you see one of my videos what you see in the final video is the final thing after all the trial and error so yeah before I record the video I definitely go through this process I get a ton of issues in order to figure out what works and what doesn't so yeah just because you see the final video and everything goes well does not mean that I absolutely did it the first time no uh right okay so this part is working so that was just the basics just trying to make it rotate so that's fun okay so now let's actually do the proper attachment system so let me just see my notes because I was thinking about the design so basically I want some clickable buttons and I want them to be World buttons so that I can then I guess the thing is do I touch them inside or not that's a good question uh yeah I guess I could put them inside maybe try doing that so let's put inside put a canvas make it workspace maybe something like this so I'm going to have canvas and inside I'm going to have a UI button okay so let's put it really tiny and I'm going to want it to rotate to face the camera uh 0.5.1 you know that is way too big just get rid of the Sprite okay so basically I want a button that is going to be facing towards the camera so this is going to be the button for uh what am I going to count uh this is going to be for the barrel button okay something like this let's put it just a tiny bit okay and inside for the text let's say Baron put it in bold really tiny disable that and that where's the decks is it on the other side nope why did the font vanish that's all did I not importing text mesh Pro thing okay that's on so why the text mesh Pro not import the essentials that's range okay apparently oh never mind the window just showed up on my other screen that's why I didn't see it okay yeah that helps all right okay so let me select the font assets one of these two oh boy got some errors on the thing we create the game with JavaScript I mean this is Unity but yeah I guess in the past I have made some games using JavaScript that was uh actually I was trying mostly it was with PHP back when I wanted to make a a online game kind of like dark galaxy I really enjoyed playing that one that was really fun really interesting so so yeah I've definitely tried that record mug it sounds different well that's probably because I'm in I'm doing live streams so I'm not my voice is definitely different why is this guy not showing did I yeah bro yeah it messed up the Sprite asset okay so let me try doing oh crap I can't click under the people so let me just get read make new button Barrel button yeah the issue with the text mesh girl not showing up all right why have you been a Game Dev I've been using Unity since 2012. and I've been programming since I was about 10 so definitely been doing this for quite a long time uh right let me just grab the button actually ah crap sorry I can't read the messages right now I'm trying to yeah because the yeah because I should not rotate this guy I know instead just rotate the barrel thing and just need to make it a lot smaller than this and on the barrel button okay make it quite a bit more like this point two something like this all right okay finally ah crap I offset it no put it down there this one okay all right so that was quite a bit tricky actually because of the thing all right okay hey thank you for the Super Chat tunneler I was wondering if you have are planning to make an updated yinty analytics video yeah yeah there is a I did Cover analytics and there's a lecture there but yeah that lecture was quite a while ago and in the past few months they completely refactored it so yeah I definitely need to do that one right now because I haven't yet looked into how the new analytics Works what exactly changed I assume quite a lot of things change so yeah I'll definitely so yeah that's definitely part of the plan just don't know when I'll be able to do it that's always the it's always a tricky thing especially with that course which is should I spend my limited time on updating own lectures or covering new tools that is always the tricky question that always have trouble answering so yeah definitely part of the plan since that one is pretty much outdated so yeah that lecture hopefully soon I'll be able to update at least just down uh okay so look at the camera let me just make this one super simple one late update and over here let's see the trends form dot forward and I never remember if it's before it or not forward camera dot main transform.4 I'm pretty sure it's reversed I'm pretty sure that's how it's supposed to be okay it's gonna be an escape from tarkov yeah pretty much that is the one that I used as reference in order to figure out which one I should do so yep that's definitely the kind of thing that I'm going for all right did the kitchen chaos course and want to know if I can turn it into a coop game yes when the the second part of that game second part of that course is on taking that game and converting into multiplayer so yes if you haven't done it yet definitely go ahead and follow the the free multiplier section so follow that one and if you can make it into a coop game all right okay so basically yep it is working except apparently I did want the opposite so now reverse but just facing like that and this one also needs to be quite a bit smaller so let's put it maybe on point 3.1 we're going to have to modify all of this okay Barrel quite a bit tiny that's the issue with these it's kind of hard to crawl in order to be able to find but anyways sure okay so that works all right okay so thanks so much summer for the Super Chat yeah thank you all right so basically I got my canvas and I want and I want to be able to click on this button so let me go into the definitely going to need to refactor quite a lot of this I gotta say that writing code once on live stream it's quite a bit trickier my brain definitely works much much slower it's definitely much trickier to do things so yeah doing it on the live stream complicates things can I use your Utilities in the game I want to sound same yep feel free to use the utilities in your own games free or commercial yep go ahead I hope they help you in your game okay so the barrel button let me just actually I just want to test if I can actually click on the button yes or no so on the barrel button on click add in listener and over you just debug.log in order to bear on them all right how do you handle dealing with encountering games that are similar to the one you are working on uh the answer is don't worry about it pretty much I mean you can have two people that come up with the exact same uh design and even if you do two people that come up with the same design over the building of the game The Funnel games will be completely different so yeah I would say definitely don't worry about it unless you're actively trying to make a clone it it won't come out exactly the same thing so definitely don't worry about that if someone has a similar idea go ahead make your own whatever you do it is going to end up being quite different so yeah don't worry about that all right okay so the button does work I can select the barrel yeah that's one all right okay so let me uh okay so I got the basics I can rotate I can do a thing and now the main thing that I want is the parts okay so let's start by making the weapon part so can you see Sharp script weapon part so let's go inside and this one is going to be a script mode object with a create asset menu and okay so for this one let me see what do I need for it right I'm going to need a poem for the part type this is where I'm going to uh the final things okay so let's see I'm going to have a barrel then a barrel end then an under Barrel a stock a grip and a magazine something like that okay and for the parts I'm going to make it a problem with part type and the part type and then I guess if only transformed for the prefab that I'm going to instantiate okay I used to like the White theme because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it if I put this on dark mode I couldn't stare it for more than three seconds so sorry but yep for me it has to be like that objects okay and inside let's make a weapon part so let's make it a barrel and actually let's start with the grip because that one is probably going to be easier so start with the grip and let's see all the parts that I got so we're here seeing all the assets You Can't customize the snow let's go oh yeah yeah I forgot about it but yeah definitely going to be able to customize the scope as well yep uh okay so for the grip that one should be the easiest one so this one has three separate grips okay so let's start by doing that what are the names grip one two three that's it yep okay so on this one let's call this script one grip two and grip three okay now the tricky thing about this kind of system is going to be how do I position them yeah because basically so the way these assets are set up so the body is like that but I actually want the body to be a bit more offset because right now the rotation is a bit strange so let me grab all of these and try to move them just a little bit just because yeah the body's supposed to be kind of like that okay good let me actually move it kind of like this all right uh okay so for the body nice and missions to show the chat messages yeah nice if you want to know I actually covered it on the oh God I always forget the yeah I actually didn't notice the message down here because there is you can customize your character on your live stream except I don't remember the oh God I always forget this one so customize live stream character yeah I don't think that's it I'm not gonna remember oh crap it shows up down here the link to customize it I always forget this this is always a thing that I forget but yeah basically you can customize your character and in there it also showcased all the all the things that you oh crap why can't I remember it I always forget that one I always forget what it's called uh nope damn it so I can figure out okay So eventually it's going to pop up the message down here so when it does let's see uh anyways Okay so I want to modify start off by modifying that one so uh okay yeah basically I'm trying to think of how am I going to policy points so this is going to be what am I calling it the grip so these are going to be the attach points so let's put inside attach points put down on zero and then put the grip is the grip on the position yep and basically essentially where's the grip let me grab a grip this one is the mod a mod a grab a grip put it in there yeah I think that's supposed to be the position and just get rid of the grip on this one and yep that does work okay right so on these Ripple objects let me assign the prefabs and actually for the prefabs I'm going to one no I can use like this one right now okay so let's put grip one then the grip two and finally the grip three oh grip three all right okay so for the weapon itself let me link up on the weapon attachment system let me put another transform for this one is going to be the grip attach point great Eternal thanks oh that's awesome I'm quite the videos have helped you okay so for the grip touch points okay and the way that I'm going to oh yeah player customization tutorial yeah I think that's is that the link does it work nope it's something like that but yeah I can't remember exactly what it is or maybe nope nope or yes all right it is all right yeah thank you for your home who was it weird sweaty yeah thanks for the help yeah it's uh yeah that is the one I always forget that that link I really need to add some clickable link somewhere so anyways yeah you can customize your character and yeah at the bottom down here if you want to know how I made this yeah basically this is a transparent TNT window then for the characters they are controlled using some mesh based animations and the way that this is interacting with the YouTube API is through an HTTP request from inside unity and if you want to see more on how I color the colored all of these random uh characters those are pretty much the same code that I used in my game battle round Tycoon so you can see you can watch all these tutorials and figure out how all this works and maybe make your own if you also do some live streams or want to do something fun yeah this should help okay right uh okay so over here how do I just think you have a private a dictionary a dictionary of weaponpart as so dot part type and then the transform so for the weapon part type transform dictionary okay do a new one and up here let's see a red void set parts and what part am I going to put so not part time so the part type and wait do I do part type or no yeah because the thing already has the parts so if I just put a weapon for this so if I just do this one then I can go into the dictionary on this weapon part so that part type and basically I'm going to instantiate so transform for the part transform and I'm going to instantiate go into the weapon part instantiate the prefab okay all right so the weapon part type is this one but I also need to do some cleanup so if this one dot contains this key if it does already contain ducky then I need to destroy that one so I need to destroy this one dot game object okay so I destroyed that one I spawn the new one I put it and then I just need to actually position it so over here let's make a struct what am I going to call it part type attach point and I'm going to power the public weapon part so that part type for the part type and then a public transform for the attach Point transform and I gotta make this a serializer bone in order to show up and up here make a serialized field what's your own serialized film of parttime attach Point Let's see analyst of this one cell part type attach Point list okay so this way I can have the list and then over there I can or not for each uh first of all let me just fill out the array okay all right hello from Sweden hey nice what time is it in Sweden what is it like what is one plus two so it should be around what 2PM over there so that's nice uh okay so we're here for the part attach Point let me add one and I'm going to put it for the grip and for the group attached point it is this one right here okay that's a good question do I put it as a child or not I'm not sure 12 47 oh so it's really just one hour really huh I thought it was a bit more since Sweden is quite a bit more to write where I'm in yes 18 okay interesting all right so uh let me also make yeah a dictionary of the trying to think uh weapon tart attach Point transform dictionary and over here let me make a new one and then do a four each a four each on this guy right here for the part type attach point and the part type attached pointless then I go into this guy and I access it on the parttime touchpoint.part type and I put it equals to the parttime attach Point dot the transform okay so that way I assign the transform and then down here I can do a transform for the attach Point transform and on this one basically I can grab the transform for the part type and the part type is going to be this webinesso.par type so with that one I have that one and over here dot parent I can put it as a channel that down and then put that local or angles equals Vector 3.0 and same thing for the oil composition also Vector 3.0 all right brings from peterborg all right nice uh okay so for testing let me make a simple weapon part so weapon part so and let's go one and two just for testing so I get two of them and then over here on update lets you so if input get key down and let's go with the T king so I'm taking step apart and going the weapon part so one and on the Y let's go with set part SO2 all right so let's see that how can I learn to code in a good way well watch tutorials and more importantly actually do the things that's pretty much it don't just blindly copy paste code actually try to try to follow things try to do things so I want you to turn on then try to make it on your own modify the code see what changes and yeah that's pretty much it there's really no secret for how do you learn how to code how do you learn how to make games it really is you just try to do it and then keep on doing it okay I think I forgot one thing did I yeah I did sort of forget one I just forgot to uh where's the what am I clicking on oh is that one spawning two of them yeah because there's the default one over the Oh okay that's unintentional why did that one huh because whenever I click outside and then click back it sometimes does something oh look at that wow that's on huh it kind of like why there's reverse why did that one go into 180 all right that's strange yeah it only basically this is one of those weird bugs that only happens in the editor basically if this was a build actually if it was a building it would still possibly work because you could always click away but yeah basically the issue is with the delta so if I click outside and then click there that's funny all right that's not supposed to happen but sure uh actually I can sort of fix that can by making the I could clamp the mouse don't they except which one is I don't know anyways I'll I'll fix that later right now I really want to make sure that this part at least is working and yep it is working so I can swap out I can click a button and yep it does sup up down let's just make the third one just for fun so I got that one right now just based on key input but yep that's about it so the one thing that I do need is to get rid of the one that is on here right away so this one just disabled it so right now there's no grip then I click I said I don't like Co routines you use async methods and test instead no but that is also a valid option for me usually I just use basic uh flow timers so just count on the time I've got a class that is super useful in my utilities that I use it all the time and I made a video about it a long time ago so the function timer Yeah so basically this is the whenever I want to do some time based logic I just use a basic fold timer but yep if you do like using async and a weight then you have definitely go ahead and do that because that is pretty easy but application is focus work to fix that uh not really because the issue isn't that it loses Focus the issue is that it keeps track of the last uh the last position so over here the last Mouse position so this one grabs the input that Mouse position and when it loses Focus this one stops updating I don't know I think this one returns zero So based on the issues go go out of focus and you go back into focus and the input Mouse position difference between that one and the last one is going to be huge and for some reason that is causing that one to flip 180 so that's a bit strange so yeah basically the solution would be just make sure to limit the mouse Delta just limit it to a certain amount and that way it wouldn't cause issues on moving normally and when snapping from a huge distance it would clamp so it wouldn't cause problems so basically that would be the fix but yeah right now I really want to just make sure this part is working and obviously I forgot one thing but yep so on the weapon system you gotta put the grip three yep all right so the basics is kind of working there you go look at that all of them swapping nice can I use 22 or wait for LTS yep I would say definitely use 22 nowadays it's the version that I'm always using so yep the LTS should be coming out where are we we're at the end of April right yeah usually the LTS version comes around apron so yeah I guess the LTS version should be right around the corner pretty much uh okay so instead of being on things let's put it based on a button so on this one that's kind of tricky thing I'm going to have to make could I use just one canvas that's a good question I actually don't know would that work because multiple canvas is going to be make it quite a bit tricky so for this one let's call the grip button and instead of putting the look at let me see because I actually don't know if this is going to work or not let's try putting a look at camera on these two instead of on the canvas and that way I can have just one canvas let's see if it works I have like that actually does work all right nice so that's exactly what I want okay so on this one down here it is not the barrel but we're at the grip and when I click on it I want to modify it so up here let me grab the button I'm probably going to eventually refactor this code separate the UI from the actual weapon logic but yep you are the champ you got me into Game Dev let's start off with program now working on Local web dev as a frontend view.js all right awesome hey that's really awesome it's really great how programming is really such a global thing so yeah you can start from one area and end up in something completely different so yeah that's awesome yeah I hope you're enjoying your job that's a great story nice yeah JavaScript is one of those things that I if I had the time I would love to be able to explore it I pretty much just know the basics I know there are so many tons and tons of JavaScript Frameworks and yeah I will definitely that is one area that I would love to research if I can find time but yeah I can wear ads on getting into programming getting a job that's really awesome nice all right okay so I've got the brick button and okay let me just make this one so grip button on click at The Listener and for this one let me make a function so probably change grip and on this one up here let's go put that one on the change the grip okay so on this one I want to modify the grip and how do I oh that's actually yeah I'm gonna need hmm yeah actually a different uh dictionary stone is the attach point that one is the spawn thing hmm I'm trying to think do I make different structs or do I put them all on the same one it's actually a good question I'm actually not entirely sure all right let's put it here and then if needed I can just refactor it okay so the spawn transform and inside I'm also going to have the weapon part to so weapon part is so okay so those are supposed to start off as empty and on this dictionary I'm actually going to make it a dictionary of the attach point but then actually hmm not yet because I got the attach point and I got the things okay so let me just refactor this because yeah I think that I probably only needs that one right so instead of getting that one put down on this guy right here okay and then get rid of this second dictionary and now down here I go into this guy if this guy contains that part and this guy oh crap and this one dot the spawn transform is not known if it is not known then that's what I want to destroy I want to destroy the spawn transform okay and then you go into the part transform you spawn a brand new one all right then you go inside this dictionary on that one and on the spawn transform you put it as down can I modify the return value oh crap I only saved this it's always annoying uh so what do you call this thing or type attach Point whatever touch Point equals this guy right here and then the part type attach Point that's one transform equals down I guess you should probably make that one a class instead of a struct that would probably solve this problem anyways fine and the attachment point transform it is going to be this one dot the attach Point transform I put down on that one and then I just need to make sure to update this one yeah I think I should probably just make that one a class so that I don't need to worry about copies and so on but anyways okay so it isn't like this now I've got a structure that has all the data that I want so with this basic refactor hopefully everything should still be working the same so let's see after a night shift Shawarma IPA programming stream oh that's nice that's a very busy day huh uh right for example it's not yeah I forgot to assign the grip button that's not the one that's the one the grip button all right okay just wondering why did you choose struct over class just because usually when it's for groups of data that are only supposed to hold down for that one usually I just go with uh for that usually I go with struck just because just honestly they're usually in most cases there's there's no reason you can use another one so yeah it's really just habit whenever I just want to start some data I just tend to go without anyway so this is now working so that's fun and I just need to put on this one so I spawn it I position it and then on this one for the weapon partner so equals this one so this way I know what weapon is attached to that one okay so now when I change the grip uh I guess things I'm going to need an Esso for all of the enlists hello there hey both of you nice thanks for being here what's your real name my real name is Hugo how you doing yeah I'm doing great yeah thank you all for being here on this random live stream on this random Friday morning thanks for being here uh okay I'll make a weapon part list as so and for this one I'm going to want to make a scriptable object with a create asset menu and now inside of it I'm going to want to on the enlist the weapon parts so weapon part SL list and then basically I want a public list of weapon part so yeah this one could probably be yeah it could be fixed but I think making it Dynamic makes a bit more sense so get weapon part as soon list and I'm going to take a printer of type part type like this so list of weapon parts so weapon part so list actually instead of giving it the same name because everything can be a bit confusing so return weapon part as some list and eventually I'm going to return this one and I'm going to do a for each on weapon part so weapon part is so in the weapon partisan list and if this weapon part is so not part type if it matches the one that I'm looking for then on the return weapon partisan list let's add this one and return it okay so this way I've got a nice function to return it which is going to describing objects and let me make the weapon part so list or list this so I guess so on this one and let's select this one and add the three grips okay great so now if I go on to the other one ever facing lots of data when using public properties within scriptable objects uh no but then I never use property so maybe that's why really do you lose that that's a bit interesting yeah with assembly definitions okay yeah I don't know because for me when it comes to scribble objects I'll use them as readonly uh data containers so for me I always make them as public variables yeah over here I never use any any property so I never had that issue that is definitely very strange can I recommend the fix for a third person shooter animation rigging close to one problem well the solution is use a separate camera so kind of like how I did on the on the recent on the drag racing mini game versus why is this so smart uh no problem I'm gonna have to yeah ah crap so over here how I made the there's a camera for the actual game scene and then there's a separate camera for the UI so in order to prevent a shooter I'm actually only now I know you said third person shooter yeah basically I was talking about in first person so in first person you use a camera just to run the weapon and the camera to run the thing in front and then you just stack the weapon and that way the weapon will never clip through the geometry in third person shooter yeah for that one you were only just uh do a raycast in order to find the distance to the wall and if the wall is way too close and you basically just use another animation where the character kind of lifts up the weapon that's pretty much it so for that one it would just be based on animation rather than anything more complex okay right so what was I doing I was trying to modify that one so let me go into the weapon attachment system and when I click on that one let me just grab a reference to the weapon what did I call it the weapon partner SSO so the weapon part is so and on this one basically when I click in order to modify the grip so first I need to know what grip am I using so for that let's go into this one on that part type can I assume that this one actually exists yeah I think I can make that assumption because this transform dictionary yeah I'm always going to need to add the attach point so I can actually make the assumption that this one exists so I don't need to constantly be checking for that one uh okay so the part type weapon part is so part type dot in this case that's the grip so I'm going to grab so that's the attach point and then yeah and then from this one I'm going to basically yeah check the weapon part of so so if this one is known that means there's none so if so then I'm going to set parts and I'm going to go into the weapon partly so in order to get the weapon partisan list and I'm going to pass in a grip so I'm going to grab the list of groups and from this one I'm going to grab the very first grip so if there's no weapon then it's going to set down and if there is one then in next index so I'm going to first need to get the part index so for the part index I'm going to have to get this guy right here so it's going to be a list of weapon parts so weapon part that's a list so I grabbed that one and list of weapon parts from that one and then I do a index of and try to find the weapon that is currently on there so that is the important index so for the next part index that one take the part index plus one view a remainder of the weapon part list no not this one weapon part as soon as yeah I gotta be careful not to mix them both and do down like that and the next part index so I basically go into this one and exit on the next index okay I think that should do it this one is clicking so like nuts all right let's see uh what am I doing what's your opinion on test driven development I don't necessarily do test driven in the sense that I don't normally write tests but yep I definitely do find it I find the logic of focusing on it worrying about it I find that to be actually very oh this one is not uh I find it to be very useful to actually think about it so once personally I don't really usually uh write tests for my games I definitely do make sure that any code that I write I try to make it so that it would be possible to test it so I don't necessarily fully follow this driven development but yeah making sure that your code could be testable just having that in the back of your mind that will definitely help you make quite a lot better code all right look at that I can modify the grip that's cool okay nice so the barrel that one's actually going to be the trickiest one so I don't know why I started on that one uh but yeah all right so I can modify the grip so let's just add the buttons for the other ones and actually yeah just with that most of the system I don't already be working nice python Dove when I started Game Dev on your channel you don't like the brackets of my Game Dev Journey that's nice all right I'm glad my videos have come to you that's awesome that's really cool uh what am I doing okay so I need so I got the grip button let me add one What's called the stock button and the scope is actually going to be quite tricky so the scope button like this the stream of M1 to watch afterwards yep it won't be recording so yep afterwards it won't be available and of course what I'm doing here I'm basically making the system for a video so the phone uh tutorial or Showcase Video won't be coming out on Monday I hope Monday or Tuesday something like that so yep the the uh the live stream will be available and the phone video will also be available okay so modify the stock and then modify the scope okay that one is a bit too high looked it just a bit all right good uh okay so let's try adding all those parts and right now I know we need this testing code so I can get rid of this okay all right so that's good uh yeah set part and change change work I should do it change part instead but okay all right looks for the multiplier terminal is that how I find you oh nice that's awesome yeah multiplayer was a lot of fun searching for it so yeah that's that was it was really fun researching that because I hadn't done multiplayer in many many years so yeah that was great I'm glad you enjoyed that thank you uh okay let me go up here actually I don't need to modify anything here so in order to modify that one I just need one first of all I need the buttons so the stock and the scope buttons I need those actually that's a good question hmm once again the same question do I put them all together yes or no anyways for now let's make separate buttons and maybe I'll add it over here onto my thing but for now let's just make different buttons and then see what else happens okay so I got the stock button and I got the scope button and actually I'm going to modify that script but for now all right I just need to attach those so let me go into this guy on the part the touch Point let's put array size of three so I got the grip then I'm going to have the stock and I'm going to have the scope and for the attach points this is actually where it's going to be tricky so let me start from this one go inside this one make an empty game object name it the stock then drag it out and this way it has the exact same position okay let me put it inside the attached points and yep so that's the stock so I can actually take the stock and drag it inside there and disable it alright so that's the sound position uh the other one that I want is the scope naturally the Scopes are a little bit tricky where let's go there it is I don't know actually it's good I thought the Scopes would be with the pivot a bit different but no uh so let's go inside this is the scope attached point so let's go down here to the attach Point split the scope and drag the scope on there and disable it okay great as I'm adding more and more things this weapon is becoming more and more naked so that's funny anyways um yeah so I got the attached points so let's go into this one how do you make systems that work together well in unity I mean the answer is it depends on the quality of your code if your code is good well written nice and clean code then putting together system is actually super easy but if you write super dirty code you know just like I used to do 10 years ago yeah then Things become quite a bit more difficult so the answer to that is focus on writing good clean code and the better the code quality the easier it is to put together lots and lots of systems okay so I got the grip and now let me make a stock and actually I don't know how many stocks this includes so let me uh what do I want can I actually uh no I can't I thought I could do something but turns out I can't and tips on running cleaner code well I would say go watch my my complete course the going with this one was to focus on writing good clean code so if you go through there if you pay attention to all that by the end you won't have learned quite a lot so yeah learn a lot with your free course then you are that's awesome I'm glad it helped that was a ton of work but I'm really happy that the response to it has been so positive so nice thank you uh okay so let me get into the stock I need to pick up this guy can't I actually uh because dragging this is actually quite tricky so let me grab a different one okay so down here for the stock ah crap this one oh boy where was I where was I weapon a this one for the they're all these stocks can I unlock this one does that work oh it does work nice at least I think it works uh okay so where's the stock so let me grab just a handful of them so just stop one and two and then three just seven enough just to test it out so these top two and the stock three okay then I'm going to need a scope scope one so for this one let's call it a scope and let me find where's the scope and the scope is all the way over here so let's unlock and relock or is that it that is it lock it go down find the scope and let me grab which one is that one that one is a scope too okay let's go one two and three so let me grab don't scope two and that one is go three all right great so then on this one let me unlock it and just write the stocks and the Scopes drag them on there okay good so actually with this pretty much all of the codes should already be working just over here let me just refactor this so instead of making a function for each of them so change part and I'm going to receive a weapon part so that part type for the part type then I'm going to basically replace all of these references so down down and down okay so up here when I click on this one this one I want to modify the grip so let's go down the grip and on these other ones so on this one I'm going to modify the stock and on this one modify the scope okay and just like this I think everything should already be working so that one already has the attachments on the thing so let's see right and got an error what is the error uh did I not drag the buttons I didn't let me unlock this and there's the buttons okay so I need to add the stock button and the scope button okay ever considered making Unreal Engine 5 content uh in an Ideal World sure but in the reality where I have limited free time yeah that one is basically I mean it takes a lot of a lot of time to become an expert at something so in order for me to be able to teach unreal 5 I would need to spend a lot of time actually learning it so yeah I'd love to to learn it just for fun but yeah I'm learning it to the point where I can actually teach yeah that is probably not going to happen since someone takes so much time and effort so yeah for learning ue5 probably better to look elsewhere and look at that it does work except for some reason one of the stocks is a magazine why I don't know apparently I tried the wrong reference that's a stock that's a stock yeah that's a MAG I have no idea why did I drag a MAG I don't know but yeah the stock03 all right but yeah look at that it is working out bucket of games Thank you not much [ __ ] yeah that's awesome I mean thank you for the Super Chat thank you for being here watching the videos thank you for everything so yeah nice thank you okay and look at that so grips I can modify grip I can modify the scope and I can modify the stock and why is that one off this is kind of the the issue because I'm going to have to huh because the ah crap the same bug again all right I've only got to fix that bug yeah because every time I go it messes up but uh yeah so for this one mod Stock A yeah it is ah crap uh the weapon becoming um yeah but why is this one offset because some of the other ones they're all pretty good you know if I go inside this one yep the pivot is in there the pivot is in there and for this one for some reason the pivot is different and for this one it's also different yeah basically but that is easy to solve basically I'm going to need to make uh prefabs of my own Parts kind of so let me actually make for the prefabs and I'm just going to make a handful of them just right now um so let me just just fix that one just because that's a better night okay so what am I doing uh let me grab the so on the stock let me create an empty game object then go into the stock let me pick up stock three put it inside there and basically I need to offset it to where it makes sense okay that doesn't make sense so just gives pretty much the exact same name and let's make a prefab out of this one so if you ever have issues with uh modifying the pivot of some object this is how you do it you just make it a child of some other object and hopefully now it should be working all right uh okay so over here if I modify one two three there you go does work all right like that pretty cool just like this yeah it's already looking quite interesting it can modify the grip scope and all kinds of things all right so that's already pretty fun uh okay so the barrel and the underground those are actually going to be the trickiest things I wasn't expecting a buff dude that's funny all right thank you I guess uh yeah for me I love my two passions are programming and working out so yeah it's uh it's good because that's the only way that I can actually do what I do basically my biggest problem is when it comes to work life balancing that is always my tricky thing but the one thing that I never give up on is my time for going to gym and walking my dogs and that is really the one thing that helps me pretty much stay productive and helps me keep doing this for such a long time without burning out yeah it's the fact that I got those two things always okay all right so let's fix this annoying bug uh right theoretically can you make Unity just as good as unreal using egrp yep nowadays yeah pretty much I mean unreal probably still has a bit of an edge uh and the main thing they have is they have quick zone so they have all kinds of really photogrammetry assets so using good quality assets is quite a lot for making but Unity has the Adaptive probes volume and this one looks really awesome yeah right now it's only for herp but they are making it for urp soon so with this basically basically that's the issue is making something look good really comes to lighting quality and unity seems to be pushing more towards this direction so with that it should be very good so this is basically a way for adding uh probe volumes much easier it's currently on agrp and should be coming to Europe sometime in the future so yeah this is the one thing that I'm really looking forward to it being able to have screen space Global illumination just that one is great obviously raycasting is better but just that one is great so yeah definitely Unity is pushing towards having a bit more better Fidelity so that should be nice tips are good tutorials to learn Unity from your channel I mean if you're a beginner then go ahead watch my free course that one if you go through that one by the end you will have gained a ton of knowledge so yeah uh okay so what was I doing um right so the stock does work so the next thing is the barrel and that one is actually the one that is going to be really tricky because of the way that this weapon handles uh because the way that this system has because it's basically the barrel but I don't want to separate the barrel from the handguard sort of thing so I kind of want to put them together but the issue is that these have different shapes different sizes so that is going to be a bit tricky but let's put here the barrel what time is it oh damn it's already midday 20. yeah I guess it makes sense why my mouth is already quite dry because I'm really not made for for I was I doing as that yeah I always ask myself that uh yeah my mouth is definitely starting to be quite a bit dry anyways um okay so basically because I got the barrel and I want to include it with the hand card and the iron side so these are the three things that I want inside of the barrel and this is going to be the barrel touch point so basically I'm going to make uh right let me think because the issue is hey thank you so much for the super Channel thanks once again uh the issue is that over here this one actually includes multiple handguards on multiple sizes actually that's not an issue right now it's only an issue afterwards yeah so actually right now that might not be the problem unrecord yeah that is really awesome yeah yeah and recorded that one is definitely next level although the issue with that one the issue the uh why that one looks so good is not necessarily because of the essence even though obviously the s's are super high quality but it's more for the movement of the animation the way that the pistol is moving away from the from the face so the face is looking One Direction the pistol is looking another one that disconnect that is the one thing that really helps sell that one because that one really doesn't look insanely realistic and yeah it's because of using high quality assets with some that split in the animation so that is really interesting so but yeah that one is definitely a example of what's coming in the future as more and more devs have access to better and better tools yeah that is going to become much more common what kind dogs do you have uh they're a mixed breed so yeah no idea they're both medium size they're both sleeping they're both very very calm very chill so yeah they're nice uh okay so over here so I'm going to need basically a barrel and I'm going to basically have to build the barrels of different shapes hmm all right so this one's going to be a little bit tricky but let's see so I got a better one yeah I should have actually duplicated that one first so let me duplicate this one let me unpack this prefab what am I doing what am I doing where's the prefab prefab let me unpack this one and this one is going to be the barrel II and for the barrel two uh it's actually not the barrel ah crap I'm I'm thinking a bit too much uh make prefabs of barrels yeah but it's more that you know because I got like a tiny hand guard over here so I pretty much need to pick up that one and need to link up the barrel like this does it look okay I don't know and on such a small one do I also include the iron sight yes or no does that look actually I think that one looks good I think it looks better like that than oh crap than without the if I take away the iron side and put the barrel a bit more inside I don't know that also looks good I mean I guess maybe I could do barrels with and without iron sight you know maybe that could work anyways for now let's just include it and yeah it doesn't have some matches here but you could definitely do that I mean for this I'm focusing on maybe on something much more basic but yeah then afterwards you could all kinds of logic so yeah how to backup Unity projects the right way I mean for me usually I just do a super basic zip of the entire file but yeah that's not the the right way so if you want the right way I would say a Game Dev guide and where's the one where's the one he made a really nice video on how to use plastic SCM so this is unity's official version control tool so if that's the kind of thing that you're looking after definitely go ahead watch that video because yeah that is the builtin tool so that should be the one that is easy yeah the classic zip file because for me I may mostly do backups just for just for safekeeping pretty much so yeah for me super basic Zips work but yeah if you're working as a team then using Zips really isn't the best approach so yeah definitely go ahead and look into that one okay so Barrel two actually I'm going to name this brown one whether I call it brown two uh because this one is what is this one let me see it's based on the handguard so this one is the three so let's actually name this one the baron three oh crap so many clicks sorry trying to click underneath uh I think if UI tonkit is it production ready I did do quite a lot of research on it already uh I haven't made a video yet but I did do quite a lot of research and does seem that nowadays it is already pretty much ready although I don't think it is still I don't think it's runtime UI yet or am I wrong about that I don't know it's been a few months since I've seen it so is it now good for runtime UI uh but yeah basically the last time that I looked at it channel for 21 but on 121 I want to see for example version 22 do they recommend it okay so for the editor they recommend UI toolkit but for runtime they sound recommend the nty so yeah but yeah if you want to make editor Tunes I've looked into it and using UI tokit is so much easier than using I am going so if that's the kind of thing that you do definitely go and look into UI tokit that is definitely more than stable enough for that use case it just appears that for runtime it is not yet there so we shall see is there on version 23. now in 23 days I'll say the same thing but yeah definitely it's already advanced enough that you can actually start using it it's your first programming language I started doing IRC Scripts so I don't know what's the average age in chat but how many of you remember Merrick how many of you were on live back then yeah because that's pretty much how I started by making IRC Scripts so writing code to make this kind of thing I made all kinds of games kind of like hangman games trivia games so yeah that's pretty much how I started by learning how to do all kinds of those things it's kind of a scenelike language so yeah it was a it was definitely great to start like this I made my own thing on top so yeah it was pretty fun when born 91 someone remembers yeah it's definitely been quite a while but yeah this was a lot of fun really great yeah uh okay so let me continue making the barrels so I got the barrel two with that hand guard let me just move the uh what do I want just the hand guard too okay let me grab the Ironside and the barrel push it a little bit like that okay so then the barrel three is done and is there a four there no not this one the handle guard there's a yeah okay so there's a four so let me make the barrel four oh crap I can't see underneath the characters that that's the tricky part again let me just push it a bit just so I can work a little bit that's kind of the issue with the characters here um yeah so for the barrel let me grab the last one so the hand card 04 get rid this one take these two and push them out like this maybe push it out a bit further yeah because this one is this kind of barrel is more from like a sniper rifle something like that so yeah all right okay so anyway so just making all the various barrels so this is Barrel four this one is Barrel two and this one is we're on one okay so now let me make these script mode objects so the barrel one two three and four so the three ah crap uh so for the barrel two this one is a barrel one modify all these put them all as a barrel for the barrel one the brown two the barrel three and the barrel four okay so then on the weapon attachment system let's add another entry on this nice structure and this one is going to be for the barrel and the attach point is this one so the barrel attach point and yep thanks to how the color the code is all set up this should be it so let's try it out and I just forgot the brown button so let me actually just fix that one so up here for the on click on the barrel I'm actually going to do pretty much this modify the barrel all right and she don't like a new Marine Co routines can you elaborate on that point basically it's because the pattern they force you to use so you need to have a mono Behavior object so you need to have a game object then you need to make a function that returns I enumerator uh micro routine then inside you need to do return Eon do all kinds of things or you don't return that's the thing so you need to do that then you need to call and start Co routine and do a my core routine something like that so basically that whole this whole entire project the song this one structure being forced to use the amount of behavior being forced to use a game object being forced to call starco routine being forced to make an eye numerator with the end return basically for me I find this entire pattern to be way too convoluted this is way too unnecessary so that's pretty much it for me I find it so much easier to just do a basic flow timer it's a lot more straightforward at least for me so that is pretty much why I do that you can use a Singleton class yeah sure you can do that you can definitely work around it but personally for me I find all those requirements to get that pattern going I find that to be way too way too cumbersome so yeah for me that is why I just prefer super simple full timers that is really basic really easy to understand so yeah but it is uh just personal preference so if you don't like cool routines then by all means go ahead and use them there's nothing inherently wrong with them it's just because I personally do not like the pattern but if you do then go ahead and use them okay why did I mess up over here did I not add them yeah I forgot to add them to the list so appear on the weapon partner list let me unlock it and add the four new barrels and that's all I need to do and everything else should be working do you have problems learning to code are you one of the genius people I'm definitely not one of the genius people I'm similarly someone who has been writing code for many many years that is running it so yeah I definitely have problems I mean you can go rewatch this live stream and see how many errors I've got once building this system the only difference is simply when I find an error I try to fix it so I'll learn how to do it I do a lot of traveling error a lot of things so yeah I'm definitely not a genius just someone who has spent many many hours doing this sort of thing all right so look at that this is already working quite well so I got the scope I got the stock I got the grip oh it looks really nice so I can make a really tiny weapon or make something like a really long rifle and so on all right so honestly the only thing that I'm missing I think it's just the end Barrel and afterwards everything is already working quite well all right it's the logic of a class loaded on the Heap and if you follow the item on the quest the logic itself multiple times in memory uh the Heap is for I always confuse the Heap in the stack but yeah let's see okay I always confuse those but yeah I don't know so basically when you load an object to class is a reference type so that one is yeah it's on the Heap I think yeah structs our Valley type so those are the ones that go on the stack uh but yeah the logic itself multiple times in memory uh no I don't think so don't logic itself that's a good question but no I don't think so it's only the data that gets store actually I'm not 100 sure about that but either way the code itself isn't too much so yeah total nothing load the function multiple times right yeah because that's uh yeah it just it you've got a different reference for each uh instance of the class so if you unload the CL if you instantiate a class 100 times you are going to have a hundred times 100 references to that but yeah the code itself I don't think it's going to be repeated 100 times that would be very wasteful so yeah uh okay so what was I doing um all right let me do the Environ that is the one actually I made quite a bit of progress I didn't expect to be able to do all this in this live stream which has been going on for an hour and a half so all right so that's actually very good yeah I didn't expect to be doing all this so the end Barrel what do I call it what is a better name for this because I don't like the name and Barrel but yeah Barrel end and Barrel what do you call a tip ah I really don't like the name but anyways Veron and button and inside ah I really don't like the thing but Muslim all right that's good thank you yeah that definitely makes a lot more sense rather than barrel and thank you Muslim button is it an m416 the same thing is modular so you can make this pack is actually really nice I mean that's the reason why I'm doing this because this asset pack is going to be on a 70 discount on Monday next week so yeah they've got a bunch of presets over here so for example look at this one a really complex weapon then for this one some kind of heavy rifle and on this one this one is more of a regular looking rifle looks real nice nice red outside that's cool then there's also an SMG so basically all of these weapons are built using this modular system so with this you can see it looks really nice nice SMG then you got a giant sniper rifle some of these are based on the same thing so yeah so these look really nice yeah oh yeah this one can do pretty much without a a stock so that's fun that's done the intensity store it's the one on the where's my thing the cinti store it's a it's the military pack which is going to be it's going to be on the sale where's the other one the military yes this one which is going to be 70 off uh next week so that is why I'm doing this because say run a nice pack so if you need some things yeah thanks for always being so nice funny YouTube Ah that's awesome thank you for being here thanks for watching the videos thanks for commenting it's a twoway street so yeah thank you all so much okay are you just changing the gun objects on buttons click yeah that's pretty much it just having different objects and different objects that change in different ways and that is it okay so uh where was I the muzzle all right so let me actually rename that one because Muslim does make a lot more sense so thanks for that tip so instead of Barrel in Muslim okay more multiplayer netcut tutorials yeah I definitely want to do that I mean I'm currently working on my steam game which is based on multiplayer so yeah that is definitely a topic that I won't be covering quite a bit more in the future Okay so uh right yeah that's the issue with the with the muzzle it's the attach point for it yeah or hmm no yeah it is tricking yeah this one is quite a bit tricky why the script compilation take forever I mean that depends on what kind of things you have but you can definitely look into a simply definition oh crap assembly definition Unity yeah if you got problems with code compilation taking way too long definitely look into assembly definitions it's a bit tricky to set up also have a lecture on this in my ultimate TNT overview course so if you have that you can go watch that but yeah if you want to if you want to speed up compilation you can do this and basically with this if you modified just something inside the library then it only recompiles this one rather than wrinkle following everything so it can definitely help with with the compilation times for me usually that's not an issue because usually most projects on the list they are super long most projects compile in like two seconds so for me never really does that yeah strongly naming things too yeah picking good names is definitely one of the toughest parts so yeah definitely having help with that is always very useful okay so on the weapon attachment system let me add another part and for this other part this is going to be the muzzle and drag the Muslim reference all right so yeah for the buttons this one is actually pretty easy and I should probably refactor this code got to do it in a little bit rather than having so many individual reference or actually I could and I couldn't it works either way uh anyway so yeah do it in order to modify the muzzle so what did I do the muscle so that's all I need to do over there and really just building parts so thankfully this system is actually quite easy if you've ever done Android iOS games I've done some research on that area but no not really for me it's a I usually stick with just uh I usually stick with just PC games that's the thing that I've grown up on the thing that I've learned so yeah mostly do you know the Hot Wheel plugin yeah I do think that I've I'm pretty sure I didn't look at it in one of my assets list videos and I'm pretty sure nowadays it is actually free so I'm pretty sure it didn't be hot reload there's an asset that is now free is it this one okay I don't know but yeah yeah so apparently there's a yeah so I've seen it and it doesn't look very interesting so definitely something that I would like to research yeah look at that it's a ENT verified solution and it is free so yeah this is definitely one of the things that I wouldn't like to research as soon as I can find the time because yeah if you got problems with with doing it yeah you can you can definitely learn this how do you spin the pencil well basically many years ago I got into pen tricks even though I'm not very good as you can see ah yeah so I started learning from it quite a long time ago yeah if you go on pentrix tutorial as always nowadays you can really find so many things in so many places yeah look at that you can do the charger oh I could do that one but not anymore that also requires a specific thing yeah the the thumb around that's the basic one and the thing above I don't remember what that one was called yeah going up like that that's cool yeah that was fun definitely something that I I would like to get a little bit better anyways um yeah uh let me share this project GitHub link Yep this one I'm based on making this for a tutorial which should be out next week so yep uh okay so let me just continue doing this a little bit more what was I doing modified muzzle so basically I just need to make the prefabs so for the oh actually that's good because for the muzzle I also need to be able to enable no Muzzle so hmm okay so let me go inside make a prefab and for the muzzle yeah they got some Muslim breaks then there was a silencer wasn't it yep there's a silencer there's a bunch of silencers okay so let me put in there called muzzle one yeah the issue is going to be how to position it that's what's going to be really tricky well let's start with just Amazon one start with just one and then see if everything works so the muzzle one this one is going to be of type muzzle and this one is going to be a muzzle one all right so just with this I should be able to oh crap I can't see sorry uh let me see underneath just disable this one okay oh crap uh what did I forget of course I forgot the button always forgot the button uh okay so I can select the grip the stock the scope the barrel and the muzzle crashes why did you crash did I forget to drag the reference no I didn't so what happened oh right I forgot to drag it onto the parts list that's why yeah and for that one I need to I need to go into to be able to allow none yeah see this kind of problem so like this it does work but the problem is that the Muslim position that one has to be based on the barrel size otherwise it goes inside okay so let me think how am I going to do this because basically the muzzle requires an offset could I do maybe a barrel whistle I have a project where I only use an Arduino board in combination with DNT the game will be a multiplayer game oh that's nice it's stored data from the sensor in form of Time series for each player to analyze them later for a suitable database yeah I really don't know sorry that kind of very uh yeah I mean you need some database online and there are tons and tons of them but yeah I'm really not familiar with the pros and cons of all of them so yeah I know that Azure has a bunch of things so if you want to learn how to do that I did do some research I did cover some Azure tutorials so if you want to learn how to interact with Azure from Unity go ahead and watch those videos uh but yeah probably touching Muslim point to the barrel so uh not really because I don't want to put the attach Point as a challenge of a spawn object so that would be kind of dragging so basically I need the burnless so to contain like the offset for the Muslim position that's kind of what I need to do but the kitchen chaos multiplayer course will help me create the local multiplayer version that's not really the focus on the course but yeah sure I mean if you go through the course and then you learn about the input system which is used in the course if you do that then yeah it should be relatively easy to convert it to a local multiplayer yeah how do you instantiate that weapon with a specific attachments you choose for that I really just need to store the so basically over here the weapon it's all stored inside this dictionary right here it's got the part which inside has a weapon part so so I would basically just need to save that so I'm going to do that in a little bit but yeah it's pretty much I just say the weapon card so so let me just do the muzzle and then I'll do the saving and loading okay so for the muzzle all right I think the best thing of all is to make hmm I I wonder if this works so if I make what do I need I need the barrel weapon part so so if I make this one the barrel weapon part itself so this one is going to be a script long object and on this one basically I just need a public Vector 3 for the muzzle offset so I think like this or actually yeah it shouldn't be a vector three just a float muzzle offset okay so I think just like this now if I go up here and I make a barrel weapon part of so Barrel one yeah I just need a different name oh crap that's not no not scriptable object but needs to extend weapon part so you know this is what I want does this work oh maybe it does work all right okay so I think this might this might actually work hmm all right okay okay this might work uh with this Barrel Old okay so we got the barrel one and I'll just make two of them I'll correct this side so the barrel one and then I got a barrel two okay so now I just need to go inside the barrel with that one and basically for the Muslim position that's going to be pretty much just a point inside of it so it's going to be offset by let's say by this much so by Point 1432 so if I go into this one point 1432 and then if instead of this one if I've got the barrel two so for the barrel two make a new game object for this one the offset is going to be something like this I think Sunday Brown 2 I have this offset so that way I have a bit more information when it's a barrel as opposed to something else okay uh send this so I change the parts yeah I think I think it is like this right so I changed the part I said the part transform okay great so if uh if this weapon part as so dot part type if it equals a barrel so if this one is a barrel then I'm going to go into this one weapon part dot muzzle so this is going to be the Muslim part attach points Muslim Parts attach points I'm going to go into this one and in the attachpoint transform Dot dot position equals and I'm going to put it this one dot attach Point transform dot position Plus amazing the position uh does right work okay now a bit I'm a bit confused right now but yeah so on this on the right times the all right I need to grab down uh so I need to get what I call it the barrel weapon part itself okay Barrel weapon part so equals this weapon part is so as bear on weapon part is so okay so let me get the attach point for the barrel just to make things a bit more clear okay so I get the barrel weapon carton that I'm going to position the muzzle on the barrel dot position was the right is that the right I don't know if it is the right but yeah that one dot muzzle offset okay I think like this it might be working so let's see all right forward from Turkey improving myself more and more everyday thanks to your videos oh that's awesome yeah I'm glad my videos have held you that's really cool best of luck in your Learning Journey nice uh uh oh I still haven't fixed that issue I thought I fixed it but yeah um if I put a bear on where are you moving put the bear on and got a known reference did I not telling muzzle uh on the Muslim I did add it alright bye thanks for being here thank you uh what exactly was not here this one is known no this one can't possibly be no this one is also not known is the barrel part does this one know how do I make good input prediction that's a very complex topic so not really something that can be answered right away that really depends on your on the context whatever you are trying to do so the barrel got no reference what is it the baron weapon partiso is this the one that is known do I need to cast it instead of doing as Maybe still get that special happy feeling when you get something to work probably yeah of course whenever something works it is always amazing like for example this there you go got a null error I think the biggest difference is as a beginner sometimes you get frustrated when you see an error whereas for me I know that's just part of the process so the fact that I'm seeing this error doesn't bother me it's just perfectly normal part of the process so in this case I'm pretty sure the issues that I can't I need to cast it instead of doing as checking if it's a bear not a muzzle which one did I grab yeah that makes oh no yeah no it it is the logic is correct it's just over here that I forgot to add it oh crap this kind of oh actually no yeah I forgot the unity has the thing for sorting the things all right so that's good so nine so I can get rid of the other elements so put it on 10 and then add the barrel one basically the issue was that I had forgotten to add the new script object type so like this it should be working so like this Barrel any up there you go got no errors and where is the muzzle uh right yeah this is the thing it's positioned on the right where it should be on the fourth Vector so four instead of right so up here for the forward instead of the right one all right what about the errors that is not about your code like when using an external plugin yeah that part is definitely a lot more frustrating but thankfully that doesn't usually happen so yeah did you fix the bug where the weapon flicked around nope not yet it is not yet fixed so here yep there you go the muzzle is in there yeah there you go that annoying I really gotta fix that because that's annoying uh yeah so got the barrel and got the other barrel and yep it did work all right look at that the barrel position is indeed changing so I can put a muzzle and there you go it does work all right awesome yeah there you go I mean snake and what the input to feel good well the first thing you need to do is actually Define what exactly do you mean by feeling good because that can mean a billion different things so yeah do you have a game development what would you tell yourself when you first started on this pad well what I would say is write a lot of code make a lot of games so pretty much what I ended up doing so yeah there's really no no shortcut to game development you really you just built something and you keep making things so I made a really nice video quite a long time ago on seven steps yeah that one which is basically just make a bunch of tiny games then make a bunch of small games then make a bunch of medium games and make a bunch of large games that's really it I mean experience really is one of the most important things so definitely spend a lot of time making a lot of games for me one of the things that helped me quite a lot was how I spent five years making Flash games and Flash Games by the by definition are only super tiny so in those five years I made about 40 games and that gave me a ton of knowledge with regards to programming how to write code how to do game development with regards to game design trying all kinds of game genres so yeah basically made tons and tons of games and with experience Things become so much better how many finished projects did you have before publishing something because what does publishing something mean that's kind of the issue because uh in flash games yeah I published about 40 of them and I probably had another I don't know at least 20 or 30 other unfinished prototypes but when it comes to Steam games I actually don't have too many because usually when I decide on a steam game idea when I actually decide on it and start really building something by then I'm pretty Focus that this is going to be my same thing so actually when it comes to steam game projects for that only I actually don't have too many unfinished prototypes uh right I'm a senior phone stack that with a good salary but I'm hating my job what can I do to change the game though uh yeah definitely start by watching the course and see if it is something you like but yeah I would say I would definitely say don't jump don't if you got a good job definitely don't quit it before you have a good alternative because making money with game development is really difficult so yeah I would say stick with your job even if you hate it that sucks but yeah that's stick with it and do Game Dev on the side and maybe when you get to the point where your side Game Dev when that one is actually providing income then maybe you can make the phone jump but yeah I would definitely say don't quit it until you do it because game development is really difficult yeah uh right did you enter the cinti jam uh no because I usually don't have time for game Jam so I normally don't do game jams but yeah that doesn't look really interesting so if you that if you have some time we'll definitely encourage you to do that I mean personally I love their style that's why I'm using oh can you still hear me did something go down I got a random notification from OBS saying reconnected so did this go down is it live I don't know I think so okay I think it's live again okay something went down all right okay good uh okay right so let me let me finally fix that bug that annoying bug about the rotation so basically let me do a debug.log on the mouse Delta and see which is the one causing problems because I think it's only on the rotate how do I get input a specific controller what do you mean by that I don't know what you mean but go and look into the input system the input system basically you can get all kinds of inputs so it depends on how you have it set up but yeah looking to use the new input system and doing that kind of thing should be relatively simple okay so I rotate all right and the issue is when I click away and then I click back yeah there you go the Y is on minus 600 and I think that's the issue yeah if the Y is huge on the negative or negative or positive because if I go here then I click outside on the left side and yeah that one rotates but does not flip so the issue is with the with the Y so I can actually do most y equals math crack meth I always get wrong method.claim let's clamp the mouse down to dial y between I don't know minus 200 and plus 200. don't fix it so if I go here I rotate I click away and I click back and there you go now it has been clamped so it no longer flips up down left right if I go yeah I should probably clamp the X as well just so it doesn't do that massive thing so any most Dante on the X also put it same thing so this fix huge jumps when when Unity loses Focus all right meth yeah meth is a tiny typical to right but yeah uh okay favorite hobbies I don't like walking my dogs I don't know if that counts as a hobby I love working out going to the gym oh crap I close it um so yeah I love walking around running oh man I messed up I put it on 16x9 and put it on the side there and maximize that's what I want all right great you say it's your own job I never had a regular job so I am not the right person to ask about that hey look at that this is the weapon all right okay let me just fix the other barrels and enable the ability to choose a no Muzzle uh so let me go let me call it muzzle zero and yeah for the muscle zero I'm just going to do wasn't like this except there's nothing inside of it that's a pretty basic so the muscle zero you got the Muslim zero and on the weapon part list let's set the muzzle zero okay so on the barrel let me make the other Barrel so there are three and the crap and the barrel four keys are just moving there yep I'm here I am Portuguese so I was born here in Oliveira it's okay to move the character in fixed update it depends on what you're doing if you are moving using physics then yep you should be doing it on fixed update but if you are moving by modifying the velocity which is what I usually do for that one you don't have to do it on the fixed update you can do it on update because modifying the velocity of the rigid body that doesn't actually modify the the uh doesn't actually move the object so for that one if you're just modifying the velocity you can do it on the regular update which is what I normally do so it's been a while since I made a regular character controller but yeah this one over here this one is still a nice tutorial so on there yeah I use physics in order to move it and yeah I do that Game Dev yep go ahead and watch the free 10 hour course so if you go through that course you won't learn quite a lot uh okay so what am I doing uh right the position on the barrel so let me put the barrel three reset and the barrel four crap uh let me find the positions for both these okay sure I mean I'm speaking English just because I assume most people uh in chat uh just no English not Portuguese but yeah sure I can yeah uh okay so let me put this put a empty game object push it to the side and for this one and pretty much like that so this is the offset so for the this one is what Baron 3 and put on this offset okay and then for the barrel four let me offset it by a little bit more so something like this on this offset like this okay good great so on this one if I add the barrel three and the barrel four and yep now it should be working okay great oh boy my voice is already very messed up you see about MVC patterns uh I've never used it uh I know that it's super used in things like web development and so on I haven't looked into it because of the when I was researching Azure a lot of those Azure things do you use that pattern so yep I'm aware of it but yeah I've never really used it and I don't think in game development it is used quite a lot but yeah if that is something that you're already familiar with it can be really great for I like how it forces you to separate so the logic from The View I almost forget which is which so the model that's like the structure then the view then things so yeah it does help with separating things out which can be quite useful so yeah uh all right so yeah so this is working I can put the muzzle barrels of different lengths and the muscle is positioning correctly then I got the stock the grip and all of these and there you go all right nice okay great all right get input from a specific controller player input and player input manager components you asked the the input system uh I remember it's you've got the control schemes or it's not the control scheme I don't know because on input system multiple characters there was yeah there you go crossplatform control so watch this video on unity's channel they've covered something like that where they got multiple characters all of them driven with the same thing so they use it in order to Define which characters they use so yeah they made a bunch of these videos so definitely look into that one uh okay so what am I doing all right let me just make a quick save load system so let's go up here and as usual make a private a class save object so I got the save object and am I just going to store all the parts that is always the thing that I always have trouble remembering which is does it automatically serialize yes or no said you were using a create function method what create function Singleton dead no that's a great very useful pattern personally I really like it so yeah Code Monkey Gym and Fitness video yeah maybe one day I'll do a second Channel yeah yeah lately for me it's a I go to gym do regular bodybuilding Fitness stuff then usually on the weekends I do a bit more running and lately I've been more into rock climbing so yeah do a lot of things yeah maybe one day I'll do a second Channel just focus on Fitness that would be funny where are you from I'm from Portugal uh all right so for the okay so for the same object I want yeah I think this is actually going to be weapon part is so weapon part as soon list and I think this actually does not work so so probably not public ah private Droid save and on Save let me go and you save object and inside the save object for the weapon partisan list I'm going to need a list of weapon particle weapon partiso list make a new list and basically I'm going to go do a four each on this guy ah crap trying to uh so for each on the parts type attach Point part type attach Mark crop I'm already starting to miss okay so go on to this one so if this one dot weapon part is so it is not known that means there's something on there so on the weapon partisan list let me do an ad and add this guy right here down this is the same object same object and then I take this save object and I do a Json utility to Json and convert this into Json so that's the string Json and let me do a debug.log in order to save this Json so this is the save and appear on the update let's do some testing so if input get key down on the T key when that happens let's try saving okay I have bad social anxiety when I lose control of volumes and stuff oh damn that's difficult yeah gem is dangerous yeah I mean yeah definitely start by working out at home that's definitely an option although I would definitely also encourage you to I don't know try to beat that essentially what I'm saying is a lot of people get really selfconscious about going to gym but personally I can tell you my point of view as someone who goes to gym five six times a week for me I don't really pay attention to anyone so if I see anyone who's a beginner who's something I'm really not paying attention I'm just focused on my own thing so that's usually something that people have a fear which is one of those sort of imaginary fears what I mean is the other people most of them are probably not judging you especially the ones who are who are there regularly they're just focused on their own thing so if that is your concern I would say I would say personally for me I I've never felt the desire to mock someone at the gym I mean we're all there to improve ourselves so yeah I would say basically if I saw you at the gym I would not have any negative opinions upon you so I would say focus on that and focus on the fact that the social anxiety that is probably all in your head and all the other people they're just focusing on their own thing so focus on your own I mean Fitness is all about selfimprovement so so yeah do that but if you if you can do it at home then definitely do it I mean for me I prefer going to gym there's much more much more equipment much more things but yeah whatever you can do it always helps yeah yep we are all at the gym for the same reason so yeah and yeah cold sandwich yeah thank you for the Super Chat most important teacher of my life that is awesome yeah I'm glad the videos have helped you thank you so much all right uh okay what was I doing kind of forgot uh all right let me choose a bunch of things and press on T and nope it did not save of course this is always this issue that I was sort of concerned with yeah I'm already for two years nice yeah yeah it's a great experience yeah people are really nice yeah for the most part people will go there they're really especially people who are the regulars who know that the eventually things yeah really nice uh so for the weapon party yeah that's a problem because it does not automatically do so the weapons part is so yeah I gotta save it by name so I gotta do a string so I got a weapon partiso name so a list of string for the weapon part is so name list do a new list and then I'm going to do a four for each weapon so it's weapon particle weapon party so in the weapon part as so list so I go through that one and then I go on to this one and I add any word part so dot name so I add the name and then I save the name and now it should work oh another one nice hey thank you so much for the Super Chat Super Chat cuteness oh hey generally hey how's it going bye croissant yeah thank you nice yeah I hope you had a nice flight back I hope that was fun yeah hope you're doing well that's cool thank you uh right so press T anyway uh nope okay so now that's range that should have worked okay why did that not work wait is that one no it's not that one oh this one that counts am I not adding this one should be adding why are you not adding this video be on YouTube later yep this won't be recorded and of course the reason why I'm doing this is for a uh for a tutorial video which will be coming out sometime next week so yep that is the goal okay at things save and nope why are you invisible am I doing did I not save it oh never mind oh God ah sometimes I really mess up things yeah I'm going through the list but obviously the list doesn't have anything attached to it oh boy so that's not what I want so it's on this one dot keys is the key the weapon part type it is right or no is it no I don't remember and parttime parttime attached point so yeah oh boy so this is going to be the weaponpartiso that part type part type and then I go into so the part type attach point so part type attach point it is this one on this part's type so I get that one and then I do that and now it should work all right can I get a dedicated server for free uh not really I mean someone has to pay for it so if you want to use the lowest cost possible I would encourage you to use ENT relay because that one does have a very generous free tier but yeah getting a proper dedicated Center for free I mean someone has to pay for that so I don't think you're gonna find something for free all right awesome there you go it's saving that one sectionally maybe was it working previously hmm because it seems that it wasn't a weapon party so if I do the weapon partisan list and I put the weapon partisan list I don't think this won't work but still let's try it can run a micro ec2 an AWS free tier really forever or just say or just saying onetime thing because yeah I haven't actually looked into AWS when it comes to Cloud I've really unlocked at Azure and yeah I don't think they have anything that is 100 free on the time but yeah oh look at that so this actually might have worked okay all right so I thought it wasn't working but it really only wasn't working because of the because of the thing yeah just for a year per account oh okay so it's one of those promotional things 50 50 ccus isn't that much generous it really is I mean when it comes to Indie Games it is so difficult to to reach people to some copies so yeah 50 concurrent users that is a massive amount that is something like a thousand copies so if you sell a thousand copies on the first uh month of release then you can easily afford the cost that they charge for really so for me that one is either your game doesn't make it too well in which case you don't have to pay anything for the Relay or your game does very well and the cost of the relay is super mini skill so either way I think that one is an excellent thing okay right so I need to hey another Super Chat hey thanks again for sharing thanks so much nice like a gym all right thank you that's nice thank you all so much uh Muslim can be better without a barrel yeah I need to add some some uh some testing over that anyways um right so a private void load so unload I'm going to receive a string for the Json and I take Json and can I just convert directly I don't think so so the same object passing the Json and save object save object so I'm not sure if this is going to work but let's see let's do a debug.log on this one that weaponpartisan list dot count let's see if this one does find it and let's see if it does okay just need bit of testing so up here on the update let's go do another king on the y key let's go with and loads I speak it appears on my character's head yep yep it does oh got in there what did I do wrong they're not calling mode all right I gotta pass in the Json uh right let me just copy paste actually I've got the yeah I've got the Json right here so let me use a fixed Json for now string Json let me copy this guy can I copy it directly like this yeah there you go it does work I think this work oh right yeah I oh boy this is way too much text uh the Json ends here okay so let's see if this one does work I don't like channels Khan but we can look at light mode sorry but my issue is the opposite as I cannot look at dark mode so sorry I really wish that it was Dynamic I really wish I could look at light mode and you can look at dark mode but yeah videos aren't really Dynamic so it's uh difficult uh right so I did it so I press on Y and it did work wow okay nice I didn't expect to work that easily but yep it does work okay cool oh boy no my pen oh boy my my dogs are starting to wake up so I think it's gonna be about time let me just fix this challenge Japan uh right okay so yeah I just want to actually load it and it's actually going to be super easy right so I just gotta go for each weapon part so weapon part so in the weapon part is in the save object ah crap in the save object that weapon part as soon as second through that and call set part and set this weapon part so and yeah that should really be about it with that it should be saving automatically actually I don't need the yeah I don't need the name I just need the weapon part itself so I can actually get rid of this any Json probably still works so I don't need the name I don't need these things okay let's see do you have to master data structures and Algos for Game Dev uh now really I mean definitely helps to know but uh well with any other yield then loads I can put something completely different and then unload and there you go all right awesome great it works uh so yeah data structures now goes it does help to know them but yeah you don't need to I mean if you ask me to Define what is a bubble sort or quicksort or any of those things yeah I couldn't tell you I really don't know the I know how to store things but I don't know the name behind the algorithms but yeah so you don't need to know the technical things behind it but uh but yeah it does help to know how things work in general yeah General tips for using generics or interfaces I mean it depends on the context so yeah it really depends on the context so for example if you want to use if you want a good use cases well first of all I've got uh videos on those so on the generics and interfaces so if you want to unlock that for example when it comes to interfaces I've got the what did I call it interact with the record this one yeah how to talk to NPCs so if you want to see a very specific use of how interface can help you then this video is right so it teaches you how to use interface in order to be able to interact to talk with a person or push a button or open a door so interface are really good for that and all my videos on my grid system all of these are really based on using generics for the grid map so if you want a practical use case of generics definitely use that is playing their best for making your own assets uh it's one of the most widely used tools so yeah I do think blender is really great I've only learned the base of it but yeah as far as I know blender is a very good tool so definitely if you learn about it you won't be able to do tons of assets um all right so yeah so basically here the system is pretty much only working so I can modify all these let me just do a bunch more so just a few more minutes let me make a few more parts and then I gotta go because my voice is already pretty messed up uh let me do a bunch more muzzles that should be fun Muslim two and Muslim three uh because there are a bunch of Muslims over here I got a Muslim break these don't look really intense and another silencer so let me go over here on the muzzle so muscle one okay so on the Muslim 2 let's go with the last uh you know a sound turn and on the Muslim three let's go with one of these Muslim breaks let's go this one which is this one yeah that one looks good okay all right so down here I just need to add the muzzle two and the Muslim three just need them to listen don't need to touch the code at all once again thank you so much for description nice thank you uh Barrel scope grip Barrel Muslim one and there you go that one and a nice Muslim break all right that's cool so I can put a bunch of silencers I can put them nothing and so on and for the barrel it can be of any size so it can be really long it's like this and a real long stock there you go really long rifle that's nice not like that that looks pretty cool so yeah then I can press on T in order to save it and there you go let me just copy this yeah we just need to implement some saving onto a file instead of onto a fixed Json here but for now this works so let me just get rid and only find the Json there we go now I can get back to this rifle anytime I want so so let's try it out this game development need math I mean you need the basics but you don't need anything too special I mean over here on the making of this system I really only use math just over here for handling the rotation of the weapon so everything else really is just logic there's no no math involved in any of these so yeah you don't need to be a math expert you see the people at the bottom yep I do which makes it sometimes a bit different difficult to touch the button so unload and there you go here's my weapon and I can load something completely different then load again and there you go nice so I got some nice saving and loading look at that the camera the main camera where's my main camera for the near 0.01 there you go all right okay all right so I think that's gonna be it because my voice already messed up and I actually did manage to do quite a lot I didn't think that I'd be able to to build pretty much the entire system but turns out that it actually went quite well so I can modify all these and I can load them save them and so on just need to add all the parts for all the other remaining things but yeah in terms of logic all right I still need the under barrel and modify the mag and so on BM most of the core concept is all over here and it actually looks quite nice I'm quite pleased with this okay great all right okay so yeah definitely stay tuned for the video sometime next week and the video is going to coincide when this pack is on 70 off so definitely don't go ahead and pick it up right now wait for next week because those should be like this more likes to informal logic tasks yeah definitely whenever I got something that I need to do like this yep I will be doing this yeah we're applying to the channel yes this live stream won't be saved and then the final edited video won't come out next week all right okay so my voice is really already messed up so I think that's gonna be it so I'm working good so I'm looking good all right okay so let me just put on the characters just look at my OBS see how things are going like that all right okay great so yeah thank you all so much for being here I hope you found this entertaining useful informative whatever I definitely would like to do this more often so yeah whenever I get the next tutorial that I need to do some research I'll try to do it on a live stream okay so yeah once again thank you all so much for being here all right I hope you enjoy the rest of your Friday the rest of your weekend so enjoy it alright so thanks again for being here thanks and bye thank you foreign thank you foreign foreign
