quick question about two months ago I made a video on a practical plan for you to make your very first game that plan was to First work on a small scope project then to quickly set up a steam coming soon page and the third step this one was right now in October during the steam nextfest to publish your free demo so now that we are in October and the next Fest is currently running my question is did you follow this plan I already asked this question to patreon and YouTube members so now I'm asking all of you if you follow this plan and you have a demo out right now let me know YouTube doesn't like it when people post link in the comments so instead of a direct link just post the name of your game and I'll find it on Steam over the weekend I'm going to play through them and then make a video with my thoughts hopefully that should be very useful for the developer but also super useful for anyone watching there's a lot of things about game design that are very much Universal watching an analysis of one game can also help you in your own game and by the way the general advice is to keep your game demo up even after the festival that way YouTubers have a bit more time to find your demo and play it and of course in my specific case depending on how many games people post I might not be able to play through all of them before Monday all right so that's it super quick video I'm looking forward to playing through all of your games thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
