hello and welcome I'm your KMI the ssur is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for March 24 in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid assets and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also if you need some awesome low poly aets right now there's a really excellent Humble Bundle tons and tons of aets for all kinds of games with a super deep discount personally I love this ancient empire pack it always makes me want to make some kind of game like 300 or for some nice zombies There's a city zombies pack maybe there's one if you'd like to make some kind of farming game one if you'd like to make some kind of office tycoon or town game you've got fantasy characters nightclubs icons even the really useful prototype pack and a really awesome spy kit so as you can see tons and tons of really awesome low po asses help you make pretty much any game you can imagine all it at a pretty low price just 25 bucks so go ahead and get it with the link in the description all right so on to the top 10 list starting off with a really awesome visual effect that looks just like VHS it's got quite a few options to add scand lines and some glitchy movement it looks very good definitely looks exactly like VHS so if that's a style you're working for then this would be perfect this one works with the volume system so it's a super easy postprocessing effect that you can easily add to any game then if you're making a mobile game and you want a quick and easy virtual joystick check out this one it is exactly what you expect it's a virtual onscreen joystick you just drag it onto your project and works right away you can click drag to move shoot and do whatever you want and it also includes support for multiple joysticks now this is something that I've been wanting to cover in tutorial for ages but if you don't want to take the time to build yourself you can just use this free asset next for a fun visual here is an ice cream truck it's a pretty nice model it's low poly with a bunch of colors growing up I love playing a game called lemonade Tycoon where you saw lemonade from a van and customers showed up so I could see a game just like that being made with this truck model or if instead you want an entire city then check out this one it looks quite nice the roads are actually very realistic with the roads the curb the lights and so on so if you'd like to make your own car game or something like GTA then this would be excellent starting point next for a useful tool here is one to help you add a bunch more control to your Cod routines this is basically a timing system that has a bit more control like giving it a custom Delta time or updating in a specific order normally I build my own timing systems for my games for example on dinky Guardians I have a timing system specifically to handle the offw logic but if you don't want to build yourself then this could be a great help then for another fun visual here is a low poly excavator I quite like this style it's very low poly with some solid bright colors it's split into pieces so you can very easily animated looking at this makes me want to make a fun Machine controller script I think that would be interesting and then if you want to take this further this dev has tons more machines in the exact same style next here's a super useful tool it's a script ball object table view this one is pretty simple and does exactly one thing very well you can select a script ball object type and it shows you a table with all the objects in all the fields if you use a lot of script B objects in your game then a tool like this one can really help save you a ton of time from having to swap between objects back and forth then for another fun visual here's a low poly zombie Hospital character this could be great for an enemy in some kind of Hospital zombie game maybe something inspired by episode one of The Walking Dead and if you want some more then this dev has an entire zombie Hospital pack then if you want to make your worlds come alive one way to do that is to add some trees to your world here's a free pack with a whole bunch of different ones there's actually a ton of variety over 60 trees and bushes in this one free pack with all different colors you could very easily make all kinds of biomes and then if you're making a game set inside the human body check out these virus models there's some spiky round ones some that are tiny and some with some creepy tentacles I could imagine a game kind of like an RTS where you control the body's defenses against these viruses with all of these model differences if you apply some different materials with some scale differences you could make a ton of enemy types just from this one pack all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the NTS store for March 24 there's Link in the description and also check out my own free and P ass on the store all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some
