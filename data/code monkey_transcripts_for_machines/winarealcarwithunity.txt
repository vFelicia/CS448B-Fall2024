hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and unity currently has a contest running where you can actually win a real car apparently this contest has been running since late february but i've only heard about it just now the submission date is pretty tight it's already next week but still i want to make a quick video just in case you want to participate then who knows maybe win a car specifically it's a volkswagen id4 with a value of 40 000 and the runner up prices are also pretty good there's 300 worth of unity swag so the goal of the contest is to make something using unity forma this is a new tool built by unity that is meant to help you easily create some realtime 3d product configurators so the most obvious example is something like a car where you can inspect and interact with the 3d model in tons of ways so you can change the colors move the wheels pop the trunk and so on or maybe instead of a car you have something like a furniture store where you create something to showcase a custom desk and demonstrate all of its features or maybe for clothes to change the color the fabric and so on then you can make a normal build or publish it to the cloud and access the configurator through any web browser so it's a pretty interesting tool for marketing various products now usually this is a paid tool but while the contest is running you can test it out for free so even if you don't end up submitting anything to the contest this is a great way to test it out if it's something you're interested i did just that i downloaded it myself to try it out so here is the official demo it's a car configurator if you just want to try out this demo you don't need to actually download it you can do that through the browser on the website so it's a really cool car i'm pretty sure this is fictional i don't think this brand actually exists but it's a really good looking highend sports car so the whole point of unt forma is to make it super simple to create a configuration like this so for example over here i can change around the color pack so make it in red and see how the car looks like i can try rotating the wheels just to see it i can open up the doors and look from any angle and so on this whole thing is a unity scene so i can also load just a different environment so here's on a soft flat so a really good looking environment then you can change the color of the calipers over here change the seat back color go inside the various cameras and there's all these for example going to the interior camera if there it is look at that the whole interior so as you can see this is a great tool to easily create a configurator so the customer can see their specific customized product exactly as they want it this is the builtin configurator to demonstrate what the tool can do now the goal with the contest is to actually build your own and for that it doesn't actually have to be just a car it can be just about anything so for example you can make it with some furniture or maybe some clothes or maybe a house you can check the official rules for more info and according to those rules i believe you can use assets from the asset store so thankfully there's actually spring sale running right now so that's pretty helpful if you want to participate you can get some great assets at a nice discount and use them in your demo now when you sign up you get the link to download unity forma which is what i have open here by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks so this is a different interface but this is exactly still unity so in fact i can simply go into forma into switch mode and there you go now i'm back on the standard ent window so as you can see this is a tool that is built on top of unity so just go ahead switch mode and back into the unity form of view okay so let's take a look at this and see how this all works now on the right side you've got the product outline so this is some sort of hierarchy so it shows all the various parts of the product or model or anything you have then on the left side you have over here all these buttons so the first one is for the product so this is where you add all the various variants so for example up here you've got the various color packs so i can inspect the yellow color pack the red black and so on with the pack selected you can see down here all of the various settings so for example this is a pack which means that it will apply all of these individual changes so it won't change the car paint into blue it will change the leather into dark blue and so on so this is a pack of multiple changes and then you've got the individual changes so for example the body color just double click and there you go now we've got an ember body and then here you can see what this variant actually does so if you scroll down you see the various assignments so these are the various object parts that get modified and they get set with this particular material and with this color so for example you can see this one will change the material up here for the front splitter so change into ember then changing to aqua so all it's doing is selecting a bunch of object parts and then setting their material in their color now how you work with this tool is very simple so up here just click on add let's create a new material variant set and for this one let's say i want to change the color over here on the front bumper so i can just rename this so this is the front bumper and then let's say rename this one and this one will be in white so to select what objects i want to be modified when i select this option i can just select the object on the scene so i want to select the front bumper then you go here and let's select the home front bumper and down here it says the material that this object is using so i can right click and add assignment to the selected variant and there you go down here now i've got the various assignments so the various objects that won't be changed when i select this option so for this one let's change the material into a white color and there you go now i've made a variant to change the bumper color into white and if i want i can create a new material variant and for this one let's make it a black and let's reset it back into the black material okay so here i've added two variants for the front bumper set it in black satin white and so on so that's how you play around and add the various configurator options then next thing you have is the environments so this essentially loads a different unity scene so for example let's go into the luxury showroom and yup so that essentially loads a different ent scene that is used for the background then we've also got the various cameras so these are the multiple preset viewpoints that you can create so you can click on any of them there's already a bunch of preset ones and if you select down here and over here you can see the various options and if you're familiar with hdrp cameras and all this won't be familiar so you've got the basic you can change the field of view change the behavior type so free analog orbit and so on then on the advanced you can set it to follow or look at a certain object so if you want to make an automatic camera that moves around then of course you've got the scene machine so this works with cine machine then you've got some blending then for the animation this one is using the timeline so if you're familiar with that you can easily use this and over here on the appearance you can also create a custom volume profile so you can add it and for example add tons of postrusting effects so for example on this one let's massively increase the saturation there you go so you can make each camera look exactly as you want it and then finally you've got some rules so this is pretty interesting this one lets you tell that if you select a certain thing then a certain other thing is no longer available for example add new rule let's say if the red color pack is selected then i'm going to say that the material variant set of the one that we made so the front bumper so if you select the red pack you cannot select a white bumper so this is how you configure the various options and combinations and then finally over here you've got the new build so this is how you select the profile and make an actual proper build so here you select the profile so hdrp is meant to look really good then you've got the products so would select your own custom product if you want to submit and then just go ahead and click on build so if you want to submit your own entry to the contest first of all just go ahead and grab whatever asset you want to showcase then go up here into the gear icon and open up the profile settings then up here click on add to add a new product in this case i'm going to add from the unt project and i'm going to select just a car that i grab from the asset store and up here is my car so again i can go ahead create all kinds of variants in order to modify the color and so on to make my custom configurator alright so that's unt forma it's a really interesting tool that showcases how unity is a great realtime 3d engine that goes beyond just game development now the price for this contest is really awesome it's an actual real car specifically it's a volkswagen id4 worth 40 thousand dollars and renter prices are also really good i only just heard about the contest just now it's ending already next week so if you want to submit something do it quickly take advantage of the spring sale to get some great assets for your entry and if you just want to try out unt format go ahead and get it it's free while the contest is running alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
