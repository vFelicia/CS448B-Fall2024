one developer has reimagined the movie Joker in Unreal Engine 5 as a sort of open world game although calling it open world game is a little bit of a stretch there's no real gameplay it's just visuals and animations but for that it is absolutely gorgeous they have perfectly recreated a bunch of environments directly from the movie these feature some insanely highend textures insanely high quality lighting more than anything this actually showcased the power of today's tools from what I can see this was all done just by a single developer so really impressive
