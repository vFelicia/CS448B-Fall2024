haiya ruined so I've been working super hard on the code monkey steam app and it's finally almost done it won't be completely free and the release date is set for next week July 13 so please go to this team page and add it to your wishlist and phone this has definitely been a lot more work than I anticipated the original release was meant to be all the way back in May which I guess sort of works as a pregnant example of how you need to be very careful with your estimates but despite going over my original estimate I'm so pretty happy with how it's going it is composed of a launcher with all the completed games as well as the alerted section with tons of interactive tutorials so this definitely took went longer than I originally planned but I'm really happy with how it looks and of course it's only meant to be the beginning now with this team have functional I have a super easy way of doing lots of really cool things for example when I make another complete game which is something I'd like to do more of I can just update the build and you can play it very easily this also has the ability to make some really cool multiplayer tutorials and there's also my idea from very long ago of doing some livestream games which become much easier if I can just include a client directly in the steam gun so if you haven't yet please go to the store page and add it to your wishlist now I have to get back to work on it and get everything done and polished up for release alright thanks for watching and I'll see you all next week
