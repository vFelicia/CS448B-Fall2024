in this video I'm going to go through an overview of the FPS that I built these past few days using the unity FPS micro game as a base this game is nice and short with some interesting level design and some unique mechanics there's a hookshot shield transformers mission briefing final boss fight and more let's begin okay so first of all if you haven't played it yet then go check the link in the description and come back here afterwards the game is very quick only about five minutes and is fully playable in your browser so go check it out play through it and then continue in here alright so if you're back here I assume you've played through it as you saw the game has a bunch of interesting features there's the awesome shield effect connect to the Transformers there's the hookshot which feels very nice to play with the mission briefing display inside the helicopter as well as jumping down into the landing zone to start my level super fast mini enemies two unique weapons plus the grenades a nice elevator and the final boss fight with multiple stages those are all the things that I added on to the FPS micro game base ok so now first of all the reason why I was able to get this up and running so quickly is because the base of this game is the justreleased unity FPS micro game if you're not familiar with micro games this is a great new thing that unity has been doing recently in order to help new developers get started so if you're a beginner I suggest you look at them and play around you can find all of the micro games on the unity hub over here you just open it and go into the unlearn tab and here you can see all of the various micro games as well as a bunch more stuff so previously we had the Carling micro game then the platformer micro game and now it's just been released the FPS micro game they come as a completed playable based game and then you have a bunch of mini tutorials which they call mods in order to add more things onto it so for example you can modify the FPS micro game to add a new weapon type by following this Motty turn so that's unity micro games a great feature for complete beginners to quickly get started using unity even for more experienced developers this can be a great way to quickly get a prototype up and running and test your ideas just like I've done in this project also next month there won't be a very nice livestream game jam using the FPS micro game as a base it will be on November 24 and it will be hosted by Android from mixing jam alongside myself and couch ferret as well as Alayna from unity it won't be a very fun livestream so make sure you add the day to your calendar in order to build something awesome there's almost a chance to win some community swag so here I took that nice fps as a starting point and I built upon it here you can see the entire level in the editor we start off at the helicopter when here keep going through here and as you can see a bunch of enemies already placed a bunch of worn aides there and there's a door and a key over here a weapon pickup then we go through the elevator and over here the nice shield and all the way here in the end we have the turret boss alright so let's start playing through the game and I'll talk about all the features and mechanics that I added ok here is the starting point we start off on our helicopter and after a while the door opens and the color turns green and you can see the objective we need to recover the microchip over here we have a nice mission briefing so it showcases our goal which is on the enemy bus turret which is our final boss fight the way this is working is a simple render texture and over here I have a camera just flying around and it's rendering onto this ok so that's our goal now let's begin so we can just out here look at the home level so you can see the boss in there the third level there 2nd level and there it's where we start so now I can jump out and as I jump out there you go I go straight into the landing zone and there we have some nice particle effects the drop is handled through code so we make sure that whenever we jump we always land on our landing position ok we start off with a very basic lesson this is the default weapon on the FPS micro game and here we can move into the first area and there you go there's an enemy in there and another one running over there and there you go he spotted me this is a very quick micro enemy so he moves very fast but dies very easily and there is the foam enemy now as we press through here we can see a nice red door and over here another enemy's you can shoot them and in here we have a nice deterrent message so here let's press G to look at the UN aid and there's an enamine there press G and there you go there goes the grenade and after a while it explodes and causes area of effect damage so let's try to hit that one over there and shoot this one and there he is and throw the grenade after a while it explodes and there you took him out right so those are some very simple grenades it's essentially just a rigid body being thrown with the script that explodes after a certain amount of time so we take out all the enemies and now here in the corner you can see a nice wall with this nice crack texture this is meant to indicate that hidden destructible wall so if we shoot it we can get access to a nice sitting area so there you go and we have some more grenades and over here we have our nice key so we can pick it up as you can see the key is on item being nicely animated so pick it up and there you go that's in the UI so we are currently holding our key no let's go into the door and when we approach the door there you go it plays a nice animation and the door opens all right great now let's go through here and over here we have another weapon so we move it and we pick it up and that's the rocket launcher as the name implies this fires some slowmoving rockets that explode on contact and have an area of effect damage there you go that one tasty I always love rocket launchers so when doing a FPS micro game I have to a minute now there we have a nice turret so let's take them out then in here we have another enemy so we can use the nice flash damage and it's very nice alright so as he dies he drops a nice blue King so we can now pick it up approach the blue door and it plays the animation and opens a nice door now inside we have another weapon this is a nice rail gun so this is pretty much a sniper rifle so we can zoom in very far and fire the weapon and land exactly on the target position so whereas the others are projectile weapons this is a hitscan weapon then in here we have a nice elevator so as we go in it starts playing and there you go it starts moving up and we can see that we are indeed moving up and after a while we reach the knee level so here we have a bunch of enemies waiting for us and let's try to shoot them and these small ones are our best animal with a nice splash damage and just take them all out just like that they're right over there you can see something really interesting there is a turret inside a very nice shield and if I try to shoot I cannot shoot through the shield but there you go he sees me and he can shoot me I made this nice shield effect in shade of grass and it looks really cool so see tuned for a tutorial on how to make it as you can see he can shoot me but I cannot shoot him so I need to destroy the shield and here on the floor you can see some power lines coming off of the shield and they are connecting to this thing and this is meant to be a transformer so we can shoot it we destroy it and when we destroy it you can see that the powerlines vanished so with that power line of wine we can now look and see that there's another one going through here so let's follow and see where this lands and in here we have a nice pickup and if we move in there you go we have captured our hook shot so this is a really cool mechanic that took me quite a while to make right so we press F and there you go it fires something and it tells me towards it this is a really fun mechanic to play with so I can go I can jump in me there and keep the momentum and there you go it looks very nice almost kind of like Spider Man so there you go just fire it and go through and there's an enemy in there so I can go and I can fire in the air and now I fallen off the map so I can go and there you go okay great so as you can see a very nice interesting mechanic so this will be very useful for the final boss fight as you will see and here just take out these enemies so with them down now I can take out the last transformer there go the power line is offline and now look yep there you go he is no one protected by a shield so with the shield gone we can now easily take him out that for some Rockets there you go he's gone okay great over here in the corner we can also see this and picked up some more grenades now let's pick up the purple key open the purple door and there you go we now have access into our very nice boss fight so let's go into it okay we go in make sure we have full health and there you go he starts shooting right away but luckily we have some nice colors that we can use in order to take cover and after dealing and update there you go the shield has been spun as well as some enemies so we can all longer damage him we now need to destroy all the transformers however since this whole thing is encasing last we can use the very nice hook shot in order to move and slide around so I can go here get fire there and this whole movement feels very nice very satisfying and there's another one and there yo now he's available and I'm gonna shoot them and there you go we have reached the next stage of the boss fight and this is actually quite hectic in quite we don't they keep talking and play at the same time so let's see if I can make it now we are on the final stage the enemies are still being spawned we also have some grenades being spawned talent to player and they also drop some home and there you go I took him out with a nice grenade so as he saw once he went down all the minions went down with him all right so that was quite stressful but also quite fun the hook shot works really well in order to combine it with a nice rocket launcher so I can fire and I can keep going keep jumping around as he saw it's a very interesting bus fight so wear them down as you can see he dropped the nice microchip which is our current objective so we can go pick it up and there you go now we have the final objective we need to leave with a microchip so let's go and over there we can see the nice helicopter in order to leave this area so let's go into it jump inside any of there you go we have completed our mission objectives completed awesome so here you saw the entire game I've built starting from the FPS micro game as you saw the game has quite a bunch of interesting features the mission briefing displays inside the helicopter and jumping down into the landing zone to start on level the superfast mini enemies to unique weapons plus the grenades a nice elevator the awesome shield effect connected to the Transformers the hook shot which films great to use and the final boss fight with multiple stages if you'd like to see a tutorial on any of these specific features please post it in the comments of those combined to make this very nice game you can go down to your own FPS game by using the micro game as a base just go to the unity up open up the learn tab and start modifying the micro game you can very quickly play around without the premade prefabs and build some really interesting levels and make your own weapons and enemies so give it a shot and see what you can build also next month there won't be a very nice livestream game jam using the FPS micro game as a base it will be on November 24 and it will be hosted by Android from mixing jam alongside myself and couch ferret as well as elena from unity it won't be a very fun livestream so make sure you add the day to your calendar in order to build something awesome there's almost a chance to win some unity swag
