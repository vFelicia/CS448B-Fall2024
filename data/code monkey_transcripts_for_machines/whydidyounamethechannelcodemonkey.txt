find the name of the channel and Code Monkey I always like the term Code Monkey even though technically it's supposed to be kind of a negative but I always found it was pretty fun so yeah when I actually wanted to name my my game Studio I wanted to name it that but there was already uh developer called Code Monkey so I couldn't use it for my game Studio but when it came time to making it for this YouTube channel for this one I decided hey why don't I go back to that to that idea that I had previously and yep there's also a song called Code Monkey which is almost so pretty fun
