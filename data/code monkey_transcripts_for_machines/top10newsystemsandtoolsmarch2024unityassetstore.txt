always there's links to the ass in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10% off your order by the way quick mention I just updated the companion project for my C course I added about 50 new exercises in the intermediate section and if you need a b with Gorgeous low ply visuals check out the cinti bundle all kinds of assets to do all kinds of games for just 25 bucks and this one is ending really soon so if you want to get it quickly and there's another bundle for just 15 bucks you get tons of tools a bunch of visuals and so on and this one is also ending in two days so definitely get it quickly check out everything with the links in the description all right so starting off with a fun one a door system this one reminds me of the fun meme where some kind of Dev wants to implement the door in their game something that seems quite a simple task and soon enough they have a million things they need to do in order to make a simple door work and this asset is kind of showing exactly that it's a door system with a mountain of customization you can build all kinds of doors you can build rotating hinge doors sliding doors garage doors you can modify where we want to place the door pivot you can animate the opening and closing by modifying the position XY Z or some kind of rotation he can automatically detect when the player's in range and do a ton of stuff in the custom editor so this one really is a great example of how some tasks in Game Dev seem quite simple but in reality they actually have a ton of complexity next if you'd like to make game with lots of of movement interactions check out this system it's for handling all of your animations that have to do with movement making it look really seamless to Vault over a wall climb something or do a finisher move it looks really quite impressive the demo looks extremely natural with no jerky motion or sliding between each animation everything looks really perfect this works with any animation so including custom humanoid or generic animations either in place or with root motion this is a really very impressive asset if you have a game that is character based with lots of animations then this could help add that extra of Polish then if you were disappointed with the final release of skull and bones and if you'd like to make your own check out this naval battle kit you can controlly ship on the Open Seas you can sail around and explore or go into battle with some enemy AI ships the Ocean looks really gorgeous it's got some really high quality very realistic waves and the boats all have the correct buoyancy so just the Water by itself would be a great asset this one works on both PC and mobile if you just took this and then you got some Vision assets for some islands and a bunch more ships then this would be a really create starting point for some kind of pirate or trading game and then for a simple one that does one thing and does it extremely well here is the button animator Pro like name implies this helps you animate buttons that's it the custom editor looks really powerful very detailed there's lots of options for all kinds of events and actions you can easily add logic like making a button change color on Mouse over or change the scale on click then you can very easily copy paste the exact same behavior across multiple buttons adding some tiny animations to your clickable buttons is a super easy way to make your game look look a lot more polished so you should definitely use some kind of asset just like this one next if you want to build some kind of paths or objects on a grid then check out path Grid it's pretty simple it helps you build Road networks or pipes or Bridges really any kind of object on top of a grid the visuals adapt to the mesh underneath so this works great on top of the rins or other nonflat meshes this is one of those assets where if you wanted you could build it yourself for example if you follow my grid system tutorial videos if you do that you will be able to build this or if you just want to save some time you can simply buy this prebuilt that'sa then here's a fun very specific one called cooking tulit you place down an object with a virtual collider box to den note the heat area then you can grab some hamburgers and place them on top to start cooking the objects have different states and they can seamlessly transition from uncooked to cooked to burned it also tracks cooking either uniformly kind of like a stove or just on one side like a pan so you can cook and flip around then you can also slice your food you can deep fry it in some liquid and really just view all these stats definitely this is a very strange very Niche asset but if You' like to make some kind of cooking game like perhaps some kind of VR cooking simulator then this would be a really great starting point next if you'd like to take some object that you have in real life and scanning into your game if so then here's an asset to help you do that you just grab your iPhone point at the object and select the area then just walk around the object very slowly the model is scanned piece by piece and in the end you have a pretty high quality model the mesh on the corners still doesn't look a little bit too sharp but the textures especially they look really great this is probably the best result that I've seen from any kind of app just like this the only limitation is how sadly it only works on iOS not Android makes me wonder if that's some kind of limitation in the sensor API or really just the fact that iPhones can sense up but most Androids can't then here's a bundle with a bunch of tools basically if you want to paint your objects and this includes three tools to paint it you can paint in 3D in 2D or just in the editor this kind of tool that is really great for fixing or slightly modifying some premade assets doing that can help make them quite a bit more unique or you can just give the player access to this tool in order to paint their car or their character or their home player customization is always a plus and with this it's pretty easy to implement in your game so this is a great asset to try out next if you like to make a card game here's a complete template to help you get started the game itself is kind of like heart zone so you have cards and creatures or Heroes on the board then each card has different stats that has all kinds of skills and those skills actually come with some great looking animations and effects and of course you can then extend with your own cards draw the cards Define some behaviors and create some kind of awesome effect this one is also ready for multiplayer with Lobby support and connection using Photon it also works on both PC Mobile and console and then if you have tons of Sprites in your game and you want to improve the performance check out this one basically this takes a ton of nonmoving Sprites and baks them all into a single mesh just a single drwall which in turn improves performance quite a bit even when compared to the builtin batching you can combine Sprites with different textures colors materials and so on so this is an example of a simple very specialized tool that does one thing and does it very well all right so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unts store for March 24 there's links to all in
