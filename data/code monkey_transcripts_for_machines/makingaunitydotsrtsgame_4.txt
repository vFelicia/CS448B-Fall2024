all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great week so far thanks for joining me on this live stream hey hey thanks so much you in a crossa yeah that that would go very well right now I definitely wish I had had a nice crossa around here would be very nice very welcoming so yeah thanks so much uh all right I think levels are good I don't know let me just TR to increase this the max okay I think it's already near the max hopefully that's okay all right what is the people walking on the bottom yep that is actually a it's a Unity window it's a transparent Unity window uh just just set things up a little bit uh on the oh let me just uh where's my controller like that there you go uh my windows here so if you want to know how this all thing down here works it's it's a transparent TT windows so you can go on this page and I've got tutorials down here basically for how I built all this so the whole thing is a transparent TNT window for the characters the way they are animated those are mesh based animations and how it's interacting with YouTube API through an HTTP request from inside unity and these characters the way they are random is how I implemented them the guest spreadsheets in my game battle round Tycoon so if you're curious as to the technical part of all this uh where's the chat where's the chat there's the chat can watch that watch these tutorials and you'll be able to build something just like that song is a little bit loud is it let me just put it down a little bit because it's a bit uh I think the main thing is my microphone is probably a bit too low cuz I'm the goal here is to do a little bit of programming I can't have the microphone too close to here so it has to be a bit further away so I think that is why the that is why the levels are likeus 20 Deb let me just uh can I change that a little bit I go one two here I put the input G like 50 or 60 let me see if that one change uh all right so it seems a little bit higher so hopefully that's a bit better now uh all right okay yeah I hope you're all doing well today on this random what is it Tuesday Wednesday I don't even know what day today is what is it is it okay it's weddingday yeah I'm a bit lost but sure yeah hey Brazil hey how's it going all right okay so yeah basically I've been doing research on my on my little RTS game so I've got a bunch of stuff that I still need to do so I figured might as well do it on live stream answer some questions some things like that so hopefully it should be interesting already got a little bit uh implemented although the main thing is more uh the main tricky part so far on my research is figuring out what parts to do in dots and what parts to not do in dots what parts to do in just regular monob behaviors so that has been definitely an uh an interesting process so far uh basically in the beginning I was making almost all of it inside of dots like for example the unit selection manager so I was handling like selection of the units I was doing this in a regular dot system but now after after trying it out for a while I figured it makes more sense to just have a regular mod Behavior so just some basic code and then this regular amount of behavior that interacts with the en world and does all kinds of things in order to select the select the unit so so yeah basically on my research Pro process it has been sort of like that just about trying all kinds of things and figuring out what works well as part dots and what works well as just a normal mon Behavior game object is this a network game or using netcut for Dots nope this is going to be just a a single player game I mean I might do then a followup on on multiplayer but uh so far the goal for this one is just a standard single player game using using uh dots basically I've wanted to research how to make a complete Game using dots for quite a long time and now that finally Unity 6 is here and is definitely fully stable to be used I think now is the perfect time to actually try to try to do that hey so thanks again for you and another Super Chat hey King spray thanks for all the great work you do for you to come in Ah that's awesome hey thank you all so much for being here and watching the videos following the channel I really hope all the videos have helped you out a lot on your own Learning Journey I mean the goal is I make the videos sharing what I know so that you can learn things too so that you can then apply all those learnings to do all kinds of interesting game design ideas you have in your mind so that's kind of that's kind of my goal with this channel So yeah thank you all so much for watching and I hope it has been quite useful to all of you stuck on 2D farming can you please just not spam just ask question once and I'll try to help I have no idea what you mean by 2D farming system there's like a million ways to do that so my advice to you when trying to fix any kind of problem the first thing is figuring out how to break that problem apart into multiple pieces and try to solve the each of those problems one by one CU if you try to solve them all all at once it is probably going to be very mess so the first thing I would do split that figure out what exactly you're stuck with in that farming system that great system and then try to yep there's a million ways to solve pretty much anything so yeah how didn't make the Game Dev news episode I sat down on a chair with a green screen behind me I read the script using a talent perameter read it onto a camera and then did a bunch of editing so the answer to how it's actually relatively simple simple but it takes quite a lot of work that is actually in terms of editing that is actually a very uh a very tricky video format to do so okay so let me do just a little bit of work and then I'll answer some more questions so the one thing that I want to do was I want to convert this unit visual system into something that is uh not ECS based so something that is just a regular uh game object so let me do that so instead of having my unit visual system let's create a regular amount of behavior for the unit visual manager so let's try doing this actually the characters down here kind of kind of screws up my UI just in case you don't know I'm actually seeing all these characters these are actually on the bottom of my screen it's not just an overlay so yeah sometimes makes it a little bit uh tricky in order to uh in order to be able to see things down here guess Portugal accent yep I am uh I am from Portugal I am in Portugal so yep that is why my accent is probably a little bit strange uh okay so let me do the unit visual manager so for this one I actually don't think I need any references to anything so let me just add that one set that one and so what do I have to do on this one so I'm basally going to do the exact same thing as on this one so I'm going to have to listen to the other one so let's do a start go to the unit selection manager on the instance and I got to listen to when those change so the unit selection manager so when the units change yeah pretty much just got to run the exact same code so actually converting this one from dots into non dos should be very simple it should be literally just like this yeah so actually this one is pretty simple let's just see if this works where's my pen my pen is gone where' my pen go did I lose my pen oh crap oh there it is all right later kitchen chaos course yesterday oh that's awesome hey congrats on reaching the end I hope you I hope you learned a lot by doing that so yeah that was a that was a fun one to make so I hope you'll learn a lot okay so let's see so yep I can select just these just this one and the selection logic works and again the the selection itself is actually in uh these are entities but the manager system that one is a mon Behavior so that is kind of how I'm managing things but if I select all of these These are entities these are all inside an entity subscene and inside they were built with regular game objects regular things and yeah actually working with the the uh mixed uh hybrid mode is actually coming along quite nice what say that choose dots versus Mon behavior that is something that I'm learning by myself as I'm doing research for this course but the conclusion that I'm coming to is basically if it is something something that involves lots of units lots of lots of iteration if it's something that is going to run constantly like for example the code for moving the units that that makes sense to be dots code but if it is something that happens just once like for example the management for selecting the units for handling which units are select which ones aren't so the code that manages all this logic that one makes more sense to be just a regular mono Behavior so that is kind of the logic that that I'm going for for things that imple for things that work Logic on multiple units multiple elements for that do it in dots for things that exist pretty much just one for all kinds of manager systems and so on just make it regular am Behavior so that's kind of the rough idea that I'm going for but like I said this is research so I don't know if I'm going to come up with uh a different perspective in the future but so far that is what is making quite a bit of sense so all right so so these are indeed working now I very much want to I want to be able to click to select the unit because I actually still got a slight issue right here because if I right now if I click it works but it only works if I click on the bottom because it's all based on doing a physics quering so if you're curious as to how the unit selection Works here's my unit selection manager again just a regular amount of behavior and from this one I am interacting with the physics with the with the en's world so I'm basically just going to the world in order to grab the enti manager then from there I construct an NT query in order to find all the units with Target position unit and the selected and then I B basically just grab all of those in order to give them the target position and then for actually selecting them so that's that's for the movement so basically when I right click it tells them where to go and then for the uh movement I basically uh get a click for position a release worm position in order to calculate the square that defines what area I want to select and then for actually selecting things I'm doing some dots physics so basically going inside the anti manager get get the physics World Singleton then from that one grab the Collision world uh construct an array construct a fil for the things and then just do a simple overlap box so the one thing is that when dots things are indeed quite a bit more complex uh because so in physic in normal uh thing you just do just go inside physics and do overlap box just like this and it works whereas in ECS World in dots World you've got to First grab the physics World signon in order to grab the Collision world you have to prepare some native lists you have to prepare the Collision filter in order to finally do the overlap box so in terms of dots it does still have quite a quite a bit more more setup quite a bit more things that need to be done so it's not quite as simple but in the end it does work quite well so it leads so it requires quite a bit more code but in terms of logic it is also uh relatively straightforward so hopefully this should be hopefully uh uh the video that I will eventually make will hopefully be very good for learning since I'm basically going through all the all the trouble of doing all research figuring out it took me quite a while to figure out how to do how to do cast overlap box and all this so hopefully on the final video you can basically skip ahead all of the uh frustration that I had in figuring out a bunch of these things so hopefully the final video won't be really nice okay so let's let this out and thanks again King spray for the Super Chat and Sh again coffee overd those that would be nice overd those is not nice ea uh drinking a little bit for fun that sounds good but yeah all within moderation okay so let's see so I dis select all units and now it's over here that I wanted to do a so I was actually researching for it so basically going here on the documentation which by the way uh a bunch of you have asked me on comments in my videos about how do I research things when there are no video tutorials and well this is the answer I visually go onto the official docs official manuals I try to read a bunch of things I try to read all the code examples and eventually I write a bunch of Code test out see what works what doesn't work and then everything works like that so but anyways I actually don't think that I need to do anything different cuz I think I just go inside the Collision world except instead of doing an overlap box I just do a cast Ray yep now this one takes a rcast input now what is a rast input uh apparently takes a start and end and then has a filter so let me do the rcast input for the rcast input let me do a brand new rcast input and now inside so I've got start that is going to be the start position uh is that no it's not okay a crap so now that's actually annoying because I I wasn't quite thinking about ah I got to remember H how that thing works camera. Main in order to get the uh the screen Point array I think that's it I never like using these these uh raycast things in order to calculate the Ray and I but I think like that I should be able to then do it what's difficulty curve using dots well I'm basically going through myself and some things are relatively straightforward if you want to do something basic it is actually super simple but if you want to do things that are more complex then yeah like in this example here doing a physics query in dots is quite a bit more complex than doing uh physics query in non dots so yeah there definitely takes quite a bit uh quite a bit of learning how things are done differently but once you figure out how things are done differently then they are not is there a name Collision there is so this inside Unity engine. Ray and I assume from this R can I get the start position no I can't oh I can get the point okay cuz I'm trying to figure out how do I get the the start point for this one I think like this it might work so basically this is going to get me the point so I think like this it might work and then the end point well I guess I guess what is the end point let me see X over here it says the aray from the aray to and so on hey a new new member hey thanks so much Tessy hey and by the way for all of you who are uh channel members or patreon supporters uh check the uh the videos or the messages on the members tab so you can get access to the private Discord and the private live streams that I do every Saturday so just in case you want to join those go ahead so uh okay so basically over here so for the start Point let me start for the end point well I guess maybe if I get end with some huge number maybe that will work and then it's got the filter so that is going to be the Collision filter okay so let's see if like this this rcast input does work and then this going to output something but for now let me just do a debug. log on this guy right here so let's see if this one has should have to transformation helpers uh yeah cuz the main thing is converting the what is the start point with the ray does ray. origin exist Ray dot oh it does all right thank you okay so that's good so that one actually probably makes more sense to have the ray. origin RTS like mobile Legends I don't know mobile Legends uh it's like um uh games like Age of Empires Command and Conquer Red Alert Starcraft uh those kinds of things so Company of Heroes yeah uh okay so basically is giving me false oh cuz that one oh right I I was I was thinking it was going to hit this one but this plane this is just a regular game object meaning this guy does not exist in the actual uh in the actual dots physics world so that makes sense that's why clicking over here is returning false but now if I click on top one of these units yep now that one does return to all right awesome so let me just actually edit cuz I'm pretty sure the collider isn't perfect when using camera main is still find the camera at run time can you elaborate on this time that was the previous thing previously when you used uh camera. main you were you were supposed to cash this one because every time he did this he was constantly doing a fine so doing this one on every single update it was a terrial thing but I don't know like two or three Unity versions ago they automatically handle the caching on the back end so nowadays you don't necessarily need to cash it you you can do it if you want to but yeah there's no no performance benefit so even if you are on some kind of update you can use camera. Main in the background it won be cach so it is no longer going to be a massive a massive performance uh drop like it was uh back in the day cuz yeah quite a while ago quite a few versions ago that was indeed one of the main ways that a lot of people had a lot of issues why can't I see the button authoring uh cuz a lot of people had a lot of issues with terrible performance indeed because of that because the camera. main was so insanely slow but thankfully now Unity cash isn't in the background so nowadays you don't have those issues okay so let's go so now that one is quite a bit better so now I should be able to click on it and see that hey Timo Jones how's it going hey and by the way for all of you if you're seeing all the nice custom characters you can also customize your characters so on the same place where I uh talked a while ago about all these tutorial links you can go there and follow the follow the guide or follow the video tutorial I guess you can just ah you can just watch your video tutorial if you want to customize your own character with either just modified or use a custom spring sheeet like that little nice ringman and this little nice guy over here so that should be fun okay uh right so over here I think it is working so I click on emptiness it's got false and I click on top of the unit and I got true let me just make sure that I am that I am uh getting it correctly okay so this one casts the Ray and this one just returns if the ray actually hits something hey thanks so much I'm glad my I'm glad my videos have helped you yeah I hope you're all also having a great day okay so this one is just yeah let me use one of the other versions cuz I want to be able to do something uh do I just want the closest hit I guess so yeah I guess I don't want to get all of them just one of them would work fine so let me get out what is this rast hit but it's a rast hit from unity. physics for the closest hit closest rast hit okay so on this one does this one have an entity it does so let me do a debug down log in order to verify this entity just to verify that it is the one indeed that I hit let's try and let's see thanks for on the help yeah awesome of course um have a question about managers within Unity usually you want to access Managers from multiple scripts you recommend making a static instance of these manager for example the game manager yep when you have things I mean that's the that's the whole question about using the Singleton pattern which some people have a really biger version to whereas for me I've always seen it it's just a tool sometimes it's a great tool sometimes it's a bad two but at the end of the day it's really just two so if you have something of which you have just a single thing like for example over here for all these systems these have just one so yep I've got a Singleton right here I've got a Singleton instance because there's only ever a single unit selection manager there only one exists so for me that always makes perfect then so single tens can be abused if you make a ton of them and you have tons of connections between all of your scripts and all of them get all messy get all messed up that is not going to be a good thing so definitely avoid abusing singl ton but definitely make sure you do use them because win these correctly they are extremely good so definitely don't avoid use them just because they can be they can uh lead to tons of issues do use them use them correctly and hopefully it helps more than it hurts uh okay so let me see so if I click on this guy right here what is this one uh oh cuz it's behind the let me click on this one and it's telling me that this guy's unit 169 is that correct let me see uh put it on runtime and yep that one is indeed 169 okay great great all right so that is working that is cool we charge my credit card from Google couldn't trace it back oh really that's interesting I wonder how it how it uh what kind of name does Google use but yeah uh all right so yeah that one is working so now let me just use this logic in order to actually select just a single unit and let me also out that one he Super Chat hey uh thank you so much a heck should I study tomorrow's my class 10 exam yeah definitely go study definitely uh exams are definitely much more important than watching some live streams so yeah I would say watch a little bit and then go study uh cuz studying is definitely definitely very important definitely make sure you pay attention to your own education so you can learn a lot so you can get a ton of knowledge to build tons of things so obviously as you might guess I'm a big fan of education so definitely make sure you do study okay so let me see because I want to make sure that I only select a single unit if basically the player is not doing a square if the player is doing a square I want to select all units within that square but if they only click once then I basically just want to do rast so the logic for doing either rast or not so I do the select I do things but order to do this so B select single unit and basically the way that I'm going to Define that is if the distance so uh Vector 3 mes drag uh Mouse drag distance it's not really distance Mouse drag Vector that makes more sense uh let me take the oh actually no yeah because I've already got the half extend so I can probably use that so have extends that magnitude uh so if this one is above I don't know like uh so select single unit if this one is less than say one unit so if my selection square is less than one unit then basically just going to Ray cast just select one and if not then do that so now if select a single unit if so then I'm going to do the recast logic and if not then I'm going to select multiple units and either way need to do that so up here select multiple units okay so hopefully that should work so basally that does that selects that one and now I really just need to check the unit if that one has a a if it has a unit component if so then select it if not then don't select all right so that should be about it that should be working live to say that I'm from Portugal and I'm loving your cont oh nice just start learning games oh that's awesome hey I'm glad I'm glad the videos have helped you yeah definitely best of luck with your Learning Journey uh okay so let me see if this is working so click on that one okay no why why did you not work it's only it's still okay let me do log on that one some select unit cuz that one I think that makes sense do this guy right here and then this guy right here just print out this to see what it is doing someone trying to inject some JavaScript yeah that is not going to work uh although there was an exploit uh it was able to uh place things with different kinds of uh if you watch my first live stream which I believe the video is still live and uh I believe you can still find it basically a bunch of people were putting uh size tags directly inside their message which then over here since this is using text mes Pro he was using that in order to make in order to make the text on on thing super huge so yeah back on the first live stream it quickly it Qui uh went into chaos with people making tons of messages super huge so I couldn't see anything on screen there were just giant messages with a font of like 500 so yeah that was a a fun exploit that people found right away so that was that was quite interesting okay why is this one always one is that one normalized oh never mind no it's not normalized but I think it has a y of one so that is probably why so let me try well let me actually just try to come up what can I so if I just click it's going to be just one and if I click and drag actually it doesn't I thought it would right cuz cuz the Y is actually messing up so uh so uh let me get the vector three for the drag Vector so that is going to be the half extent but then I take that guy I set the Y into zerf and that way it should work a little bit better so now if if I print out magnitude on this one now it should make more sense hey L man hey how's it going how are the the issues with the uh making networked fireworks I know you I've seen a bunch of those uh videos on on Twitter hope it's going well cuz yeah handling fireworks in multiplayer all those particles all those things that definitely sounds quite challenging um and yeah there you go the logic is working so I can click individually on each unit select move them around or I can select all of them I just need to make sure to let go like that and yep that does work solve the NGO update well ah nice yeah I mean I've seen there where I've actually want to uh go and do some research on the latest net code packages I've read the change log and does seem uh there are some interesting things like merging the various rpcs so yeah definitely would like to have some time to go and uh research those those new uh new changes that should be interesting you run into performance straps working with dots I've had issues with unit finding targets using overlap spheres and checking team tags uh not yet but I've only done uh a little bit of research so I haven't done anything extreme so I'm curious to see that issues with finding targets using overlap spheres okay I'm curious to see what those what those uh issues were CU yeah that is also definitely what I'm planning to do for for doing defining targets logic I'm going to do the the same thing doing an overlap sphere and trying to find it so yeah I guess if there are issues with that then I will TR doing that the particles Network wise Sol the smart wave with a SE that is shared oh nice that that is smart that is definitely smart sh the share the seed and everyone everyone uh share the seed and everyone runs the same local simulation logic that is definitely definitely very wise very smart my game trct players money by using a script M object the script object is reset the start and is used to read multiple scripts should I make this a Singleton instead uh do you mean you're using a script object for read and write personally that is something that I advise against just because it has a bunch of issues that you might not know about so I made a video on that on why you should be careful with script ball objects and basically the thing is how in the editor they work one way they work as persistent data but if you then make a Bild they do not work as persistent data so if you're using script objects for read and write access if so definitely be aware of this limitation and the same time a bunch of people in the comments in those videos uh mention some interesting points so I made the followup so definitely do watch these two videos if you're doing that personally I do not I do not uh like using scripal objects for read and write access I normally just use them as read only things so yeah personally I would not use them for read right but technically you can do and if you using it for read write and yeah maybe using a regular Singleton manager maybe that might make quite a bit more sense okay so let me let me try doing uh something a little bit okay so basally like this I've got that one and now what I want to do is I want to be able when I right click I want to be able okay so this one just tells me the movement now i' be able to see that I right click on top of an enemy so for that I'm going to have to use pretty much all of the same logic obviously in the future I'm going to refactor all this code so just something to keep in mind as you're watching me work live keep in mind this is how I write the code uh piece by piece but obviously what am I missing the uh not the right wait do I need the right no I do need the right uh right yeah okay so basically now I want to figure out if I hit an enemy did I already tag that enemy I don't know that I did then yeah thanks so much for becoming a channel member okay so let me put son authoring the enemy authoring script okay I already have an enemy component so over here is an enemy and this guy is going to have the component for the enemy okay so this one is if I right click on enemy so debug. log attacking enemy so let's see that so if I right click on top of an enemy it should actually say that I'm right clicking on top of an enemy off to work now it's G to have time for me yeah definitely see you have a great great time working on the game best of luck uh RTS course live w't that be record yeah there won't be recorded videos I mean this I'm basically just doing research and I figured might as well build the prototype for research over here on live stream instead of thing but yeah the the uh video lectures will be standard normal video lectures and so on does RTS stand for it stands for realtime strategy so games like command conquer Age of Empires and so on so all those kinds of games okay uh so yep this one is indeed working and now here comes the interesting bit because I want to be able to tell the selected units where to attack so um uh do I put this inside a trying to figure out uh ball is attacking enemy probably makes more sense to separate this but I'll I'll sort this out not let stor gate isn't that the one from the dev like Starcraft we're working on that looked interesting so I have no idea what happened to that one it's been it's been a while wasn't that one like summer game Fest of last year I haven't seen it in a while okay so let me need this guy right here so if you are not attacking enemy oh crap so if not attacking the enemy if not then I move if I am attacking the enemy then I don't do that you find dots in terms of learning card uh so far it's pretty interesting I mean definitely got to do a lot of Googling reading the manual and so on so uh definitely has a learning curve but honestly just learning the things and yeah there you go this does work say for examp learning how to do ray cast physics cast box cast learning how to do all these physics queries that take quite a bit of researching reading all documentation all the things but yeah after a while I managed to get this super basic scene in just a handful of hours so yeah there is a learning curve but it does uh it does actually work pretty well decently why do the entities shake a bit when they're idle that is simply because they they have a Target and they're constantly going to that Target I didn't Implement any kind of uh stopping logic so basically they keep moving to the Target they get there and they constantly jump forward back and forth between the targets so that is why they are shaking because they because they get there then they jump over to the other side and move back and so on so on so on so yeah that is that is basically why uh okay so basically I can click on attacking the enemy and now the question is how do I set the enemy Target so now this is the kind of thing that during research requires quite a bit of quite a bit of thinking in terms of figuring out okay how do I organize this in terms of data debug L to print yeah yeah that's uh that's an interesting one for me I'm so used to writing debug.log that I just write that constantly without even thinking about it uh okay so let me think how do I make a targeting system for this actually I had the target position uh what do I call it I don't know uh maybe a just do enemy Target no Target enemy I think makes more sense authoring so I make this authoring component now on this one uh basically I'm going to have a public stroke for the Target enemy and this one is going to be I component data so this the target enemy and inside I want to have an entity or an enemy I think an entity so Target entity so I guess doesn't necessarily need to be a Target enemy so putting a baker class Baker Target and authoring and just like this Implement that one so basically over here entity entity equals get the entity and get the entity uh this one is going to need to move so Dynamic and then just add the component on this en new Target enemy just like this put it nice and empty cuz there is an empty entity right let me let me see uh wasn't there I thought there was okay I think that's it I can compare with the null entity in order to see if this one has has something or not okay so let's see so basically with this I can set the target enemy so then over here on the unit selection on this one when I right click on top of attacking an enemy I can basically go through I think it's this array yeah exactly it's through this array so I go through this array of units that are selected I don't even need the target position I go through these and then I set the new what do I call it Target Enemy new Target enemy and inside for the Target entity it is going to be the uh in put entity for Target enemy entity it's going to be the closest break asset. entity so I've got this one and I'm going to set this one like this all right so let's see if this does work so basically I attach the authoring I make this one and that one should be able and I should be able to right click and all the selected entities should then get the target entity for. score so far I've taken all your courses they are amazing and taught me a ton of stuff which I use every day oh that's awesome that is really cool that is exactly why I make them so I'm glad you have learned quite a lot so yeah thanks so much what was your percentage in class 10 I have uh what is Class 10 is that is that a universal thing I actually don't know I don't know what you mean by percentage uh do you mean like school scores that was let me just add the uh terms of school I was sort of all right I guess depends on the on the topics like in math I was pretty decent in the program class that I had those were obviously excellent so the uh School scoring over here in Portugal goes from 0 to 20 at least in high school so for the programming I had I think it was three programming uh uh different uh studies things and all of those I would always get 20 cuz I I've been programming for a long time so those always got the max score when it was like math I would get like 16 17 and then things like philosophy and Portuguese I would get like 10 so yeah it really depends on the on the topic but yeah varied quite a bit uh okay let me just attach so I want to attach the target enemy authoring hey yeah thanks for being here I hope you've learned a ton uh for Target enemy authoring let me see if like this if I can select some units then set them and if they go over there so let me put this one into runtime and let me see if I can find that one so they target enemy okay that one says no let me just pick one of these let me just separate this guy out so I can click on it and SL selected and this one target enemy okay Target enemy still nothing and now if I right click now I'm still moving that one is still empty and if I right click on that one and there you go it does work it does select the enemy unit and if I select either of these these do not have an enemy selected and nope I have to select them all and if I select just a handful of them let's say select just this one and attack that one and now that one should have an enemy so if I select that one go into that one and see any of that one do have an enemy okay awesome so I can click and select an enemy okay so now I want to spawn some bullets playing for a while and just found out that you're Portuguese yep that is true yeah it's a it's a because it's an English Channel channel that is always an an interesting news for for some people it's always it's always fun um someone asking are you going to go over animations as well that is a very good question I'm not sure what I'm going to do about that topic uh because yeah animations uh Unity ECS right now does not support animations by default so there are a bunch of assets on the store that uh do handle animations and if I was making a commercial game using dots I would definitely be using that but of course if I'm making uh something that is part of the course I don't want the course to be dependent on on buying a third party asset so I'm still not sure what I'm going to do either I Implement some kind of Animation system from scratch within but I don't know depends on how complex that is it definitely wouldn't make much sense to have a course where half the course is like building a custom animation system that would be a bit strange hey ruin hey how's it going um so yeah that would be a bit tricky but if it is simple I might do it on the course or if not I might just see super basic animations like instead of having like humanoid skin mesh renders animations all those kind of things maybe just uh fix animation poses some basic uh just rotation kind of things so yeah I'm still not not entirely sure what option I'm going to go with that is why that is why basically I'm making this prototype in order to do a bunch of research because yeah it's going to be that is an interesting question because yeah in terms of dots animation not having it by default yeah definitely would be awesome if it had by default I'm guessing within the next 12 months hopefully hopefully it should it should have it I mean now that that'ss stable hopefully the next Point as far as I know that's what Unity is focusing on basically get it Sable and then build all kinds of things on top of it so maybe uh one uh one year from now maybe by then there won't be quite a bit more systems I don't know do you call all the time not all the time because I also have to do all kinds of things I have to read the comments answer questions I have to do research on all kinds of things I have to walk my dogs go to the gym do all kinds of things that are nonprogramming but yeah I do spend quite a bit of time programming because it's the thing that I love to do okay so now let's build some nice projectiles cuz I think that should be fun so let's figure out how am I going to do that so first let me actually construct a brand new empty game object call it some kind of bullet and now for this one let me go back into authoring and on the bullet let me go inside and put a sphere just make some kind of visual so let me move the bullet where's the bullet like this make the bullet oh actually I don't think I have some okay let me just uh put over here a new material a crap I really dis like this thing in unity 6 where if I right click on top of the material go up here to create material creat a material variant but I don't want a variant so I got to remember to right click on top of that that is really annoying that is something that I definitely got to get used to it so let me make a bullet material and then going to my bullet over here and also a DOT thing I got to make sure to get rid of the collider this was one of the things that I learned that was quite annoying which is if you have a collider in a child object and then you ineni that entity it is going to ineni it with a flat hierarchy instead of having a child parent relationship so that is that is something that is really annoying took me quite a long time to figure out so that was definitely definitely part of the uh learning process of learning how dots works okay so let me put it like this and put some a mission because a mission is always fun although I'm not sure if I okay I do have a little bit of a mission so some like this and then just make it a little bit smaller so I don't know. five 4.3 okay like this it should be good so I've got a nice bullet right there me dos RTS well the goal for this is indeed to make a DOT scores but not on un me just because un uh un me has a ton of limitations like for example it doesn't support uh free samples of more than like an hour and my goal with this course is going to be have a paid version and then a free version like the first few hours of the course and doing it like that I couldn't do it like that with yud me so I'm not so that is why I'm basically going to do it sort of using the same thing that I was using is that properly available for 2D that is actually a good question that I'm honestly don't know the answer as far as I know the answer is no that Sprite renders are not suppor but if I go up here and I create a 2d object and I create a random Sprite if I do this and now I start playing yep that one is over there and if I look inside the runtime uh not this one the runtime if I look inside the runtime this one does have bunch of of things it does have a Sprite written component so as far as I know uh 2D is not suppor but when I create something over here it does work so I have no idea what is the answer that does seem very strange so that is definitely something that I won't have to research quite a bit but yeah like for example for these selection areas over here I was using just a regular uh Sprite until I remember that technically they are supposedly not supported but apparently they are so anyways that is something that I definitely have to definitely have to figure out so yeah thanks so much for the Super Chat and other ones thanks so much finally please make very series for that for the RTS yep definitely I will that is that is the goal that's why I'm researching so yeah hopefully you will all enjoy this a lot and should be should be really nice uh learning thing for anyone who wants to learn either dots or RTS that should be interesting interest for my questions are your Unity course in the comments uh I'm pretty sure I just answered all the questions like two hours ago when I was entering things so I don't know maybe post again just in case I didn't see it but I'm pretty sure I've seen it so uh okay all right let me do a little bit more work and then I'll answer some more things so first of all is I need a reference that for the thing that I'm going to spawn so for that I've been using this so basically over here for the bullet prefab I spawn all kinds of prefabs then convert them into things looks like Al and go yeah actually that hairstyle was indeed inspired by by Goku so I guess if it is in in white or gray it doesn't look like alining so that that's actually a cool reference uh okay so the entity so this one is for the bullet prefab so I put the building prefab put the bullet prefab and let me just uh so now here comes the question how do I handle the shooting do I make a system just for shooting or do I put them on the moving so these are the kind of questions that I still still have uh issues trying to figure out what is the correct answer but well let me try doing just say uh yeah let's try doing it like that and then I'll try doing the other thing as well so this let me go entities let make a system for the what do I call it unit shooting system something like this so we're going to have a nice system I don't need y un create I don't need destroy so just Val like this okay so for this one so for each and now I'm going to have an entity do I need the entity actually don't think I need the entity but in uh system api. query let's query for what uh query I need no I need the with all the units so actually for the query I just need the target enemy the target enemy with all with all of the units so basically I'm going to cycle through all the units that have that so oh and actually this requires the refer W no R cuz I'm only going to read it so the ref r o for the Target enemy Target enemy and in there I do this okay so if Target enemy dot what did I call didn't I call Target what do I call it Target entity so why is this one not oh cuz I'm inside that one okay value. Target entity if this one is not and I think this is how you check if it is not an empty so if this one does have a Target if so then I'm basically going to want to spawn so go inside the system API uh in order to how do I instantiate is it only through the nty manager this is the one thing that always uh still drives me quite a bit as I'm trying to as I'm trying to figure out all the things is trying to remember what kinds of things exist inside the system API what kind of things exist inside the uh entity manager what kinds of things are through the world and so on so so that has definitely been one of the interesting challenges on learning all this not Super Chat hey video on proceed on generation yeah that is definitely one of the many many topics on my todo list like I literally have uh have almost a thousand uh potential video ideas on my todo list so yeah there are so many things that I would love to cover but figuring out all the time to cover it is actually quite uh quite tricky so but hopefully one day cuz yeah proceeding generation is very uh interesting actually just the other day I think I mentioned on a video recently I don't know on the wave function collapse that is definitely one of the algorithms that I would love to research so if some of you don't know want to do uh uh Precision generation definitely look into wave function collapse because it is a very interesting algorithm basically you've got a grid position a grid uh a cell and in the cell you've got like 10 possible options then you place something and then each of those options have some kind of rule so like this one can only be next to this one this one can only be under this one and so on and according to those rules as soon as you place one position randomly it is going to apply all those rules in order to place all the other points so it's actually uh a very interesting algorithm definitely such something that I very much would like to would like to research okay so I think I have to go to the state. enti manager in in order to create an entity and I'm going to create the entity but for that I'm going to need to okay let me remember how I did it on the building placement manager so I go and set that one and I instantiate it and then I move it so yeah actually pretty simple oh crap uh so the the spawn bullet entity so I'm going to go inside The state. Entity manager oh it's instantiate that is why that is why I wasn't so how did I get the entities reference okay that's how I got it so I need to get but I think over here on this one I can go through the system API in order to get a Singleton get the Singleton of type what did I call it entities references okay so I think this one is going to entities references so I get this one and now from that one I can go inside and grab in this case the bullet prefab so I grab that one and then I go to state no actually in the I think the system API has it in order to set the component data except just set component set of set component data which is a bit strange but okay spawn B entity so I spawn the bullet and then I position the bullet on the same position as this one so let me actually modify this one let me grab the ref arrow for the Target enemy and then a ref Arrow also for the local transform so then over here let me just grab both of those so for down and ref R of the local transform local transform and now from that one yeah I can actually just SP on literally the same isn't it local transform oh right inside that one and that okay so Bas like this if I set an empty it is going to spawn it I don't like this is actually going to be messed up yeah wish I could instantiate myself that would be that would definitely help me uh quite a bit uh okay let me just put a timer here which by the way technically you're not supposed to make timers inside systems that's another thing that is going to be quite interesting uh time. Delta time so let me just so if timer is bigger than zero then return and if not I put timer equals uh 1 second so spawn a bullet every second if it has something so let's see if this does work okay Super Chat thanks so much musky Dev you're a legend bro oh nice we see all this kind of view making games what games does Code Monkey play that is actually a tricky question because I'm always so busy building things that I don't have much time to play things so yeah that is actually trick I mean lately for uh doing research for this I've been playing uh they are Billings actually really awesome game so if some of you don't know I mean I mentioned it in the steam power.com I mentioned the video so if you like rtss then they are Billings it's definitely really awesome it's a really great game with tons and tons of units like literally well not literally billions of units but almost so yeah if you like rtss with tons and tons of units then I can definitely recommend this so yeah it's uh definitely interesting then I'm also a big fan oh that you're not signed in I've never seen this little Banner that's interesting uh I'm also a big fan of factorio I've also spent many many hours on there so yeah Factory games management games so basically the kind of games that I make are also the kind of games that I love to play so another one that I really enjoyed and I really want to get back to is valheim I played it back when it came out and I know it has had tons and tons of updates even though it's definely still in Early Access so yeah this definitely one and it's also it's one that I want to come back to play just for fun but also want to come back to play uh in order to do some research because I think it would be really awesome to make a complete course on making a game like this cuz I think that would be really awesome something that is third person action RPG elements house building system multiplayer all those things I think that would be really cool really awesome so yeah I definitely would like to would like to play it for fun and play it for research in order to make for I think that would be really awesome so yeah as always so many ideas of so many things that I very much would like to do I just need to I just need to find a time machine to be able to do too many things at once that would be okay uh actually I think this is going to be a null reference yep there you go there it is or an argument exception that's interesting I'll bring out an invalid oh that's right cuz entities are not references so that is why it doesn't have that you have donation alerts uh not alerts but I've got this nice little uh thing that shows up if you do a super chat so yeah I don't have any donation like on PayPal or something like that no I don't have that so just over here on YouTube the thing okay so I just need to drag so on the en's reference I need to drag the bullet so let me make the bullet into a pream and then just drag that one on there no that one over there yep okay let's see if this would work only TOS when they I'll be back in gev oh yeah definitely go for it if it is something that you want to do definitely go ahead and do it look at that they are spawning bullets yay it looks so silly so simple but this is the beginning of how something works yeah Target tet targeting gets interesting when you have thousands of units in range yeah I'm I'm very curious to one make this game and two push it to the Limit and see just how far just how far uh dots can be pushed so that should be interesting make this live stream overlay actually have multiple tutorials on that so if you go onto that page right there if you go on to that page and you go down to the bottom you can see so this only thing down here is a transparent Unity window by the way these aren't links so you can click on these in in order to watch the tutorials so this a transparent Unity window then the characters these are mesh based animations the way they they move up and down they walk left and right then in order to interact with YouTube API that's really just doing an HTTP request regly from inside unity and then for the randomization on the characters that's exactly the same thing that I did on the guest spr sheets in unity why they push each other you mean the units over here just because they are literally going to the same point so they're constantly trying to go to the one single point so they're constantly trying to push each other around then as one pushes the other one pushes back and so on so that is why they get like that basically the only thing missing is it needs some kind of uh code to say okay as soon as you've gotten uh close enough if if you can't get any closer stop moving instead of doing what they're doing which is they're constantly trying to get in so they're constantly trying to push each other and they never stop so yeah just needs that little logic in order to make that work where's the place of dots in the future nobody really knows but I would say the best place is in the back end of everything so that even if you're not intentionally using dots in your game if you just have it uh if you just make games by using Game objects everything in the background is going to be using dots so hopefully that is the ultimate goal is get to a point where even if you yourself don't directly use dots or directly use enties or anything like that just by using regular game objects all the back end is going to be much much faster than dot so basically everyone will benefit from that so I heck signal low poly medieval pack for free to make tutorial uh I'm not sure but uh yeah already got tons and tons of assets so that is some that uh usually my issue is more time to make tutorals as opposed to finding the asses for it so yeah uh what was I doing uh the bullet okay so the Bullet needs to know where it's going to go actually the bullet could technically also have the exact same targeting thing right so if I go inside the bullet and on the B did I remove that one I did remove that one I think uh so if I add the target enemy authoring so basically this one is also going to be able to have a Target enemy so I spawn the bullet and then I go into the system API in order to set the components set the component of type Target enemy and on this spawn bullet entity and new Target enemy it's going to be the same one right right yeah so I can just access Target enemy. Val R so it's basically going to receive the exact same enemy and then all I need is really just a system in order to take the bullet and move them left right and so on we play GTA 6 I mean I still haven't played GTA 5 it's quite crazy how I bought it on a steam sale in like 2015 I bought it because I thought okay I'm eventually going to play this so I might as well pick it up and nope I still haven't found the time to play it so yeah definitely looking forward to finally playing that game and eventually playing GTA 6 when it does came out so yeah definitely U cuz yeah I've Loved all of the GTA games those are definitely very fun so definitely would like do okay so let me go into entity mechanized system it's going to be what do I call it like bullet mover system something like this let's do the bullet mover system and I don't need the create I don't need the on Destroy and so on all right so now over here on the on update what am I going to need I'm going to need to grab the bullet grab the UN local transform and just move it towards the target so let me do a for each and I'm going to need local transform which is going to be a ref RW because I'm going to need to move it okay so I need local transform local transform then I'm going to need the refar for the Target enemy in order to figure out where am I going to Target it so Target enemy and I think that's it I think that's it okay so for this in system api. query let's query for a ref RW of local transform and a ref r o of Target enemy just down right yes I think so so so get that one and that one so basally I've got those and then I just get the float three for the move direction that is going to be the target enemy right cuz I got to trying to think about the the target for the thing uh right so I think I need to go into the system API in order to get the component okay I can for local transform I get this one of the target enemy. val. Target entity so I get this one so that's a local transform for the Target local transform so I get this one so the move direction is going to be this one minus the local transform uh this one. position minus that one do position value r o. position okay so basically I get those and I get the move direction that I'm going to move into and can I normalize no that is another thing that drove me crazy for a while is how they are two there's normalized normalized safe I have no idea what is the difference between them I've tried seeing the documentation and I couldn't quite figure it out but I tried using normalized and it was all messed up but normalize save should be good there be a recording Yep this should be recorded So if you check afterwards it should indeed work how to make a replay Sy Min Unity I mean the basic idea is you just have a list of like I mean depends on what you're trying to replay but if you're trying to uh uh say for example the positions that the players move then you basically just have a list of vector 3 and you record okay on frame one the player was on this position frame two was on this position so on so basically on every update you have to record the state that you want to record so for example the player position so on every update you go onto that list you add okay the player was on this position and this and this this and then when you want to play back that demo you basically just go back into the beginning of the list and just grab some kind of player dummy object grab the position apply to that one so the players here then here here and so on so basically you just just save the data that you want to save and and then load thata that you want to load for the reload so yeah so that's one of those things that doing the super basic thing is super basic making something more complex going to be quite a little bit like GT5 with its own video yeah that becomes quite a bit more complex but uh what is the uh what do they call it Unity photo mode Unity has this really awesome package where if you want to do something like that where basically you can pause the game and have control this is more so basically you would have that kind of Replay system then on top of it you would Implement something like this so definitely look into that one if you want to do something like that where you can basically pause the game then control some camera move it around modify all kinds of things take a screenshot record some video and so on so I would definitely start looking into that one we have multiplayer for this course uh so far I'm just focused on single player but afterwards who knows I'm I'm not sure I mean the uh kitchen chaos course that one start as something simple and then I decid to add multiplayer so who knows maybe maybe not but so far for the at least the first iteration just focusing on single player learning how to make it work with with uh dots and so on you have a Discord Community uh actually there is a private Community for channel members and patreon supporters and the only reason why it's private is because I tried once in the past many years ago tried to make a public Discord and it just devolved into chaos like I couldn't be there 24/7 so I couldn't really moderate and tons of Bot tons of people uh joined there and started posting nasty images and all kinds of things so yeah that was really messed up and that is why I had to that is why now as trying doing it uh I did it more of a private thing so it's a much smaller community and sectionally pretty nice so if you are a channel member or patreon supporter check one of the posts on there and it will have the link for that Community okay so let me just how' you learn English the answer is by watching carttoon Network I spent most of my childhood watching that with no subtitles no things so I basically had to had to learn very quickly and and I didn't learn so trying to learn day by day learning each each word each thing eventually I I was able to to watch a cartoons and obviously programming program is in English I've been programming since I was 10 years old so that also helped quite a bit okay so on the uh local transform. value RW because I want to write onto it value RW and basically I'm going to go go inside uh this guy dot now let me read in order to translate so I'm going to want to translate onto this move Direction times need some speed float speed let's put 3F uh times some kind of speed times system api. time. Delta time okay so yeah so the Bullet should be able to fly towards an enemy right right I think that is correct so let me just go ahead and try out and see if this work work is there a romantic song in the background it should be the low five beats which is actually pretty nice usually very soft very calming great uh great kind of music for doing any kind of programming working that is actually really good look at that got an error right away why do I have an error uh The Entity does not exist What entity does not exist okay is this on my own code or I can't read down there I'm just nope okay so this seems like a a Unity bug let me just save okay so that's strange entity does not exist but What entity aend destroyed okay it seems like I found a random Unity bug cuz at least this one there's no the call stack does not come from my own code nope something on the component system group okay let me try just commenting out this one to see if the code is supposedly the thing that is faring the error DT does not exist yeah I've seen this kind of message so many times especially over here in the scene view okay so why does that one oh so maybe maybe it was actually an accurate message related to an error in my code just a terrible error message I think the thing I think the issue is yeah I think the issue might be or no I was going to say I think the issue might be for the what in the world is this running debug that log not that one unit the engine that debug that log let start with unity six months ago your videos have been biggest help that's awesome hey I'm glad the videos have helped you definitely go ahead I hope they help you on your Learning Journey and okay I have no idea why this The Entity does not exist What entity what system. string what are you doing okay first of all I I forgot something here so that is kind of my but also this shouldn't be so basically the issue is over here I'm not targeting just bullets so that is kind of an issue but I still have no idea why that one is saying this message argument out of range is it a Target enemy no because then this wouldn't run on anything that does not have a Target enemy but it should be okay I think maybe the issue is that one so I think I think I found the issue so basically it's see yeah the debug messages over here inside of dots are sometimes very oh look at that hey Andre hey thanks for becoming a channel member uh yeah I think the issue is I think I figured out the issue yeah that's the issue n. okay so basically the issue is that I forgot over here to add the make sure that this query only runs on bullets so basically the target entity this one is set to null because the uh the units they do have this target enemy but the entity in there is set as null so that is why so that is why over here this one is calling uh get component on a null entity and that is why it was throwing an error but this error is very not not helpful argument and I have no idea why it doesn't actually me yeah cuz down here on the stack trace it doesn't actually oh it does well I just didn't see that okay the bullet mover system so it does say yeah that was the issue anyways thankfully that is a super simple fix I just need to make sure to tag the bullet so I'm make a new mon Behavior script bullet authoring and I'm just going to tag this one with the bullet so let me just go up here uh I'm going to have a public struct for bullet it's going to be I component data okay I component that and I don't need anything this one is just a tag so then a public class for a baker class Baker of type bullet authoring and then over here Implement that one and I'm going to get the entity get the entity this one is going to move so like this and entity for that one and then I just add component add component onto this entity and we going to add a new bullet okay so this one now tags the bullet and on this one I'm going to look for things that have a Target enemy the local transform with all with the bullet component okay so now this one is only going to run the bullets and now this one should be working I believe I believe that should be working what keyboard do you have oh uh what is the name of this it's say Logitech what do you call it uh oh God I have no idea oh no I think I got the little overlay thing I think it's the g15 is that it yeah that's it Logitech g15 so that's the thing like that then the Pro Wireless mode the microphone a bluei and then the camera over there is a c922 so basically that's my uh basic setup like that uh okay so is this working let's see if this is indeed working uh okay so now if I go and if I select that one okay it is spawning bullets but oh it's spawning and moving there okay but why are you not moving okay so let's see why they are not moving cuz then go inside of that one doesn't the oh I did not add the tag that is why got to go inside of here and tag it as a bullet bullet authoring so it's got the target enemy it already has transform and it's got the B othering so this one should not work so let's see any that visual bug that just happened that something that I got to figure out how to solve cuz basically as it spawns a bullet it always spawns it for 1 millisecond over here for one frame it renders it on 0 and then renders it over there yeah there you go so now that one is spawning bullets and I can select all of them tell them all to attack and there you go so many bullets and they are not being destroyed so let me look inside the uh entity hierarchy uh or was that entities hurric let's see over there how this one is spawning more and more bullets oh yeah same one frame is yeah I have no idea I think I think the answer so that problem is going to be over here on the systems so I think the answer is it has to make sure to run before the rendering but at the same time that doesn't makes sense because because I'm uh both spawning and then moving the Bonet right away so I'm spawning it and then I'm setting the Lo trans so I have no idea why that one is why that one is rendering for one frame down here and then moves there I have no idea that is definitely very strange pulling still thing with dots I don't think so I mean technically you can have some kind of pulling system you can create multiple entities and then reuse them but the main goal with dots is really how it's super easy in order to uh create and destroy all kinds of objects so this one is probably on the on how many well that one is taking why is that one taking so long I have no idea uh but yeah in dots spawning things is so 340 really that many that bullets that's uh interesting uh so yeah spawning and destroying entities it should be relatively simple can Define the position in intiation good question I don't think so can intiate the output entities no these are just the thing so you can spawn multiple entities instead of just one so nope you can't set the position directly on there so you have to spawn it then you have to move it but yeah I have no idea why this one isn't uh doing it like the oh crap uh why that one isn't why that one is spawning in just one position for one frame I have no idea why so I'll have to figure that out but anyway so yeah over here it is indeed working spawning tons of En okay now let's make sure to destroy those entities when they do reach there so if I go inside my B mover system and over here just check the distance so if the uh does math have distance math do distance it does have or I guess distance Square would make probably more sense uh between the uh this one this local transform do value r. position between this position and the target local transform. position so if the distance is within like I don't know uh 1 F that's probably too much let's put it 2 F something like this then I'll figure it out so hold for destroy distance put it on 2f ah crap 2f and and so if it is within that one then I have to destroy it now let's figure out how do I destroy say the workflow is like compared to game objects I mean considering how a lot of it is literally the same so like for defining what is a unit what is a bond and so on I'm using just the regular uh game object components like over here I'm attaching normal game object components I'm using a normal rigid body component normal box letter and so on so considering that it's actually a lot of the workflow is actually very similar cuz for the most part I'm working with game objects which then gets baked into all kinds of uh entities with entity components and all kinds of things so the workflow is actually relatively straightforward so far the biggest the biggest difficulty is in learning how to have a different mindset and trying to think about what should be a system how many systems should I have that do different things and what things should be do systems as opposed to just monob Behavior systems so like in the beginning I was making everything in dots but then I figured out like over here for examp the unit selection manager this one isn't really a performance critical kind of thing I just have one unit selection manager that manages the selection of the various units so for that one it makes more sense to just make it in mon behavior and just use regular code and then when I want to select the uh the entities then I can interract with the dots world so that that has been the the main thing is trying to figure out what should be an entity and what should be a mon behavior that is actually that has been the biggest challenge but in terms of workflow it's actually been surprisingly easy uh Photon Fusion to nope the only the only uh networking stack I've used is net for game objects which works pretty well but all of those are very good so if you use uh Photon if you use fishnet and so on those are all uh as far as I know those are all very good so you can't really go wrong with any of those so yeah okay let me just uh stop the um the the B mover system okay once it gets let me destroy it now how do I destroy it is it through the system AP II destroy entity nope I'm guessing it's going to be from this guy. entity manager destroy entity that is probably going to be it this R oh now that's a good question cuz that is going to trying to think that is going to be a breaking change okay so now I got to remember how do I make an entity command buffer okay that's going to be a tricky one so I don't remember how this was done yeah I think it's like that so use an allocator dot what was it called the allocator dot uh this one just going to be a temp I think so destroy the nty but I have to do it on the ENT command buffer in order to destroy an entity so I'm going to want to destroy this guy right here so I have to get the with entity access for this one entity for the entity for the uh bullet entity okay so I've got the buet entity and then down here I tell that one in order to destroy this buet entity so I go through this whole cycle does all that and now didn't command buffer tell to playback and this one requires an N manager so that is going to be the state. entity manager okay so I think that's it and this one should now be destroying the bullets as soon as they reach the target so let's see if it does will this be uploaded later yep the video is set to record and then have the thing so it should then work is that a an error no that's okay I don't know you must dispose the buffer I don't think so I think when you make it temp it automatically dispose so I don't think that is but I'm not 100% sure so I don't know if you need to I don't know but I I as far as I know if you use temp it automatically dispos of it so I don't think you need to manually but I'm not 100% sure so let us see if that is the case and why is this one still firing this message okay get rid of that all right so if I click on that one any he spawning bullets and let where's my the entities Hy window where is it this one on this one and spawning yep it is spawning in the spring bullets let me actually hide the if I hide the plane just hide the plane and yep CU they are going to the bottom yeah they get there and they get destroyed as soon as they can close all right awesome so those are some nice bullets super basic but yeah I can select oh crap cuz I disabled the plane so now I can select multiple let me enable the plane like multiple all of them attack that one and boom every point three they attack they fire bullets and so on okay now we make some kind of uh health system which I think is going to be an interesting challenge challenge in the sense of spawning in 0000 Z execution order of the systems I mean that's what I think but in theory I'm spawning the units over here inside of the simulation group whereas in reality the rendering should only happen down here so that was my first thought is that it's something related to do with the system order but that shouldn't make sense because the entities are being spawned here and then they're being rendered here so I'm not sure that doesn't seem to make much sense so maybe they need to be spawned in some previous point I don't know that is definitely something that I willon have to research cuz yeah the U thing in which they visibly spawn over there that is uh quite something uh okay so let me make some kind of Health thing activate subscene from another scene I'm not sure I haven't used subscenes too much so far I've only done this so had a normal scene with an ntity subscene I haven't done anything more complex than that so I don't know anything portfolios in order to progress from software into Game Dev here in Portugal uh the answer is I don't really know just because I'm not too familiar with the whole job market thing but in general I would say a portfolio is very important because a portfolio basically shows to a prospective employer what you can do so I would definitely say that you so I definitely say a portfolio is always a good thing have a portfolio that showcase what you can do what you built by yourself personally I would say that is probably more useful than having a random degree although I'm sure there are some companies that do prefer degree so yeah I'm not sure but I do know that having a portfolio doesn't hurt so yeah I would definitely try to do that that update before the transform system group oh maybe maybe that's it maybe that's it actually that's a good point that's a very good point cuz maybe that might be it because I'm actually setting the data yeah maybe that is it cuz I was thinking that it was a rendering thing like why is it rendering on thing that it was on previous frame whereas in reality it might be actually related to the transform system where it's being where it's being uh posted in one place then move so if I uh let me go into the bullets the bullet mover system update before so before what before the local tal system maybe uh let's write that type of the local to World system so let's see if this one does indeed move it actually move it before your stream while working yeah definitely oh hey thanks for the Super Chat hey M Laboratories do you think it's worth using dots to handle background processes like a trading game that has a lot of trade rout yeah I would definitely say that is the kind of problem that is absolutely perfect for Dots is all the games that are ah crap it still has it still does let's see oh never mind I'm using the Bol mover I should see the unit shooting so let's try on this one and see uh but yeah all the things that happen in the background those are pretty much just those are basically just that operations in order to do trades between one faction and another one those are definitely the kind of things that would do really well in being in the background so ah crap it still show than I put it there I saved so this one is now running the uh unit shooting system where's the unit no it is not wait is this I assume this is ordered from top to bottom is because it is not in the group how do I how do I spawn cuz I put update before right that's it right update before update in group so maybe I have to do I have to put update in group maybe that's it I've got to put it on the trans transform system group maybe it has to be inside that group in order to update before that one let's see oh can I do update before before group itself cuz that would help okay so now it is shooting before let's see let's see okay yeah that that might have done it so yeah all right so that's awesome now let's just try that one so update before the group does that actually spawn it in there yes or no let's see let's see if that one does show up before the group it does show up before the group okay so great so yeah learning something new that is awesome so you can do update before with the group instead of just being a system so that is cool and apparently the issue was indeed that so I was thinking that it was a randoming issue so thank you I'm sorry I don't know I don't know who said that but yep that is indeed the solution so I was thinking that it was a rendering thing so why is it rendering the position that it was in the previous as opposed to the answer is that this shooting system this one is running after the local toal system and that apparently is a system that actually positions the entities where they should be so that is why they were showing up for one frame like that so yeah thank you so much whoever give that tip cuz yeah that is indeed the solution so right now they're indeed spawning and they are no longer spawning for one frame so yeah nice awesome that is cool can dispose Destro system at runtime when you don't need it anymore uh good question I think you can but I'm not entirely sure the only thing that I know is you can do state. enabled so if you want to disable a system from running you can just modify that one but in order to actually destroy it destroy itself nope clean up nope so yeah I don't know if you can destroy itself I guess technically maybe you could destroy the system handle the system entity attached to the system I'm not sure so so I'm not sure but technically if you disable the system it shouldn't have any overhead at all so hopefully if you need something then just doing that should work okay okay let me just try implementing some some health system try to do that just in order to destroy the enemy and then I'm probably probably going to go because my voice is already quite messed up say something in Portuguese inid um you create Game Dev TV course why in 3D course use broadcast message in set of events I'm not sure I don't know what what uh I've done one of their 3D course and it was really nice so that is why I can recommend because the code quality was really good but yeah I don't know what specific one you're referring to I mean there are many many ways of handling Event Systems messaging systems all kinds of things so using events versus not using events you can definitely use uh all kinds of all kinds of options can be good so yep right down the center uh okay so let me just let me try doing some some health so okay so I need a going to have some kind of health authoring component okay and now in this health authoring component what do I need I need a F struct Health and this is going to be an I component data okay and then inside I'm going to have some kind of hint for the health amount and then uh also have some kind of hint for the health amount Max right yeah I think like this it should work and then up here I've got a class I've got a baker class Baker of health authoring and then I bake it I get the Cent would be nice if this one was a little bit didn't have to write all this B plate code that would be that would be fun but anyways so add component onto this entity I'm going to add a new health and I'm going to need to add it to something so up here only H Health amount yeah I guess I might as well put both them so for the health amount equals the authoring health amount uh and then the health amount Max like this okay so so basically I got a health and I got a health amount Max okay then on the bullet mover if the bullet gets close enough over here it's going to destroy itself all right and then it's going to have to go onto the enemies over here on the query let me get a ref RW of type Health that is going to have a health health a ref RW of Health okay as soon as I damage go inside of that one inside the value r w and and I set it to what I set it to let me read let me read the current health minus one okay can I just this is something that I still don't know can I just you health amount minus minus does this work or do I have to assign the value r w I'm actually not entirely sure if this one does work so let's try it out let's see I just need to make sure that the enemy has a health authoring component so the health authoring like there and you got let's say 100 Health okay so let's try it write custom templates for it Oh you mean for the over here for the create yeah they I noticed that they had a bunch of these these things which is interesting I mean it requires a little bit of getting used to because I'm used to the the giant list of all things but yeah adding all these of these sub folders it does indeed is quite okay so let me see the enemy and let me put the en me on run time and see the Health Data okay 100 and if I fire a bullet are you firing bullets okay why is the B not moving now did I forget something wait what oh did I put on on the B mover don't put that one but uh why are the BS not moving now okay that's strange range wait ah crap yeah I'm I'm not very smart I don't want the health for the Bullet cuz the bullet does not have health so yeah that is obviously not it I want the health for the other guy for the Target entity okay so I have to go into the system API system API right to get the component actually I've never used this one for get component RW get the health component the one that is attached to the Target enemy. val. Target entity so this the health uh the ref r w of Health for the Target enemy Health then on this one I can do that and modify that okay so now let's see if this one does work I'm not sure if the minus minus over here works or if I have to grab the value r w and then modify it so I guess we won't see or the argument okay okay is this a okay just every once's in a while an air randomly shows up and then apparently does not throw an air anymore okay so it is spawning it is moving okay what is this log doing okay still printing out that entity okay it is down one uh we looking the enemy and hell oh so it does work okay so that's that's good to know that's that to simplify things a little bit so basically over here in the code if I grab a refr w I don't have to do value RW equals something I can just go inside the Val RW and modify the health amount and apparently that does work okay that is good all right so like this it is indeed working let me just try doing a nice little health bar I want to be able to do that I'm trying to think uh okay let me try just doing a little health bar just make it visible okay but I'm going to need see now normally I would make a world space canvas that is how I would make a a health bar but over here that doesn't quite work so yeah I think I'm going to have to go with game object for some kind of health bar and inside the game object I'm going to have see again I'm not sure if Sprites are are usable or not uh so I think yeah I think I just need a regular quad that I'm going to have to make it look towards the camera okay let me it's not very red bar uh okay so let me oh crap got this got this same bug that happened the other day I don't know if this is a Unity 6 bug or a thing bug cuz like I click on that and doesn't let me modify let me select something else there you go some random blob has it reference I'm not using any blobs but okay something went wrong in the background uh can I select that one okay now it does work so let me just select the health bar and then put the health bar on there and basically I'm going to want to scale this a little bit okay so I'm trying to think how am I going to make this health bar can I actually make it with okay no mesh Lether none of that see now this is the thing that I have to stop and think for quite a while which is how do I the logic for updating this health bar so can I maybe have no cuz that one has the this the one thing that I still have to have to think about how am I going to cuz basically I want the health bar to update based on the health of just this one enemy but how do I have a reference to that enemy I guess I could have I mean I guess one way to do it but I don't think it's the right way so health bar uh authoring and basically over here I would have a a struct for the health bar I component data okay and now inside of this one I've got an entity for the entity. so Health uh Health in that doesn't make much sense but okay uh class for a baker class Baker for the health bar authoring so maybe like this it might work cuz if I got a game object or the um entity game object okay and over here entity entity equals get my entity get the entity this one is going to be dynamic okay then add component add on this entity a new health bar health bar yep and now health bar for the health entity get entity of the authoring do entity game objects okay this one and then the dynamic this mine does domain Rel Lo every single time if you're wondering about that that is actually something that is recommended that you disable in dots about the uh it's over here I think it's in preferences uh where it's on don't remember where is it it's on the it's on the on the project settings they mentioned this in the in the dot thing which is yeah it's over here project settings going into editor and then go down here into the when entering play mode and basically normally it reloads The Domain in the scene whereas uh for using with dots I think it's because the live link between the en's world and the uh game object World they recommend that you set to do not reload the on scene which does have some side effects like for example static Fields do not get reset by default so definitely be aware of those side effects but yeah if you want your game to uh handle the compilation a little bit faster then yep that is something that you can do okay put that one and then I pass in a reference to that one okay I have no idea so many errors I don't know so then let me try doing the uh a new entities I system so health bar visual system let's see if like this this logic is going to work I'm not sure but let's try it so basically I'm going to do for each health bar health bar in system API the query for a health bar and for this one I want a ref rro I'm just going to read it so ref for the health bar so basically it goes through the health bar and then on the health bar I can get the value r o and then from that one I can get the health entity and then from the system API I can get a component of type Health from that Health entity so health health on that one that one should work we review triaa games and shows how to recreate their mechanics uh yeah I mean the uh the uh uh how to make this one I'm definitely planning to continue doing this one a bit more but maybe you're referring to the How It's Made series that was also a fun one I really enjoyed making this one but yeah that one does require quite a bit more work in order to make these kinds of videos so I'm not sure cuz these do require quite a bit but definitely the how to make this one I definitely would like to make quite a few more so I made a doesn't this have the uh yeah plan list yeah I've got a plan list on this one so I've done four of these and I definitely would like to make more of them as well so RTS stealth Action City Builder 10 BAS yeah definitely would like to make quite a few more on that format because it is a fun format okay okay so basically this code is siling through all the health bars then on the health bar I've got the health entity that is related to that health bar and from that one I can web the health and I basally just need a float health normalized and that is going to be the health. health amount divide by health. Health amount Max except I need to cast one of these onto a float in order to make it work but then I need to have the visual for it so over here on the health bar authoring I need to have a health bar mesh game object something like this then a public entity for health bar mesh entity because that one is also going to be converted into an empty so the uh crap health bar mesh this one goes into the health bar mesh so I get that one and then from that one I can go inside the system API in order to get the component rrw of local transform and I'm going to grab it of the health bar do uh for the health bar. Val Ro and I'm going to grab the mesh entity okay so I grab that one that returns theow P transform for the help barcal transform and then the ref RW and then from this one can I modify the scale that is a question wait can't I is this not oh it's a field is this one going to be no cuz if feel you get wait but why is the I'm trying to think cuz why is this scale is the scale just a one no the scale is multiple or not yeah I guess scale is just that there's a scale on this one is the loow quty world is that the thing that is going to be okay I don't know but let's try let's try playing to the scale so scale equals the health bar normalized Health normalized okay so I think this might be working for updating the help bar so I guess we shall see how that goes oh boy my voice is really already messed up dating Health on each update is bad yep that is something that I will have to figure out during research CU yeah normally I would have the health system fire off some kind of event then based on that event update some kind of thing but in this case that doesn't uh making events in dots is very strange so uh so yeah that is definitely something that I won't have to research to figure out what is the best option to do because like this I I'll select one of these guys and I shoot it technically it should grow a little bit smaller or no is it oh it is so yeah it takes a while it's going down very slow and yeah it is going uniformly as opposed to like that so I don't have this drop down yeah if you're not on Unity 6 then those options look different you have one checkbox and then you have those so if you have if you want uh similar to what I have here take the first checkbox that says enable custom option and so on then leave the other two uh unticked use post transform Matrix for nonuniform scale uh for the scale I basically want to okay so health bar background so the way that I normally do uh a mesh so let me go over here and make material oh crap the same thing again I created a a variant accidentally I don't want to create create variant let me put this in Gray I need dark gray so on the health bar background let me put the gray material and now on this one over here so health bar mesh and inside I have the one with the actual visual so there's no visual on this one up here so this one is just an empty component this one is actually on one and one so this one one and3 and this one shift it to the right by 0.5 and I just need to make sure to push it a little bit behind Okay now this one push it a little bit to the left by minus5 okay so now I've got this little X and if I modify that if I modify the whole thing it still get strange but yeah so I just need the nonuniform scale for the X and it should be good but like this actually like this it should let me see if it is still working like that let me just go over here here instead of making like that let's make it just 20 okay let's see if this one does work pick this one trigger some damage okay yeah that one didn't update needs to update in the beginning yeah definitely it is is it this one or is this one and I'm a little bit confused trying to figure out is this one modify yeah this one is modifying but the other one isn't right yeah this one is on one as it should be okay so basically it's on the local to world is that what I need to in order to have nonuniform scale uh cuz yeah local transform does this one have from scale it does but it only has so who was saying something about nonuniform is it local to World local to world does this one have non uniform don't like to create a popular game yeah sure I would love if my games were more popular but yeah I don't know the goal is to keep learning things and keep making better and better games getting more knowledge about all kinds of programming game development things so yeah that is basically my go see separate component oh there was but do I need to attach it to I do remember seeing some kind of uh local transform or local to world un uh was it nonuniform no can't find it but technically on the local 2 world doesn't this one have I thought this one would have some oh I've got to set it on the transform usage Flags Okay so let's try that one except okay it's on the health bar hot ring so on this one make it with nonuniform scale okay so let's do that one and see what component to bake does and now uh where is it on this one the health bar okay so I did do get uniform nonuniform but it doesn't seem like it changed modifying that one is modifying the whole thing yeah because I want to be able to modify like one of these nope this doesn't do anything so only has a regular it's got a post transform Matrix is this what okay so what is a post transform Matrix the post transform Matrix what's kind of component is this apparently just has a float 4x4 and I guess yeah my goal is simp to modify this one so the c0 dox so okay so technically that means I've got to go onto this guy and grab the post transform Matrix grab this one so health bar post transform Matrix so I grab that one and I modify okay so it's the value and then it's apparently the c0 oh there's a float 4x4 techn like this it shouldn't work yeah what does that one Flo 4x4 what kind of function does this have oh you've got Oilers rotate scale does scale have all three you got to float X wi's at okay so this is probably going to be quite a bit better so the health normalize then the Y of one float Z of one so this is going to be the scale and set the not the C 0 this one okay so let's see if this does work all right okay it seems like it is working cuz that one already updated now f that one there goes a bullet and as soon as it gets there and there you go let go down all right awesome we have bullets being fired and we have an enemy taking bullets and if they eventually get enough and and goes into negatives oh right cuz I'm only destroying right that's the next part that I need which is uh being able to see the thing that's funny look at that the health bar going into negative Infinity but yeah it does work uh okay so yeah that's the next thing that I got to figure out is how to I got to make some kind of system in order to check the health and if the health is under zero if so then destroy it it's uh was fun so yeah thank you all for for your help for figuring out about this cuz I definitely did not know about this one post transform Matrix okay so there you go so we all learned something new here so if you want to make something that is nonuniform make sure to use the nonuniform scale and then on want some kind of thing you can grab the post transform Matrix and apparently that one has a float 4x4 which you can then modify so yeah after doing all that and I can now do that shoot and so on I can place down some buildings which don't do anything and select all the units move them around so yeah this is the little prototype is coming along nicely so that should be fun background music this is the low five beats it's actually on description I think it's see standard low five beats which is pretty fun uh is UI toolkit compatible with dots uh I mean I think you can use it in s that the UI toet is really just a UI layer so you can use any kind of UI layer and then and then communicate with the dot side in any kind of way so yeah technically I'm not using it here this just standard normal UI but yep you can definitely do it is there a weight list for this course there is a link where you can sign up and I'll let you know where's the link I don't remember where I put the link uh I think I put it over here uh yeah there you go so you can follow this link right here and you can uh sign up over here with your email address and eventually when I'm done with the research when I get the course done I'll send an email to all the people in there but yeah since this is a brand new topic really no idea how long it's going to take me to build this entire course so far it's been I mean I've only been researching for a few days and I got a decent basic prototype but there's still quite a lot of things that I've got to research quite a lot of things that I've got to do so so yeah really cool that you stream this if you have a chance do more yeah definitely would like to but uh yeah it's always figuring out what time works that is definitely tricky but honestly for this kind of research it actually works well with uh researching live with a bunch of people so so yeah hopefully as I'm doing research for this project that should make for some interesting live streams where I try to do some work and try to answer some questions all kinds of things so yeah um no offense but how are you using a light theme I'm super used to having dark mode ever the answer is because my eyes do not work well with dark mode if I put this on dark mode especially especially the code if I put this in black with the with the letters in white I get a massive headache after looking at it for just 10 seconds so I know a lot of people love dark mode but for me literally does not work I don't know something wrong with the way my eyes work I don't know what it is but yeah if I put this on dark mode I get massive headaches and I can't write code for more than 10 minutes so yeah that's that's uh that's pretty much it okay so yeah my voice already pretty messed up definitely got to stop a little bit cuz yeah I'm definitely not the kind of person who can do live streams for very long cuz I can't really talk that much so yeah switch light things when I'm watch yeah I mean if you like both definitely go ahead and use both but yeah for me definitely like light mode and all kinds of things why don't you use find object of type instead of USE events with single T I mean if you have just a single object of a type you can use it that one used to be super slow previously nowadays I think that one is not necessarily as bad so technically nowadays you can use that one but yeah normally I like using sylon so I pretty much use Singleton super easy to access all kinds of things uh you said components do not have any Behavior yep they only hold data but can they have properties I think they can I think so in the sense that I don't think anything stops you so over here public entity Health entity and you can do with a get and a set so I'm pretty sure the code does not stop you from doing this but technically you're not technically the way they the unity themselves talk about best practices is really just use these as data container so yeah no error so technically you can do this so if you want you can you can do it but usually the the format they tell you to follow is really just make things just make public fields to hold all data that the component needs so yeah that is basically the the guidelines that they encourage you to follow all right so yeah I'm going to rest my voice for a little bit take a little bit of a break so yeah I hope you enjoyed this live stream I've certainly enjoyed doing a bunch of research telling to all you so hopefully this was interesting all right so going to go put down like that and like that and game objects and dots I mean game object is a standard way and dots is entity so kind of different way so object oriented versus data oriented different things but both can make games all right so yeah thank you all uh so much for being here I hope to do these a little bit more often should be fun should be interesting but yeah that's going to be it for me today so I hope you have a great rest of your day doing whatever it is you're doing so yeah have a great day and see you next time all right bye everyone bye
