now the core of pretty much this entire genre is using a grid system the entire world is a grid the units move in a grid they shoot in a grid everything is on a grid I've made a series of videos on how to build a grid system how to create it from scratch add some generics then build all kinds of things on top of it and just in case you don't know a grid system is literally just splitting the entire world into multiple grid positions and then on all of those you can apply whatever logic you want making it grid based can help simplify some of your game design rules which lets you as a game designer have a bit more control over all the actions your players can take this is especially great for strategy games they allow you to make some very clear decisions but they're also very useful for many other things I've used my grid system to make a city Builder I've us it to make a house building system like valheim I've built a nice mini Factory game I built a pixel drawing mechanic also a Tetris inventory game and a bunch bunch more I into that grid system make it work with a hex grid so grid systems are really awesome they're extremely versatile I highly recommend you research them
