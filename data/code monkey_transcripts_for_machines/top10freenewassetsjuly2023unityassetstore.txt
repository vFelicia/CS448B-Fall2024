hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for July 23 in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paint ads and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also right now there's a mega bundle on the acid store it's got 30 assets for 30 bucks on the first year you've got some nice animations some pixel monsters you've got a bunch of sound effects there's some nice modular pixel characters then down into the second tier if you had a nice nature pack made by cinti a and localization tool a bad word on filter a really nice book flipping Shader and a ton of assets for making a nice low poly mining cave and last year this one has a 97 off discount so if just one of these looks interesting then you can go ahead and get it there's only four days left so if you're interested definitely get it quickly alright so on to the top 10 list starting off with a nice animation pack with a bunch of tonking interacting animations usually there aren't that many free animation packs and this one looks quite unique it features 16 animations so things like happy crying laughing it's got some Applause angry hungry so I could see this being great for some kind of party game or maybe something likes my party then for a nice and simple tool here is one for sorting your hiking this one is definitely a problem when the hierarchy has tons and tons of objects storing them can be a nice way to keep things organized you can sort everything sort by alphabetical or reverse sort by name or by position you can select which specific ones to sort or really just sort all children it's a nice and simple tool that does just one thing and does it very well then for some nice assets here is a Japanese bar it looks really nice and cozy it includes the bar some decoration a bunch of sushi and sake props it even has some playing cards some water buckets money and a nice cash register only on pretty unique pack then for another tool here is one called go now goat means going oriented action planner so it's a way of handling AI it looks surprisingly great for a free asset if you'd like to experiment with this kind of AI then this looks like you really great tool you define your goals and your actions define them either with config files or with code then you can visualize all the units and what decisions they are making it use the job system so it's super performant and has some really detailed documentation very interesting then if you have UI objects that you'd like to animate here is it you want to help you do that basically you can use this Shader and then this tool to easily modify any of the properties on that material there is no need to create tons of materials for every single individual change you can apply an override to just that one object you can modify the scale color rotation offset and all of these overrides can also be animated which gives you a ton of control over your UI definitely very useful to make UI animations much much simpler next for some assets here is a pack with a bunch of low poly rocks it's got a nice variety of sounds so you've got snow grass desert and rock there's also a nice variety of shapes there's some really big ones and some tiny Pebbles it's always great to have one of these packs to populate your world then if you want to organize objects in 3D space here is a nice thing to do that I'm pretty sure I've seen the paid version of this tune before it looks really useful for quickly organizing objects I'm not entirely sure what are the limitations of this free version you have full control over where the objects are positioned you can define a shape size margin and padding you can animate the objects as they are positioned animate them using a curve or a simple lerb or rigid body or any custom animation it automatically works with meshes Sprites texts colliders and even UI objects next if you're working on a medieval game and need some props here is a nice pack it's got some fences some four boards crates benches and various items so a nice and simple pack that you can use to populate your world then for another simple tool that does just one thing and does dwell here is a simple web transport like name implies this helps you handle Connections in a web build apparently this is also what mirror and fishnet use in the background so it should be very stable very robust soon this kind of thing can be very useful if you have some kind of nongame program that you're building in unity and you want to access it through the web it's a low level Library so it's up to you to Define what data you want to send over the network or maybe just see the character here is a nice Minotaur it really reminds me of the minotaurs that I fought in Oblivion it's a pretty nice character model with a nice doubleedged weapon it includes the character with some high quality textures along with some 17 animations if you like this style then this have has tons more characters alright so those are my top 10 free new apps on the ENT Sr for July 23 there's a link so in the description and also check out my own print pass
