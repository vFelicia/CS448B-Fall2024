hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and right now you can get a bunch of awesome animations for free from the unity accessor these are only free for a short while so go ahead get them quickly with the link in the description also by the way if instead you want some 2d art there's a massive humble bundle happening right now tons of 2d art of all types and it also has a bunch of music and sound effects it's a massive discount at 95 off so check the link to see all the contents okay so back to the free animations you've got these three free packs so you've got the basic motions crafting and the oriental sword animation pack you can get all of these for free using the coupon animate 2021 so the basic motions pack has a whole bunch of animations that are useful in pretty much every project so idle animations lots of walking talking falling and so on the next pack is the crafting pack this one is great if you're making any sort of survival or strategy game so you've got tons of animations using lots of different tools like hammers axes as well as just carrying some items and the last three pack is the oriental sword it's a bunch of really stylish sword animations so i could see this one being great for any kind of action game just add a bunch of particle effects and tons of enemies and you have something really cool these three packs are made by three developers and all of their other animations are also on a 50 discount so if you need more animations than just the three packs then this is a great quick sale for me i've been researching characters and animations more and more lately so this sale really comes at the perfect time you can browse around the full list and see there's tons of variety from these three developers so from kevin iglesias you got a whole bunch of basic animations some archers pistol soldier rifle and so on then down here from explosive you got a whole bunch of melee rpg mage and so on lots of great animations and then down here for we make the game these are some really awesome stylized animations i've seen a bunch of these in some sales but i don't have any yet so i might get some of these for using a future melee video and of course all of these are humanoid animations which means you can easily use them with any humanoid characters i cover the process of animation retargeting in the stern assets video you can essentially use any character with any of these animations so here i've got a project and i import those three asset packs so this one is the free basic motions pack as you can see tons and tons of animations this one is really useful for pretty much any project so you've got some jumping falling a bunch of sitting a bunch of basic emotes a bunch of people turning around everywhere swimming dying walking crouch walking normal running talking and so on tons and tons of animations and as an example of animation retargeting over here is the animation being applied to a completely different character so this is from a completely different asset pack all you need for this work is really to make sure that the animations are being marked as humanoid which all of these are already like that and then you just need to use the avatar for the actual mesh that you're using so here i'm using the animations from this pack and the character and the avatar from a different pack and yeah that's all it takes and works great so you can apply any of these animations with any humanoid character so that's the basic motions pack already tons and tons of things definitely get this one then over here is the crafting pack this one the demo scene actually has an issue where it's using a second camera for the ui but this was made before urp was around so if you're using urp and you see a grey screen with just ui you can easily fix this just go ahead and select the ui camera so the gui camera then over here on the render time instead of being based set it as overlay and then on the base camera just go down here on the camera stack and just add the other camera so with that yep it works perfectly also when you do in case you see everything else being completely white that's also another issue that is very easy to solve just on the material itself just make sure you disable the emission so just do that and here is the demo this is a really cool demo so you've got tons of buttons for playing all the various animations for example the cheater animation pretty simple cheer another cheer then you've got buttons to equip all the various tools for example get the hammer he picks up the hammer then all of the various hammer animations so hammer on a table hammer on the wall really nice then just put away the hammer then let's say pick up a shovel and start digging and just dig and yep this one has quite a lot of awesome animations you also got take food so receiving some food then eating it really a lot of stuff if you got any kind of rpg or survival game this one can be insanely useful even just pick up an object overhead like that really nice alright so that's the crafting free asset pack this one has a really cool demo definitely check it out and finally here is the free oriental swordpack this one actually has the mesh with the animations using a generic ray so just as soon as you import it won't work automatically but if you browse on the project folder over here you can see there are some with the generic animations and then you've got the humanoid so if you want to do animation retargeting make sure you're using one of these models so these ones and they've got all kinds of animation like these tons of them so here after making that change i retargeted into my custom character and yep it works pretty great so i just had another free sword from another asset pack and yep all of them looks really nice so tons of great sort of animations all of them really flashy you can definitely add a bunch more effects and with this you would have a great base for making any kind of action game alright so those are the three packs you can get use the link in the description and the coupon to get them they are only free for a very limited time so make sure you pick them up quickly and that link is also an affiliate link so if you end up picking up any of the other packs you'll also be supporting the channel alright i hope you enjoy these free assets and i hope you put
