hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and for some news unity has just acquired what it digital that is the vfx studio responsible for bringing movies like the lord of the rings and avatar to life with unity buying them that means that you will soon be able to use all the tools that they use to make those movies with those super high fidelity visuals you can see the entire blog post to see all the tools that will soon be available for example one of them is a path razor so for some super realistic lighting then a physics based simulation tool with a bunch of effects water fire smoke and so on then some physically accurate lighting and color then there's a puppet rigging system a bunch of facial tag for facial capture a really interesting one with some tools for hair fur and everything so it supports simulating growth as well as grooming then some world building some vegetation an advanced liquid smoke and fire simulation and tons more for just about everything as you can see most of these have to do with visuals so for me since i'm primarily a programmer i'm not sure if i won't be able to use many of these but if you're an artist then the possibility of accessing all these super high end tools is awesome and perhaps more important than the tools is that they're also buying their entire asset library so these are hyper realistic scan assets with extremely high quality now one thing that unreal has had for quite some time is the quixote mega scans where they have tons and tons of acid scanned directly from real life so this seems like it might be similar to that if they've been building this library for 20some years and it's bound to be full of awesome assets if you work on hyperrealistic games and this library sounds like it will be extremely useful now this was just announced so there's not much details on this so no idea what the license will be how much it will cost and so on but it does seem really awesome so hopefully there will be some more details by the end of the year now the song purchase is really interesting because until now it's been mainly unreal who were interested in using game engines for movie making whereas unity has been more focused on other things like architecture building automotive and so on but with this purchase clearly they see the unity engine as being very useful for movie making as well the price was 1.6 billion which is a pretty decent amount for a company like unity so they definitely do see unity for movies as a big part of their longterm plan of that means that if you're using unity at all then this news is yet another great news that unity is here to stay for a very long time and it's getting more and more use cases so whatever you learn using the engine won't possibly help you get into movie making or the vfx industry or tons of other things now my question to you is how many of you are working or wouldn't like to work on a game with realistic visuals for me i'm a big fan of the low poly style so when i eventually start working on my next steam game that's probably the sound be going with but if you're a fan of the hyper realistic style then this is great news for you alright so thanks for watching and i'll see you next time you
