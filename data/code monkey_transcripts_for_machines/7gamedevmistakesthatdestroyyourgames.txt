hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's an interesting Video Game Dev mistakes that destroy your game three years of work on my game and nothing no sales no wish lists no money for the steam holiday sale wow right away yeah that stuff but suddenly that is not uncommon if anything my advice to you would be don't spend three years working on your game especially not your very first game when you're just starting out and you're trying to learn you really want to be able to learn with as little risk as possible so yeah for your very first game my advice is don't go anything further than some like two to three months I made a video quite a long time ago on seven steps you can take to become an end Dev and in the beginning I do say make tons and tons of games because you will learn so much more by actually finishing and Publishing a bunch of games you'll learn so much more than just working on one massive game over several years right now I'm working on my next team game which is meant to be a three to four month fulltime project depending on your skills and experience you can get quite a lot done in a few months if you have a clear plan I don't know what I did wrong I need a Christmas miracle all right this game is going to be amazing I think I'll just start with all my art assets holy and this is the first mistake who are you I'm you and I'm here to save you from all of your beginner Game Dev mistakes I'm just making my art assets what's wrong with that exactly you spend way too much time on your art during the Prototype phase sure yeah that's an interesting tip you should definitely make a quick prototype in narrative to actually validate the idea however at the same time some game ideas are heavily influenced by the art so depending on what game you're trying to make it might not necessarily be a terrible idea to spend some time making the art assets although at the same time when I say spend some time I don't mean spend months maybe depending on the genre it might be why I suspend perhaps the very first week working on nothing but art assets trying to get the mood of your game figuring for something like a visual novel or a point of Click game something where the art is absolutely essential on those kinds of games that might not necessarily be a mistake but yeah for most games if you're making a platformer a strategy game a action game something like that then getting the gameplay up and running as quickly as possible that is definitely going to be much more important than spending tons of time on making polish art not to mention that as the game develops you won't permanently replace the art anyway so yeah there are some exceptions but in general yeah definitely don't spend way too long working on Art right at the very beginning by focusing on Art during this early phase you have less time to devote to making sure the gameplay within the Prototype is actually fun don't even use those assets I completely changed my art style later on yeah that's the thing that happens especially if you spend way too long in the game to the point where your skills actually improve and then you want to make you want to redraw the assets once again with better skills so yeah do not go overboard on the art right at the very beginning so I should just work on the ugly gray box prototype and yep definitely do spend time working on an ugly gray box prototype the thing is if your ugly gray box prototype if that thing is fun to play then when you add all kinds of visual Sparkle effects and punch on top it won't be even more fun to play so one good technique is definitely made tons of prototypes make them super quickly and then just experiments and see which one of those actually plays right because again if it does play great while it's looking terrible then it won't feel extremely awesome when you finally add all kinds of polishing visuals gameplay Loop instead you would have had a much stronger gameplay Foundation hence the first mistake not focusing on gameplay early making a game involves a lot of moving parts and it's extremely easy to get distracted by all the things that need to be built making a finished character asset and Polished textures may make the Prototype more visually appealing but the main thing that will make people wishlist buy and play your game is the game part visuals May grab someone's attention but the gameplay will make them stay also related to this is when you're trying to make some kind of demo or perhaps a vertical slice in order to get funding from a publisher in this case this comes after this phase after the pro timing phase when you have the game nice and solid it can be wise to spend a bunch of time just polishing just a tiny sliver of the game just making what is called the vertical slice just doing that getting that all polished up as much as possible in order to hopefully get some funding or maybe start to promote your receipt page two years hey I'm back what are you working on oh God I made it just in time I followed your advice and focused on gameplay I'm just doing some some play testing which is super great but my brother in game devs you're just asking your friends and family to play today well yeah but asking strangers is hard and scary who's gonna play your game and do you think your friends and family are going to give you a solid critiques yeah I guess not so what should I do well for starters ask your friends and family but take their feedback with a grain of salt yeah friends and family are definitely great for a first initial thing but you always got to keep in mind where that feedback comes from always keep in mind that feedback is always going to be slightly biased towards the positive side because they're friends and family they're your friends so they're not going to be brutally honest at least not as really honest as actual scene players won't be when you finally release your game so do get them to play your game and read through their feedback but do keep that positive bias in mind I just had a similar example to this when I recently released the seam neck Fest demo for my game most of the feedback that I got were actually from people that found this Channel and if they watch his channel if they enjoy the videos that I do there will definitely be much more biased towards the positive side rather than the regular steam audience you want strangers anyone and everyone to test your game flight testing often gets pushed aside during the development process or you put it at the very end but in reality you want people to be testing your game early and often play testing is really market research it lets you know how people are receiving your game your mechanics your art style and gives you an idea where you might be blind to certain issues with your game so get initial Impressions favorite parts parts they hated and things they think are missing every piece of information is useful yeah waiting list of things definitely get their initial Impressions read so many games nowadays you really gotta hook the player as soon as possible especially since nowadays going on a steam Festival is super important and on a scene Festival you are providing a free demo and you are competing with tens of thousands of other demos so for that you really got just a few minutes in order to really hook the player so initial impressions are extremely important the favorite Parts also really important in order to figure out what people like about your game so you can do more of those least favorite parts so you can either reward worth the design in order to make them not the least favorite in order to make them a bit better or perhaps just cut them out entirely at some point there are some mechanics that just don't work no matter how much you want them to so in order to improve the game sometimes cutting a mechanic is really the best approach and things missing like if lots of your players are telling you oh I wish I could pause the game to take my time and go things slowly that is really great feedback on things that might be missing that might even be super easy to add but you might have never thought about and that might make your game much much better you don't need to implement every single idea or change but at least be aware of how your game is being received yeah definitely also that's another thing do not just blindly Implement every idea that anyone tells you remember that you are a developer so you know best what your game should be like you know with the idea that you have in your head and what you're actually trying to accomplish so always keep that in mind make sure you don't Implement every single idea that you get if you do then the final game won't just be a mishmash of different ideas that might not go together in the end it's really up to you as the developer to figure out which ideas to take and which ones you should ignore more okay so focus on gameplay and have people test it so you can refine it right and while you do the play testing you're also getting networking contacts for future tests and potential buyers once the game is finished so in general play testing really good asking more than just your friends and family to play test your game that is extremely good but obviously the big problem is where do you find those people and that can be quite a bit tricky you can perhaps look into Reddit there are some communities that might play your game there are some discords with lots of developers who play each other games you might look into itch.io there might be some forms and some areas over there to find the community or alternatively you can kind of do what I've done which is make a YouTube channel grow that YouTube channel over time with whatever game that related videos you have like perhaps devlogs or something like that and then you have an audience that if you ask them to test your game they might be able to do that so plenty of options to find plate testers other than just your friends and family okay I remember this I was crunching trying to get all the features but together it kept breaking every time I added something yeah this this plugin won't work it says it works for massively multiplayer RPG action adventure racing open world VR games okay maybe I added one too many features yes scope creep is yet another beginner Game Dev mistake I myself I'm definitely not immune to that when I started making Flash games around my third Flash game I suddenly had the brilliant idea why don't I make a massive MMO game it was meant to be something with like cops and robbers so it was going to have dozens or hundreds of people on the same map some people would try to rub some bangs others would try to stop them obviously after working on that project for a bunch of months it didn't go anywhere so I ended up abandoning it but yeah this is definitely a big problem and you should definitely keep track of it make sure you don't go way too overboard but at the same time if it does happen don't get too down on yourself it seems like this happens to literally everyone foreign making games is sometimes like the Wild Wild West a free open world of opportunity and that freedom can be a big problem yeah freedom is definitely both a positive and negative it's great to be able to do anything I mean it's your game so you can literally add anything you want onto that game but at the same time not having any constraints means you might get caught up trying to add things more and more and more and you never actually end up finishing anything it is indeed a doubleedged sword so always be very careful when you add a new mechanic when you come up with a new idea always think to yourself okay this is actually enhancy core idea that I already have if so then perhaps that might be a good addition if not if it's just something you added just because on a whim you suddenly decide to add some more mechanics if so then perhaps it might be wise to keep that on a drawer put that underneath to play around with in the future in case you have time but for now focus on actually finishing the core game idea that you have we all love games and it might be why you started making games all together and sometimes you might want to add every single feature from every favorite game you've ever played so when you're feeling the urge to add a new gameplay feature ask yourself does it fit my existing design if you answered no then focus on getting what you have to a point where you can add new features and if you want to add something anyway prototype it and play test it yep definitely great tip great advice if you're going to add some brand new mechanic to your game especially if it's something complex that is going to take quite a bit of effort perhaps try making just a prototype of that initial idea just get the basics up and running in order to actually test does this idea actually work only it actually improve the final game so remember that when it comes to prototyping you can prototype not just the actual full game idea but individual systems you can always get just the core of it working just enough in order to figure out does this work on the sexual improve the game it brings me to one final piece of advice while you don't want to introduce too many new features don't be afraid to borrow from some of your favorite games yeah definitely I mean if you got into game development chances are you got into it because you actually enjoy playing games so therefore look into the games that you play the things that you enjoy trying to analyze them trying to look at them with a game designer eye and try to see why do those features work why those systems work what makes them so compelling that is one great way you can improve your game play similar games and don't just necessarily copy things just copy paste but actually figure out why those Mechanics Work why those systems work and perhaps they might be applicable to your game in some way you likely got into game development because of the games that inspired you to do so and sometimes listening to the inspiration and keep you going with it going it's hard if you find yourself losing motivation check out this video to learn how to deal with burnout alright that was a great video lots of really interesting tips definitely mistakes that many people might have fallen for so if you're a beginner and you're watching this definitely keep in mind all these mistakes make sure you don't do them and they won't really help you on your Game Dev Journey alright so go ahead and watch the original video And subscribe to stay at home Dev I hope you found this interesting thanks for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
