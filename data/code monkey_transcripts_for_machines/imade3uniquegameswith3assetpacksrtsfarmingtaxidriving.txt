hello and welcome i'm your code monkey so a while ago i made a video on the awesome cinti assets humble bundle that is currently running and is actually ending soon in that video i asked if you would like to see some quick mini games built with these assets to showcase various game ideas that you could make so lately that's what i've been building i took the scifi pack and made a really nice rts game i used the farm pack to make a nice farming game and finally i used the town pack to make a sort of crazy taxi driving game the goal with this video is to show you how you can take some asset pack that you like and you can turn some idea you have into reality pretty quickly and thanks to using some nice assets the final prototype actually looks pretty good as opposed to just using some boring cubes so whenever you look at an asset pack and you get an idea for an interesting game go ahead and try building it you might really enjoy what you make in case you missed that other video here is the humble bundle that i'm talking about this one's got a massive amount of cindy studios pack all of them in their gorgeous low poly style i would highly recommend you get this bundle you can get over 3 000 assets which you can then use in hundreds of different game ideas like you will see in a bit over here you have the ones i mentioned so the farm pack the sapphire space pack and the town pack then you also have the pirate pack with tons of assets if you got the office pack in case you want to make some sort of tycoon game you've got the prototype pack with tons of basic modular pieces then you've got tons and tons of characters there's a spy kit an explorer kit and tons and more so yep as you can see this bundle is excellent possibly the best bundle i've ever seen it's got a massive amount of variety for an extremely cheap price it ends in just three days so i would encourage you to get it quickly check it out with the link in the description and one more thing if you're the kind of person who does not like using assets because you think it's cheating or maybe because you're afraid that players won't call your game an asset flip if you think like that then go watch this other video that i made where i browse games that are clearly using assets and i see what the player reviews actually say okay so let's see the mini games that i quickly made using these assets there's also chapters in the video if you want to skip ahead i'm pretty happy with what i've managed to build and how good it looks considering how quickly i made these games i only spent about 4 hours on each game that's a pretty small amount of time but they still work as basic prototypes and thanks to using some awesome assets the games also look pretty cool so here is my first game this one is the rts minigame that i made with the scifi pack so i've got a bunch of units i can click to select them i've got a camera that i can move rotate around zoom in and so on for the selection logic i actually covered rts unit simulation in another video so i can click to select them and right click to tell them to go anywhere so all of you go over there then for the level it's a really nice space station tons of things all of them looking really cool and over here inside the ship there are various turrets defending it so i have to tell my units to get within range and start attacking those thirds so there you go the units are attacking and the turrets also started tagging so as you can see they all have health both the units as well as the turrets so these are using the health system that i made on the very first video on this channel now eventually suddenly some magnets die so they can't really take it over with just three units so like in any rts i need some more units so down here i've got a button for my build queue so i can click to build some more units now as usual they take some time to build and after they are built they spawn them out and since this map is on the space station they get dropped off with a really nice spaceship so there you go the spaceship comes in drops them off and goes away now i've got these units i can move them around and try to get them to invade the space station and take out the turrets one by one there you go just like that so as you can see this one has all the main features that you would expect from an rts it's got unit spawning it's got unit selection and orders there are attacks and weapon shooting there are enemies health bars and so on again all of this was built in just about four hours of development and you can already see a nice game idea forming and thanks using this asset pack they actually look pretty great if i had not used an asset pack then all of these characters would be boring cubes and level itself would be some boring shapes instead of a cool looking space station now another idea i had for this pack was making some sort of spaceship duff fighting game there's tons of cool ships including the pack but that one is not a genre that i'm very experienced with so since i had such a short amount of time to make these prototypes i went to the genre they already knew how to make but again another example of a completely different game you could build with these same assets or perhaps you could make some sort of spaceship trading game so moving goods between planet to planet or perhaps something in first person like doom or halo just get a character controller and a first person camera and you can walk around the demo scene so tons of game ideas you can build from this one pack and load by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks next up the farming game using the farm pack now this one was an obvious idea although initially i actually thought about making it more in the style of a management game i thought about having an overhead view and just clicking to place down crops but since the rts game already had that sort of view i went to something different so over here i've got my former character in third person for the controller i'm using the unity official sarnas's third person controller that one is a free acid and it's really awesome i covered it in detail in another video so all i did was use that with a character from this pack so i can walk around anywhere on this firmware now there's also some npcs just lying around just give a bit of life to the world as well as some animals also walking around now these are from another pack but since that pack is also low poly the style actually fits perfectly so i can move around and over here are some plots of land as i approach i can select each one individually so just by looking at them so i can go into this one and using the keyboard i can select which seat i want to place so let's say i want to place down some carrots so i just go approach i press the button the character drops down does a nice animation this one is from the crafting animation mega pack pretty useful pack that i picked up quite a long time ago so with that the seed has been planted and i can play some more so i can select a different one and click to play so place down some corn then some like a butternut squash then some like a pumpkin and finally some like a watermelon okay so all of those seeds have implanted now all it takes is just some time to watch as they grow then i also add a button to speed up the clock so i can press a button and everything speeds up there's also a pretty basic day night cycle so the sun rotates around i just use a simple animation on the directional light and just played a bit with the color now as time passes the plants grow so they keep track of their own growth stage there are multiple growth stages as you can see so let's just pass some more time and wait until they're all fully grown all right they're all fully grown so it's time to harvest so again just approach a pot look at it the character bends down there's a nice animation and grabs it you can see down there on my ui you can see i've got a sort of simple inventory system and they get added so i just picked up a carrot and over here picking up this pumpkin and there you go just pick them all up now i can just plant some more and keep farming more and more vegetables so you won't really see quite a lot of things that i can plant all of these are from objects from this farm pack now if i were to expand upon this i would add some sort of market so adding the ability to buy seeds and sell fully grown vegetables so just with that it will be an interesting game loop you just plant grow sell buy more seeds plant some more grow some more and so on again all of this was made in just about four hours and you can already see a nice working prototype and just like with the rts game the prototype looks great since it's using proper assets instead of just boring old cubes for some other ideas you could build with this pack first off my original idea you could make this sort of more like a management game so something with a topdown view perhaps controlling multiple farmer characters building buildings and so on or perhaps this could be simply a normal level in a normal shooter game just a nice farm environment or you could make something like farming simulator and add some vehicle controls to all the vehicles included in the pack once again lots of game ideas you can build with this pack and then for the final game the one using the town pack now my first idea for this one was making some like the sims so using the interior of a house and controlling various characters to do normal actions that was my first idea but that required quite a lot of animations which given how much time i had to build a prototype would be quite tricky so i looked at the pack and saw that it had some nice cars so i decided to use the demo scene and make something sort of like crazy taxi for the car controls i made a super simple controller in another video but that one is extremely simple then i also remember that i had a driving asset that i picked up quite a long time ago so this was the perfect time to use that it just took a bit of time to look into how that asset works just change the visual for the one from this pack i tweaked some settings to make the driving feel nice and arcading and with that over here is my car so i can drive around i can even go and do some nice moves the town itself also looks pretty great so lots of buildings lots of variety and lots of things i also made a bunch of people walking around now for the movement i actually use the super useful spine class from a previous video i used it to design the wall path just to have these people walking around just give the world a bit more life now the game itself is a taxi game so randomly there are some people waiting to be packed up and above the car is a nice gps arrow pointing me to where i need to go so over there is a person waiting for a ride so i get there i stop at the point okay now i need to go into the destination so i gotta move my car around gotta go somewhere to the right side and yep there you go i've delivered that one so now with that one now i've got another one so i gotta go once again follow the arrows and try to find the next spot here there's another one just waiting for a pickup and i gotta go and go into the target also up there on top you can see a nice timer so the time is calculated between the pickup and the dropoff and there you go drop them off alright nice so once again another basic but prefunctional working prototype as for some other game ideas you could build with this pack now if i had some more time i would have known that seems like idea i think that one could be fun alternatively you could do something like a newspaper delivery mini game just wrap around go through all the houses and deliver some newspaper or of course since this one is named tom pack you could use it to make a city builder you could place down houses and roads or since a pack also includes a bunch of cars maybe you could make some sort of traffic simulator game or perhaps a while ago the cintiq city pack was also part of a free deal on the essasor if you pick that one up then you can easily integrate this pack onto that one to give you even more possible game ideas so as you can see i built a really nice rts then i made a pretty interesting farming game and finally a fun taxi driver game all three mini games were built pretty quickly in just a few hours and all three look pretty great thanks to using some assets i hope this video helped show you how quickly you can make some great prototypes so whenever you have some new idea possibly when you see a random asset pack maybe take some time to explore that idea and bring it to life also another benefit of using some good looking proper assets if you're someone who has problems with motivation problems with sticking with a project for more than a few hours if you're like that then having some proper assets can really help boost your motivation it's easier to stay motivated if your prototype actually looks great as opposed to just some boring cubes so definitely check out the humble bundle with all these packs and many more it ends really soon so definitely get it quickly this one is a really excellent bundle it's the best discount you'll ever get with this much variety so check it out with a link description all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
