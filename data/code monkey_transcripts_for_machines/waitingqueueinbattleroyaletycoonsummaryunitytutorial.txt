hello and welcome I am your code monkey in this video we're going to view a summary of the waiting queue from battle royal tycoon series let's begin so the goal in this series is to make a waiting queue as it's used in battle royale Tycoon it is very much inspired by roller coaster tycoon so we have guests going into the queue and moving forward the queue is set up as a series of positions and the guests enter the queue if there is space on the queue when the one in front is called to enter the building all the others move forward to the next position so first we're going to start off by making our waiting queue class it will have the necessary based information for the queue be havior so in ELISA positions and gets in the queue it will also have functions to add yes to the queue and get the guests waiting in front then we're going to add events to our waiting queue class events won't let us keep our code nice and clean by providing an easy way for the building that is connected to queue to being notified when a guess is added or reaches the front of the queue then we're going to create a test building with a simple interaction to see how we connect a building to the waiting you so when the waiting queue notifies the building that I guess is waiting in front the building won't request that guest he won't go to a position to an action and leave the building when he leaves the next one waiting in front will be called and so on after that we're going to add functions to modify the positions in our queue so we won't be able to modify the queue in runtime by adding more positions making it easy to create a custom queue shape and finally we're going to create a a I to have them each guest in the queue it won't be a very simple class that will be responsible for removing the guests inside the queue and handling any extra behavior whilst inside the queue so that's the plan for the waiting queue in battle royale tycoon series it features some interesting logic and some nice clean code it won't start off very simple by thinking of all the elements that make up a queue and by the end we will have a complete queue in a clean class that can be applied to anything we want so go watch the playlist and begin learning right now as always you can download the project files in utilities for each video in the series from int code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
