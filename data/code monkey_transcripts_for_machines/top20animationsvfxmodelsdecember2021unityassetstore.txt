hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for december 2021. even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great to look at them and see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all kinds of games that i could build this one is the list of paid assets and effects i've already made two videos covering the best free new assets and the best tools and systems go watch those if you haven't seen them let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's a link to the asset in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order also right now unity is having their endofyear sale there's over 8 000 that's on sale including many that i've never been discounted previously if you've been watching these asset highlight videos for the past couple months and adding some things to your wish list chances are some of those are now discount the sale ends in just four days so if there's anything you want make sure you get it now and there's also a bunch of interesting humble bundles for game devs there's one with a bunch of courses for learning blender 3d modeling i'm currently going through these myself learning the basics then there's another one with tons of ui elements lots of sliders buttons and so on another one with lots of music and these bundles are also ending soon so check them out with a link in the description all right so starting off with the latest cinti pack scifi worlds as usual it's their signature and low poly style this one is a massive pack there's over 1200 prefabs everything you can imagine in a scifi setting you've got tons of characters vehicles buildings lots of weapons and vfx of it in three different unique factions and several unique environments then if you need a giant pack with some awesome reverse doom plate and missions then look at this one dual wielding is always fun and even more fun when it's a reverse grip features all kind of animations so the usual attack combo hit jump move and equip and as usual these are all humanoid animations so they work with any humanoid characters this developer has tons of really awesome animations so if you like this style check it out then if you're making some kind of office management game or something like the sims then look at these stylized businessmen they are low poly but not too low poly it's a pretty nice cartoony style features five unique models each of them with three hairstyles and tons of outfit variations or maybe you're making a game where you need some sort of detective or eagle vision then check out this one it throws out a pulse and then highlights all the enemies or objects and you can see them even through walls so this is just like the detective mode in the arkham games or even econ vision in assassin's creed it's a pretty nice effect and i'm guessing you can even modify the shaders to make it fit whatever game style you have up next here's a pack with a bunch of really nice monsters in total 20 characters a bunch of dragons stone monsters dryads and bears it's a really nice style very fantastical this one is the fourth volume so if you like this style check out the others or maybe you need a massive amount of rpg weapons then look at this pack of them in a low poly style everything from swords to bows maces shields and saps and each of them also has 64 color variations so the actual total for this is a massive 25 000 unique combinations up next some more really cool animations this one is all about pistols but it's much more than just normal standard pistol animations it's got some really stylish ones so think something along the lines of john wick you've got lots of takedowns with some really cool headshots really awesome pack then for a nice texture pack check out this one it's got everything you expect from some normal textures to some weird materials this one is actually a bundle that includes seven packs all in one and as usual it's got a nice discounted price if you need some props to populate your scene look at this one quite a lot of generic props in a nice painted style you've got bookshelves beds tables bottles and tons of food another really cool animation pack is this one it's an office pack which looks pretty funny given how the characters they use is a really scifi looking guy so it's just funny to see that model doing the general office things like being on the phone on the computer talking moving the fingers and so on next up here's a bunch of surface shader effects it's a pretty nice collection you can make some auroras or maybe a flood or some fog or some weird lava or acid or maybe you're in need of some battlegrounds for your game then look at this one lots of environment objects including a bridge and a gate all of them with modular borders and tons of horse so i could see this one as a great starting point for making a game kind of like xcom or mario rabbids or even something like clash royale then if you have weapons of any kind here's a bunch of muzzle flashes it's got lots of styles from normal looking muzzle flashes to some siphon looking ones in some weird colors this dev also has tons more vfx assets as well as a really interesting youtube channel or maybe you want tons of gorgeous looking environments then look at this one this one is a bundle so it's lots of different packs all in one with a really nice discount features a regular planet desert forest and a mountain up next check out this one to punish your ui it's a nice style that perfectly fits pretty much any rpg like game you've got tons of buttons cursors crosshairs icons and tons more then if you'd like to make an rts and you need some buildings then look at this one it's got tons of unique buildings each with their own faction so you could just grab this one and combine with some unit pack and very quickly make an rts prototype then here's an office with a really cute art style includes both the workers with a really unique style as well as tons of furniture for you to make whatever office you want then some more animations here this one is all about talking if you have lots of download in your game then a pack like this can really help instead of having your characters just walking forward while sound displaying use these animations to really bring that dialogue to life if you need tons of icons and here's a great one they're all in a flat style so they would fit just about anything and these are not static they have some really nice animations and if you're in need of a massive amount of unique people then look at this one it's got a hundred people all in a low poly style all of them unique in all kinds of weird scenarios so you've got a standard construction worker then a policeman then for some reason you've got a guy in a rubber donut there's a nun a cook and even a bunch of kids alright so those are my top 20 new assets on the int assessor for december 2021 there's links along the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to
