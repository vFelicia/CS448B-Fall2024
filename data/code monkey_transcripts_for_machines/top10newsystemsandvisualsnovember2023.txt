awesome if you want to make some kind of M tycoon game there are also two great humble bundles there's one with tons of Blended courses and materials I followed this one myself quite a while ago and I really enjoyed it I really learned a lot and there's also a bundle with a massive amount of Tod Sprites lots of characters cars environments space pack UI pack and tons more those are all Linked In the description which is usual those are all affiliate links so if you buy anything through those links it's the same price to you and I get a nice commission all right so starting off with a system that does EX only what it says it's a parkour and climbing system if you've been playing the recent Assassin's Creed and you'd like to build something like that then this could be a great starting point the animations are a little bit stted but it works exactly as you expect it features some regular box climbing you can jump on some edges you can swing from bars jump from edge to edge you can Vault balance and tons more to create a climb point you just select an object in the level and use the included tool to mark it as climbable swingable mountable and so on then the character is smart enough to identify the nearby climb point and select the an a mission now I must say this is one system that I've always wanted to research for myself when I played the recent Assassin's Creed it made me want to research that even more so hopefully in the future I'll have some more time to research this topic but if you just want a tool that just works then check this one out next is something that a lot of games have like for example Assassin's Creed which is a navigation system this one is actually not just one element but rather a ton of tracking and navigation elements all in one single pack you've got a radar kind of like a minimap then you've got a flat Compass like in something like Skyrim you've got some onscreen indicators some Edge arrows and tons more it's made by Infinity PVR so all the scripts are really very nicely detailed and very well put together and it also comes with some video tutorials to help you get started so if you need to guide your players in some way then a tool like this one can save you a ton of time then here's one that I hope doesn't get this video demonetized it's called Gore simulator like name implies it lets you create different body parts of a mesh and then slice them during gameplay it doesn't have to be horror game Gore doesn't have to be something super intense it can just be something like Doom where you have enemies and you just want them to blow up into various pieces or simply maybe some skeletons kind of like Skyrim where you really just want them to break into bones it includes a custom Editor to make it super easy to use you just assign a skin mesh render pick a button and it automatically creates all the colliders and all the various separated body parts if you have some kind of action game then this is one of those things that can easily be added with a tone like this one and it can really help take your game to the next level next here's a super simple one emojis for textmesh pro this one adds actual emojis to text smh Pro so this is not just a Sprite pack with this you can copy paste actual emojis like text emojis you can copy paste them into regular text objects and they won't be rendered perfectly it comes with a prebuilt Sprite asset with the most popular emojis but also allows you to create custom Sprite asset if you want to use some different icons basically it's a simple tool that does exactly what it says if you have some kind of chat system in your game then this could be a nice way to make it a little bit more special then here we have one to help you polish up your world it's some Cloud Shadows this lets you create clouds of various shapes and then you can watch your shadows that those clouds cast directly on the floor this is one of those really subtle things that you never really notice but as soon as you add it you do see a massive difference you can modify a ton of properties on the clouds you can make them thicker or thinner move fast or slow you can change the color the randomness the animation and tons of more parameters really this is a great way to make your world feel much more alive up next here's a great one for helping you keep track of your time now for me a long time ago I did use to track my time I had a program that would track every single second although nowadays since I'm pretty much working all the time I don't really use it anymore but a tool like this one can be quite useful especially if you're making games on the side and you really want to keep track of how much time it takes you to build something this one is a simple tool that tracks time both active and idle it tracks the start and end times and then shows it all in some nice graphs and pie charts then for another relatively simple one here is a Color Picker UI it does exactly what you want lets you pick some colors it includes a bunch of templates so you can pick the one that you want this one is a great tool to include alongside some kind of modding tools in your game you can use it to let the player custom their player character player color logo color or really anything then here's a tool designed to help solve something that every game has to deal with which is bootstrapping just with a few clicks you can define a bootstrap scene and execute essential code before starting the regular gameplay so things like for example a sound manager or a music manager object or maybe in multiplayer game something like a network manager you really need those objects to be initialized before going into regular gameplay with tool like this one you can easily automate that process by simply implementing an interface and then it will automatically make sure those objects are initialized before the game play so this looks like a nice and simple tool to solve a really common problem next every game has tutorials which you need to build in some way so here's a tool to help that you define each tutorial stage you run some custom code on stage start or end then Define all the conditions to complete that stage you can easily make it based on some distance between two objects make it based on time clicks or really trigger it manually with the events for the stage start and end you can easily set up some visuals to guide the player throughout the tutorial there's a bunch of tools like this one and this one seems to be one of the better with a really nice watch then if you normally work on multiple objects this tool sounds really great it helps you link multiple projects together and then you can share assets between them so basically you share a folder and in that folder you place whatever assets you want and all the projects that are linking to that folder all of them can use the same assets this can be super useful to save space if you use the same assets all over the place in several projects so this one looks like a pretty simple to use but also very capable all right so that's the top 10 new systems and tools now on to the top 20 new visuals list all right so so starting off with a really nice looking pack for making an RTS or a tower defense game every time I see one of these packs it makes me want to make an RTS but then I remember that genre takes a massive amount of work and I'm already so busy so I can't really do it but if you do have the time and you want to make an RTS then a pack like this is perfect you've got tons of units all with some really nice animations there's eight Towers each with three levels of upgrades there's various buildings vehicles and planes all with some really nice colors which you can obviously recolor for multiple players or maybe you need a really high quality really unique Mech TRex look at this one I love the model it's an excellent look excellent style and it also comes with some great looking animations this dev has tons more mechanical dinosaurs so with a bunch of these maybe you can build something like Horizon zero Dawn then if you have some voxon prototype that you'd like to build check out this one it features a ton of cube like objects that you can use to build entire worlds you could either use this to make some premade Maps or you can give them to the player alongside some kind of building system to build something like Minecraft features a little bit of of everything with some very unique biomes next if you need a great modern UI pack check out this one all of it is very modern very clean very slick you've got lots of bars and Frames you've got various buttons toggles and Sliders it also includes some editor scripts so you can really modify everything to your heart content or if that's too modern and you want something a bit more medieval check out this one it's a modular Town pack you've got tons of objects over 300 meshes some VFX and decals all in a really good looking realistic style the demo scene includes an entire town with enem objects and fully interal buildings so this is one of those packs where if you just enjoy building things and you can just have fun with this pack without even having to make an entire game next if you need some VFX look at this one you've got over 200 effects there's lots of fire lots of smoke then also some really nice beams some explosions and all kinds of RS adding some great VFX is a super easy way to polish your games so definitely pick up a large pack like this one to really make your game stand out then if you're making a game in Japan check out this one personally I've never been to Japan I'd love to go someday but based on all the anime that I've seen this perfectly matches exactly what I imagine it features a ton of objects of all types everything you need to make an entire town or an entire city you've got lots of Apartments houses and shops you've got plenty of signs flowers cars and trains also you can build a really nice world and then just play around then here's a very expensive but a really great one it's a highly realistic Anatomy pack I've seen a bunch of these packs and I'm always fascinated I guess people buy these packs to make all kinds of medical apps with unity this is all super realistic and I assume it's all medically accurate at least based on what I know from working out all the muscles seem to be correct it's interesting how the fat distribution for the model seems to have something like 8% body fat in the ABS but then 15% legs so pretty much just like a fitness influencer you've got more shapes to modify the size for all kinds of organs view all the details about the muscle fat heart blood circulation and really anything certainly a very unique thing all with super high quality 8K textures then if there's a bike game you'd like to make check out this one it features a bunch of super bikes they all look seriously awesome I know nothing about bikes all I know is that these look really cool the pack is set on low poly but the models are actually quite detailed it features five Super bikes all with separated parts for easy animation and it even includes some nice speed and RPM dashboards then if you need tons of animations check out this boxing pack it's got quite a huge amount over 350 animations for really all kinds of scenarios you've got lots of quick Jabs some huge punches you've got some serious knockdowns some Get Up animations some dodges and really powerful finishers it also includes some nice win Victory or defeat animations so this would be perfect for a boxing game or really just some kind of beat him up next here we have the latest cyti pack this one came out in late October right on Halloween and it very much fits that theme it starts off nice and normal during the daytime and then at night it turns into a very spooky horror Carnival right away this reminds me of playing Left for Dead that mission on that Carnival with the gnome really fun times this pack is in their signature gorgeous low poly style it features tons of objects bu buildings characters props and even a working feris wheel and Mero round then if you need some explosions check out this one all are really high quality very realistic with some 3D Volume there's some nice fire and then some satisfying smoke this was all created using fluid simulation so it's all very accurate if you just need one high quality unique character then check out this one it's a modern Samurai it's a really nice high quality model and it's all fully rigged so it works with any animations you can add some cloth physics for the trench coat or just grab that really gorgeous nice sword then for another spooky thing here is an apocalyptic Hospital definitely very spooky abandoned hospitals are always very creepy you could just use this demo scene directly if you need some kind of nice new level for your game whether it be horror mystery or something next if you're working on a pirate game check out this one it's a huge pack with a ton of assets all in a really nice slow poly style it's got some really very inviting colors the pack is giant with a ton of unique locations there's a Castle Island and a bunch more you've got ships trading and a bunch more things so if you're a fan of something like Black Flag or you want to make your own Skull and Bones before Ubisoft does it then check this one out then here's a very fun one a really fancy golden rabbit definitely very strange very unique model these kinds of super custom assets always make me wonder just how many games would work with this it seems like something that is extremely custom it's got multiple skins it's fully rigged with a whole bunch of animations so perhaps this could be your player or perhaps just a fun unique companion next if you need a water Shader check out this one it's some really nice stylized water it looks really good and it's interactive it's got a mountain of parameters to get it working exactly as you want it then if you need tons and tons of materials check out this mega pack it's got a little bit of everything so

fire lots of stuff and it also has lots of crafted weapons so swords Shields pistols and rifles so a pack like this one definitely makes you want to build some kind of blacksmith tycoon game then if you'd like to make a nice and inviting medieval game check out this one it features tons of modular pieces to build any level you want you've got Towers catapult some pretty cute soldiers and some
