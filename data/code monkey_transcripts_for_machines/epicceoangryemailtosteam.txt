UA host Court dos reveal epic CEO's anger at seams 30% fees so this is an interesting email from the CEO of Epic that has just been revealed it has to do with the valve wfire lawsuit that has been going on for quite some time now I first heard about it on the game discover code newsletter basically this lawsuit has to do with selling steam keys and how valve is enforcing pricing parody and anyways whenever there's a lawsuit there's the discovery phase where all kinds of things become public in this case internal valve data and emails are part of this suit and from that came this email and S off with an email from Gabe new to Tim Sweeny of Epic where he just said anything we doing to annoy you T which Tim replies how generally the economics of the 30% platform fees are no longer justifiable how there was a good case for them in the early days but the scale is now high and operation costs have been driven down while the turn of new game releases so fast that the brief marketing or UA value the storefront provides is far disproportionate to the fee and then one interesting slightly depressing stat if you subtract out the top 25 games for scam I bet valve made more profit from most of the next 1,000 and developers themselves made that's definitely a pretty depressing stat it simply comes from the case that so many games are unprofitable whereas valve themselves by now their business is definitely extremely profitable so when a developer puts a game on Steam steam themselves make money right away whereas the developer first needs to recoup death costs and over here Tim goes on to say how Val takes 30% for distribution then they have to spend 30% on Facebook Google Twitter for UA user acquisition or traditional marketing 10% on servic cost 5% on engine so the system takes 75% and that leaves 25% for actually creating the game worse than retail distribution economics in the '90s and for a bit of context this email is actually dated back in 2017 this was actually before they had the epic game store at the time Paragon was still alive and fortnite was still in its infancy considering how much it has grown since then he continues so I believe the question of why distribution still takes 30% on the open PC platform on the open internet is a healthy topic for public discourse now I do think the 30% this topic is definitely worthy of being discussed whether it's fair not in today's age especially considering what he mentions on how nowadays there are so many games coming out that steam doesn't really give you that much visibility by default I'll tell you my own thoughts on this debate in a little bit I have something of a hot take on this topic but I'm hoping you'll help me out so these are definitely some interesting points however this is not the angry email this is the much more tame one the second email was still somewhat tame this was on November 26 2018 so about a year after that one so on this one team Sweeny revealed to G new how on December 4th or 5th epic will announce a new store host on Epic games.com so the epic game store they announc that with a permanent 88 12% Revenue split definitely much more generous than the 30% that seam takes they mention how they're going to launch it publish it on the game awards how the store is engine agnostic so any engine supposedly can work on the store this all also happened before the epic games versus Apple lawsuit where they updated their IOS app in order to bypass Apple's fees they basically included the link where you could buy vbucks directly from their own website which would mean they don't have to pay app on their 30% cut that's what eventually triggered this lawsuit but anyways all of this happened before that and over here back in 2018 Tim was already thinking about that and it was exactly based on this that he sent the message to gab new apparently on this email his goal was to actually ask valve to modify their own steam cut and in doing so basically Prov that things can work with lower cut which in turn would put pressure on Apple to lower their cut as well what it mentions here what we need right now is enough developer press and platform momentum to sear Apple towards fully opening up the iOS sooner rather than later a timely move by Valve to improve steam's economics for all developers would make a great difference and all of this clearly demonstrating that store competition leads to better rates for all developers epic would gladly speak in support of such a move anytime conversely if valve made unannounced Revenue sharing changes that favored big Publishers over Indies the implication would be that software distribution economics ought to be defined by negotiating power in backro deals between companies in that world companies like apple can keep their closed platforms and just pay off big Publishers to St Island not good and this line is actually really interesting talking about unannounced Revenue sharing changes that favored big public over Indies it's kind of interesting how this is from an email apparently titled from November 26 2018 and then in December 1st 2018 on that day steam announced this so new Revenue shared te and other updates with steam distribution agreement basically this is doing exactly that so basically it's giving a much better deal to Big Publishers as opposed to small Indies so like it says here we've created new Revenue shareed tiers for games that hit certain Revenue levels starting from October 1st 2018 when a game makes over $10 million on seam the revenue share for that application will adjust to 7520 25 as opposed to 7030 on earnings Beyond 10 million at 50 million the revenue share will adjust to 8020 on earnings Beyond 50 million and all this Revenue includes game packages DLC and game sales and so on our hope is this change will reward the positive Network effect generated by developers of big games figing their interests with steam and the community this was definitely an interesting change and pretty much the opposite of what most people wanted obviously with myself being an indie game developer I would prefer to see this going the other way so basically taking a lower cut from smaller Indies as opposed to giving a much better deal to already massive corporations but then again valve is a forprofit company so while it does suck from their point of view of just making as much money as possible obviously this makes more sense and then we get to the really angry email from December 3rd 2018 so over here team Sweeney talks about the announcement going live tomorrow that is the announcement talking about the Epic gam store and how that's finally going live and he mentions how later this week we'll be escalating a conversation with apple the issue was about the iOS platform fee so the question of open platforms and store economics will be foremost on Apple exx mines this week I believe the best outcome can be achieved if Apple speedily concludes that the combination of an app store Monopoly and 30% fees is untenable and that opening iOS up is the best stoploss strategy then here comes the really part right now UA holes are telling the world that the strong and powerful get special terms so that's that special deal while 30% is for the little people we're all in for a prolonged battle if Apple tries to keep their Monopoly and 30% by cutting back room deals with big Publishers to keep them quiet which by the way spell alert is what has happened since then so why not give all developers a better deal what better way is there to convince Apple quickly that their model is now totally untenable so yeah team was definitely very angry about having to pay 30% to both Apple Google valve whatever he feels that it's way too much and especially considering how much money fortnite makes I can imagine how difference between 10% and 30% are millions and millions of dollars however on this topic I have I guess what is a little bit of a hot take this whole argument makes it seem like seam does absolutely nothing 200 30% and going back to his argument on how there are so many new game releases and based on that the very brief Market that you get from launching a new game on Steam that one does not seem worth the cost however I would argue as both a developer and a player steam is still extremely valuable it already has a huge Library it's already really easy to use it's got user reviews which are Super useful there are Community forums there's a place to add some really useful guides you have the Steam Workshop which is really awesome for so many games by comparison the Epic gam store doesn't have all of that even after all this time you can ask any player and they won't tell you that they much prefer steam because it is objectively just a better service and as a developer is simply the case that seam is is really massive with millions of monthly active users the price access those users which steam has gathered for the past 20 years by building their ecosystem the price ACC is this massive audience the price that they defined is 30% so personally given all that as a developer well obviously I wish the 30% cut was much lower if they lowered it from 30 to 10% that would be objectively a great thing however even at 30% I still think that it's a good deal and let me say why back when I made my first game in 2012 Survivor Squad back then I finished the game in about six months so around July of 2013 back then I finished the game and I put it up for sale directly on my own website and as you might expect selling a game directly on a unknown game website the final result was maybe like 10 copies sold in a first week obviously that's not really great back then Steam Greenlight was still a thing so over many months I was gathering votes and hoping to finally get on Steam and when I finally did on the first week I sold something like 1,000 copies so that really is the massive difference between posting your game on your own a website that no one knows or going onto a platform like steam that has over 20 years of gathering players from all kinds of games and if you just put a game on seam you are potentially exposed to a massive huge audience so this is really the AG on question do you prefer to keep a high percentage of a smaller number or a lower percentage of a much much bigger number value is really always subjective 30% can be a low or a high number but personally I don't necessarily see it as an unfair number the reason for that is simply because I've seen what happens when I get 100% of the revenue but try to sell to a tiny tiny audience the results were really not good I would not be doing Game Dev as living if I could only sound directly on my my website whereas over here on seam I can pay 30% to access the massive seam audience alongside their very robust ecosystem so personally given what I've experience myself I do think that steam is definitely quite valuable and I do think the entire ecosystem is worth the cost maybe 30% is a bit High maybe it should be 20% instead like I said value is subjective but I do disagree with the notion that some people like Tim compared steam to just a payment processor like Visa or Mastercard those payment processors usually take a 3 to 5% fee seem is worth a lot more because does a lot more more than just Payment Processing if you just Implement a Visa widget on your own website if you do that you don't really get any access to any audience whereas on Steam you get access to a massive audience and tons of tools that have helped me personally make a living from my indie games for the past 10 years so while of course I wish they would lower their cut to make something much better despite that if seam did not exist and I would not be doing this as a job so that is why even though I do wish the cut was lower even so I still think that being on Steam is objectively a good thing so we'll see one day change how Revenue works if I had to guess I would say probably not like I said they are a forprofit company so while technically the best thing would be to do the opposite of what they did meaning take a much lower cut from super small Indies in order to have those Indies who barely have enough money to be able to keep a little bit more if the goal is to make as much money as possible then obviously what they did is objectively the right move so personally if I was gab new if I was the billionaire owner of seam that's exactly what I would do I would definitely lower the cut in order to make it pretty much 0% from let's say the first $10,000 I think that would be really awesome for supporting Indie devs but see is a massive company and really their main goal is just make money so I really don't expect that to change anytime soon but do let me know in the comments what do you think about the 30% seam cut and importantly let me know what do you think about the cut and if you have ever tried publishing games off steam I think that's a really important point because obviously lower would be better but if you've tried selling games off steam then you've probably seen the value there is of being on Steam
