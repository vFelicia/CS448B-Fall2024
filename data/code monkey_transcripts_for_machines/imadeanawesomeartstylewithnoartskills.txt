hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here's a very interesting unique look that I made by combining some Assets Now as you might know I am a programmer I'm definitely not an artist and something else you might know since I'm constantly talking about it is if you want to find success with your games you really need to stand out marketing is the most important thing for Success nowadays you need to send out both in terms of mechanics but also in terms of visuals so for me I cannot make interesting unique art assets but what I can do is make some interesting assets to end up with something that really looks quite awesome that's basically the idea that I had when I first saw the CNT Humble Bundle with a bunch of art tests and tools this bundle is really awesome it has tons of awesome self with a huge 98 discount there's also another bundle cell active this one is all about tools I highly recommend you check out both bundles this one ends in just a few days so the Earth bundle here has a Cynthia low poly pack which I'm always a huge fan of their style and then there's also this really interesting shaded tone con equipment this one helps you create an anime inspired sound shading look so I thought about combining both of them to achieve an interesting look however when I tried that it didn't exactly work out here is equivalently with the official equivalently demo scene it looks really great the character the background everything looks really awesome and then here is a character from The Cynthia low poly pack and now if I apply the equipment material yep there you go this is normal this would quickly so you can see quite a big difference and depending on the angle it can look good but from a lot of angles it actually looks quite odd now personally I don't like how the Highlight changes so drastically that happens basically because the asset is intentionally low poly so there's not enough polygons for the shading to smoothly change although I should Orient that in the material itself you can enable or disable the rim so if you disable that then it looks a bit like this although I think for a sound shade look it really does need the rim Bissell equivalently is more meant for high polygon Assets in order to benefit from that sound shading look so for example the bundle here also includes a nice little pack with a bunch of dragons here are two dragons from the asset pack this one looks extremely realistic and this one is realistic High probably but a bit more cartoony so on these ones if I do apply the equivalent Shader yep I do think that this doesn't look right this is quite a big change both on that one as well as on this one so on these high polygon models I do think quickly does look quite great you can see as the models move around the highlights no longer change quite drastically now like I said this has tons of options so you can enable or disable the outline you can change the color you can change these thickness and so on you can enable or disable the rim light so tons of options for modifying this Shader as you can see equivalently it doesn't look great if you have high poly assets with complex textures but not so much for a low poly however the bundle has lots of us himself including another art tool this one called Pro pixelizer what this one is is basically a Shader to pixelate your characters and in doing so it also creates a sort of sound shaven look so back on my synthy character here it is using the standard Universal Shader now if I apply the pixel light Shader and you better go quite a nice difference this shade is meant to add a pixelated effect however over here on the settings you can modify the pixel size so you can make it really insanely blocky so if that's what you're looking for but for me personally I'm not a huge fan of super insanely pixel art so for me I can lower it down and pretty much end up with just a really nice cell shaded Shader then this shade also has a bunch more options so I can play around with the outline color make it white red and so on I can play around with the edge highlight which is all of these lines inside personally I think this one looks really great either in black or over here in white I think this one looks really nice so with this visual style I do think that the character over here looks pretty great and here it is applied to all the other assets from this pack so as you can see all the shields of them look great all the web weapons here of them got this nice downlized look whilst not looking too pixelated so I quite like this style I think this one looks pretty great pretty unique it can be applied to every single mesh as you can see then I can also apply that same Shader to some visual effects included in the bundles also this one with a bunch of VFX so here it is one where I add that Shader to make it also a bit pixelized so the Rocks over there the trail everything looks really nice with that bit of deterring for the transparency and by the way for the animations here I'm also using this animation pack from the bummel so if I take that and then I place my characters over here on this gorgeous tune fantasy metal if I do that then here is everything combined looking pretty great now if you post a screenshot of your game looking like this you would definitely send out from the crowd personally I think this town looks quite gorgeous and here are all of them side by side so this one on the left this one is using the equivalent Shader this one in the center this one is using the regular urp Shader and this one on the right this one is using Pro pixelizer so you can see all of them with very distinct Styles doing in the center using the standard Shader this one is pretty standard the one who equivalently does have some more pronounced some lines and then the one with pixelate has a really nice black outline some really nice white in the center and so on so I think this one looks really nice so personally I'm quite happy with these results I think it's pretty unique and it's very easy to do by just combining some assets and if instead you have some high poly meshes then I think quickly can indeed look great like I mentioned both these shaders equivalent Pro pixelizer both of them have tons of options you can play around with so you can enable or disable the outlines you can add highlights add more or less pixelation more and less color bending and so on so both of them are really great for adding a bit of extra on top of your visual assets okay so this was just a fun quick video on what you could build using the assets from the bundles like I said for me I'm not an artist so without this I would only be able to make some basic cubes so being able to add some proper art and make some awesome looking effects and shaders doing that is really great like I said nowadays the trickiest part to making it as an indie game developer is standing out from the crowd so for that I'm quite pleased with the results of this experiment I think this style of using low only assets with a pixel chair on top I think this one looks really good it would definitely help your game stand out from the ground if you want to try it out for yourself check out both panels Linked In the description they have a massive discount 98 off so if just one of these assets looks interesting then the whole thing is worth it I can highly recommend both of them these bundles only happen once or twice a year so make sure you don't miss out this one the tools bundle ends in just a few days and the art bundle ends next week also those links are filmed links so if you pick them up you get some awesome assets and I get a nice commission alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
