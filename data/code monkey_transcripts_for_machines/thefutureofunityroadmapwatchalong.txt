e e e e e all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day so Unity has just released this video so it's a Unity 6 uh GDC road map talk so I figured let's watch it together I'll share my thoughts and we'll see we'll see what's the future I mean because I haven't seen it yet so I don't know what they're going to announce so this should be fun okay let me just unmute meet everything and yeah let's see if it should be interesting okay has any of you already seen it it's been about 3 hours so yeah all right so yeah Bas let's see it then if I have anything to say I'll pause comment and whatever okay so let me just uh put uh kind of like that okay great all right okay so yep let's put it on and let's see before we get started here's our Safe Harbor statement this is just a legal statement explaining that you should still do your homework when you choose your Tech so welcome to unity's developer Summit and game developer conference 2024 today I'm grateful to be able to present along with a very talented crew our road map for 2024 and maybe a bit of a tease to look Beyond last year we announced the next version of the unity engine Unity 6 and promised it would boost your productivity and give you the ability to create more immersive worlds with more players more objects more assets than you've been able to Target before for today's talk we decided to look at Unity 6 a little differently and rather than divide this talk up into individual products or features we looked at areas of game creation that you asked us about the most so that's what we'll see today oh that sound like a great way to set up the GDC talk right and by the way just in case you don't know uh I believe they've already uh released the uh preview version which I assume I believe it's the tech version learning about the new version is a bit tricky but I think I think uh un6 has already been the beta has already been uh around for a while and now they've got the preview version which I believe is the equivalent to the tech so I have to confirm that but yeah I think that is correct so yeah if you want to try out6 yeah pretty much after this live stream you can go ahead download and give it a shot that's pretty much what I'm going to do but yeah let's see before we dig in let's take a look at what oh right Away Great stat 60% are using the 22 LTS that's really awesome yeah it's uh although at the same time that's 40% not using LTS I wonder what those are using I guess that's just using older LTS but yeah basically uh if when in doubt using latest LTS that's usually what you should do what's been happening recently we released Unity 22 LTS last year and the adoption of this latest version has been incredible in February more than 60% of all actively worked on projects were done so in unity 22 LTS and what's been gratifying is that along with the sheer number of projects being worked on is the fact that we've also improved the quality of the engine in big wies and we're seeing less issues reported over time compared to previous versions we continue to release a new build every every two weeks and I want to confirm that we will support Unity 22 LTS in production for some time to come ensuring that you can have the confidence to continue to build your projects until you launch turning our eyes towards Unity 6 there are more than 50 major features being updated wow okay that's a lot of stuff okay so address BS lots of Android stuff buil profiles okay that's cool character hair and skin improvements that looks awesome crash analytics that's cool dedicated server that's awesome server host distribute to Authority this is really awesome for making multiplayer games dot swapable physics engines wow that's something physx experiment on web GP support on the last uh unite conference a lot of people were cheering for this so yeah this is some pretty big stuff GPU lightmapper a lot of GPU stuff meta web multiplayer oh multiplayer Center a this is awesome this was on the latest unite this is a way to put all the multiplayer tools together in one thing so that's really interesting real integration recording so yeah tons and tons of stuff they added to the editor and along with hundreds of minor improvements across the editor there are thousands of you using Unity 6 beta and with unity 6 preview just around the corner fully supported in production you've got a chance to get your hands on with much of what we'll share with you in this talk in just a few weeks let's take a look at what some of you and other creators have been creating with unity this last year ask your questions about your dreams and memories e wow that's really awesome every time I see one of these showcase the main thing that comes to mind is really just the versatility so many games all of them look so so awesome and so and they are so different like action games FPS games top down games asimetric games there are AR VR and right away valheim I haven't played valheim in about two years so yeah definitely would like to get back to that it's really really awesome the amount of variety that developers can build with the engines just so incredible to see so many different visual Styles genres and platforms represented by everyone here and I'm looking forward to what's next so these are the five topics we're going to cover today creating the most immersive worlds possible leveraging the efficient game creation tools our full endtoend multiplayer solution our platform support and through all of this making sure your games are performing great so with that let's dive in so we hear you you need to create deeply immersive worlds to entice your players to play you want the most scalable and efficiently rendered visuals you can get without sacrificing performance and you need ways to create worlds that draw even the most demanding players in we also learned that immersion isn't just Graphics it's the ability to have your worlds react to players in Dynamic ways in real time along with many other things so to begin I'd like to introduce Matthew who's going to give a rundown of what we're doing with a rendering pipelines and with speed Tre to give you scalable immersive experiences so hi everyone my name is Matthew Miller and I'm product manager for graphics now I talk about creating imersive worlds in the past few years uh we've been incrementally building our rendering Technologies called Script on the pipelines and that most of you already probably and we've been consolidating on one side the common set of functionalities so that we have a better parity across the pipelines improved performance customization visual Fidelity and artist tooling and on the other side we've been reinforcing the unique value of each render pipeline so for Universal render pipeline Studd rendering VR rendering uh optimize mobile performance and customizability and for hdrp it is uh improving physically based rendering and en so with uh all these features coming 6 oh it's interesting right away saying that the buildin render pipeline so it is maintained along the unity 6 cycle so it's actually interesting that they're specifically focusing on that while at the same time focusing on these two so these are going to be default un6 okay so yeah I wonder if they're going to show stats on how many how many developers are using urp versus uh the bued runer pipeline because last time I saw those stats those were still like s like only 50% using urp orrp and S like 50% on the build and run pipeline so I wonder by making that default I wonder if that is going to change in the future but yeah interesting we think that srps are the right place to start with your project so there will be defaults in unit6 and the builin render by planine uh builin render will be still available and maintain all along the n6 cycle uh which will be a longer cycle than the classical LS oh that's also an interesting one longer than the cor TTS I don't think they've mentioned what is in the future because now since they've gone away from the number scheme so we can expect we can no longer expect a new Unity version every single year so I wonder so this thing longer than current LTS so I wonder if Unity 7 is going to be like I don't know 2026 2027 so yeah interesting to see this little hint so on Steam oh um in like 90% of the games that were shied released in 2023 already use srps uh a third hdrp and third urp for 3D games that I served for urp oh okay so it's already at 90% I thought it was quite a bit less okay so only 10% are using builtin okay so that's interesting I'm pretty sure I've seen these numbers before it was like 50 so I wonder is that a huge boost or am I just misremembering it I don't know but that's and more than 50% uh of the XR and mobile games also use this it's based on all this production feedback that we've been shaping uh 22 LTS and community6 but being used in production doesn't mean it's easy to learn so we wanted to provide you with uh all the materials to get started so first it's a ur3 samples uh they are available the unity up directly and it's four scenes with four visual side to get you uh started to be able to deploy a wide range of platforms from XR mobile to PC then it's a 2d happy harvest project showcasing 2D lighting 2D shadow style maps and a lot of the urp Tod renderer features and finally because building a game is a lot about customization uh each of our rendering package contain samples that you can find on the package manager in the editor with a lot of examples of custom Shad graph custom bfx render passes lens players but over all the features yeah and by the way all of those are downloadable so if you haven't seen any of these definitely go ahead and check it out I believe they're all available from the unity Hub so the urp scene sample this one is really awesome has tons of interesting scenes all with different rendering so this really great if you're into 2D the happy harvest I hav made an overview on this project this is all really awesome and the samples is something that I've been meaning to look at for ages cuz it looks like it has a lot of really interesting graphic stuff so yeah if you're interested in any of these these are all downloadable stuff so definitely check it out afterwards R passes lens players but over all the features uh performance is always the number one user request if you've not watched it yet we I recommend watching the keynote uh from unite 2023 and in particular uh the fantasy Kingdom demo in unity 6 where it's showcasing uh the the performance improvements that we're bringing by the way um we spent more uh like the majority of our development resources uh on improving performance and it we we have three groundbreaking advancement the first one is the GPU resident drawer which totally changes the way that we are processing the scene and sending it to the GPU so uh we Leverage paration on the CPU and we store it into buffers so that it's stored uh and it processed directly on the GPU um and since the sces are now more processed on the GPU we could add GPU occlusion coding which will discard uh automatically at each frame the nonvisible geometry and finally to be able to render at 4K or with high shading quality or post processing quality on mobile uh we are introducing our own crossplatform temporal post processing uh Ator um which is called STP for special temporal post processing and this allows to render at a small percentage of the frame resolution and upscale is a final resolution with a little L of visual FID yeah these three things are really awesome I mean I am not a graphics program so I'll have anything in which I just take a button and everything runs 100% faster so these are really awesome the GPU resident drawer these showed some really insane results back when they showed it on un6 at unite last year same thing for the GPU cusion calling and on STP in case you don't know this is an upscaler so basically you can render your game at let's say half or quarter resolution then basically Auto UPS uh upscales the the entire image up to 4K or 1080p something like that and basically it looks really awesome so yeah all these three are basically things that you can just take one box and your game runs much faster personally as someone who is not a graphics program these are the kind of features that I definitely love to see take one box everything runs faster awesome uh in unity uh extensibility is key so we uh we wanted to mix extensibility with performance and sometime it can be challenging and that's what Rog graph is for uh so the urp that's what the urp Rog graph is for so the randog graph allows to order uh the random passes so that uh you can optimize the memory usage which optimizes the memory bandwidth as well for better per per and but also for uh improving uh the battery consumption which is very important for mobile but it's also yeah that's another thing by the way which is if you improve performance not only does your game run faster if you cap the frame rate that it either you make it run faster you make it take less power which in terms of mobile means it's uh uses up less battery so it lasts longer so even if you don't like even if you don't need Extreme Performance then it still benefits you if you're making mobile games and need battery uh okay customizability framework so you can uh extend the pipeline through yourp uh runner bath uh while leveraging these low level optimizations now it's also easy for technical artists to extend the PIP planine uh with SH graph and create their own custom post process effect for example and for bfx artist they are not limited to the set of nodes and blocks that we are providing with vxb because now they can create custom hlsl blocks to create their own system for example blogs or custom simulations but extending and optimizing requires uh good tooling we provide already a lot of tools but we're introducing three um more tools the first one is a run bar view so that you can monitor the different R passes like the full uh rendering framework is available now you can see it in this tool and you can monitor as well uh the memory and the frame resources usage then uh yeah so basically this not this one I believe it's a brand new view because they've had the the frame debuger for quite a while that shows you all the steps that render the scene and I believe this one is more organized by each render pass so I believe it's like a an upgrade on that one so it should be really interesting how basically you can see each render pass what it is doing especially if you have custom render pass you want to see how long that specific render pass is taking so rather than just seeing the order seeing how long so in terms of optimizing for graphics it should be quite useful the Shad graph heat map and the VFX graph profiling tools allow to profile and optimize inside a Shader or inside a VF on the visual Fidelity side um we uh one groundbreaking advancement is adaptive Pro volumes or apvs and it's a system uh for Global elimination that works across a wide wch of platforms and scales very well so it's a prob based system of like prebaked in the editor with automatic placement for fast iteration and per vtex or per pixel lighting for great visual quality and uh and performance this is definitely the the number one feature that I'm looking forward to Adaptive for volumes this basically uh basically real time Global illumination and it's a way technically I think it's not real time technically because you need uh probes and you need to bake them but I think you can make them real time I think so I'm not not 100% sure but basically you can just again take a box and automatically place all the probes so you don't have to manually place the probes it baks them all and everything gets some really gorgeous uh Global illumination so this definitely one of the main features that I'm definitely looking out for it also supports large worlds uh with an integrated streaming system and supports different lighting scenarios and Sky occlusion and so that you can as well create a different time of the day or blend between them and having a continuous time of and both uh adaptive Pro volumes and the classical light Maps now rely on a newly architectural light Baker which is lever leveraging the GPU while still uh running on machines with only two gabt of uh GPU memory so that you have better accessibility one I baking and while getting the performance for the environment artists when you want to create a the high DT environment uh most of like most of the time you need to have good sky and good water so we introduced a new new water system in hdrb 2020s and we are uh wrapping up uh this system with new features uh with currents for generator deformers excluders as well as uh better line rendering water light rendering and it's all very easy to use thanks to the samples in the package manager the demos that we are providing as well ah this one looked really awesome I was waiting for for him to say and now it's also available on urp but it didn't say that so yeah I think that that really awesome water system is still just for agrp which kind of sucks but I get it because it looks really gorgeous so yeah I guess it must need some specific hrp features and for the sky uh we wanted to add the support of time of day as we mentioned already for apbs so we added night sky we improved sunset and sunrise I think was a mayor and uh improve the atmospher atmospheric scattering quality and performance by adding it directly into the sky system so that it works uh at longer distance than other the clouds as well so then you need to populate this world and often you need a lot of vegetation and bance of this ve vegetation um so we read this 39.5 last year with new tools for example the front sections which allows to procedurally uh generate viance of leaves or with a cutout idor to better uh process your um your texture atlases uh or the projectile system which for example to project mushrooms as we see on the image or snow on top of your vegetation and it's all uh well integrated in nt6 there is a new importer uh which directly allows to load uh the speed 39 files and assets and we improve as well performance so you can more vegetation at runtime thanks to integrating speed Tre into the GPU resident drawer that I was mentioning previously and the integration of the speit 29 game win system which entirely runs on the GPU so we are already working on spit 10 which we be uh releasing later this year with again more tools uh to create more organic options such as admin spine tools for example or more procedural workflows so that you can trim and shape your trees and all this is coming uh in a a new editor with a better ux and modernized ux uh for Speed Tre so with this uh I speed Tre is always an amazing thing like I I can't believe there's such a complex program just to make vegetation but it makes sense because so many games have so many trees but yeah it's something that is really really impressive to results that it makes but yeah something that in my case for making tiny IND the games doesn't doesn't really make much sense for my kind of work but I'm always amazed to see all the kinds of things like uh dragging something in order to cut the tree so it's always a fascinating tool it's really awesome to see how a two for such a supposedly somewhat Niche case but it's really insanely Advanced yeah really interesting Works uh for me Tre so with this uh I give the mic back to inro thanks Matthew speaking of generating immersive worlds we have to talk about the newest Unity product that launched last year Unity Muse Unity Muse is a suite of generative AI capabilities that allow you to generate original and copyright free Assets in editor thanks to our custombuilt responsibly trained model and as we continue to improve the underlying AI models you'll start to see better quality Sprite generation and more accurately stylized 2D images you may have already seen that we recently updated our Muse's texture model to provide better output quality stateoftheart material generation and more texture options and something we're really excited about are the 3D texture improvements that are shipping later this year or a yeah all of these uh the main thing that I'm interested in is over there improving Sprites because the first time that I used M Sprite Which was I don't know like six months ago so really early on I was definitely not very impressed with the Sprite tool so I'm happy to see that they're focused on quality while at the same time like you mentioned focused on not having issues with copyright so they're maintaining that thing so definitely happy to see that and this one over here the uh Muse texture this one has already improved quite significantly they made a blog post a few a few weeks ago a few days ago on talking about the improvements of muse texture from like version 1.0 from like 6 months ago to now version 2.0 or something and it did have some significant improvements so I'm definitely hoping for those same improvements apply to Sprite because usually Sprite that's what makes more sense to me and texture 3D I saw this one but I'm not a 3D modelist so I don't know specifically what this is it does look impressive like you give it a a 3D model and basically generates and applies the texture exactly what it should be so I'm not too sure but if any of you are 3D modelist I'm definitely curious to see just how useful this uh this little tool is because does seem the results at least seem quite good AI research team has pioneered a better way to create high resolution PBR textures from a prompt an input geometry or reference images and with this technology you can Auto texture full 3d assets with multiple PBR materials in a meaningful and controllable way and Beyond generating art we know that prototyping immers of Worlds with AI needs more than just St imagery to set up interactions Muse Behavior allows you to build decision trees in editor and provides AI to automatically generate the code needed to set up interaction behaviors to make the most of these interactions and motions Muse animate allows you to turn text prompts into animations that can be applied to humanoid characters we're also working on a new model for even more realistic actions and the ability to turn sketches and videos into character animations say all three these do sound extremely interesting I mean the behavior one for me personally I don't necessarily think so but I think for a lot of people especially less program personally I like to make simple St animation State uh ah State machines using Code so for me not really all that but I do believe that one you can generate and then convert into C code so that might be interesting but personally the one that I'm really interested in is Muse animate I mean there are so many cases in which you want to make a quick prototype and it's even if the accur has tons and tons of Animation it takes a lot of time in order to browse those animations and find the specific one you want so this one in order to quickly generate uh animations from text this one I'm really looking forward to and sound effects this one looks really awesome I mean I think this is the first time there they're announcing yet another texture to their yet another tool to their Muse tool stack so yeah generating sound effects I'd be curious to see what are the results on this yeah and lastly we can't forget the audio coming later this year Muse will allow for AI generated promp to sound effects such as movement and environmental science on the topic of AI let's get more advanced with centus centus is our neural engine that unlocks new previously impossible features in unity games because it enables you to run and import AI models you can hook it up once and deploy to any runtime Unity supported platform and we see it becoming an indispensable component of the engine just take a look at pleno a new and quirky game that uses Advanced gesture detection powered by AI models running on centus to unlock really unique interactions this deeper level of interaction creates a truly Dynamic environment so you by the way CES in case you don't know this is their uh tool for running uh inference engines directly on device so you don't need to uh like contact like with cat GPT you need to contact the open AI servers in order to make it work whereas this one does not need the Internet or anything at all so every time that I see send this I'm always amazed to see the potential that it could have but I'm still waiting to see some kind of killer app this one does seem quite interesting although very Niche being able to use machine learning in order to have gesture detection for finding all kinds of things so yeah it's a always interested in this to but still waiting to see some kind of killer app deeper level of interaction creates a truly Dynamic environment so you've created the world you're going to immerse your players in but you need the actual gameplay too and the user experience and doing it all as efficiently as possible including helping you and your team work better together productivity upgrades we've made across Unity 6 Empower you to create faster and more efficiently even with the additional functionality you'll see this week and we hear that creating these kinds of deeply immersive and engaging games you strive for often needs the ability to work together in a streamlined manner so I'd like to introduce Simon who's going to walk through some of the improvements we've made in this area absolutely but before we get into the shiny new tools and workflows we've also been working hard on the basics we're delivering many ways to get started and work faster on game projects on top of the new samples for urp that you've already heard about we're adding new presets on what we call projectwide actions in the input system package so that you don't have to keep setting up wsd again and again we're also introducing new tools to profile the job system better and to help you understand complex dependencies between many threads and jobs addressables are also getting better presets and platform defaults to save with repetitive setup tasks for asset bundles oh okay so all of these project wide input action I have to say whenever I do some kind of prototype I still use the input manager just because it is so easy to use you literally just write one line of code and works so yeah this one making it much easier to get started with the input system this could be a nice one maybe I'll start using that one even on prototypes if it if it comes with a with a preset thing that is already already handled by default that would be nice and yeah jobs profiling that is always nice cuz that one is always a little bit tricky and addressables haven't used them for a while but yeah well great tiny things to platform defaults to save with repetitive setup tasks for asset bundles and now for real step change AI offers great potential to assist you and your teams with basic tasks and use machine learning powered tools to get you to Solutions faster chat Sprite texture behavior and animate will all be available in Editor to complement your existing workflows oh right away that that is excellent news cuz it was always annoying always very strange how Muse chat you had to go outside into an external website so being able to have that in the editor that is definitely really awesome so right away really great Improvement as Muse continues to improve and expand you'll see these take on more in editor tasks with deeper integration one very exciting example of this is Muse chat with chat moving in editor it is becoming more project aware this means that soon you'll start to see responses Solutions and generated code that are directly tailored to your project there's also a whole ecosystem okay so that sounds really interesting putting uh Muse chat directly inside the editor and giving it information I'm very curious to see how exactly this one work so can I just say okay I'm trying to build a health system tell me how I would integrate on this complex project that is already built so that sounds very interesting I'm very curious to to test out the limits of just how project the where it is but right away sounds really good system of amazing AI Solutions out there and for trusted solutions that you want to use in your project access is going to be easier in the editor context via the Muse infrastructure so we're helping bring helpful AI Solutions closer to where you work today with all this new content you'll also need a better way to manage all these assets enter Unity Cloud Unity cloud centralizes content and streamlines workflows with connections between Unity asset manager Unity Version Control and the unity editor itself helping your team to create better games FAS and with less of a headache Unity asset manager provides a central asset repository for your studio to store organize discover and deploy content directly into Unity projects Unity Version Control provides Source control that handles large 3D files without uh any challenges of agility uh providing artists and developers with their own specific workflows to keep development moving Unity Cloud connects all these tools to the unity editor eliminating the time that's wasted currently switching between different applications searching for Content or trying to figure out who on Earth has that texture via slack or em oh right away those so these are not really tools that I use myself since I'm really just a solo IND developer so I really don't need these kinds of things but it's really awesome for for teams but more specifically I really like uh what he said specifically which is the goal is to put all these tools directly inside the editor so you don't have to constantly alab between going into different tools so even if I don't use this I I really like I really like that uh uh that way that Unity is going of trying to integrate everything into the editor making everything much more seamless I quite like that content we're trying to figure out who on Earth has that texture via slack or email as a preview of what's coming next in unity Cloud this year we'll continue to roll out new features from Unity asset manager such as versioning custom asset statuses to help you with complex pipelines broadcast editing and the ability to add comments and annotations also Al a new feature that enables users to track asset dependencies directly on the dashboard allowing you to improve your collaboration workflows we'll also remain focused on developing deeper Integrations with the unity editor and with unity Version Control to make it easier for teams to work together across projects and pipelines and rounding back on Graphics we've made it easier to create VFX and custom shaders to bring unique styles to your games many of you use Shader graph and VFX graph for multiple hours on a daily basis we're improving the user experience with tons of keyboard shortcuts for both better management of properties and keywords and faster undo Redo for Shader graph and improving attribut spackboard and node search for VFX graph the new VFX graph template system allows you to create a new effect faster and make it easier to share your own VFX library with the rest of your team oh wow I I quite like that one about having various presets for VFS effect ref that sounds really awesome cuz there are so many times in which I'm making a brand new project for some kind of tutorial that I want to make and I want to make some kind of explosions with particles and I always have to rebound that from scratch because I never have I've never really prepared my own Library so having these templates these sound really awesome and all these improvements again tiny things that make you work quite a lot better so yeah I'm I'm quite a big fan of this section of the road map so far effect faster and make it easier to share your own VFX library with the rest of your team we didn't just stop a quality of life either for VFX uh or at smoothing the learning curve we've also added new features that let UI artists use Shader graph to create Dynamic and responsive UI Styles and visual effects artists take full advantage of VFX graph with the urp rendering Pipeline and to round out this chapter on more efficient tooling let's look back at Ai and talk about improvements we're making around cenus now not everyone is an ml expert so we're working to make centus more accessible in January we launched an integration with hugging face tagging models that we we've validated with unity centers and precon converting them to the centus format you can import them directly into the editor and they just work of course there are also seear samples to go along with these if you do want to tweak your models for performance or capabilities or maybe you are an ml expert we've got a graph tool to help make that more efficient as well ingame models have to run fast hitting 100 plus frame rate targets uh even with relatively low GPU budgets chances are you might have used all the GPU for some of those fancy rendering features we showed you earlier to speed up inference we are supporting the new neural chipsets if your end users have a neural processing unit on their device then STIs will automatically take advantage of that extra compute and last oh that sounds quite interesting so basically I wonder how many devices are uh have those kinds of neuron chips I don't think they're they're quite that available just yet but basically for the future and sounds really interesting and really awesome is over here the hugging face integration with unity sent Stacks that one sounds really awesome because I have I've brows hugging face but I haven't really use it too much so it all seems quite a bit uh complicated machine learning is always very complex so yeah having something where I can just see okay this just works just plug in play download this model make it work that sounds like a really great Improvement to make sence much easier to use lastly we recently added quantization support which converts huge model weights from high Precision floating Point 32bit values down to much smaller int8 values uh and other variants in between this can cut down memory usage and compute time sometimes as much as four times you can kind of think of this as being a little bit like LOD but for yourl and with that I'll hand it back to Andrew immersive worlds check Dynamic AI controlled entities check streamlined workflows and great gameplay check the next step is to ensure your game lives on post launch and a critical factor in success is to drive deep player engagement that includes making sure your game delivers on what player players today expect and it's no surprise that one thing you've asked for is a better multiplayer creation experience unity's fully endtoend multiplayer solution has become even more robust over the last year and with unity 6 it's a powerful way of efficiently setting up a variety of multiplayer formats and features including leader towards matchmaking and more let's welcome Diana to tell us more hi my name is Diana and I'm leading product for Unity gaming Services Unity has many solutions to help with a variety of multiplayer game needs uh we're working on a series of templates to get you started but we also understand you often have to navigate technical choices later in the game when it's time to introduce multiplayer Concepts to your project to help with this situation we're working on a central location in the editor named multiplayer Center where you can play with the parameters of your multiplayer goals and see what are the recommended tools services or educational materials relevant to your project at this point you can add some of those directly to your project and start experimenting with those multiplayer capabilities immediately this multiplayer player Center this one something that they showed in the last un night and I was really impressed by it and I'm still I still want to see how it's going to go because does seem like something really awesome cuz sometimes multiplier can can be very uh very intimidating because of how many tools how many assets how many packages you have to install so having something in which preselects all the options you just select the template and it automatically installs everything I think that is really going to help all kinds of people get started making multiplayer games so I quite like that one once you have a working gameplay the very next step is to try out multiple clients to get a feel of the experience using separated processes this is what multiplayer play mode will deliver it enables multiple editor instances of client cents along with server to be open simultaneously on the same device using the same source code uh same assets on the disk providing a more efficient and quick development cycle of multiplayer games yeah this one is really awesome because when trying to make multiplayer games having to constantly make a build especially when it's a complex game like when I was making my game d Guardians near the end development making a build did take quite some time so having this one where it just basically spawns a new Unity editor interface this one is really awesome definitely once again really speeds up iteration with which is extremely important especially in multipay gam so I quite like this one you can see working here with our casual Coop bus rooms and note how each one of them has a different console that is really awesome for debugging sample the next step for your team is usually to involve another play tester in a casual C scenario like we've seen in this slide before that will often be in a client authoritative multiplayer gameplay coupled to a BL server to accelerate your play testing phase we're integrating Unity gaming Services relay so you can simply create a session and get somebody else to join your play mode quickly your multiplayer game might require us that was really awesome I don't know if you noticed there was a little a little basically just drawing just putting the uh right there so basically there's a new thing to add the really join code so you don't have to do some complex coding you just right there start the CL automatically connects wow that is really awesome that really simplifies uh making the really work that's another great thing get somebody else to join your play mode quickly your multiplayer game might require a server authoritative model to prevent cheating for example when there is some competition involved while you could use multiplayer play mode with any net code stack here is an example based on dots for an action competition game showcased through a latest competitive sample Mega City metro in such a scenario multiplayer play mode will support the local and remote deployment of a dedicated server to keep your iteration loop as short as possible even when you have a complex Network topology oh interesting so basically you can uh test dedicated servers locally so basically it starts a dedicated server locally and creates the different oh that is good for testing so you always so you can basically always test on the uh server architecture that you choose instead of having to constantly test with just Local Host versus all using dedicated servers when deploying so yeah another great Improvement we've delivered dedicated server build Target allowing you to create both the client and the server from a single project reducing significantly the development and iteration time or adding additional content selection features that will help you get one step further in that process without custom scripts and help you make that server as lean as possible with options to strip out the client parts of your project another really awesome thing because yeah when I implemented uh multiplayer when I worked with that and also interesting how they're talking about multiplayer hosting I thought they officially changed the name of that one but anyways uh but yeah having to press a button instead of having to go once again instead of having to go onto the dashboard and upload a separate bill just being able to press a button and have all of that handled automatically in the background another great thing that mely improves inter interation yeah but when you need to introduce a cloud infrastructure in your iteration Loop for your dedicated server it can become difficult and slow to iterate this is why we have taken steps to automate the upload of your builds to your game server hosting solution in Unity gaming Services allowing to mix and match automatic creation of clients and server to run deployment scenarios faster and save you additional integration steps all all the multiplayer gameplay Solutions coming to you with unity engine are based on the transport package this package provides a robust lowlevel networking layer you can also leverage to build your own customized net code for specific game needs yeah by the way in case you don't know you if you don't want to use netco Frum objects you can just use the unity transport package if you don't want to deal with uh manually handling connections manually sending bites and so on if you want to build anything on top of that you can use just this one so one thing one project that I would like to try out is basically doing a nongame thing just using this one just sending bites between let's say a mobile device and a computer in order to control things so if you want to do simple things that remember how you don't need to use the entire the entire tool like you don't need to use net for game objects you can just use a transfer package which should help uh simplify basically just sending bytes back and forth so this is quite interesting transport now supports Unity B which means your solution could ship to all platforms of course multiplayer play mode and dedicated server work flows can be used with your custom Solutions as well building a multiplayer game today often requires to integrate several products and services together with thousands of lines of codes with our upcoming multiplayer Services SDK we're massively simplifying integration and dependency management while offering a new way to interact with their services oh that's another great one because yeah right now you basally need to uh individually interact with each one of these services so basally I've got tutorials on each one of these individually because each one individually he uses a different SDK so yeah having it all go through one single thing that once again that really simplifies things makes it easier to it rate upon implementing so yeah another great Improvement and dependency although interesting to see how vvox is apparently separate from that one I don't know why interesting management while offering a new way to interact with their services building reach multiplayer experiences can sometimes feel daunting due to the complexity and high operational costs involved but what if there was a way way to distribute the simulation worklow across clients in a way that's scalable and resilient reducing the burden on the server and opening up new possibilities for multiplayer development that's exactly what our new network topology solution called distributed Authority aims to achieve by leveraging The Familiar Unity net code solution net code for game objects that you already know and a new scalable Cloud backend that we provide distributed Authority enables you toload a significant portion of the computational workload from the server to the client and offers the flexibility to shift simulation between the two with such a solution you can build large scale multiplayer titles with lower operational costs engineering effort and improved scalability to accommodate a larger number of concurrent players opening up yeah this one is really interesting so basically you can have instead of having just a single host you can have multiple uh players each of them is responsible has authority over certain things over here the red one is responsible for these red balls the green one for this one so that's that's an interesting one for I guess it helps for the yeah like it says here distribute uh simulation workload so basally if you have lots of especially with lots of physics objects then yeah I guess this one would be interesting you have each Player handles just a handful of objects making the whole thing run much better as opposed to having all that stress on the on the H it's a an interesting one instead of having just one host then you got distributed Authority and of course dedicated service so three three interesting different modes up new possibilities for multiplayer development in the world of multiplayer games maintaining Fair competition is crucial to keep players engaged however you often face difficulties when it comes to establishing a skill system of your own our skillbased Matchmaker will eliminate the need for you to build a skill system from scratch through this feature you can effortlessly compute player skill scores using various metrics such as wins load out or achievements the skillbased Matchmaker can be easily configured to suit the specific requirements of each game ensuring a Level Playing Field for all players which Fosters a genuinely Fair competitive environment a boost player retention and engagement you also want to have better observability to track things that are happening to the matches created by the Matchmaker so that you can see Trends or catch issues earlier for debugging session details offers enhanced observability into the Matchmaker by provid you with match level details it can track major events that occur throughout the lifespan of each match such as the specific matchmaking rules that have been applied to a match the joining sequence of individual players and the fill up back fill up dates with match level observability you can identify Trends detect and resolve issues faster you to see time to iterate the matchmaking system just as we carefully curate matches to enhance player engagement our safet solution are tailored to safeguard our players making every game not just competitive but also a secure and welcoming space for everyone involved our approach centers on utilizing intelligent AI based detection systems for efficient monitoring of your voice and tax chat promoting positive behavior to cultivate respect and camaraderie and take actions to address identified toxic behaviors oh it's interesting how she mentioned both Voice and text chat I thought this one only worked with voice so yeah this could be interesting especially for IND game developers who can't really afford to have a massive moderation team yeah I think these tools can be quite interesting so basically making multiplayer games easier and then having this one in order to be able to more easily handle multiplayer games so yeah if you're a small team trying to handle that then hopefully this should be quite a useful tool safe always F A semantic and acoustic analysis for sharper insights limiting the need for human moderators to review the evidence this year we will roll out rulebased moderation actions which will increase the productivity and morale of moderation teams even more we're also excited that we will be launching our Innovative safe Tex platform featuring an Adaptive chat filter that actively screens and filters toxic content in real time complementing this our Advanced context analysis technology deals into the entirety of conversations enhancing the detection of toxic content by understanding the context with integrated evidence from safe voice and safe text you can quickly organize and prioritize incidents based on overall risk toxicity and disruption scores and really scale your moderation workflows you can not only take actions but also get an overview of moderation activity and player behavior in your game track sanctions and assess moderation efficiency using an intuitive dashboard together safe voice safe text and moderation fortifier our platform safety Suite allowing you to build communities that are safer by design game after game if you want to get a head start on multiplayer make sure you don't miss our Mega City metro sample talk and with that back to you Andrew of course yeah by the way there's a new Mega City sample I wonder if it's downloadable or if it's only visible HDC but yeah I think they they did announce it they did publish it so yeah basically there's a new Mega City metro so it uses uh it's a multiplayer game like one with chips flying around so if you've seen the last unite that one should be I believe it is downloadable right now I don't know I'll have to see afterwards but yeah that one should be using all these tools so it should be an interesting case study course building an immersive and engaging title is critical to the successful reception of your game but you're also concerned with making sure you're delivering your game where your players are and where they want to play unity's industryleading platform support allows you to build for web mobile PC and XR including some of the hottest new devices let's welcome Tara to tell us more hey everyone my name is Tara and I'm on the product team here at Unity let's cover new features that will help you reach more players across Platforms in unity 6 we're willing out improvements to make your life easier when it comes to setting up your builds and exploring new platforms we've heard from many of you about the challenges of using custom scripts to manage builds because our settings are too rigid and only configurable at the project level we've taken your feedback to heart and are excited to announce the introduction of build profiles which give you the flexibility to create multiple profiles for a Target platform for each phase of your project whether whether it's a vertical slice a demo or the final version you can set custom settings and scene list for each profile and this one is a really awesome thing that I know people have won for a very long time so it's really awesome to see them finally going so basically instead of having you to make all kinds of custom scripts in order to make a build for Android then a build for seam then a build for the Epic gam store then another one for humble and so on instead of having to do all that you can just create profiles easily swap between them so yeah I think these These are it's something that people have won for a very long time so it's really awesome that it finally officially supported this one is really going to be quite helpful to a lot of people and that's not all we're also making it easier to discover the platforms that Unity supports through the new platform browser this isn't just a list it's your new shortcut to get everything set up with the Right Packages and the right settings for your Target platform automatically getting your games onto the web presents a huge opportunity for you to reach a larger audience of players starting with unity 6 you'll you be able to run your Unity games anywhere the web exists including mobile browsers you'll be able to run your Unity titles embedded in a web view inside a Native app or use our Progressive web app template to make your games behave like native apps along with their own shortcuts and through our strategic partnership with Google w GPU is now available in unity 6 beta with this early access to the web GPU backend you can now experiment with things like compute shaders GPU skitting VFX graph and more GPU driven rendering techniques the web GPU is really interesting but the last time that I researched I saw that it was in uh basically in the various browsers it is still in the experimental stage so this one seem it seems something really awesome but definitely something way out in the future I believe I don't know I'm not I'm not an expert in web but yeah it does seem something really awesome mean being able to use uh uh compute shaders to do all kinds of awesome stuff directly on a browser that definitely sounds excellent and mobile web is something that when they announced back back at unite there was huge cheers so I'm not too familiar with the with the uh web Market especially mobile web but apparently that's a huge deal so nice to see this yeah we've also partnered with meta to build support for their instant games platform through Facebook and messenger you'll have the opportunity to reach hundreds of millions of players that are discovering games every day with unity A6 you'll be able to easily build and publish webbased games to this platform and greatly expand your reach next let's review some exciting news from our partnership with Microsoft in unity 6 we're adding native Unity editor support for armbased Windows devices this means you can work on your Unity games on even more windows devices taking advantage of the performance and flexibility that arm powered devices can offer you'll also be able to develop win32 games using Microsoft game development kit which contains the common tools to build Windows Standalone games we know how that's an interesting one how many how many devices nowadays have arm in them I don't think windows on arm is still very popular but hey anything that gets the editor available on more place is always a a great thing to see important it is that not only do your games install quickly but they're also performant across many different types of android devices to help with this Unity 6 supports play asset delivery through the new addressables Android package with this feature you'll benefit from Dynamic delivery options and when you combine this with texture compression Target formatting your players will get textures customized for their devices while still maintaining an overall smaller install size Unity will also include a new application point game activity powered by the Android game development kit this system brings a number of new benefits including improved threading and enhanced updatability through the use of Android X we've made some major improvements to iteration speeds while you're developing for console platforms unity's incremental build pipeline allows you to iterate more quickly in between builds once a scene has been built subsequent builds will focus only on the Delta meaning build times drastically reduced in most situations as you can see on screen when we tested the boat attack produ project after doing a script change build times dropped by almost 50% in unity 6 versus the 2021 LTS after doing a script change build times dropped almost 50% in unity 6 versus the 2021 LTS and building is seene without any changes dropped from 40 seconds to just over five yeah this one is something that they've had for quite a while I'm pretty sure this was available in the 22 LTS and this one is definitely really awesome really massive massive improvements back when I was making my my uh multiplayer free course the kitchen chaos course back when I was making that one since I had to constantly make builds this one really helped without this one it would take like minutes to make a build but with this one took a few seconds and yeah when when making builds for consoles this is one of the things that you definitely want to be super nice and snappy that's a huge Improvement that will offer significant benefits to your iteration speeds during development lastly let's dive into new capabilities for XR platforms while we have a ton of new features coming in unity 6 for XR development let's highlight a few of these key features you can use while developing for platforms like meta Quest and vision OS whether you want to expand your existing game with mixed reality or you're making something entirely new AA Foundation empowers you to incorporate the physical world into the player's experience in a crossplatform way and in unity 6 we're expanding meshing occlusion bounding boxes and persistent anchors to additional platforms like meta Quest Vision OS and Android we're also adding Vulcan support in AR core and enhancing it for meta Quest so your players have smoother more performant visuals one feature we're super excited about is composition layers another way to improve the visual Fidelity of your game here we have a side byside comparison on one side a regular texture and on the other a composition layer as you can see the use of composition layers significantly reduces artifacts giving us clearer text sharper outlines and overall a better appearance we've also created interactive UI components for composition layers allowing you to get started with minimal setup or easily convert your existing UI we know that sitting up multiplayer for your VR games is difficult so we're trying to make this easier through our new multiplayer VR template built on top of open XR this template is a first class Showcase of unity's breadth of multiplayer Services allowing you to get straight to building content with spatialized voice chat lobbies networked interactions and hand tracking finally a feature I know many of you are excited about for those developing for vision OS plated device is a gamechanging feature that leverages unity's poly spatial technology to stream your apps content over the local network enabling you to iterate and preview your content across the unity editor the vision OS simulator or apple Vision Pro wow that is really awesome just looking at that little SC makes me think how this would be quite a a fun tool for doing some kind of level design like being able to physically move the the level parts around that could be a really fun use case yeah the vision W quite nice any tweaks that you make in the unity editor like adding game objects adjusting inspector values or refining Shader graphs instantly sync to your simulator or device in real time and what's even cooler if you use this new feature while wearing a visual Pro you can work in the editor using Mac virtual display and see your spatial content right next to it this is an incredible new way to work while developing your games for vision OS thank you all for listening to our exciting updates on Unity platforms so with all yeah that all sounds really interesting honestly when I first started about the uh Vision Pro I didn't really have much interest in especially given how how expensive it is but the more I see it the more the more I get interested in wanting to try it out make some uh fun interesting prototypes with it but yeah it's still really expensive so yeah still not quite sure and actually over here in Portugal I still can't even buy it even if I even if I wanted to pay for it so yeah it's uh but yeah definitely one day I definitely would like to can apply for Dev kid oh that would be nice if I if I could because yeah that would be definitely got especially seeing this oh that looks quite interesting for making all kinds of L designs so yeah it's nice how how as the device matures hopefully the use case become a bit more more evident becomes a bit easier to figure out what the device can do all the possibilities in front of you and the rich diversity of ideas you want to bring to life it is important Unity gives you the room you need to explore and grow your Ambitions along with your game success we're already hard at work modernizing the foundations of the engine and want to unveil more details about our progress there please welcome luron to walk you through some of the key aspects of our plan hi I'm Nan keot product manager at Unity before we look at some of our targets for the future it would be useful to quickly revisit the new foundational capabilities that landed in a Unity engine over the last 12 months I'm talking in particular about ECS ntity component system a core frame work about data oriented technology stack dots starting with unity 2022 RTS ECS is fully integrated into the editor and supported for production on all platforms NS architecture helps design more flexible game code architecture this allows games like evish to Pivot their game IDs more easily during production reducing refactoring risk ECS also gives you complete control of your target device Hardware this is how title like detonation racing could deliver such an and game PL on the target device ECS efficient memory layout and scalable processing enable the simulation of many more enemies with complex physical gameplay like in ostar and Mars the many hundreds of thousands of dynamic objects of the V Rising open world are being brought to life based on the ECS for Unity stack and finally ECS for Unity Powers a new range of multiplayer gameplay possibilities thanks to its net cut stack and determinism if you want to see a fully functional demonstration of this please check out Mega C Metro scalable High concurrency crossplatform sample of our endtoend multiplayer platforms that we play tested with more than a 100 players we are committed to the do EOS system as demonstrated yeah right away I really like that line because yeah anytime I mention dots there's always one one comment who goes well dots is nice but is going to abandon it a while so yeah I'm really happy to see that every time they mention some kind of thing they mention how they're committed for the for the long term so you are safe to use it and yep they've already put out quite a lot of impressive updates 1.1 1.2 1.3 so yeah they're constantly this definitely not something that they've been building on and they're not and they're now going to drop nope this is definitely something that they are committed to going for the uh longterm future so yeah I personally as someone who's a a really big fan of dots and I really want to see the future where pretty much the engine behind it uses dots mean that if you yourself still just use game objects you still get the benefits from all this dot stuff because the background is all using dots so it's all super performance so yeah personally when it comes to dots I think it's already awesome right now and I'm really excited to see everything that's going to come in the future by the Min minor versions of ECS for Unity currently being worked out ECS 1.1 and 1.2 are already available in the package manager and we're preparing version 1.3 we've been listening to your immediate feedback from your production environments and prepared many different fixes and improvements that will be delivered back where you work on Unity 2022 RTS and unity 6 at lunch in a recent survey 25% of you told us you could use ECS as a solution in production however you also told us that ECS can represent a significant learning curve resulting in a little less than 10% being able to actually Implement a production this is short of our goal which is to deliver data oriented performance to every single one of your projects this is why we've been at work bringing game objects and entities closer together in a future version of unity after after unit6 by doing so we will make ECS power available to you in the context of the editor to Lage its runtime power for authoring workflows this would also make it easier for you to introduce a targeted ECS solution to your game object based projects to tackle a specific performance bottleneck and finally this will help us deliver more performance to all of you in many cases without having to expose the ECS complexity if you don't need it so yeah basically that's what I was saying that's there that's their goal I've spoken to a few times and he has mentioned how that is the goal how basically the unity backend they're going to uh be using more and more dots on that so even if you yourself don't use any dots at all if you don't touch ECS directly you are still going to benefit from all those all those benefits yeah it was interesting because yeah like the number said 100% of people do want performance improvements everyone always wants more performance so if the engine by itself just without you having to do anything specifically if just by itself the engine already performs better that is uh really awesome regardless of what you're trying to use so yeah like I said really excited for the future of dots the first Milestone of this convergence is to ensure that for every game object of your project there is an equivalent entity link to it this simplifies manipulating your project data through both environments the most important data you usually need to synchronize between game object and ECS or object Transformations this is why we are aligning both transformation apis and data structure to boost synchronization performance this will lead us to unify the scene and build workflows to ensure that regardless of the system you use for manipulating your project data we provide a fully unified experience as I mentioned a little bit earlier wow that was quite a lot of information okay interesting so basically this this is all for the future so this is all Beyond Unity s so definitely not something that is going to happen this year interesting game objects are also entity so are they going to make so that by default every single game object you create has an entty attached to it and this really screenshot over here seems really interesting so basically you've got the builtin components so the regular transform rigid body then you've got some custom Behavior components so regular uh mono behaviors and then apparently on that one you can also add some component data so that is really interesting so being able to have basically put all together and somehow magically it all works both ECS and game wow that's uh I imagine this is a very significant engineering challenge but yeah I I I quite like the ambition it does sound it does sound like the future is going to be very difficult for Unity but very interesting potentially very powerful that regardless of the system you use for manipulating your project data we provide a fully unified experience as I mentioned a little bit earlier converging game object and ECS will have amazing applications with scalable project authoring workflows to illustrate this we've been working on a major rework of our engine animation system that will be based on ECS the additional performance row allows us to deliver more complex and dynamic workflows to you in the editor as well as giving giv you the ability to have many more characters on screen at an unprecedented level of complexity at one time yeah again so this the kind of thing if they themselves improve the animation on the back end to be able to use dots you yourself can keep using the regular animation tools and basically everything will just run faster so yeah this is exactly what I want to see we've also been out our work to reimagine our world building workflows based on thiss again this work will bring us closer to large open world support out of the box in unity we'll share more about those developments in the future yes when it comes to wor building also interesting because the uh Unity terrain is something that I have not used personally way too much I usually don't use uh complex rins in my games but I've heard a lot of people have a lot of gripes with it so yeah being able to have that be a lot more efficient a lot more performant and a lot more capable with a lot more features that sounds great speaking of delivering additional performance to 100% of unity project I'm glad to inform you that we're making significant progress with our migration to co C all this is another step in modernizing the cor foundations of the unity engine the World of. Net is changing rapidly and performance enhancements are coming with every new version of friends up Microsoft release with our work on integrating cor out to Unity we'll bring additional RW speed to the editor simpler ID build integration and faster code reload this will result in major improvements to iteration time on the other hand new optimization in garbage collection will dramatically improve the Run Time Performance the other signs are pretty good some parts of the unity editors and tests we made with ui2 kit are running twice as fast we are excited to deliver okay so yeah that is definitely again keep in mind this is all for Beyond un6 so definitely not going to happen this year this something uh for next year and Beyond but yeah all these sound really good improvements I still haven't researched the cor ER too much so I'm not I'm not too sure on the specifics but from what I know it's just objectively a great Improvement so I mean iteration time uh that's one thing that a lot of people are constantly Ming about how it takes way too long to just change one thing and recompile it takes way too long so anything that improves that that's really awesome and of course yeah better runtime performance and feature proofing this actually this actually something that un has done quite well uh recently whereas previously uh Unity used to be in like I don't know four or five uh C versions behind whereas lately it's been uh pretty good and I imagine once they move on to the Corr staying up to date with all the C version that should be even faster so yeah and garbage collection will dramatically improve the runtime performance the other signs are pretty good some parts of the unity editors and tests we made with youu to Kit are running twice as fast we are excited to deliver all of those performance improvements in future releases of unity so that you're able to build on more ambitious games regardless of your expertise well there you have it the bulk of what you saw over this past hour is coming to you soon in unity 6 Unity 6 preview is will be released in May with full production support until Unity 6 is released later this year we looked at new tools and new services that coupled with the improvements and upgrades you've made to the engine overall go really some way to addressing the most common requests and scenarios you tell us you faced frequently we're pretty proud of what we're delivering in the next major release of unity and we can't wait to see what you can cve with it thank you for joining us all right so yeah personally I think that was that was really great a lot of things com in the future and even more Beyond so yeah in general yeah I'm quite a big fan of of the road map started off quite interesting lots of uh rendering improvements so yeah that one is always something that is like I said I'm not a graphics programmer so anything in which I can just take a box and everything runs faster oh and by the way you can go ahead and download the urp samples to the uh happy harvest so yeah the uh the things that make the code run much faster yeah this one definitely looking forward to that just take a box and everything runs faster so that one is really good then all the improvements about rendering and all kinds of stuff so if you if you are more of an artist if you do all kinds of things then these improvements are definitely going to be very useful and the one about water it just sucks how this one is apparently still just agrp only but still if you are using a grp then this water system does look really awesome really excellent and so many things about speed tree Muse AI also seems to continue to improve so that's great to see as long as that one continues it's going to be great and Muse animate this one is the one that personally I'm most interested in being able to quickly generate some prototype animations in order to make some prototype work much better so this sounds really good same thing for sound effects if this one works I I I'm very curious to try this out and see how good it is because I don't know I imagine that making sound effects actually more complex than making Sprites maybe I'm wrong about that I don't know but uh yeah I'm curious to see how many different sounds this can make but yeah basically when it comes to uh Muse and all their AI tools I think these are really excellent for quickly building all kinds of prototypes so you've got some kind of idea and very quickly you can generate assets animations sound effects uh Behavior trees make the level make everything so yeah for the prototyping stage I think these tools are extremely helpful and yeah all the uh daytoday improvements these are all really excellent like really tiny things that massively improve uh your speed of iteration of working with the editor so these were really good and yeah more and more things about asset management and all kinds of things more improvements with shad graph and the multiplayer Center this one is definitely some that I'm very much looking forward to so this one says coming in un6 so this one is coming so basically you've got a window where you can select some kind of template and basically automatically automatically preselects all the things to install and automatically installs all the packages so this one should once again should really help simplify the process for starting off a brand new multiplayer game Prototype so that one's really awesome multiplayer play mode so you don't have to constantly make brand new builds every time so that really speeds up the relay being much easier to integrate that one is also another really awesome thing same thing for dedicated server just pressing a button instead of having to go into an external thing to make a separate build and upload so that's really good the multiplayer SDK basically uh unifying all the different multiplayer tools into one thing that you can very easily access that's another great thing for EAS of views distributed Authority so this is one is also going to be really interesting for making different kinds of games that can handle much better safe voice again if you're if you've got some kind of multiplayer game being able to safely handle that Community especially if you are a small in developer who who can't really afford an entire dedicated team for moderation these tools can be extremely useful and yeah build profiles this one is really awesome this one is something that a lot of people have won for a very long time so it's really awesome to see that coming in mobile web support again this one is apparently a super huge deal so it's really nice to see and web GPU as well being able to use compute shaders directly on the browser that seems like a really awesome upgrade and yeah even more performance improvements just improving all kinds of things all the AR stuff I have to say I still haven't I've wanted to to play around with ar and VR for a very long time but I still haven't gotten around to it so yeah all of these things sound really interesting but I don't have much experience I definitely definitely would like to try it out at some point because all of these improvements with the uh occlusion that one as far as I know used to be a really complex problem but over here on this demo it seems like it was working quite well I mean those those balls are being stuck behind that wall and so on improving visual visual Fidelity with TCH specifically this one one is also really awesome every time I played a VR game every time you have to read some kind of tutorial it's always really messed up so these improvements seem really good search experience this one again something to very quickly speed up and this one this one uh seemed really awesome to me I mean being able to do level design by physically handling things inside your Apple Vision Pro visually moving things around in order to create your own level this makes it really awesome honestly it makes me like I played uh I spent most of my childhood playing CounterStrike so right away looking at this one SP espcially like this where it looks some kind of desert it makes me imagine oh it would be really awesome to have like uh the map this to right here next to me so I can play around with moving all the crates I think that would be really awesome so yeah lots of improvements there and everything with dots is already awesome and continues being really awesome and for the future so many things coming in bring game objects and entities closer together that one sounds really really ambitious really exciting so I'm definitely very curious to see how that one is going to go dots animation really awesome World building as well so yeah when it comes to the Future and Corr just making everything snappier and faster than it seems really good so yeah I mean all in all I have to say I'm quite quite pleased with this with this little uh road map so yeah I'm curious to see what are you all thinking because yeah I have to say I was I was focusing way too much on on watching so I didn't really read too many comments so I'm curious to see what is the sentiment what do all of you all of you feel and yeah it seems like the unity 6 beta is out now I thought the preview was out but no that that's the thing that's a little bit confusing so previously you used to have the beta then the text stack and then the LTS whereas now you've got beta then preview and then the final version so right now apparently un6 the beta is out right now well actually I can just open it up and try to see apparently if I go into installs install the editor okay so okay so it's on prly so basically it's the unity 6 which is 6,000 which is kind of fun yeah so apparently that one is in beta then apparently in sometime uh around March no may I think that's what they said so around May it's going to go into preview which is basically going to be the equivalent of previously what used to be the uh uh beta version Oh God this so so confusing but after figure out I guess it's going to be but basically yeah so the preview and then comes the unit6 proper which is going to be the equivalent of an LTS version so yeah so yeah that one is uh quite interesting okay let me read some comments does this mean we won't have C 12 I'm actually not sure I'm not sure what what specific version of C is currently going on so about Vision Pro is just imagine how this Tech Will evolve in the coming years yep I I definitely I agree I mean uh the The Vision Pro and this little push for AR since uh since uh Apple is now coming in they're really putting in a ton of money into it I think that is going to be I think that is definitely just the beginning so I'm very curious to see how that one going to go thing change the approach of the multiplayer tutorial are you talking about the distributed networking no that is basically just a different one so you can now just host just one one person host or it can have dedicated server or it can have distributed Authority which basically each player holds uh authority over different parts of the map so basically it allows you to make bigger more complex games and I think that also means that players don't have to be on the same place at all time I don't know I'll have to try that out so basally you could have different games with all kinds of things so yeah this6 coming out we check to see if it was worth updating d g suit yeah maybe I mean that would be definitely an interesting thing depending on the improvements especially especially if I can just take a box and the game runs 50% faster in terms of rendering yeah I guess that that would be awesome so we shall see uh what happens in the in the future yeah still scared to touch ECS and fill coding things but yeah that's what L was saying which is basically the goal is to get to the point where you yourself don't have to specifically touch ECS if you're just using Unity unity in the background is going to be using ECS and dots in order to make everything much faster so even if you yourself just use play on game objects everything should still hopefully be quite a bit faster so yeah hopefully that should be even if you are concerned about ECS you should still benefit from quite a lot of these things what about the runtime fee I made a video on the updated things so basically uh in most cases just don't worry about it because not if you are an inev like me Dania you're not going to and uh I don't remember the big takeaway but yeah I'm made I made a video on that so if you want to see uh a crap um yeah uh but yeah so essentially that thing technically the fee still exists on Unity 6 so only on that version afterwards but yeah it's all based on you tell Unity how many copies you sold and it's based on that it's not based on inss or anything like that so basically the math is the fee ends up being if you have to pay it's at most 2.5% so personally I don't think that's going to be an issue at least personally for me as a solo IND game developer I've never going to hit the limits of selling over $1 million and 1 million copies I'm never going to hit those numbers so personally that is something that I don't really worry about so if you are an in like me then yep also yeah exactly if anything you can just do 2.5% Revenue so yeah if you are concerned about the runtime fee you can just do the math with that and it's always guaranteed going to be less than that so yeah and yeah the splash SC yeah another thing that they actually didn't mentioned they they should have mentioned because it's something that a lot of people have been looking for basically starting with un6 if you're using the completely free version you no longer have to use Unity splash screen so I know a lot of people really dislike that so yeah starting on Unity 6 yep you can just remove the splash screen if you want and should be like that and yeah they also put out this road map let's see if this has a little bit more information oh it actually has the uh Unity 2024 oh crap I moved uh the report which is actually quite uh let me get the yeah if you want to download the the report there it is cuz this one is actually it's a DNT gaming report yeah I'm planning to make a video on this basically this has a m oh crap because right now I've got to access basically it has a a ton of information all kinds of things so yeah definitely check out that link and definitely check out that report because it has a ton of stuff it's really a giant page with tons of information and yeah it has all kinds of things from single player games multiplayer games games made with Studios with the with the small teams uh what are the current challenges what are the best ways to solve those challenges and so on so I definitely encourage you to go and check out the uh gaming report like I said I'll be making a video on that covering the core things uh and yeah the road ahead for un6 and that is indeed uh this video really nice it was actually relatively short but nice and compact really nice and solid 45 minutes of just excellent information that was good that was nice oh yeah and the mega City metro sample apparently you can download this right now so yep you can download the mega City metro so this is an end to end multiplayer demo I believe it is using yep it is using net for entities because it supports 128 players crossplatform so it's all really awesome and it's uh it's even uh playable okay so this is the old one yeah so basally yeah yeah basically there was the Mega City demo which is kind of funny how it was the very first demo that they showcased when they first talked about dots in I don't know like 2016 2017 so so many years ago they first announced uh the original Mega City demo so it's really awesome how right now what is it like five six seven years later now finally this demo is now downloadable works perfectly single player multiplayer so yeah definitely if you want to see how it all works definitely download the sample and give it a try because yeah it is something that seems very impressive basically it's got large scale streaming and rendering with ECS that's awesome interpolation prediction like compensation that is something that a lot of people have asked how do you do that well you can just look at this proc at this project max out performance with 128 players on mobile that is really awesome and on desktop enabled by dots and urp that's awesome and it's using all these all these servers so it uses uh dedicated servers it's got Matchmaker and vvox so you can chat around so yeah this demo seems definitely really complex I definitely would like to try it out for a little bit to spend some time inspecting it because that's definitely seems quite impressive so yep if you want you can go ahead and download it streamline work for Unity cloud like I said since I'm a a solo game developer usually these kinds of tools aren't really all that useful to me but if you work as a team from from what I can see these tools do seem uh extremely useful for working with teams and collaborating or even if you just do uh a couple of game gems every now and then these do seem quite useful for that and Muse preview for texture 3D yeah like I was saying when we were watching the road map I'm not I'm not a a 3D modeler myself so I don't specifically know exactly what what this one is meant to what is the challenge that this one is solving I'm not 100% sure how basically you give it a 3D model and generates a texture that adapts perfectly to that model I'm not entirely sure but it does seem extremely impressive so yep it's really nice how Unity Muse is iterating upon itself and becoming better and better that's another thing that I'm very curious to see how it's going to go along in the future tap Joy daily rewards in Google ad for mobile okay so I'm not into the mobile market so I have no idea what this means but if you are hopefully this is something nice and celebrating the UN Community again it's always really awesome to see all of these really awesome games and again how they're all really so different so there's one top down action game then you've got something really stylized really awesome another thing really stylized really awesome oh and this one that looks really awesome no rest for the Wicket just in case you don't know this actually apparently it's the new game by the developers that made or and it's kind of like an action game very strange so it's kind of funny how they went from uh ay which was a really Jolly really nice real nice looking game to making something really dark and yeah this one looks really awesome some kind of thing with zombies something else with some really gorgeous 2D art and Lego builders and yeah they show in AR that is also really awesome and yeah South Field I'm not familiar with this one but nice building multiplayer and another one with a really interesting art cell that is really interesting arcade Paradise so yeah as you can see tons and tons of oh look at that all of those games are inside an arcade that was fun hey funer Chronicles yeah I really enjoyed playing the original funer so that one looks really good and something with tons and tons of characters and something with some really awesome mechs wow that looks really cool o nice oh that looks nice and this one for some reason apparently you play a character who has an angry foot I'm pretty sure I saw some gifts of this like one year ago two years ago on Twitter something like that but yeah basically looking at these szz reals it's always really awesome to see the variety and the the awesomeness of all these games shown here so it's always really awesome yeah yeah Thomas B FAL near cron account yeah that one I definitely want to give that a shot because that seems quite interesting so yeah so many things all really impressive yeah thank for the conversation and memories as we close out GDC want to thank everyone who took time to connect with us live and in person Ah that's really awesome I wish I could have gone but yeah this year I wasn't able to go to GDC it's I'm sure it's been a lot of fun so yeah are any of you at GDC I'd be curious to know so yeah it should be really fun and really uh full of people that's what I remember from GDC of last year how it was so crowded so much stuff so many people everywhere but uh all really awesome definitely very drainy to handle all of those people at the same time but yeah that was really awesome and we had a little uh Meetup at the uh uh verba Buena Garden something like that I don't know that it was last uh last year and it was really interesting so yeah hopefully next year here should happen so yeah can't wait to see you at next CC yeah nice meantime keep creating amazing games oh yeah so lots of stuff here yeah definitely very very interesting lots of information lots of samples you can download right now and download the unity 6 beta I'll definitely be doing that so let me actually put it on install and just install that there you go how big is this one I don't know it doesn't say the size but yeah it's downloading pretty fast so yeah definitely curious to try that out it should be interesting so yeah you've been making a new game for steam well I still have my uh Total War Liberation I still want to get back to that one at some point so we shall see maybe this year and I still want to finish a bunch of things more on thinking Gard so yep we'll use Unity 6 yep I'm definitely going to try it out is a 6,000 beta preas yep that is the un6 beta they called it 6,000 I assume it's just to keep the same format of having four digits so what used to be 2023 now it's just going to be the 6,000 so yeah pretty much like that should I learn game da which university I'm sorry that's a very local question I have no idea I would say learn from watching channels like mine and others and then find a local University that teaches something although I would probably advise more going into just general uh software development as opposed to specifically game design something like that so yeah it's a it's an interesting question yeah definitely wish you the best in your Learning Journey will you bring more C course yeah I'm still about to still got a bunch of work to do on my on my C course I've actually been building some interactive exercises but uh yeah so the unity 6 road map this was actually it looks quite interesting I'm definitely quite quite interesting in the future especially all this looks really awesome basically making everything run much snappier much better that is 100% a positive thing all right so yeah it's already pretty late over here it's 800 p.m. so yeah got to take my do outside do something so yeah this was a fun live stream I mean I I saw the uh video going live and I figured hey doing this on live stream could be fun could be interesting so hopefully you found this a bit more interesting than just watching by yourselves so I hope that you enjoyed this live stream and uh yeah so yeah thank you all so much for being here and I'm going to just move this like that like that and yep all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here hope you enjoyed this and all right uh see you next time everyone enjoy have a great weekend all right bye everyone bye for
