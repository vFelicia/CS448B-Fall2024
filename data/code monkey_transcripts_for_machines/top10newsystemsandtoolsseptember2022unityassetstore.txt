hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for September 22. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video I already covered all the best free new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it as always there's links to the ass in the description and as bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now there's a sale on the SSR everything by City Studios is currently at half price for me I'm a big fan of their awesome low poly style and there's also some flash deals with a super deep 70 discount so check out the link in the description to see which ones are in a Flash discount right now alright so starting off with a pretty huge release this is Odin validator as you can tell by the name this one is from the same team as the excellent Odin inspector which is actually the dependency for this one but chances are you already own that one this one is all about helping you validate issues in your game it helps you easily find missing references find broken assets materials Shader errors missing scripts broken unit events and tons more you can apply automation hooks to run validation before every run or build you can export validation results to HTML or Json and of course just like without an inspector you can build your own tools on top of this one there's all kinds of attributes you can add to your code to make sure everything works exactly as you intend if you forget something it will help you find the problem and fix it so this one definitely looks like an excellent addition to the already excellent Odin inspector then here's a fun tool a 3D mask like an implies you can add a mask in 3D so you make a quad and change what you can see through that Rod this is one of those things that looks really simple but if you've ever tried doing this yourself then you know how complex it can be there's lots of issues with shaders depth buffers Z ordering and so on so having a simple easy use tool to achieve this effect is definitely very worthwhile you can learn how to add it to your project by just watching a simple 1.5 minute video it's that simple then an interesting tool all about quaternions for me I've been using Unity for 10 years now and I still have trouble with quaternions for the most part I pretty much just completely avoid them so this tool helps to make that easier with one line of code you can rotate the object exactly as you want it now I'm still not exactly sure on exactly what it does after watching the video and reading the description I still don't get it but the promise of easy quaternion certainly has me intrigued up next do you need millions of Blades of grass in your game then check out this tool lightning implies it's GPU based meaning super fast and supports tons of objects this one is a replacement to unt's terrain grass system which is apparently CPU based this one is on the GPU so there are no hitches on changing LEDs you can render on multiple terrains it runs supports wind you can cover the grass and make it blend with the bottom terrain certainly the results in the video definitely speak for themselves then if you want to damage a mesh look at this tool the deformation certainly looks very realistic you can apply to any mesh this would be perfect for any game that features collision damage like for example any car game it works in real time and you can deform and repair with code it's lightweight and performant home with nicely commented threads and speaking of vehicles if you've ever wanted to make a motocross game then look at this one as a kid I remember having tons of fun playing Motocross Madness it was a really fun game where you could drive your bike around and do all kinds of Tricks looking at this asset immediately reminds me of that game it's based on dots using jobs and the burst compiler so it's extremely performant supporting multiple bikes all active at once you have several types of bikes you can simulate you've got a regular dirt bike adventure bike quad bike and so on you can customize the ik on the human driver meaning most of the animations are dynamically driven by ik and of course you can customize the character itself and one more phone bonus feature is it has a POV camera designed by using a GoPro camera in real life so it definitely makes it look really interesting then here's a very professional tool for super low latency streaming that is usually the main problem with tools that do on live video this one is meant for you to show realtime gameplay as fast as possible for example you can see what someone is seeing through their Hollands you can share virtual reality with friends collaborate in real time and a bunch more the main thing is stability and performance then for a UI tool with some strange but interesting effects you can make some UI elements merge into one another you can make them dissolve into different shapes and some other weird effects it's all based on regular UI objects and text mesh Pro definitely a strange thing but it certainly makes your UI look very unique up next if you're working on a retro and low poly game then look at this low poly terrain editor you can place and rotate textures automatically place some detail and import the height map you can make automatic texturing based on terrain height and being low poly means you can pick up each individual vertex and terrain and make some brilliant low poly shapes then if you need a way to record audio in the game here's a simple tool it does exactly what you expect so you can record audio in a multitude of formats you can grab it from whatever audio Source the player has then perhaps you can use that audio and let the player add it to their own gameplay Clips or maybe use it to send a voicemail to some friends in game or perhaps combine it with some kind of cloud machine learning to add voice controls to your game alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unity assesor for September 22. there's links on the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your organ and also check out my own free and paid as on store all right hope that's
