hi there this is a quick tip regarding the side effects of type conversions it is very important to be familiar with the various data types and what implicit limitations they have now one issue which has tripped me up a couple of times is you to doing math with integers so I'd say I have a simple health system in here where I have my current health and my maximum huh both of these are defined as int now in order to display my health in a health bar I would like to have a function that returns the health as a percentage some value between zero and one so we can easily apply it to a bar so for that we can go in here make a private float Comet get help percentage in order to get a percentage since we have the current amount and the maximum amount all we need is to return the health bound and divided by the health amount max so if we have a health Mad Max of a hundred and a half month of thirty then we should get point three so let's do a test make here a private void start and since we start off with a hundred health let's cause 70 health of damage and then do a debug dot log of what we get from the get health percentage okay so starting with a hundred taking 70 we should get point three so let's see and here is the log and as you can see it is incorrect it is saying zero instead of zero point three now the issue here is you to the fact that if I'm doing math with two integers the result won't also be an int so since zero point three cannot be represented with an int it gets cast down to just zero so what we need here is do math using floats now when we can do it is cast one of these values to a float just like this and now we're going to have a float divided by an int so the result will be a float so we can run this code again and there it is the console now correctly says zero point three so always remember to be careful when doing math with integers and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
