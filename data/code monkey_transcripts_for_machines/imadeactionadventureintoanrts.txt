hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here is a really interesting project where i took an action adventure game and converted it into an rts it's got all the mechanics you would expect from something like age of empires or command conquer so there's villagers gathering resources constructing buildings enemies combat and so on it's kind of interesting how this game also works as an example of what you can build as a hobby project i've been working on this game on and off for about two months now some other projects had to take priority so i wasn't constantly working on it but i think the total time to build this was around 20 hours it's kind the same thing that happened when i made my factory sim game also around that time spread throughout one or two months so both of these games are great examples of the kind of thing that you can build if you have a day job and can only work on it for 10 or 20 hours per month the making of this game also involved in live stream where people in chat caused it to descend into complete chaos thanks to an exploit in my legit characters so more on that in a bit okay so let's see how this idea got started and how i took that action adventure game as a starting point and it ended up with this awesome rts do you prefer learning through a more guided path rather than separate tutorials then check out my complete stepbystep courses starting from scratch until the final polished games if you're into programming then get the awesome builder defender course learn how i make my own games using code build an awesome game that involves mechanics from city builders tower defense and survival games or if you're into visual scripting then they get the vs course which features not one but three complete games a simple platformer an action rpg and awesome fps in the visual scripting course all of this is built without a single line of code all games in both courses start commonly from scratch and go step by step until the final polish games all of the unleashers have their project files available at every step of the way and i'm always active answering questions every single day in the q a section so if you are looking for a more guided path then check out the courses at unitycodemonkey.com courses so a couple of months ago unity started a really awesome initiative called unity open projects the goal is to build the game from start to finish and share that process publicly so anyone can follow and see how a game is made step by step the project is led by an official team inside of unity but anyone can contribute to it the home project is on github so you can download it figure out something you want to do and submit a poll request it's a really awesome idea and there's already been tons of community contributions for me i really like this initiative but i haven't been able to contribute simply because i can't quite fit it into my schedule i work at a very fast pace on lots of things at once which makes it hard to do any kind of collaborations but still i wanted to do something with it so that's where i came up with the idea of why don't i try taking the game and remake it into a completely different genre and rts is a genre that i love but i haven't done many videos on it so this seemed like the perfect combination so with that the plan was set take this action adventure game and turn it into an rts as usual i like to think on paper when doing my designs so i just write whatever comes to mind with whatever questions i need to ask just so i have a clear overview of direction i'm going in with the core of the game defined i got to work on making it a reality i simply downloaded the latest version of the game from the project github then i inspected the included scene with all the art assets to see what i could adapt onto the rts game it's got tons of characters buildings trees and rocks so i knew i had enough assets to make it work i made a new scene copied some assets and started to work now some of you might already be familiar with what i'm showing here that's because quite a bit of this game was built during two live streams the first ones are pretty much right on the beginning of this project i just had a character visual and nothing else so as soon as i started that first live stream the first task was adding some rts movement for this one i went with the easiest thing possible just using unity's navmesh it's super simple setup just baked in navmash at the agent component and through codes at the destination it's super easy and it's perfect for quickly getting a character to move around nary with pathfinding then since this is an rts one of the main things is the controls i need to be able to select a single or multiple units and give some orders i cover this topic in detail in another video if you want to learn more here i just reused pretty much the exact same code from that video i just had to adapt it slightly to make it work with 3d so at this point i could select any units i want and even make a selection area to select multiple at once oh and if you haven't seen the live streams these characters down in the bottom are the people in chat it's a fun thing that also covered how it works in another video they show the people currently in chat and whatever messages they're saying these live streams aren't planned ahead of time so if you want to know when i go live make sure you hit the bell icon then for the first type of logic i made some gathering the unit simply goes towards a resource node and starts gathering that resource it's just a very very basic state machine i made a phone playlist a long time ago with this kind of logic so pretty simple next up was handling the actual resources so i did that as usual i made a singleton resource manager to handle the resource amount and anything to do with resources then i just had a very basic ui to keep track of the current amount after that it was time to add some enemies so i grabbed another asset from the chop chop open project a really nice looking slime added some health bars and made some basic enemy patrol logic with that it was time to make some buildings so i used scriptable objects to define the types and created some prefabs to instantiate them if you've seen my grid building system then what i did here is pretty much exactly that also made a building ghost exactly in the same way as on that grid building system just a nice way to visualize where the place building will be built by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks then up until this point the units didn't have any animations so i just grabbed the ones from the open project and added them it's got some really nice walking animations and then for gathering i use the same as the attack animations which do look pretty good so the enemies attack the rock and they gather some resources then this was the point when i started the second live stream so by this stage the game was already looking pretty good it was already a nice rts base next up was adding some more resource types i did it by using the super useful scriptable objects for each resource type so each resource node contains a different resource type this is pretty much exactly what i do in my builder defender course in there i also use a resource manager to hold the various resource types which are then used to construct buildings also quickly made a ui element to display them so we just listen to events fired by the resource manager to know when to update the ui then i made the barracks building so this is what actually constructs the units there are some buttons to select which unit you want to make and a nice building hue just like pretty much every rts game so it constructs the units one by one and of course they also have a resource cost then adding a camera system so adding the ability to move left right forwards and backwards as well as zoom in and out and here at this point i also needed to manage the depth of field effect through code so this was something that i had never done before but since i was doing this while on the live stream the chat was a huge help essentially you need to find the specific class for that specific effect so the depth of field and in that class you can then modify that object so it's really nice how it's something that i didn't know how to do and we all learned together thanks to the live chat with all of that the rts minigame was really starting to take shape so i made a quick demo on the live stream with a bunch of characters it really already starts to look like a proper game next up adding some more unit types so for the visual since i can't really model or texture all i did was just recolor the basic character i made a simple range attack unit it just spawns an arrow when it finds an enemy within range that arrow moves towards the enemy and deals damage very simple and then if you've seen the live stream then this is the point when it all turned to chaos essentially on my live stream units i have a chat bubble that shows what someone posts in chat and those chat bubbles are simply made using text mesh pro well it turns out that someone figured out that text mesh pro supports rich text by default so if you type in some tags like size and color you can make the text look quite different so yep obviously some people started posting messages with a huge font size and a whole live stream just to send into chaos it was very chaotic but also very fun i can always count on chat to find some hidden exploits into whatever code i write so make sure you join me on the next live stream and who knows maybe you won't find another exploit okay so after that it was time to work on updating the building visuals i grabbed some more objects from the unity open project and added them to the prefabs then i made lots of enemies to see how their patrol logic worked along with static ranged enemies one crucial element to pretty much any rts is a minimap so that's what i built next i made this in a separate video quite a while ago but it's still up to date it's extremely easy to make you just create a different camera put it above the map and make it render only specific layer then you add simple quads to all the objects and place them on that layer and finally you take that camera and you render it onto a render texture and simply display that in the ui it's super simple to add and with that i had another excellent rts element then punching up the ui with some proper building icons and a unselected arrow button i added some limits to the resource node so after gathering a bunch of them the node gets destroyed and the gatherers automatically go look for another one of the same type after that adding the building construction stage again i did it the exam like it did in my builder defender course just a separate stage where the volunteer units go towards it and they construct to increase the building progress and when it's done the final building pops up after that i just did a ton more small things so i punched up the enemies made the enemy spawners expand the map with some more resource nodes published a few more things and after all that here is the final result alright so here i am in my awesome rts game i've got my starting area right here all i have are three starring villagers and a bunch of starring resources and i can control my camera i can move anywhere see anything and i can zoom in and out so really nice stuff now the first thing i need is to construct a storage so i can use my really nice buttons they also have a really nice tooltip where you can see the object name and the resource cost so this one costs 5 wood 5 stone and 5 iron also cover this tooltip in detail in another video if you want to learn so up here on let's select the storage and place the storage down here as soon as i click there you go now it is in construction so in order to build it let's grab a villager and tell it to go there so just go and they move towards it and they start attacking it which is constructing and there you go the construction progress bar is constantly going up and once it reaches if there it is we have our storage so now i can take these guys and say you go grab some wood you grab some iron and you grab some stone alright so there they go they move towards it they start gathering their yo that one just gathered a bunch of wood that one a bunch of iron and then a bunch of selling all right so now i can afford to build my barracks so let me grab this guy move him in here let's barely see barracks down there and you go and construct that the other ones keep gathering those okay so there it is almost done constructing i can tell all of them to construct that once but just one is more than good enough and there you go it is built so you go back into gathering that one and i can click on it to show up the barracks ui and over here i can select any of these units so in this case let's say i want to build a melee and a ranged unit and there you go there you go they do the creation progress and once it happens yep here i've got my range unit and my melee unit alright so i can see i have some enemies next to me i can see them on the minimap so right here to the right yep a whole bunch of enemies and the enemy spawner so let's select both of these guys go in and let's attack that ranged unit there you go they attack and yep my poor guy can't handle it all of them so he's actually got way too much health but yep there you go he can't do it and this enemy spawner is also constantly spawning new enemy so i must take it down quickly so i need a bunch more units to be able to destroy it so let's make a bunch more villagers to gather some resources faster and now make a bunch more attack units all right already got quite a bunch of units so a bunch of gatherers and they're almost done gathering all these resources so let's grab these guys and see if i can start taking them down so there you go they start attacking they start taking down those and now they start taking out the enemy spawner and once done boom they're gone so i got my units they've taken over this area and now i can see on the side here i've got some more stone so let's capture this area all right so this area is now taking over so i can go ahead grab some of my villagers all of you come over here and then in here let's build another storage so i've got another storage and now i can tell them to go and gather in there and now they gather from there and they drop it in there instead of going all the way back over here all right so that's the final game it's got all of the basic rts mechanics you would expect you can download the project files to see how all the code works and if you're looking for a stepbystep guide on how quite a lot of the systems used here work then go ahead and grab my builder defender course a lot of the things that i made here unlike the building construction resource management ui and so on a lot of that i covered in detail during that course so if you're interested in this genre then go ahead and check it out this was an interesting project to work on taking a game and remaking it into a completely different genre again go check out the official unt open projects that game is still actively being worked on so there's still time for you to submit something and contribute to that project it's a really interesting unity initiative so go ahead and check it out alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
