hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's learn where we can get some free animations and models and learn how to import them into unity now i'm sure a lot of you already know about this website but i'm also sure there's some people that don't know about it so i figured i'd make a quick video the website in question is called maximo this is an awesome completely free website with tons of characters and tons of animations you've got a search bar and you can search from thousands of free animations same thing for the characters all of them free and they are in pretty nice quality and any of these characters can be used with any of these animations not to mention any other humanoid characters or humanoid animations all of them are compatible with each other also by the way this video is not sponsored by miximo it's just a great website that can be very useful to you while making your games and like i said this can also be very useful for combining with things you already have for example a while ago i made a video highlighting the free assets he could get from the asset store the deal is over now but you could get some packs that had tons of characters now if you missed that video because youtube didn't recommend it then maybe go onto the website and set up your account to receive direct emails notifying you when there's a new video that way you won't miss out on these timesensitive opportunities and you're not dependent on the youtube algorithm choosing what videos you should watch so anyways there was that pack that you could get for free and like i mentioned in the video all of these cinti assets come with a humanoid rig humanoid is just a type that unity has which allows for animation retargeting meaning that you can use a humanoid character combined with any humanoid animation and as it turns out mixomo is full of humanoid and missions as well as humanoid characters so let's first look into how to import free animations and then we're going to see how to import a free character so as an example over here i have a character again this one is from that city pack the character is in a standard tpose so just a basic mesh character now the first thing is to ensure that the mesh is set up as humanoid so you select the mesh in the project files and over here on the inspector go onto the rig tab and over here under animation type make sure you select humanoid so just do that and hit on apply so that's all you need to do as long as the mesh is rigged with a humanoid rig if not then over here you can also manually define the avatar or copy from another one or click on configure so again if you already set up your mesh as a humanoid rig then all of these will be assigned automatically so you can see all the various joints that make up the humanoid rig and once it is set up as humanoid then it works with any humanoid animation after that you can just go into maximo.com and just log in or sign up with a free account so here it is and now up here you've got two buttons one for animations and one for characters now right now we want the animation so let's go into the animations tab and then just go ahead search for any of these animations so you can see there's tons of them all these and you got a search bar up here you can search for anything you want and there you go lots of interesting animations okay so just go ahead and pick any of these animations like i said these are all humanoids so any of these animations will be compatible with our humanoid character so just pick an animation and then depending on the animation over here on the right side you also have a bunch more parameters so for this one for example there's a parameter for the hit intensity so if i put it real low then just moves a tiny bit if i put it really high then it has a much more intense effect so some of these animations have these parameters so make sure you play around that okay when you got the animation that you want just go ahead click on download and then over here you've got the download settings now for the first one is the format and for this one you can go with fbx for unity then the next one is the skin with or without the skin so if you say yes then this 3d model will be included in the download and if you go without skin then only the animation is included so right now we just want the animation so let's go with that then over here for the frames per second so this is the number of keyframes you can pick whatever you want usually either 30 or 60. either of those won't look good unity then interpolates all the values in between and finally for keyframe reduction so this is if you want your animation file to be compressed if you're making a mobile game then this might be useful to play around to have the final game be really small but for this demo and for pc games pretty much just leave it on none alright so that's it and click on download then just copy paste the file inside the ent assets folder and here it is now even though i did not include the 3d model so i did not include the skin it still comes inside an fbx file so there's an fpx you can expand it and over here you've got the reaction animation so the next step is to select the main file and over here do the exact same thing as a mesh so go on to the wreck tab change it from generic into humanoid just go ahead hit on apply and now this is set up as a humanoid and if you wanted you could just click and drag this reaction animation as you can see it already works like that there's the animation so you could just use this one directly in your animator or you can separate this from this file so just select it and press on ctrl d in order to duplicate it and the duplicated file is outside of the fbx so there you go and over here you've got a phone just with the animation and now we just need to apply this to our character so first select the actual mesh object then you add the animator component and now over here is an extremely important step which is for this to work you need to assign the animator avatar and very very important is this avatar is the avatar for the mesh so over here i've got the mesh for this character and inside i've got the avatar so it is this one that you use and not the one on the animation because over here on the animation that we downloaded we can see that we also have an avatar so it is not this one you use the avatar for the mesh not the animation okay so just make sure you're using that one and then let's just make a new animated controller just assign this one and then double click to open up the animator window and then just click and drag our animation on there there you go it starts off on the start one then we can go back into the scene view select the characters open up the animation window so you can go into window animation open up the animation window so that's this one and over here you can already preview the animation so there you go yep that's the animation that we downloaded and of course just like with any animation you can change a lot of things so for example apply root motion or not and you can go into the animation itself and for example bake that into the pose so just do all the usual things that you can do with any animation alright so here it is our custom humanoid character playing a custom humanoid animation alright awesome okay so these are the steps for downloading a custom animation and using it in unity now let's see how we download an actual character so for that let's go back into maximo then go into the characters tab and then over here just go ahead and pick from any of these characters so for example this really strange boss character now this one is not playing the selected animation if you want you can go over here and click on the close there you go it just goes into the normal t pose okay so that's the characters once again go into download and choose fbx for unity for the pose yep tpose looks good alright so here i've got the character in unity however if right away you just try to click and drag this one onto the scene and nope you do see the issue and the issue is that it has no textures so you've got the mesh but no textures now they are included in the file but they need to be extracted so just select the file then since we're here we can already go ahead and make it as humanoid okay then go into the materials tab and over here we've got two buttons to extract materials and the textures so let's extract the materials then just pick a folder and select it there you go over here you see all the various materials now we need the texture so same thing just go up here extract the textures and up here we've got all the materials and all the textures now i just need to assign them so all these use the same texture so just select them all drag the diffuse onto the diffuse map onto the base map then the normal go into the normal map then also this one is not marked as normal so just fix it there you go already looks good and finally this one has a specular map so just go with that one like that and yep just like that now it looks correct so we've got our custom mesh as well as the custom materials and textures now once again it's the exact same thing for using this one with the same animations so we already saved it as humanoid so the mesh is marked as humanoid and over here again on the animator make sure you're using the avatar from this one there you go the boss avatar okay and now you can use this with any animation so for example we don't even need the new animator controller just use the exact same one and just go into the animation and there you go now we've got our custom character playing our custom animation so yep there it is as you can see this website is super useful with tons of only free characters and free animations so the next time you start working on a prototype go here and download a nice model with some nice animations to make your game look great alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
