hello and welcome I'm your code machiene in this video we're going to view a summary of the tooltip series let's begin so the goal in this series is to make a tool tip this is a great UI element that we can use to show extra information to the player later we will adapt our code to easily show a item stats tooltip so first we're going to create the basic tool tip we want to make a simple UI element that we can show and hide while following the mouse we also want the background to adapt to whatever text we give it for testing we're going to show the tooltip when we pass the mouse over a button or a label then we're going to work on making sure the tooltip is always visible that means calculating the background size to see if the tooltip is leaving the screen and if so move it accordingly with the tooltip always visible inside the screen we're going to add the ability to update it in real time this is great for displaying something that is constantly changing like a condom we will also add various helper functions and extension methods to make our class very easy to use afterwards we will create a separate on tip class to show a warning so we'll make it flash red and display a warning message for some time this is very useful in addition to the regular tooltip so we can show the player an error message like if he can't afford a certain amount and finally we're going to take our code and quickly adapt it into a complex item stats window we only use the code for following the mouse and keeping it inside the screen while adding many new text films and images this will show you how important it is to write code that is easy to understand so you can adapt it to something different when needed so that's a plan for the tooltip series it's a great UI element that is essential if your game is UI heavy also if you ever need to create some sort of item stats window we won't be able to easily adapt the code to support it so go watch the point list and begin learning right now as always you can download the project from the utilities for each video in the series from unity kurma keep calm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
