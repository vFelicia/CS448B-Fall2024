hello and welcome I'm your kodaki and here's a really interesting article Byam isma talking about the top 10 tips for surviving the Indie pocalypse this is an excellent article so let's read through it and see what his tips are if you don't know who he is he's basically one half of the Indie Studio flam year this is the Indie Studio responsible for some pretty huge Indie hits games like Super Crate Box Ridiculous Fishing and Nuclear Throne they've been around since 2010 so since before indie game became a huge thing so anyways Rami does have quite a lot of experience in the indie game industry and nowadays I think he's a consultant so he's still up to date and also before we read this article let me actually ask you a question how many of you are familiar with the term in the Apocalypse Now this was a term that was really big around I don't know six seven years ago right after SE actually announced seam green light and then seam direct back then there were a lot of people talking about the Indie apocalypse so essentially this is going to be the end of the world because anybody can just put any game on scam so that is going to make it really difficult to find success but nowadays this word in the apocalypse Sy one isn't really heard too much nowadays nowadays I think people have already realized okay so this is New Normal it is just really difficult to find success with IND the games that's just normal so I'm curious to know how many of you who might have be quite younger developers how many of you are familiar with the word IND apocalypse but anyways let's read this article and see if we can learn something from it this article is based on talk deck H gave during the reboot develop blue conference in Croatia this was just ear ear this year so it's relevant to 2023 so let's read all of these steps starting off with the first one which is understand the risks he goes on to say if you have an infinite amount of money then please go ahead and maximize your opportunities if you have infinite amount of money you can take risks but if you're just staring out your biggest obstacles are probably that you haven't shipped anything you have no money and you have no experience so at that point you should figure out how to minimize your risks his male advised that studio start by making a game that's not expensive he shared that radical fishing the original flash version of what became Ridiculous Fishing which again was a huge hit this one cost around $60 and was made on on school computers now this is definitely the advice that I would give to you which is start off simple start off with a simple idea and don't spend tons of money if you're just getting start then the main thing you really need to get is just experience you need to make some small games and get that experience you actually learn how game development actually works so you should be trying to gain all that knowledge as cheaply as possible perhaps you can buy some asset from the store perhaps spend a couple hundred dollars but definitely don't go ahead and get some custom music custom art and spend tens of thousands of dollars so I definitely agree minimize how much money you spend on your first few games if you do that then essentially you minimize risks if you only spend $100 on making your first game if that game flops then that's really not much cost number two don't chase the market this is an interesting one because there's actually two ways to go about this he says in the gamees industry things move in waves but they're also weirdly unpredictable giving the example of OverWatch which was a hero shooter with lots of abilities that was a huge success been in 2016 but in 2018 the biggest hit was God of War which was a very narrative driven game so complely different from OverWatch so the game Market does move quite quickly so on this one I would say Don't just chase the market if you're going to find success especially as an indid I would say Do not chase a AAA Market however there's another side to this coin there's actually a positive way to chase the market that is what some people have called Fast follow essentially you find in the game that is finding tons of success and you very quickly in about two to three months make a game similar to that but adds a few things on top that is one strategy that can find some success again if you manage to make the game actually really quickly one very clear recent example of that is vampire survivors it was a huge hit that came out of nowhere and there were some games that came out shortly afterwards that were based on the same core concept but they built it in different ways by now that is pretty much saturated if you make a vampire survivors like nowadays it's really difficult to find success but right after the game was a huge hit at that point there was a period of time when it was possible to find success by just being like vampire survivals but with something different so that is a strategy that can sometimes work now number three test your business case and it's actually an interesting one if you are going to pitch your game to polishers then Ismail recommends that you start pitching with the five Publishers you hate the most basically the idea is your very first pitch is probably going to be your worst pitch as with anything you get experience the more times you do it so you basically don't want to give your very worst pitch to the number one publisher that you'd like to get so the idea is basically get some experience before you actually talk to the publisher that you would really like to have now for me I've never pitched to publisher so I'm not too familiar with this one but this seems like an interesting approach he also talks about in the context of selfpublishing and with that there are still ways to test your business case basically testing your game idea is this game idea actually viable the main way to test is really just to start putting out content so start putting out some gifts on Twitter start putting out videos on YouTube do all kinds of things you can do that and then look at the actual data in order to decide is this idea worth pursuing or not one interesting strategy to try to find what game you should pursue is to basically essentially pick out let's say three to five game ideas that you have and basically do a mockup of what those games would be like and build up a seam page for each one of those games then you try to promote them make some kind of videos make some kind of gifts maybe even look into actually paid advertising do that in order to test and see which one of those actually interacts the best see which ones gathers the most amount of wish list after your test you can do that to see which one converts best and then decide which one you want to actually follow through that is an interesting strategy that can find good results but also requires quite a ton of work but either way it's good to know tip number four is a assume failure the only healthy way to run any business as Mel said is to assume that at the end of everything your game does not make any money for example when seeking funding from a publisher make sure you ask enough not only to make the game and ship it but also to keep the studio running for 3 to 6 months enabling you to get ready to pitch your next game again I've always selfpublished all my games and I've always kept my cost real low so this kind of thing isn't really relevant to my own personal experience but the core idea here is solid that is why I would never recommend anyone to just quit their day job in order to start making any games this is an extremely tough business so I definitely not encourage you to put yourself in a position where if your game fails you suddenly go homeless that's a termal thing so definitely make sure you don't risk that much and also another tip is right here even if your game is successful you don't get money at launch for example on seam it won't take you at least two months in order to actually receive your verif paycheck see if your bank account hits zero by the time you actually launch your game even if the game is successful you might still have problems so definitely make sure you allow for that buffer then for tip number five don't aim too high he mentions how his former suu volum beer the team was never bigger than seven people and most of the time it was two to five people so with that they only made games that could be made by two to five people that is definitely a great tip sometimes you can have a game that actually finds success in the beginning but then you can risk it all and essentially go bankrupt by your second game because you expended so much again this goes back to risk management make sure you keep in mind what resources you have available how many people you have in your studio and make sure your game can be built with that team here he says we made a deal when we we started that we would never grow and it worked out just fine because the games we were making were consistent with what we could do and also just make better games he said you don't have to grow to do that your team is getting better getting more experience more used to each other eventually your team starts being better without you having to grow now for me personally this is something that I really believe in I know some people have dreams of having an indie studio with like a dozen people making really complex games but for me personally that has never been my dream for me I'm perfectly happy working by myself maybe with an artist sometimes so for me I've never had desire of building a huge Indie Studio but for you if that's the kind of dream that you have definitely keep in mind the risk with growing too fast too quickly next tip number six build your brand game developers need to establish a human connection with their audience and build an identity that makes them stand out he challenged developers to imagine two friends talking about their games in the future what do you want them to say so this goes back to what exactly is your goal in terms of any games are you trying to make just a single game and that's it you're going out or do you want to keep making games essentially for the rest of your life if so then yeah it is important to keep in mind your brand essentially build a community of people that do like your games do like your style and like says here he also emphasized that this does not mean developers need to keep making games in the same genre for example V's games they are all wildly different although once being different they do have a consistent identity you can look at all of them and see Yep this was made by vamer and when speaking of Brands speaking of building a community that actually brings upon one of the sort of negatives of working with the publisher for example to H Indie hits called the lamb or Hotline Miami they're definitely huge hits that millions of people have played however out of those millions of people chances are not many of them actually know the developers they might know the Publishers but not developers so if you do decide to go with a publisher keep in mind you are possibly sacrificing this part worly is going to be much more difficult to actually go through the polisher and get to the actual final player and somehow turn them into fans of your studio and not the polisher next tip number seven Embrace sincerity being sincere as an individual is crucial to being seen as reliable every game has a fingerprint of its creator so once again this goes back to definitely make sure you don't make games just because you want to build something that was popular games are extremely complex extremely difficult to make so whatever game Ida you decide to follow make sure this is actually sincere to who you are for example for me I hate puzzle games so it would not be wise for me to build a puzzle game tip number eight avoid the obvious obvious game ideas are the ones to avoid now this one that I sort of agree sort of disagree with you can definitely go too obvious to the point where it's basically complely generic and your game has nothing original to do with it but at the same time if you counter that you might go so unque that nobody actually understands your game so the balance between making it familiar and unique that is a very tough balance to strike tip number nine is fail faster basically this is the concept where you build a prototype and quickly try to see does this prototype work does this core game idea is sexually viable or not if you've made a handful of prototypes chances are you know there are some of them that don't work at all and some of them do work right away so being able to analyze those protypes and figure out should you actually pursue this idea does this work like this or not again this goes back to minimizing risk So the faster you fail the cheaper it will be to actually fail so if you have something that is not really working out some game idea that you thought would work but once you make the Prototype does not work it might be wise to actually just quit that idea right there and move on to something else but at the same time I would also say that this depends on chmer for example for me personally I love working on management games so games with tons of Interlocking Systems and for those a quick prototype might actually not be representative of the final game so there are some genres like for example the games that L does there are some of those genres that are pretty much just based on gameplay and on a quick prototype you can easily see is this game idea going to work or not but there are others where it does require quite a bit more work in order to actually get to a functional prototype where you can actually validate is this idea viable but yep in general fail faster is excellent advice tip number 10 be luckier yeah that's definitely a good tip if you can find it so just stop being unlucky I've made a video on this topic quite a while ago and yeah on the concept of luck this is definitely something that definitely exists it is definitely a factor in game development and really anything in life however I also believe that if you do things right if you pick the right game idea if you focus on marketing if you focus on doing all the right things you can't actually guarantee success but you can definitely minimize the amount of luck that you require in order to actually find success so yep luck is a factor as it is a factor in pretty much anything in any part of life but I believe that by being smart you can essentially minimize how much luck affects your final result and tip number 11 there is no Indie apocalypse so this goes back to what I mentioned in the very beginning of this video how many of you know this word because this word Indie apocalypse this hasn't really been mentioned in pretty much any website for the past few months or even years one excellent comparison that I've heard in some kind of article that I read ages ago basically how nowadays becoming an indie Game Dev is kind of like starting a band for many years now pretty much anyone can start a band I mean a guitar cost what like 30 to 50 bucks so the barrier to entry to actually making music is super low and nowadays with the internet you can easily put your music up for sale and try to actually become a musician so there is no barri to entry and becoming an IND game developer is pretty much the same thing the tools are all free nowadays there's tons of free education so I think the reason why the word Indie apocalypse isn't used anymore is because people have realized there's no Indie apocalypse this is just pretty much a new normal finding success in terms of Indie Games is extremely difficult and that's just going to be how it is for the next few years and forever really there's a massive amount of people that want to make games and well there is a large amount of people that want to actually play games there's more people making them than people have time to play them so by now for the past few years years the Indie Market has already been 100% saturated so the good news is things aren't necessarily getting much worse but the bad news is things are definitely not going to get any easier people are going to keep making tons and tons of games and are going to have lots of challenges in order to actually find the players to play those games this goes back to the first step which is minimizing risk just like with making a startup or any kind of Risky Business this is an extremely difficult business so definitely make sure you don't risk your whole life on making sure that your game finds success because chances are it probably won't now that's a bit negative so let me end on a positive note which is whil it is really difficult to find success that also really depends on what success means to you for me personally I'm currently working on my steam game dinking Guardians and for that game my definition of success is actually pretty achievable and the reason for that is because I'm not really spending too much money on the game I have a pretty low cost of living so my risk is actually pretty low and even if the game does fail I know for certain that I will not go homeless I will not go hungry so even though this is my ninth steam game I'm still very much paying attention to this device like primarily the one about minimizing risk so depending on how you define success for your games it is really difficult but it is possible here's a quick update from the future I actually recorded this video a few months ago and since then I have already released my game thankfully it has done quite well based on my modest realistic goals all right so that's the article it's really interesting definitely go ahead and read the whole thing I hope you found my thoughts interesting thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
