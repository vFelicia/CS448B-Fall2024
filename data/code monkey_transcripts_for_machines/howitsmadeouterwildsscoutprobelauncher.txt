hello and welcome i'm your code monkey here is the game the other ones which feature some interesting mechanics and systems let's inspect and remake the scout launcher you press a button to shoot a probe which has a camera attached to it and you can take shots from that camera and even move it around i won't cover how it works how i remade it and how youtube can make something like this in your own games after watching the video you can go ahead and download the project files and inspect only source code watch the home playlist if you want to learn some more about some other games like for example the cleaning mini game in rover mechanic simulator or the soil moisture system in endzone or warmly part and follow the curator page on sim if you want to see more of these types of videos alright so first just a quick overview of what the game is about to give you some context it's called the outer wilds and it's a very interesting adventure exploration game you're an astronaut going off on your very first mission to explore the solar system you have phone control over your spaceship you can launch from anywhere and land in any place then you'll leave your spaceship and explore on foot each planet is unique with a very different mystery to uncover it is a very mysterious game and has a really awesome central mechanic that i really don't want to spoil here so i won't say anymore if you're into exploration games and uncovering mysteries then definitely give this one a try and if you're just an indie game developer then i would also encourage you to play it because the central mechanic is really just that interesting and very unique also fun fact this game was made with yinty okay so let's inspect and remake the scout launcher it involves using some interesting unity features that you might not know about do you want to master game development and make a fulltime living creating games learn how to do it with this video sponsor the ultimate gamedev course it's a massive course model at an extremely low price taught by both jason wyman and thomas brush who together already have over 3 500 students worldwide it will teach you everything you need to know to make both 2d and 3d games on a professional level with some good patterns and workflows on top of this it will also teach you how to successfully launch your game and hopefully make a fulltime living so you will learn how to work with publishers crowdfunding how to run a successful kickstarter just like thomas himself has done jason is a veteran in the aaa games industry having worked on massively complex titles like everquest 2 and vanguard and thomas has published two games that were very successful and received a bunch of awards and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from publishers and kickstarter the campaign starts on july 1st and runs for only 30 days or until all of the seats are sold out there's only 300 limited seats available to ensure the best experience possible for all students so go ahead and get the ultimate gamedev course before the seats run out with a link in the description and turn game dev into your dream job okay so let's remake the scout launcher now first let's inspect what happens in the game itself this cover launcher is the tool you can equip and then when you fire it it shoots the scout pro and as it goes an image pops up on the screen that shows what the probe is seeing note how the screen is a ui element on top of the main ui also the probe has a different visual different post processing then by pressing a button you can take another screenshot from the probe and update the view every time we press the button it updates with a new image from the probe camera as for the probe itself it's a simple projectile it gets fired and falls along with gravity once the bottom part of the probe hits something it sticks so if the top part hits something that doesn't stick only the landing gear sticks and the last ability is you can change the angle of the camera so you can look left right up down by pressing some other buttons so you shoot the pro you get an image then you can update that image at will then when it lands somewhere you can press more buttons to rotate the view and see anything around the pro it's a really interesting mechanic and it perfectly matches the game the game is all about exploration so sending a probe out to an undiscovered place is a great mechanic that perfectly fits with the genre so let's see how we can rebuild this which is actually quite easy if you know about one specific unity tool so first of all for the projectile itself it's all very standard i just made the probe game object i add the collider and a rigid body and that's pretty much it for the setup when i press the mouse button it just spawns a probe directly on the camera's position and sets the rigid body velocity based on the player's camera for its vector with that i can look anywhere and shoot out the probe very easily and by the way for the probe visual that i'm using here it's from the simple space asset pack there's a link if you want to get it now for the lending logic i need to know when the bottom part of the object touches something there are many ways to do this you can do it all through code essentially just constantly fire a boxcast or you can do it with colliders which is the approach that i used essentially i just need to position a collider at the bottom of the probe and then listen to collisions now always keep in mind that in order for a collision to occur there must be a rigid body present on at least one of the collision objects i'm saying this because i myself forgot about this rule if you want some more specifics on this rule go check out the video i have made on it it's pretty frustrating when you don't know why it isn't working so make sure you know about it i initially made the landing as a separate piece just with the box slider and it didn't work it didn't work because the landing did not have a rigid body neither did whatever floor it went on so the solution for that was pretty simple instead of making the landing collater on a separate game object i just placed it on the main game object so the main game object has a lending collider and then the physical shape collider is in a child game object it's important that they are separated so i can make sure to only listen to collisions on the landing collider then for the code itself it's very simple just listen to on collision enter this gets triggered once when a collision occurs and when that happens in order to glue the probe it's really just a matter of disabling movement and rotation on the rigid body so just freeze everything so it stays completely fixed but it should also match whatever it lands on you don't want it to stay glued to a surface by the probe's head meaning that what we really want is to rotate the probe to match the normal of whatever surface it landed on so for that we can use the collision parameters which contains data for the exact normal that we need just apply that to the probe transform.up and it automatically rotates to match the surface perfectly so with all of that the probe behavior is working it can be fired and moves like any projectile if the landing gear touches something it gets glued onto that surface by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks now for the main part taking the pictures like i said this is super easy to do if you know about one ent feature i'm of course talking about rendered textures this is one of the features that i cover in detail in my ultimate unity overview course so go ahead and get it if you want to learn more about it and 30 other unity tools and features what it does is it lets you render a camera view onto a specific texture instead of directly on the screen so that's really all we need so first create a render texture then assign it to the camera output and then with that random texture just show it on screen to show it there's also one thing you need to know in the ui if you make an image component it only supports showing sprites but the render texture is a texture it's not a sprite so you cannot use it there but there is another component the raw image and this one takes a texture inside of a sprite so you can assign it and with that you can view the render texture on the ui itself then for making it work like the game the pro camera is meant to take pictures and not video so it's not meant to be constantly updating in order to handle that it's very simple just keep the camera disabled so it's not rendering and then when the player press the button simply enable the camera render onto the texture and disable the camera again this way it works like the game taking pictures instead of phone video next up for the visual on the camera it's also different from the main game this is another thing that's very easy to do for adding post processing to your games you create an object and you add the volume component then you can add whatever postprocessing you want and then on the camera object you have a field where you can select what postprocessing affects that camera specifically it's based on layers so you can define the second postprocessing in a new layer and then you set the main camera to ignore that layer and then the pro camera to only apply post processing on that second layer and yep just like that the main camera and pro camera are both using different post processing effects the next thing is just the probe camera rotation also pretty simple you just listen to player input when the player presses a button it's really just a matter of rotating the camera transform so just rotate on the x and y and then after rotating just take another image and yep that's pretty much it so by pressing the buttons you can rotate the image and see everything that pro can see when you put all of that together we have recreated the probe exactly like in the game so it works like a projectile press the button and it gets fired it moves like any projectile and phones along with gravity then for a landing if it touches any object it gets glued onto that object and matches the direction of the surface that will land on as it gets fired it takes a picture of the pro camera the probe camera also has different visual then manually the player can take some more pictures and the player can also rotate the pro camera to see everything around the probe itself alright so there you have it that's how you can recreate the probe launcher from the outer worlds it's a great mechanic and definitely something you can easily add to your games render textures are insanely useful and as you can see they'll let you create some really interesting mechanics check out the phone how it's made playlist follow the curator page on seem and like this video if you want to see more of these types of videos also let me know what other games have some interesting mechanics that you'd like to know how they work also don't forget to check out the ultimate gamedev course in the description it's only running for 30 days so check it out and turn gamedev into your dream job alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
