hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this last video of the graph series we're going to view a real use case of the graph being used in battle royale Tycoon let's begin so over the course of this series we created this class which displays our graph we have a bunch of functions down here to set the values of the graph and modifying how it is this point so let's see the graph being used in battle round I could here is the game right now and I have several graphs set up over here is the food kiosk and if I open up the window and I click on the graph in here you can see the graph being used to display the number of guests that have bought food for each month labels on the xaxis are correctly displaying the month and year for each bar and in here I have the stats window which shows a couple more graphs here we have the number of guests that have entered the park and as you can see this one is updating in realtime whenever a new guest enters the park then I also have a line graph being used for the park rating showing the bank balance s happiness and guests in park and so on all this is done using the class we created in this series so now let's take a look at how the editor is set up so over here is the food kiosk window and inside I have the craft transform which I converted in to a prefab to be able to copy around it has all the elements that we created in the series the container the background and the various templates and as well as the tooltip and in here I have these stats window which again contains the same transform with a different size so now let's check out the code so here on the graph I polished it up a bit and remove the code for the testing buttons the functions are now public since we want to use them outside of this class and the tooltip is no longer static so we can have multiple windows working using our graph is very simple all we need to do is call this function the show graph and pass in our value list now we could modify the class to work with generics instead of being forced to use int but for now it's simple and it's enough for what the game needs and down here we have the update function which updates a single value in the graph without having to recreate the whole thing so let's see the code on the food kiosk window here is the code that runs that part of the window as you can see on the constructor we grabbed a reference to our window graph and we also set the is label X to display the month and then the year we want to display that instead of just showing the index then we have this show function in here which is triggered when the graph window is opened we are growing the data log from the food kiosk so let's quickly see how that class is set up here is the data log class it's pretty simple all that matters is that we have our list of values and in each index of the list we contain the value for that month so in this case it's how many guests have visited the food kiosk on that particular month when we have a new month we add another index to our list and when the food kiosk records a sale it triggers this function in here which adds the value to our list so when a cell is registered the last index on this list gets increased by one and when this class registers a sale it triggers the on add sale event so going back into the window over here as you can see we are capturing the on add sale event when the event is triggered we update the last value on our graph since that is the only one that has changed and when there is a new month we call the show where I functions since unless size has changed and that's all it takes to show the graph and update now let's check out the other window and in here we have pretty much the same thing we grabbed a reference to our window graph and we set the label to display the month in the year there are also some buttons to display the data type that is shown in the graph so when we are showing that that a time we give it the list of values that we wish to this point this is using the eternal log just like the food kiosk so in here on the guests entered graph we use this list with a bar chart visual and on the bank balance we use this list with the online graph visual and we display the yaxis as a label showing thousands and on our update we simply update the last index value depending on the list that we have chosen so as you can see we create a nice clean class that is very easy to use the game is launching in December so add it to your wish list if you want to see how what I'm teaching in this channel has an actual application in a real commercial game so in this series we create the graph from scratch with a robust enough class that displays anything in any way we want as always you can download the project files and utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
