hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the asset swore is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for October 23 in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering PID ass and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them and by the way my own game has just come out this month it's a fun game with some automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you build a colony automate it and keep the tiny defenseless dinky safe from harm you then colonize other planets ga Resources with the ultimate goal of colonizing every planet and automating everything so your dinkies can finally relax it is out now on seam I hope you like it and please make sure to write a review with your thoughts all right so on to the top 10 list starting off with a really nice looking tool for making 2D soft bodies this can be some slightly stretchy objects or it can be some fluids and it seems it's able to do it in a very performant manner with lots of particles interacting I covered how to do some basic fluid simulation in a tutorial quite a long time ago the issue with that method was only performance I'm surprised that at how good this one seems to be especially considering how it's free I tried looking to see if it was just a free trial version but nope it seems to be entirely free so if you have an idea for a game that is based on fluids or sof body physics then this would be a great starting point it also has all the code available on GitHub so that also makes this an excellent research project next for some visual assets here is a free military pack it features a bunch of parts for making a military base so you've got some tin some sandbags a tower a bunch of crates targets and even a tank so this would be a great staring pack and if you like this style then this tab has tons more then if you need a tun Shader here's a really nice free one it's made by cro who used to work at unity and was involved in that really nice Unity open project game with that really nice looking pick character that game was using a tune Shader so I wonder if this is him taking that and making it a fully complete nice free accet the video shows the Shader being applied to jemo which is the fun official character from the excellent Channel mixing Jam adding a custom Shader like this one is a great way to improve how your game looks personally I always love tun shaders next here is an interesting complex tool called super Behavior this one is basically a class that replaces the standard mono Behavior it automatically caches the transforms it adds inspector property support and already has some prewritten patterns like Singletons you can easily Define icons for your custom scripts then those icons show up in the inspector and in the project files it even has some interesting vs code extension with some nice timesaving Snippets then if you need some status icons here's a bunch of fantasy ones it's a a super simple pack with some eight nice unique icons you could easily animate them to get quite a bit of variation you could make them shake or change the alpha so this would fit perfectly in any cartoony game like for example I could even use some of these in my own game dinky Gard next if you're working on a game where you need some regular humans check out this pack it features eight characters all of them fully rigged it's a really nice low poly flat shaded style the textures are interchangeable and since they are all flat shaded you could also easily recolor them so with just this one pack you could definitely get tons of variation I can see this one being great for making a game kind of like inspired by The Sims and if you like this free asset you can get the full pack with tons more characters next for a simple visual tool here we have some hierarchy icons this is pretty simple it does exactly what you expect it can be quite useful if you have tons of systems in your hierarchy and you want to very quickly find a medic lens it use the default Unity icon so you don't even need to draw anything although I also assume you could modify to support any icon Sprite to make all of your scripts look nice and unique then if you're working on a casual game here's a nice and simple UI pack you've got pretty much all of the basic elements that you could possibly need to make a casual game you've got some frames some backgrounds various generic buttons and bars so if you like me have no art skills then a super basic pack like this one will greatly help your game look much better even during just e prototype stage next if you need some cute characters check out this one it's a pretty nice skeleton in a cute style it's very round it's got a very big head it also has a humanoid rig and also even a BL shape on the face to go from Angry to sad if you like this style then this tab has tons more then for another really interesting tool here is the debug inspector this one is a nice and simple tool for locating all of your debug logs in all of your files this can definitely be quite useful when you have quite a large project with logs all over the place this makes it super easy to find them even if they are commented out you can then either modify them or remove them directly from the window or simply open up the script it's quite an interesting very unique tool all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the UN assur for October 23 there's links to all in the description also check out my own game dinky Gardens and I hope you like it all right hope that's useful check out these
