hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights it will release in september 2021 in this first video i will be covering a list of free assets and in the next ones i will be covering paid assets and tools check out the phone playlist to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on by the way there's a mega bundle happening right now on the unity store as usual it's a super deep discount up to 95 off it contains lots of interesting tools so there's one to help you manage an inventory database another one for placing some decals and the terrain system there's a digging system you can slice meshes volumetric vfx and tons more as usual with such a deep discount it's worth it if just one of these assets looks interesting check it out with the link in the description alright so starting off with an official asset made by unity cardskins this is an official addon to the karting micro game so it's made primarily for that but really these are just car meshes so if you have a carton game of any kind then this can be quite useful the cars themselves look great very nice as eyes and prevaried in total you've got 12 unique vehicles for you to play with then if instead you need some 2d particle effects here's three great ones these are impact effects so great for damaging things one of them looks like some electric damage the other one more fire and smoke and the last one putting them both together they are simple and they all look great for some textures here's a nice pack they're in a hand painted sound so slightly cartoony you've got some grass ground and ground with rocks of them with multiple variations and in pretty high resolution the variations also have different light baked into them so it allows you to fake light in your terrains without actually using lights for some props and assets here is an office scene i really like this style pretty cute the screenshots look excellent i really like the black outline it's a pretty big pack for something that's free you've got a bunch of building parts and quite a nice amount of props next up for an interesting tool here is collider x this is a tool to help you make your scene much more performant it goes through all the objects in your scene and then based on your settings it either has a mesh collider which is pretty expensive or it simplifies the object and adds a simple unboxing leather so this can be useful for very quickly improving performance in your scenes when you have tons of colliders if you need some great looking weapons check out this pack features quite a lot of them for a free pack you've got a bunch of axes some shields bows dagger swords and a couple of stops all of them with multiple visuals for quite a bit of customization so if you're working on the phone melee game then this one is great up next you can add some life to your sapphire levels with these decals make your scene look much more realistic by adding a bunch of stickers everywhere in total over 30 stickers with a bunch of warnings caution instructions and so on pretty interesting then here's a pretty unique one called simplenet based on description this is a super simple bare bones networking library it doesn't say how it works but i would assume that it's based on simple csharp sockets so this one could be a great asset for you to download and inspect the code if you want to learn the basics of networking connections in c sharp if you're working on a pixel art scifi game then check out this pack features one character and two enemies it's got quite a bit of animations for the main character and a bunch of background items so this one is great if you want to just quickly add a visual to your platformer or if you want to play around with some spreadsheet animation and finally here's another one also officially made by unity this one is probably not of much interest to game developers but it's pretty interesting as you might know unity is expanding more and more into different areas and one of those is automotive so this one seems like it's a template for creating some sort of car dashboard if you're working on a realistic racing game then maybe you can take some parts from this some of the gauges look really nice alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unity assessor for september 2021 there's links to all in the description stay tuned for the next video covering paid assets and tools there's lots of awesome stuff there check out the phone playlist to see some more
