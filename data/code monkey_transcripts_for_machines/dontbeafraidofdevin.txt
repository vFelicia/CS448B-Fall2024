hello and welcome I'm your K monkey so there's a lot of scary discourse right now all about Devon the supposedly first AI software engineer there's a lot of talk on how this is the beginning of the end for programmers now I wasn't planning to make a video on this there's already people much more qualified than me that have made videos on this topic the videos by Prime and the are both great I definitely encourage you to watch them if you concerned about this topic now for me I'm a solo indie game developer who is selftaught I've really never done a software engineering interview or worked at some kind of big company so when the topic is specifically software engineering for that I'll leave that to people much more qualified than me in that area although I heard Prime say something really interesting he asked his audience about their experience which has quite a lot of beginners with no experience or less than one year experience or even just one to 5 years and he mentioned how it's actually very important to talk about this topic because when beginners see headlines like this one so is coding Dead killing Developer jobs how it's bad news for software devs and so on when beginners see headlines like this one they might be concerned thinking that studying programming or computer science is no longer a valuable skill and they get scared into think that they shouldn't pursue that career so initially I wasn't going to make a video on this topic but I figured the audience over here on this channel also has quite a lot of beginners who might also read these headlines and might also question themselves about whether this is a viable career a viable skill in today's age especially because most of the discourse that you see over here on Twitter most of these messages which I assume come from nonsoftware Engineers most of it is having a this to like crazy pretty much taking all their marketing materials at face value so if you were to read all these comments you would definitely think that this is the beginning of the end if you get your news from Twitter it does seem that way what in reality actually isn't the case so if you're concerned about your future based on this my answer is yes I still believe that software engineering and programming is still an extremely valuable skill and will continue to be so for many many years basically my view on AI and the potential for displacing jobs and all kinds of things my view on that is actually quite simple it is really impressive it's insane how much Ai and all of AI tools have grown so much in these past few years it's insane how it's already grown so much and continues growing even more who knows where AI W be in the next 5 years and specifically this Dev AI it is really impressive what it can do but at the same time it's really impressive in the same way that a magic break is really impressive it is very fascinating to see what it is capable of but not necessarily all that useful or at least not as useful as their marketing material would have you believe so I do think AI is indeed already extremely powerful and will continue becoming even more powerful I do think it will lead to more and more changes in society in general however I believe that in order for AI to be skilled enough to do the work of something like a software engineer in order to get to that point I think it basically needs to become AGI so artificial general intelligence and that I still feel is quite a ways off and if it does get to that point then I feel at that moment world will completely change either into a Utopia or a dystopia and personally I feel it's really a waste of time to try to worry and prepare for that so I wanted to make this quick video just in case you here on the audience on this channel just in case you are some kid maybe thinking about going to college and getting scared reading all of these headlines wondering if it's still worth it to pursue computer science for that my message to you is don't be scared learning programming or software development is still an extremely valuable skill and will continue being so for a very long time time until the world completely changes and basically we're all living in madmax like I said watch these two videos in order to hear people more qualified than me talk about this topic basically the TDR is this is really mainly mostly marketing it is really an announcement targeted more towards VCS as opposed to actual users all the examples are obviously very handpicked they mention how it successfully completed real jobs on upwork but doesn't really mention out of how many they tried if it complete the first random job that Inc that's pretty impressive but if they handpicked one job out of several thousands that's not as impressive then Theo also mentioned one extremely big difference between this and Sora that's the open AI text to video tool on this one open AI was very clear about all the places in which it creates some amazing results but then they also showcased all the places in which their model completely fails and of course there's a simple fun fact that they themselves are also hiring human software Engineers so yeah this is definitely an interesting tool we are living in some interesting times but especially if you are a beginner don't get scared by all these headlines
