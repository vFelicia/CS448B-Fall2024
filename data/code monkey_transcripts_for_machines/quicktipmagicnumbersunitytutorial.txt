hi there this is a quick tip for how to free your code from magic numbers now one very important concept in writing clean code is never using magic numbers magic numbers are numbers which are used without being clear about what they're doing so I have some code in here a simple unit class it has a basic update and running this code now in here I'm increasing the position by this vector multiplied by this amount and then I'm doing a distance check and seeing if it's under 5f this is some simple code so you might be able to figure out what it means but still it should be clear what the code is doing so the subtraction here is getting the direction vector towards our target position the 20 here signifies our movement speed and the 5 F is the attack distance so essentially he's moving this unit towards this target at 20 units per second and if he gets within 5 units he won't execute an attack so we can make this code much more readable by simply defining variables for each of these numbers so in here the first thing we get a vector 3 for the move direction and move Direction is this in here so we replace this with moved ear ok then the 20 F represents our movement speed so we replace that and finally our 5 F in here represents our attack distance so the final code for the attack distance and use that instead so the code now has more lines but it is much more readable we can clearly see that we are increasing the position by the direction multiplied by a movement speed and here testing for the distance if it is within our attack distance and if these numbers were being used elsewhere then we would also have various instances of 20 F and 5 F without being connected to one another so in that case we should define these as member variables so everyone uses the same variable so always remember to keep your code clean by defining clear variables instead of using magic numbers and that's it hope you found this tip useful alright see you next time
