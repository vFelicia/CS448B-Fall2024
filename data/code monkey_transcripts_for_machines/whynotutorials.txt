hello and welcome I'm your code monkey now recently someone asked me when is the next tutorial or perhaps a slightly different question why Sophie tutorials lately I started this channel five years ago pretty much just doing nothing but tutorials whereas in the past few weeks I've definitely not done that many I've been mainly doing just some more general tonking advice videos so here let me explain why that is how I organize my work how I plan things what I'm currently prioritizing and what types of videos you can expect from me in the future now like I said in my request this comment the answer is actually very simple lately I've been working hard on my game so I really haven't had much time to make tutorials especially since those videos usually take dozens of hours to make honestly I have to say I have greatly underestimated the amount of time and effort that it would take to make a game and keep the channel running at the same time back in March I generally thought that I could work on this game and keep making videos while also working on some complex tutorials and even make some courses in the meantime looking back it seems so obvious that that is just way too much work and not really possible but back then I generally believe that I could do that this year I did start to work with some editors but I still do about 80 to 90 of the work so for the most part behind this channel the videos the games of course the everything really most of it is still just me so looking back I was definitely quite crazy to think that I could do all of this at the same time I guess this is a nice teaching moment even though I'm already quite experienced I've been making games for decades even with all that experience I still grossly underestimate how long something takes so if you yourself go over your own estimates then don't be too hard on yourself estimating how much effort and time something takes is an extremely difficult skill and one that is very difficult to get as you can see I still don't have it but anyways yes so like I said here my answer is simply I can't do everything I need to prioritize what videos I work on and right now I'm enjoying working on the game and I really think this has the potential to do quite well so I'm very excited to work on the game in order for the game to find success I'm working both harder on the game to make the game actually great but I'm also trying to gather as many wishlists as possible to ensure a successful launch the game is currently on 3000 wishlist which is a pretty decent amount my hope is to be able to hit something like 5000 by release date which right now the only state is tentatively set for October 2nd so just a bit over a month to get there with that in mind when it comes to choosing what videos to make I am prioritizing things that might get more views and importantly videos where I can also mention my game in a way that makes sense the reality is that tutorials I really enjoy making them I really enjoy researching something and teaching it but whilst I do enjoy making them they are simultaneously some of the most time consuming videos to make while also being the ones I get for your views and that's fine I'm okay with that but it does make it tricky to justify making it in times like these where I have a very very limited amount of time time a tutorial can take anywhere from 10 to 100 hours to make depending on complexity for example something like how to control send machine through code that video was pretty simple so that might have taken just about 10 hours whereas for example the tutorial on how to use Azure to make five really interesting game mechanics that one was really interesting I definitely loved all the research and learning all about the cloud and how to work with it in total I probably spent over a hundred hours just researching that to make that video but for those 100 hours of work as you can see the end result is just 15K views which again like I said I'm perfectly okay with that I've been doing this for long enough that I do know that tutorials will not do as well as different formats and I'm okay with that absolutely do not regret those 100 hours that I spent researching and making this video personally I really enjoyed researching a brand new area the video has gotten just four views in the last 48 hours and I really hope those four people will learn a lot from this video but on the other hand in more tonking video something like this one all about when to punish your game making this video too soon like 10 hours so much much less in the other tutorial and the more important part is what I mentioned about ago which is one of the reasons why I made this video was because I was going through this polish process in my own game which again allowed me to mention the game in the video and hopefully some of these people that watch it some of them out of the game to their wishlist that's pretty much my priority right now do more General videos that don't take as much time so I can keep working on the game and choose video topics where I can somehow include a mention of my game to hopefully gather wish lists so that hopefully the final release in October that one finds success like I said I started this channel over five years ago mainly with just tutorials what I've been going with sharing the knowledge that I had gained from making all of my games and I very much still want to keep doing that I love researching things and making videos explaining what I learned I'm constantly getting ideas for things that I'd love to cover for example just last month I was playing Desperados 3 and I thought it would be really fun to make a really detailed video on something like a stealth enemy AI I also thought about making a gold currency system that many games use I'd like to make a simple online chat I'd like to make a simple video on netcode for game of season 2D maybe a video on how to control time something on covering multithreading basics so you can see I have certainly no issue with lack of ideas for its General topics eventually with enough time I do hope to get through all of these and of course I've been a huge fan of Dodd since it was first announced for the past few years I've only started myself okay so I'm basically just waiting for version 1.0 and when that comes out I want to do tons of tutorials on dots but then 1.0 finally came out and it's exactly what I'm in the middle of all this work so I have done some research on the 1.0 version but I haven't yet managed to do a video on that and I also do want to keep experimenting with these more General tonking opinion videos I think these can also be extremely useful in a nontechnical way since there's so much about game development that is not necessarily technical so these are definitely topics that I'd love to talk some more about in the end I do want to keep making tutorials and general toning videos while also making complete courses and my own games but there's really just no time to do all that at exactly the same time and somewhat related I'm also currently training to hopefully run my first marathon so that also means a bit less time to work on projects I really wish I had a time machine so in general in the near future and until the game comes out in early October chances are there's not going to be too many tutorials there won't be some especially if I can find some way to relate them to the game but definitely not too many my main focus right now is really just working on the game and getting it finished by the deadline I'm also trying to do some Dev Vlogs and some general tonking videos where I can mention the game to hopefully gather some wish lists that's pretty much my current set of priorities then after the game is out in late October after that you can definitely expect new tutorials perhaps new complete courses and perhaps even free courses I've got a bunch of ideas that I love to try out like I said I've gotten lots of things on my mind lots of stuff that I'd love to create to hopefully help you on your own gamedev journey I really just need time to be able to do all of that alright so I hope this video helped clarify how I organize my schedule and what my plan is for the near future go ahead and add my empty your wishlist I wish you the best of luck with your own games thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
