in this video we're going to explore how to use the unity town up this is the builtin unity tool that helps you quickly and easily build worlds with town sprites let's begin okay so let's check out how the town map works now i've already covered the video previously on how to build a custom tile map so that one was built from scratch using a custom grid class so that one is great if you want to really dig into the code and really understand how the whole thing works but if all you want is a normal tile map then you can just use the builtin unity tile map so let's see how to use it over here is my basic empty scene so i have a character walking around just for fun alright so let's set up a towel map now the first thing you need is the 2d packages if you already created the project using the 2d template they should already be installed but if not you just go into window and open up the package manager and then here on the unity registry you just need to install the 2d packages so for this one we're going to need the 2d sprite so this is so we can edit our spreadsheet and then we're going to need the 2d tile map editor so make sure both those packages are installed then here we are in our nice empty scene so on the hierarchy just right click i'm going to create a new 2d object and let's make it a tile map so right away this creates a grid object and if you select it you can visually see the grid then over here you have some options so for example you can modify the size of each grid cell and then you can also modify the gap between each grid zone so you can really customize exactly the type of grid that you want so in this case let's leave everything a nice standard grid then you also have the cell layout so this means that the tile map supports both normal rectangular grids but also hexagon and izomatic grids and then the cell swizzle which has to do with converting coordinates so in most cases we'll just leave it at xyz okay so that's the grid object and then inside it you have the actual tile map object so over here you have the tile map component as well as the tile map render again with a bunch of options for setting the tile anchor setting the color setting a certain sorting order as well as the material used to render the tama so you can play around with all of these but for now let's leave it all at default now in order to start drawing our tile map let's go into window down here onto 2d and let's open up the tile palette now in this window is where we're going to define the palette containing all the sprites that we're going to use in our tile map so click on this button to create a new palette then give it a name let's say our tile map palette and let's set it to use a rectangular grid and for the cell size leave it as automatic all right so click on create then it's going to ask you for a folder where it will save all the sprite data so just make a nice new folder in order to keep it organized so for the time palette and yep over here on the project files we can see we created a new folder and in there we have our nice object all right so now here as it says just drag the tile sprite or texture assets in here but before we do that we need to first prepare our spreadsheet so over here in the project files i already have a nice texture so it's a pretty simple sprite sheet with some background textures as well as some objects so this is the same sprite sheet that i use in the complete visual scripting course that i'm currently working on one of the games is an action rpg where i only use the tile map in order to build the world so check the link in the description if you're interested in that course now the first thing we need here is to slice the sprite sheet into its various sprites so up here on the sprite mode change from single into multiple then on the pixels per unit make sure you select the correct size now here my texture is 248 by 2048 so each of these grids is 512x5 tone so in here just put 512 that means that this whole thing will occupy only one unit in the world alright so do that then hit on apply and then click here on the sprite editor so here's our sprite and we can click on the slice menu and now in here depending on how you set up your spreadsheet if everything is nicely separated then you can go with automatic but in my case that wouldn't work since i have objects of different sizes so i'm instead going to select grid by cell size let's put each cell is 5 12 by 5 12 and just slice and there you go right away everything is nicely sliced so there's one here one here one here and so on now i'm just going to fix these smaller ones all right so everything is good now just go over here and hit apply and right away in the project files if we expand our texture yep we can see that it individually created all of our sprites so there you go down down and so on everything looks good all right now all we need to do is take this texture object so just click on it and drag it right here onto the tile palette and again make another folder and yep there it is we can now see all of our individual sprites in the town palette now up here we have these buttons so we can select move paint arrays and so on and in order to draw our tongues the simplest one is just to click on the paint button then you click to select the tile let's say this one so click on it and then just in the world just click and drag and start painting by the way a simple quick tip just when you have the scene window selected hit shift space and put it on full screen and now you got a bit more space alright so we can use this button in order to paint individual tiles you can use this one in order to draw on a rectangular area and you have this one in order to erase various tiles and you can also select and then click the move and then move it around then as for hotkeys for example while you are in paint mode there it goes like this one and now i'm painting then select different one and paint it now if i want i can hold down shift and click and drag in order to delete and i can hold down control in order to click and select this one so select this one paint this one then click control and yep paint this one alright so that's the super basic tile map setup let me just make a basic looking map all right so here's my basic world now one thing you might notice depending on how you drew the sprite sheet is some gaps so over here you can see a little line there and there and especially if we zoom in yep there you go there's a very big line there so the solution to solve this is to make a sprite atlas so right here on the project files let's right click go into create and create a new sprite atlas and now here in the inspector you can see the objects for packing so click on the plus icon and then either select individually eat sprite or select the whole texture and then if you want you can play around all the other settings or just leave them at default and you can click on pack preview and now if we look in the game view we can still see there are some gaps so that's because the sprite atlas is only created when you actually run the build so if we try to run the game and if there you go there are no more gaps and everything looks great all right so far so good now another thing you can have in a town map is layers so over here we see we have the word object and then inside we have the tile map so it's in here that you can have multiple so rename this to the tile map background and then let's duplicate this one and named it the tile map over now when you do that it also duplicates the tiles that were already in there so for example if i move this tile map people you can see it has the same tiles now i want this one to have the objects that are going to be placed on top of the background so just erase all these in order to select on which tile map you are actually painting on you have in here the drop down menu for the active tile map so in this case i want to erase this one on the over tile map so just select that one and now if i click yeah there you go now i'm erasing this one and by the way if you select on control then you can have a bigger brush area so just select control select the whole thing and now i can erase everything with just one click all right so the overtime map is now empty and just reset it back on zero zero so everything is nicely positioned okay now we want to place some things on this time map that will show up on top of the previous one so on each tile map you can see the tilemap printer and in here you have the sorting layer as well as the sorting order so in this case let's leave the base one on default at zero and this one is meant to be on top so just put it on 10. so now if i place down some objects so let's say i want to print this little tree trunk and if there you go gets placed in there so now i want to place some of these and there you go i can place them so we now have one tama being painted on top of another one however we want this one to be in between the other tones so i want to place the sprite in between those two edges now to do that there is essentially two approaches so we can just move the timelapse object so just move it by 0.5 and 0.5 and there you go now it's offset on each corner and another potential approach is to modify over here the tile anchor so at 0.5 they are being anchored in the center and if i put at 0 0 then they're now at the bottom yep just like that so you have those two options in this case let's leave the anchor at that and just slightly offset the tile map object okay so now i can place the sprite in between the edges just like that i can also place a bunch of other objects so there you go a couple of bushes a couple of tree trunks and so on now another thing you can do is modify the tile palette so over here you have a button for edit so click on it and now we are in edit mode so while in edit mode select the paint brush then control click on the one that we want to copy so control click and then let's make four of them in here then also control click on this one and make another one there all right so now with the select tool select this one and now rotate this one by 90 degrees and this one by 180 and this one by 270. all right so we have all these rotated ones and for this one rotate by 90. all right so there it is save the tile palette exit edit mode and now we have all these nice rotated sprites so if i want i can now perfectly place these ones see if there you go just like that by the way another thing you can do is also play around with the pivot for each object so for example on the tree trunk you can go into the texture go into the sprite editor here is the tree trunk and instead of having the pivot down middle let's move it down in there and hit apply and there you go they all moved automatically so you can modify the pivot of where the thing gets placed and lastly you also have options for scaling the tiles so with the select tool select each tile and then for example modify the scale 222 and now if i try to paint this there you go now it paints it much bigger so you can really play around with any object on the palette now with regards to scaling for example i have these four objects which are meant to be smaller than one grid position so if i try to place the pillar right here that's a bit bigger i don't want it to be that big so again i can click here in order to modify the scale put it that much smaller and now if i try to paint it yep there you go it is much smaller so this works but this really only scales the sprites so the grid size is still the same so i cannot put them right next to each other so another approach is to make a brand new grid and set the cell size to be smart so right click create the brand new tile map which creates a new grid as well as new tile map so let's rename this to the town map details and on the grid itself over here we can modify the cell size so let's say 0.5 so we have this main grid and then we have this smaller grid and now in here with this active tile map selected i can place down these objects right like this all right so here's our world map composed of a background then some objects on top and then some smaller details now just one last thing regarding time maps which is adding colliders so for example i want these objects to be fully solid for that i'm just going to duplicate this time map and name this the town map colliders and then all we need to do is add the component of the tile map collider so just do that and yep it adds letters to all the objects so on this one just erase all the ones that are not the pillars so just in here erase and get rid of all those all right so i erased all the objects except for the pillars and now the character controller is already testing for collisions so if i play so here's my character and i can walk around normally and if i go towards the pillars no can do it can't go through them so that's how simple it is to add collisions onto your tile map and this also shows how easy it is to use the tile map when making a platformer game so you could draw the world using the town map and then just add the time map collector and all of a sudden you have platform collisions alright so now you know how to use the builtin unity tama it's a very versatile tool that you can use to build massive worlds very easily and if you want to see how you could make a custom town map from scratch go watch that other video that one is based on the grid class made previously which is very versatile and you can make it perfectly fit your needs but for simple cases the builtin unity time map is excellent and very easy to use now like i said the sprite sheet i'm using here is from the complete visual scripting course that i'm currently working on one of the games is an action rpg where i will use the tile map in order to build the world
