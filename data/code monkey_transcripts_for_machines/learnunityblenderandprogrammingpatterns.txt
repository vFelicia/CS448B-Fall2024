hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and as you may know i have my own very detailed courses they don't have the unlimitations on youtube so i'm not dependent on placing the algorithm and having to keep the videos under 20 minutes so each of those courses really diving deep into various topics i have went on making a builder defender game just like i make my own steam games one on mastering visual scripting and another one on explaining 50 unity tools and features courses are an excellent way to learn they provide a different path to free tutorials i actually cover this topic in detail in another video each type has its own pros and cons so courses are excellent but as you might imagine it takes a ton of work to produce a complete high quality course so i'm simply not able to make all the types of courses that people ask me to make however even if i can't build it myself because i don't have the time i can certainly point you to some course that already exists that i can highly recommend a while ago i got in touch with the folks at gamedev.tv and i worked with them to create a special code monkey bundle with courses specifically curated by me i went through all of their courses and had selected three of them to be part of a bundle which includes a really nice deep discount the course i selected are the ultimate unity 3d course this is the number one highest rated unity course it's actually the course that i researched while i was trying to make my own courses i wanted to see what the best courses were like and this was the highest rated one with tens of thousands of very happy students it was completely remastered recently so all of the content is really nice up to date it will teach you both unity and csharp both them starting from scratch so you will gain knowledge on game design problem solving 2d and 3d games as well as practical exercises on every lecture to really solidify everything you're learning the next course isolate for the bundle is the blender 3d course this is the one that i picked up a couple of months ago and i've been learning blender ever since after just watching about 30 of this course i tried making a bunch of assets to make a nice minigame and it came out really nice it's really massive takes you through the making of seven completely unique asset packs in all kinds of styles you start off making some simple bowling bone pens then you make an interesting chess set some modular building parts and tons more and the final one is a more advanced really interesting programming course it's all about programming patterns this one is excellent for helping you massively improve the quality of your code which in turn helps you make better games faster learn how to spot some bad practices how to refactor bad code into clean code learn about the observer pattern singletons factories delegates strategy polling and tons more if you're an intermediate or advanced programmer i think you'll really like this one all of the courses have a 30 day money back guarantee so you can try them out without fear so the bundle itself has a really deep discount but there's many more courses on their website all of them on high quality like i said i have gone through several game dev tv courses and i can highly recommend them all of the very positive reviews that you can see are very well deserved and of course the links in description are affiliate links so if you pick them up you get some awesome courses for you to learn from and i get a nice commission so check them out with a link in the description especially check out the code monkey bundle since it has a really deep discount and i personally handpicked those courses to really help you in all areas of game development going from beginner to advanced alright i wish you the best in your own learning journey thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
