hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this is a prequel tutorial over here let's learn how to change a character visual this tutorial is pretty general and applies to just about any controller but specifically here i will be using the official thirdperson star asset made by unity this one is a really awesome controller it's commonly free i highly recommend it i covered it in detail in another video here's the 10 second answer for how to swap the character you change the skin mesh render then you change the bones and you use the avatar for that new character that's it now here's the longer answer with some common pitfalls and errors so here i've got the unity star as controller with the included robot character now of course when using this controller chances are you want to use a custom character that makes sense for your game so over here i've got a character from the polygon cinti pack this pack was free a bunch of times so chances are you already have it alternatively another place where you can get characters is from miximo which is a free website i also cover that process in another video so here i've got another character that i grab for free from maximo all right so now let's swap out our controller to any of these two characters now if we inspect we can see how it's set up so we've got the player armature with all the various logic scripts also note how this one has the animator then if we look inside it inside this geometry game object we've got the armature mesh so this is the actual skin mesh render and then also next to it we've got the skeleton which are all the bones so let's say i want to swap out this character for this one from the cindy pack now there's only three things you need to do you need to change the skin mesh render you need to change the bones and you need to assign the avatar for that new mesh okay so let's try doing that now first find the character that you want from the project files so on some asset packs some of them come with the prefab others just have the fbx file either one is fine you can just select either of them and just drag the scene like this when you do you have the character object and then over here is the point where a lot of people get wrong myself as well i have this issue all the time so you want to use the animator from the third person controller but you want to use the visual from this one and the visual itself is of course composed of the skin mesh render and the various bones so you might think that one way of getting these two objects would be to just duplicate it so just ctrl d then just drag these new ones over there onto that one make sure transform is all on zero zero so they match get rid of the previous ones and finally of course remember to assign the avatar that relates to this mesh so let's go into the mesh grab the avatar for this new visual and just assign this one okay we've done all three steps we swapped the skin mesh render we swapped the bones and we assigned the correct avatar for this mesh however if we hit on play and nope the character is stuck in t pose so there are no animations now the reason as to why this is happening it's actually quite simple over here on the animator we did assign the new avatar but if we try to open this avatar over here we can see that this avatar had all of the various bones assigned but they are assigned you can see over here for example the bones start with root whereas if we go and see which one we just placed this one is named root and then has the one because we duplicated this game object so the way the avatar works is based on the exact game object name so since we duplicated it at this one at the end because of that the animator cannot find the bones because the name is not exactly what the avatar is expecting so if you have this issue then it's pretty simple just make sure the bones game object is named exactly as it was on the original character so you can either check the original character and see it was named root or again you can look inside the avatar and over here see yep the bones should be named root so if we just rename this one to that also another quick thing that should have happened automatically when you duplicated is if you go on the skin mesh render over here make sure the root bone transform make sure this one is the correct reference okay so do that make sure the name is exact and now if we run play if there you go now the animation zoo perfectly worked so we correctly retargeted all of our animations all of them work perfectly with our new mesh so i can move around with my new character and everything works perfectly alright awesome okay so now let's see the process for a free character from miximo now like i covered in the maximo video you select the character and you download it for free then you just add it onto your project files so here is a character that i downloaded and first thing you need to do is select the character so the fbx object then go over here onto the rig tab and under animation type make sure it's set to humanoid so select humanoid and click on apply with that done you can now again just drag the object onto the game scene and again you've got the object with the animator with the avatar inside we've got the skin mesh render and inside we've got a reference to all the various bones so again how to swap out our character controller let's do the exact same thing so let's duplicate these ones let's drag it on to the new object let's place them on zero zero zero let's get rid of the previous visual then on the skin mesh renderer make sure the reference is correct so it's the one we've duplicated and again make sure the name is correct so this one get rid of that and the final thing is assigning the avatar so let's drag the avatar that we downloaded assign it there and that's it and yep over here is my character download from maximo and yep it's working perfectly with all the animations with the controller everything works perfectly alright great so here are all three characters working perfectly over here is the original robot then the character from the asset store and finally the one downloaded for free off miximo so once again just follow that checklist make sure you follow all the steps make sure the character is humanoid make sure the skin mesh renderer has the correct reference to the bones make sure the bones are named correctly swap out the avatar and everything will work alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome
