hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights that were released in june 2021 in this first video i will be covering a list of three assets in the next ones i will be covering paid assets and tools check out the phone playlist to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on and by the way check out my own asks on the store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your game and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create custom animated cursors to help really make your game stand out i'm currently working on converting some more videos into pro system so stay tuned for that alright so starting off actually with two packs in one the third and first person character controllers these are made officially by unity they are some simple but very capable assets meant to help you very quickly get your characters working they are made using cinemachine and the new input system packages for the third person controller you have a fully rigged and animated humanoid character as well as one working on a simple capsule the animator is very easy to extend and build upon and then for the first person controller it works exactly as you would expect in first person then you've got a playground scene to test out the characters with all kinds of jumps stairs and slopes both assets also include overlays for mobile so you've got onscreen joysticks and touch zones to instantly make the characters work on a mobile device these are two excellent starting points just import these assets and immediately get to work on your next idea next up an interesting road system it's essentially a spline editor with a terrain mesh i actually cover the tutorial on how to do something like this in a video previously go watch that if you want to learn how it's made this seems like a very easy to use system you just place a bunch of points wherever you want rotate them to add some elevation and some smooth curves then make them connect and set up some intersections once you set it up you can get a graph with all the nodes and their weights which means you can also easily apply pathfinding system on top of it also you can swap out the road meshes for your own if you have a specific art style in mind then if you're working on something that involves an office well here is an ice pack it's got quite a lot of assets for a free asset a bunch of chairs tables tv walls doors and so on also has some more scifi elements like some mechanical arms some several racks and a bunch more if you like this pack and you want even more assets you can grab the paid version with 350 total assets for some ui here is a simple and clean beautiful interface it's a collection of buttons windows toggles popups and more all of it nice and smoothly animated so it's very simple but very satisfying maybe you need some oldschool weapons if so here is a free m1a1 submachine gun it's a really nice model of a very iconic weapon perfect for any kind of world war ii game it's got some very highres 4k textures the weapon is set up with moving parts so you can easily animate it and again if you like the look of this one you can check out the many more weapons made by this same developer for some pixel art here's a bunch of pixel cars quite a lot of variety in the shapes everything from some normal cars to a bunch of vans you've got some pickup trucks and some highend sports cars they are nice and clean designs so if you're working on a sidescrolling pixel game then get this one for a free tool here is the 2d ai tool it's a pretty complex tool that comes with a graph interface for you to visually manage states and develop your ai it's got tons of complexity but also says that it's easy to use contains a fully documented csharp api if you want to make some ai with a visual tool then maybe look into this one also there's a pro version of this tool if you like what it does next up some low poly stylized hyper cars so you've got a ford gt and look alike a la ferrari and a bugatti chiron it's a pretty simple and useful pack all the cars have two versions one with or without interiors or maybe you need some icons here is a nice pack with a bunch of minerals contains 48 pixel art icons so it's perfect if you're working on some sort of mining game so maybe something like seymour dig really great pixel art designs and lastly another interesting tool urp decals it does exactly what it says you place some decals on top of your surfaces when working with urp it supports normal maps and also receives shadows so it's great if you need to spawn some graffiti or maybe some buttholes alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unity asset store released in june 2021 there's links to all of them in the description and stay tuned for the next video covering paid assets and tools as
