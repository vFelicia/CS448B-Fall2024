hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity launched in both may and june 22. you might have noticed that i didn't do one of these videos last month the reason for that was because i was hard at work on my turnbased strategy course so i couldn't work on anything else the course is out now so if you want to take your game dev skills to the next level and make a really awesome game then check it out but there were actually tons of really awesome games launched in may so i didn't want to just skip the month so that means this video has even more insane impressive games than usual since i had to pick 10 from 2 months the main reason why i make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and imagination and the variety and awesomeness of the game shown in this list really puts out to the test this video is sponsored by blink they have a mountain of tools and assets you can use in your games currently everything had fifty percent off they even won two unity wars with their assets i've covered a bunch of them in my list videos they have a great style it's low poly but not too low poly you can pick up some gorgeous textures you can get a bunch of weapons and characters or you can check out their tools like their awardwinning rpg builder it's one of the highest rated assets on the store allows you to easily build an rpg with tons of features there's also a massive free update to version 2.0 coming soon or get the massive rpg essentials pack which is a huge collection including tons of characters armors and tools all at a super deep discount they even have a bunch of high quality commonly free packs you can try out so check out their publisher page with the link in the description alright so starting off with one of the bigger hits that launched in may here we have vrising it's a vampire survival crafting game great mix of mechanics definitely my kind of game and the game really takes the vampire theme seriously it's not just a visual there are mechanics like for example sunlight if you stay out during daytime you're going to get burned another one is if you're carrying silver or you get near garlic it won't burn you and of course you can feed on all kinds of creatures and humans who drink their blood so the game really takes the vampire theme seriously which makes it pretty interesting and unique then on top of that theme it really is a solid survival combat crafting game so you go out you find some enemies using tons of weapons and skills you gather materials chop down some woods and mine some rocks then go back to an area define it as your base and start building some floors and some walls the building system is actually very similar to what i covered in my house building system video so if you want to learn how that can be made go watch that video i had heard great things about this game so now that the course is done and i can finally play some games again i went to play this one first and i'm really enjoying it and the game like i said also has some interesting systems so definitely look forward to one of my how it's made videos on this game recreating some of those interesting mechanics next up for one of the launches of june here is starship troopers terran command this game is the example of using the perfect genre that perfectly matches your source material the starship troopers movie is really awesome and when i saw it as a kid i definitely imagined it as an awesome rts game so that is exactly the kind of game that we have here you can fight hordes of bugs you can command your units and do your part to ensure the survival is civilization you're always outnumbered so winning really requires thinking and deploying your units carefully at the right locations the game also features a true line of sight mechanics so you have to be careful with ambushes there's lots of troops at your disposal everything from some basic infantry to some heavy artillery it's already got over 3000 very positive reviews so this looks like an excellent new rts always remember the only good bug is a dead bug another great game that came out in may is songs of conquest this one really made a splash when it was originally announced i think it was during the game awards the visual look is so unique and so gorgeous that everyone immediately noticed it's a game in a 3d world but with a 2d pixel art style the game itself is a turnbased strategy adventure game with some tactical combat and kingdom management it is inspired by the 90s classics like heroes of might and magic i really enjoyed playing that many years ago there is a massive world for you to explore and conquer you can build your empire construct some towns and wage war against your enemies there's also a really nice barred mechanic where each campaign features a unique song that tells the tale of your rise to glory it's out now in early access with already over 2 000 very positive reviews next up for something with a bit more color here is neon white this was definitely one of the standouts of this latest c3 it is both visually and mechanically unique it's a speed running fps with card mechanics that's definitely a very unique combo you have cards for actions like dash shoot slash then you combine them all to take out the enemies and reach the finish line and the game really just oozes style the visuals are super polished and all the characters are really unique it has a near perfect score with 98 positive out of 3 000 reviews it really is great to see a very unique very imaginative game find such great success then in may there was an interesting game release called line war this one is the work of youtuber infanzia he has a channel with some excellent blender and low poly tutorials personally has someone with very little 3d modelling skills it's just amazing to watch him work i really love the low pawn look this one is his first commercial release and so far it's doing really well the game is a mix of rts with some elements from 4x definitely an interesting design one unique mechanic is how you can draw your orders instead of just right clicking on the target position there's tons of units on screen at any time massive maps you have to handle the combat but also the resource gathering and production and the thing that sets it apart is that 4x mix so the game is primarily about the strategy rather than the momenttomoment battles so there's no need for ultrafast micromanagement of units with all that the game seems really great and the reviews are mainly positive however the one big downside is that right now it's multiplayer only for me that's pretty much a deal breaker but the game looks really interesting so i really hope they had a single player mode in the future next up here is a huge release that just came out of early access raft this one was in early access since 2018 tons and tons of updates over time it's always great when a game of this skill gets a full release basically if you enjoy it then you have a massive amount of content for you to enjoy it's a survival crafting exploration game the unique theme is how it's all based on a massive ocean with some islands in between so it kind of looks like cast away the game you gather some resources build up your floating base explore nearby areas and stay away from sharks all of it can be done either solo or online with friends it looks really interesting and already has over 150 very positive reviews so this one has certainly sold millions of copies and if you've been wanting to try it out then maybe now is the time and up next if you're like me and you like managing and building things then here is captain of industry this one was almost my personal pick of the month it's a colony and factory simulation game it's all about industry so you're not building cities for people to live like simcity but rather you're building huge factories processing goods gathering power setting up mines and so on there are complex production chains and lots of conveyor belts for you to place and i really like the trailer for this game the voice over really sells you on the story and the whole journey of the game you start small start simple then you build and build until you get everything needed to build a huge rocket and get into space it's currently in early access and had a pretty huge launch already over a thousand very positive reviews then for a really unique game launch in june here we have card shark it's really an adventure game rather than a card game the whole thing is all about cheating at cards but the goal is to do that without being caught or you might have to survive some kind of pistol duel these are very interesting mechanics and all of which are based on real card tricks so maybe you can learn some tricks for the next time you play some cards with friends it also has a very gorgeous very unique visual style and the dev team participated in one of unity's live streams showcasing how the game works so check it out with the unity twitch channel if you want to see that next up if you're looking to build things and just chill out in your home here is my time at sandrock this one is a sequel to my time at portia and it's very much in the same vein in terms of mechanics you accept the job offer to become sandrock's newest builder you arrive at this empty town out in the world and it's up to you and your trusty tools to restore the community to its former glory gather some resources build some machines interact with the locals defend the town and make a nice profit there is a vast open world for you to explore with lots of combat moves to learn lots of quests to experience and many games to complete so basically if you've enjoyed the original my time with party you'll certainly enjoy this one and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month this one actually came out in may it's hard space ship breaker it was in early access for quite some time and finally had its full release i've been interested in this one since i first saw it the game is all about salvaging and repairing ships you're floating around in space with six degrees of freedom you're working for a company and you get some contracts or missions to inspect and repair a certain ship it features some really interesting tools you first scan the ship you can weld some parts and slice some others but the ships also have lots of hazards one wrong cut and the whole thing blows up so you need to really carefully inspect the ship pay attention to the internals and salvage as much as you can without dying a fiery death it's a really compelling mix of mechanics that i very much want to play and visually this game is gorgeous it's using unity agrp with a realistic art sound that looks really good along with some excellent destruction and some great g physics it already has over 12 000 very positive reviews so if you like the concept definitely give it a try alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity and launch in may and june 22. i hope this list helped you see how the unity engine is capable of building anything really the only limits are just your own skills and your own imagination let me know in the comments if you've played
