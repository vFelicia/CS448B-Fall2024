hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and last week I made a video doing a quick recap of unity's GDC world map Tonk which covered what is coming to the engine in the near future the response to the roadmap was somewhat mixed some positive comments some negative or just some disappointed comments so in this video let me tell you my thoughts on this topic and ask you what do you want to see from Unity one thing that is very clear to me in all of the events that UND has invited me to and also they've emphasized in the beginning of the roadmap is how they're always looking for feedback so make sure you write a comment with whatever you want them to do I'm sure someone from Unity won't be reading the comments in this video and also before I share my comments on whether the roadmap is disappointing or not let me quickly talk about what many people mentioned which is a direct comparison with unreal's presentation now on that topic I'm really going to say the same thing that I've only said personally I have never had any interest in the game engine Wars thankfully we don't live in a time where we are very much spawned for choices game developers all the engines are great nowadays Unity is great and real is great Godot is great there's really no wrong answer so pick whatever you want personal only I use Unity because what I started with and I stick with it because I have yet to find a game idea that I could not produce with DNT so until that happens I really have no need or desire to change to a different engine but that does not mean that I have a negative view of unreal or anything I love what unreal is doing and I definitely hope they keep building some awesome stuff again all the engines are great they are really just signals there are plenty of great games made with both engines and also plenty of shovelware the quality of the games that you make is more dependent on your skills as a game developer rather than what engine you use to make it so I just wanted to mention that right from the start use whatever engine you want don't waste your energy getting caught up in meaningless internet Wars with that said here are my thoughts on unreal's presentation and whether I feel that Unity is lacking basically my conclusion is they are targeted at completely different audiences and real stock is more like an E3 showcase more than half of it is dedicated to showing some really awesome looking games being built with the engine whereas Unity stock is very much targeted at developers it is focused on showing tons of tools in every area where the engine is used both are great depending on the target audience and what you expect from it I think in real is excellent at marketing and making the engine seem really exciting watching their presentations is always great fun so I very much enjoy them as a viewer however as a developer as a solo in developer who makes primarily 2D or low poly 3D games for me those exciting features well they look great in a showcase I don't really have much use for them in my daytoday work for example on nanite which several people mentioned in the comments I agree that it's extremely impressive Tech being able to just load a super high poly mesh directly in your game is a great thing I imagine that saves tons of time in big studios or in movie production but personally I use low poly 3D meshes I don't really have an army of artists working for me building some super high poly meshes with tons of maps so for me I love looking at the nanite demos I'm always amazed at how good it looks but I have no use for it in my actual games another big one that people always mention is metahuman again I agree it's extremely impressive extremely realistic humans that look very excellent and the Face animation tag they showcase is definitely Beyond excellent just with the phone you can get some high quality facial animation this is the kind of thing that previously would have taken months and hundreds of thousands of dollars so this is definitely an excellent tool but again for me personally the types of games that I make do not require this kind of super high fidelity facial capture so I have no use for it as developer one thing that I absolutely do wish that Unity had is something similar to Lumen this is unreal's global illumination system it allows you to let any scene with some really accurate really gorgeous looking lighting I believe they've only shown it being used in some realistic scenes but I'm sure it also looks great in some more satellite scenes as well Unity is currently working on a global illumination tool it is based on their adaptive Pros volume although the only very very briefly mentioned it on their roadmap and there's no timeline so there is definitely one tool that unreal has that I wish Unity hand that would be useful to me as a solo Indie Dev and the procedural tunnel they showcase also seems very interesting although again makes me wonder would that work with a more stylized Arsenal or not only at the parameters in the video they seem very specific to this hyper realistic style some parameters are called trees Fallen trees and Bank and plants and while I kind of wish Unity had a builtin tool to do something like this I know there are plenty of tools on the SSR that do it exactly so basically unreal's talk was all really flashy which is excellent for getting people excited over a half of their talk was dedicated to showcasing some awesome gorgeous looking games that are being built with the engine so it's almost like an E3 game showcase rather than a roadmap Tonk whereas unity's was much more reserved much less flashy and much more focused on being targeted towards developers rather than Gamers which personally that is the kind of presentation that I prefer for a world map tone so as a viewer wanting to watch something fun I very much enjoyed unreal's presentation but as a developer I'm looking for what Tunes I can actually use in my games I much prefer ENT stock I've already used the recently released netco for game objects to make a nice multiplayer game and I definitely want to explore it some more I'm very much looking forward to their user generated content tool I truly think this one won't be an excellent tool that won't be very useful to many developers their upcoming friends who also seems very useful as is pretty much everything in the entire ugs still stack and I'm obviously very much looking forward to dots and experimenting with some games on a completely different scale So based on this my question to the people who post about those in real tools like nanite my question is do you actually have a use case for it do you actually have a team of artists behind you to build the assets to really take advantage of that tool or do you just want it just because say shiny new thing that's a genuine question I assume that most of the audience on this channel are small or solo Indie devs just like me so for most people watching this I don't think there is a use case for these films but I could be wrong so let me know also some people seem to be disappointed that UNT didn't showcase too much but personally I don't get disappointed with that because I understand why they do it previously everyone was angry at them because they were very quick to announce things which would then take years to come to fruition the obvious example is dots which was announced all the way back in 2018 and is only now in 2023 finally reaching 1.0 so they took that feedback to heart and nowadays they only showcase things that are either already out or only a few months away that means there aren't many flashy new announcements in these roadmaps but it also means there's less people constantly complaining that the engine is permanently in preview personally I would like to see some more interesting things even if they are very far out but I fully understand why they no longer do it so now I'm very happy with the currency of unity and these small incremental improvements that happen month after month so I was happy with what I saw with the roadmap Tonk I can already build any game that I can imagine so even if the engine suddenly stopped getting new features and updates I would still be happy I remember back in 2012 when I wanted to transition from flash to making PC games back then when I was looking for what game engine to use I only had two requirements one can I draw something on screen and two can I apply some logic to it those were really my own requirements I knew that as long as I could do those two things then I could build anything but that's really just my opinion I know some people want an engine to have tons and tons of builtin tools so my question to you is what do you want Unity to do if you want to disappoint with roadmap which would you want it to contain what tools and features would be helpful to you in the game that you are building right now like I said my experience Unity is always generally looking for feedback so I'm sure someone won't be reading your comments alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
