hello and welcome I'm your kmy So lately it seems like more and more games are coming out broken and it seems to be in a somewhat intentional way recently it was City Sky lines 2 this one seems to have some insane requirements and just straight up doesn't work on many machines apparently they knew that it was going to be broken on launch and they launch it anyway so this was very much an intentional plan then also something crazy is how the devs Apparently intentionally targeted 30 FPS even on highend machines because apparently there is no real benefit to aim for higher this seems to be an insane statement personally I get legit headaches if I try to play games on my PC at 30 FPS or lower but anyway so apparently the plan was to intentionally launch a broken game and another somewhat recent example was cyberp Punk 2077 this was another game that was completely broken at launch many people couldn't play it especially on consoles everything just straight up didn't work and we can go further than that and look at no man's sky this one technically wasn't broken in a technical sense it just absolutely did not match what was promised right before release regarding City Sky lines 2 I basically read a comment that said some like okay so the game is borderline and play playable right now but just wait a bit and one year from now the game will be excellent just like both no man sky and cyberpunk both those launch in extremely rough States and through constant patches nonstop over several years through that the games are now considered to be pretty good by pretty much everyone so based on this it does sound like the strategy for City SC lines 2 was exactly this meaning launch a game in an unfinished pretty much broken State sell a bunch of copies and get some money right away then basically just update the game constantly throughout one year and then one year from now when the game is essentially fixed and everything is great then they will get tons of press praising the game for how much it has improved now as much as players might rightfully dislike the strategy the honest truth is that it simply does work so if I had to guess I would say this strategy is probably going to be successful winning from now I assume the game will be great and I assume it will get tons of positive press talking about how much the game has improved massively in this past year so sort of a RX riches story this strategy when it does work it leads to more PR and a lot more visibility than just launching a good game at release basically this lets you have multiple marketing beats so your game keeps being mentioned and generally the more a game is mentioned the more it sells especially if it is mentioned as sort of a quote unquote inspiring story about how far along the game has come since the broken release it's simply human nature to be attracted to a story that has a nice Arc so something that started off bad and became great that is usually a more compelling story than something that was great right out of the gate so you might look at this at how this strategy seems to work you might look at this and as an indie Game Dev yourself you might think perhaps trying to do the exact same strategy basically release your game with too early in a broken or simply unfinished state in order to start selling some copies and getting some money and then just keep updating it and one year after release the game will be awesome the Press will talk about your fantastic story of how much the game has improved players will love it and people will buy tons and tons of copies now in this video I want to encourage you not to do this even if you just ignore the morally questionable nature of this strategy even if you ignore that if you don't have a massive marketing budget if you don't have a massively wellknown game then this strategy simply will not work you will not get a second chance with players one year from now people will still be interested in city scine just because it's a massive wellknown game and if they update the game and they make it awesome there will indeed be a lot of people lighting up waiting to play that awesome version so pretty much exactly the same thing that happened with cyber Punk and no man's Sky those games were known by pretty much everyone and people really wanted those games to be good so people were willing to wait until they were good they were willing to give it a second chance and when they did they actually enjoyed the improved game so this strategy did work for those games potentially even better than if they had launched in an internally great state ever that is only because those games have massive marketing budgets and everyone knows about them and everyone wants the games to succeed whereas most Indies do not have that luxury most Indies get just one shot at impressing the player and if you lose that one shot because you launch your game way too early then you are very unlikely to get a second chance this is very much what I talked about in the video where I explained how the seam algorithm Works how in order for seam to help you promote your game you basically need to get the ball rolling yourself and like I said in that video If you have a massive marketing budget then you can pretty much Brute Force the algorithm into giving you visibility like for example how the fifas and the NB these games they always get tons of negative reviews and yet they can always spend enough in order to make the reviews not matter so even when the games are mostly Negative they still get tons of promotion on Steam but like I said if you don't have a marketing Budget on that insane scale if not and if you launch a game and it does not have a good launch either because the game is broken or simply because it's not very good if that happens then it's almost impossible to come back from a bad launch again assuming you don't have massive marketing budget which I'm guessing you probably don't what I'm saying here is applicable to both for es but also to Early Access like I mentioned in the steam algorithm video you should not go into Early Access with the assumption that going to Early Access gives you two launches in most case that does not happen if the Early Access launch does poorly chances are the full launch will also go poorly basically what I'm trying to say in this video is do not compare yourself to these Mega successful games you should not compare directly to these and assume that if you have bad launch you can come back from it because technically these games did do it and when reason why I'm making this video is because I did experience this firsthand one of my game Survivor C gauntlets this one did launch into early access and the game wasn't broken or anything it was pretty decent at lunch it's actually one of my own favorite games it had a good amount of content in the first Early Access version and the reviews were pretty positive but due to various factors mainly lack of marketing and visuals because that the game did not really have a successful lach it just sold a tiny amount however at the time I did notice that there were lots of other games that were finding success over time through constant updates so that was pretty much my plan consistently update the game and hope that people would talk about the updates and how much the game had improved and the final launch would be a huge success you can actually go watch the news page on seam to see all the updates that I did you can see how I made the first of many updates on November 18 2014 then one week after that update two one week after update three four five and so on so constant updates and constantly adding tons of important meaningful updates I had started cut scenes I added a ton more lights I added animated cursors and better looking light sight I updated the tutorials I added seam achievements had much more gauntlets haded tons more weapons event actions and so on in total I put out an update every single week for the entirety of the seven months of Early Access and even beyond the 1.0 release I really don't think that I missed a single week of updates but the reality is even though I was working really hard on these updates and massively improving the game with every single week in reality all of this this was all pretty much just screaming to the void because the game did not devel launch and because it was a tiny indie game that nobody knew about because that there was no one waiting and following the development all of these updates despite massively improving the game despite being very consistent there was no one waiting to play it and because nobody was waiting to play it there was also no press interested in covering it So eventually the game launched out of Early Access and sadly it didn't really sell anymore I'm still very proud of the final game and pushing out all of these updates but in terms of actual sales they really had no effect because again nobody cared or knew about the game so this is essentially the flip side of what you see in the Cyber Punk and no man sky this is why I want to caution you against the strategy basically do not assume that you can follow what cyber Punk and no man Sky did do not assume that you can launch your game in a broken State and then improve it significantly through updates and assume the players will be ready and willing to give your game a second chance unless you have a massive marketing budget like these games that will simply not happen if you intentionally launch your game in a subar state chances are no one will know even if you end up massively improving the game over time so my advice to you is really what is pretty obvious make your launch the best it can be although at the same time let me also say this does not mean that you should not update your games that is not what I'm saying even if your launch goes poorly I still encourage you to update the game based on player feedback make sure you fix bugs and add any improvements that might help improve the game I would pretty much just device again spending a ton of time a ton of money on consistent updates things like spending an entire year making a massive update like cyber punk I would say don't do that because if you don't have a marketing budget at the same size as these ones then chances are no one will hear about your massive update again regardless of how much it improves the game now in my case my latest game dinky Guardians actually had a pretty good launch and I am actually planning to push out meaningful updates over the next months and years but the reason for that plan is mainly because I have this channel any update that I can make on the game I will talk about on video videos on this channel so basically that helps avoid the issue that I had with Survivor Squad gaunlets where I made all these updates but had no idea to reach the players and in my case even if the updates don't lead to an increase in sales it will still give me a reason to make various tutorials and Implement random videos and make random mechanics on this channel so regardless of whether or not those updates have an impact on the exal sales numbers it will simp be worth it like for example I will make a video when I Implement seam achievements i w make another one when I test out the limits of net Cod for game objects to see how many objects it can handle I will make another one as I add more interesting and different game modes basically I will do those updates in those videos primarily as a way to try out interesting ideas make some unique videos and not as a way to try to get the press and sales numbers to massively increase I'm not expecting that to happen anyway so yeah this recent debacle with City skyine 2 made me want to talk about this topic I hope you found it interesting and I hope this information helps you make a better informed plan when deciding what to do with your games thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
