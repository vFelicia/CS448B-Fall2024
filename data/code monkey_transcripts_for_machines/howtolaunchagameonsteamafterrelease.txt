in this video I'm going to go over what you should do right after releasing your game on Steam I'll go over the various tasks I do the second game is that in order to increase the chances of success this is my general todo list that I have crafted over my 8 same releases let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with NF tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing so first of all this phone was the previous video where I covered my todo list for preparing a game to release on Steam if you haven't seen it yet go check the link in the description and then come back you that video covers what should be done before clicking the release button and now in this video we're going to look at what should be done right after you click the button so you press the button and your game is now live congratulations you have a game on Steam awesome however as a sole developer you have to keep your celebration very brief the second game is out there's a ton of work to do the first thing you need to do is let people know the game is now available start off by making a steam announcement players who are really looking forward to your game won't click the follow button and everyone who follows your game won't get a pop up in their Steam client you can't just make the announcement in the game page which will work however if you found my prerelease todo list then you will have created a developer page in that page you can post announcements and automatically publish them to your game this is very useful once you have several games on themes since you can notify all of them about your new game release also the players who added the game to their wish list will get an email saying the game has just been released so you can see why every developer myself included wants you to add their games to your wish list and phone doing so greatly improves your chances of finding success with the game out and available for purchase now is a great time to make the trailer live on YouTube whether this has an impact or not will greatly depend on how much reach you have in your channel for me for example I have quite a nice amount of reach on this channel but almost nothing on my developer channel so for me the developer channel is solely for archival purposes rather than marketing but if your developer channel is big enough then publishing the trailer on YouTube and all your social media can be quite powerful either way I make it public on YouTube so you can start to share travel to people outside of caen then post about the launch on Facebook and Twitter again this role depends on the size of your following just make a simple message saying the game is out and include the trailer link if you have a large following or just get lucky and go viral this can be very impactful if not then you have nice archive of your releases pin the message and keep following the todo list key Mandler is a great way to send keys directly to youtubers and twitch streamers this is not a sponsored shout out I just really like their service and find it very useful there are always new youtubers coming up so keeping an updated list is very difficult instead here you just see the list the stats of that influencer and decide whether or not to send them a steam key this is a very easy way to send your game to people who might be interested in playing it however I do remember the general issues with sending out keys some of the people who asked for keys have no intention of reviewing or doing a video they just want to put the key up for sale and make a quick buck so instead of sending to every single person who requests the key make sure you setup a certain minimum like for example only send to people who have more than 10 thousand subscribers how much you want to risk your keys ending up on thirdparty sites is up to you but regardless make sure you contact as many valid youtubers and twitch streamers as you can if your game becomes popular on YouTube or twitch that can seriously boost your sales nowadays it seems influencers are all that matters but traditional press still has an impact so go out and create your own list of press that covers games like yours for PC games the main one that covers quite a wide range of games is rock paper shopping once you have your list send out the emails with the keys make sure you include a very short description of your game like the one in the store page as well as in a link to the trailer look at other indie dev press releases to get an idea of how yours should look it is very difficult to get pressed right about your game but if you do make it it might help you reach quite a bit so at this point you've contacted youtubers and the general press now it's time to contact your biggest fans if you have them if you made a website for your game as soon as you announce you hopefully also added a signup form for people to join your mailing list also you can add a form in game to let people sign up from the inside if this is your first game then chances are your own list is going to be quite small but as you make more games your own list won't continue which will help you in the future so regardless of what size it is send email to those people it can be similar to the press email except targeted towards your biggest fans let them know the game is out and include a call to action to buy your game emails are possibly the most powerful form of marketing but also the most difficult if you can get your biggest fans to buy your game at launch then that increases visibility in the store which in turn increases sales and so on so your goal as a career in indie game development should be to make games that these people love the more fans you have the easier it is to stay afloat in game development in your steam dashboard you won't find a place where you can directly connect with steam curators this is yet another great way to contact influencers and have them play your game the main benefit of this system is it sends the game directly to their account rather than a steam key so you don't have to worry about your keys ending up on the black market you have a hundred curator copies you can give out this is not a very large amount so don't just send to every single person instead look for reviewers who match up with your game genre for example there's no point in wasting a curator copy sending it to someone who only reviews visual novels if you have an action game also you might get curators emailing you asking for a copy get there a curator named and put it in search bar to find them as soon as the game is out and people are playing you'll start to get some reviews make sure you read them to see if there's any hidden game breaking bugs that someone has found or simply issues that can easily be fixed remember steam updates are free so if someone reports above try to fix it quickly and publish the update also make sure you reply to reviews to either get more information from person or clarify some misinformation especially on negative reviews but remember that your reply is the official developer reply so make sure you conduct yourself in a professional manner hidden in the negative reviews are the nuggets that improve the game and you as a game developer so always been looking for those then one specifics for early access games if your game has been out for a while then you won't have received reviews during early some of those people might have enjoyed the game but just thought it was a bit too early so if you're going for a full release out of early access make sure you reply to those old reviews letting them know that the game has been significantly improved and is now fully released hopefully some of those won't try the game out again and hopefully all the issues the head of the game have been fixed or improved so hopefully you might be able to change some negative reviews into positive ones which will greatly affect your score sometimes the people who find bugs won't reply to your requests for their lives or save files which can make it very difficult to fix whatever issue they found however if you follow D before launch don't list then you will have implemented come out Diagnostics so head over to your unity dashboard and check out what errors are being reported with that error list and the feedback from your players you may be able to deduce what went wrong and even if you can't directly replicate an error try to add some safeguards to make sure everything so works even if the error still occurs for example one of the errors on battleground tycoon was a health bar that for some reason was being set to no I've never encountered that error the reference was always being set correctly in the constructor so in the function that was thrown in there I just had the simple if to test for not obviously locating the actual underlying bug and fixing it is the best approach but if that can't be done then just make sure it doesn't actually break the game if you implemented the workshop then you should have also implemented a little widget to grab items from a collection now that the game is out you should pay attention to the workshop and how like new items that players make here is the workshop highlight being used in my game as you can see it rotates through all the elements in a collection and the collection is this one so in order to highlight certain point or made items all I need to do is add it to the collection enter problematically gets updated in game so if you did a similar implementation remember to update this collection as players create more items there are a lot of other stores where people also buy games while they don't have the size of steam you should definitely not ignore them as an indie dev you need to spread out as much as possible the top ones are humble and Eugene for humble you can submit your game to the store and pre easily get there the hummus or has a great dashboard where you can easily participate in weekly sales which helped quite a bit and you can also use their widget to sell your game directly on the games website their widget is what I'm using on the code monkey website to sell the game bundle then you also have gog which is also pretty big but more curated so go ahead and submit your game and maybe only accept yugi also requires the game to be drm free so in case you do get accepted make sure it's simple to remove your Steam integration and then you have on the other stores like Green Man gaming fanatic on new vine H GamersGate in Egon and more again as an indie developer you should put your game wherever possible in order to increase your reach and your chances of success so that's the general todo list that I follow after publishing a game on Steam first let your biggest fans know the game is out through these team announcements then launch the trailer on YouTube post about the release one with the trailer link on Facebook and Twitter send keys to influencers through chemo email the general press send out a release newsletter to your mailing list use curator connect to send copies to matching steam curators read reviews as they're posted and analyze what is incorrect and what can be improved if your game was in early access contact old reviewers and let them know of the full release monitor the cloud Diagnostics dashboard and attempt to fix errors even before their reporting how ID cool items players have created in the workshop and contact other stores to spread your game as much as possible if you do all this then your chances of success will be much greater I wish you the best of luck with your game release if you liked the video subscribe the channel for more game they have videos and unity tutorials post any questions you have in the comments and I'll see you next time
