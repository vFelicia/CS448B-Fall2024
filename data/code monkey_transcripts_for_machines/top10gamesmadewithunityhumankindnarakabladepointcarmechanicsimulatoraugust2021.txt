hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for august 2021 this is a particularly stacked month lots of huge hits and highly awaited games that finally released my goal with these videos is to highlight what can be done with the engine so you know really the only limit is just your own imagination all of these games are uniquely impressive and they showcase the power of the engine in tons of different scenarios so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month there's links in description for some of the games those are film playing so if you use them it's same price to you and you'll also be supporting the channel alright so starting off at number 10 with one of the biggest releases on steam humankind this one was constantly in the top 5 most wishlisted game it's been on that list for ages and finally released it's a forex strategy game a nice competition to civilization as you play you rewrite the entire history of humankind combine up to 60 historical cultures as you lead your people from ancient age into modern times face real historical events take impactful moral decisions and make some scientific breakthroughs control your units and master battle in land sea and air so if you like 4x games then this seems like a great new entry in the genre next up another one that is also very highly awaited recompile i've been watching gifs of this game on twitter for what feels like years now it's certainly very visually striking as soon as you see a screenshot or a gif it's immediately recognizable the game is a metroidvania 3d platformer with a bunch of skills in combat the environment contains all kinds of logic gates you can freely interact with so invert them and hack all kinds of doors invaders and even enemies if you want to learn how to find success marketing on twitter then definitely check out this game's twitter account up next yet another one that people have been looking forward to for a long time 12 minutes this one has been something like over five years in development real long time it's a realtime topdown interactive thriller game you find yourself stuck in a time loop reliving the same horrible day over and over again the description doesn't really say much since this one is all about the mystery but that mystery certainly is very compelling usually i'm not really into pointandclicks but this one certainly looks very interesting i'm a big fan of the time loop concept i love playing outer wild so i look forward to playing this one whenever i have the time then for something quite a bit more jolly dodgeball academia actually already played this one i was randomly browsing my xbox one day and this one was on game pass it's a really great game it's very fun dodgeball game with lots of interesting unique characters and tons of special moves the whole thing plays like it's a saturday morning cartoon show really very jolly very funny and the game itself is also pretty well designed each character has its own moveset and you can manage your team to choose which one to use first i really like playing it it's included on game pass so if you have that definitely give it a try by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks another one that a lot of people have been looking forward to is naraka bladepoint this one had a huge beta quite a while ago i think it was one of the biggest team betas from what i can remember the concept is a melee combat meets battle royale so that certainly makes it stand out from all the other battle royale games features a very diverse skill system play with swords daggers bows and use your special abilities you've got a really nice grappling hook so there's tons of verticality to design it's also a very versatile tool you can use it to pull yourself upwards run away from a battle or just zip straight towards the end and visually it also looks very nice it features a more eastern art sound which once again makes it stand out from all the other modern military battle royal games for some vr here is a nice sequel i expect you to die too i played the first one quite a long time ago it's quite an inventive concept perfectly made for vr it's essentially an escape puzzle game very much inspired by spy movies you are in a small seated area with tons of props lying around you have to use your mind to solve confounding puzzles and travel the world to stop some world domination every mission is connected so there is a cohesive storyline culminating in an explosive ending your goal is simple it's to simply not die if you have vr definitely try this one it's very unique and the whole thing is meant to be a seated experience so you don't really need too much space then something very relaxing that just came out of early access townscaper when this game came out there were tons of gifts of it on twitter the game is just a joy to look at mechanically the game is quite simple it really is mainly an experience rather than a game it's a great example of the power of simple but very polished visuals coupled with some excellent game juice just the simple action of placing down a building feels very satisfying there's no time limit no goal just build for the joy of building very good when you want to just have a very relaxing time if that's too comfortable and you want something more hardcore here is grime it's a fastpaced unforgiving actionadventure game features a very interesting weapon system where you crush your foes with some living weapons that mutate both in form and function and of course many unique and dangerous bosses for you to battle it's got some great visuals very dark and moody and another one that is also a simple concept executed perfectly is the ramp it's a skateboarding game with no fluff so there's no unlockables no score no explosions you really just have yourself and your skateboard you do a bunch of tricks and just enjoy yourself with this satisfying skateboarding gameplay like the developer says this game slash toy offers you 15 minutes of flow to make a boring day great all of that for the price of a single latin and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month here is car mechanic simulator 2021 it's exactly what you expect it's a simulated game where you're a mechanic working on cars there's quite a lot of these games usually one every year i think the last one i played i believe was in 2016 based on the reviews and the very very positive reception this one got it seems like it's the best one yet so i definitely want to give it a try like i said the name is very descriptive you get a car find out what's wrong with it you have to deal with a bunch of screws take out various pieces to get to the part that is broken then you replace it put it all back together again and make a buck there's over 4 000 unique parts and over 70 cars tons of content you can also expand your garage to provide some more services do some painting and some tuning pay a visit to the auction house and buy some hidden gems that look rough and make them really shiny i remember playing a game called gearhead garage when i was a kid i think i just had the demo but i played a ton so this genre of taking things apart and building them back together definitely appeals to me some of these simulator games tend to be quite janky but this one does have over 5000 very positive reviews so it seems to be well made if you like this genre of taking things apart and putting them back together then this seems like an excellent new entry alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity launched in august 2021 lots of variety showing you everything the engine can do if you want to be successful in the game developer you definitely need to keep an eye on the current state of your competition i make
