hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the ssor is full of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more some stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for April 23 in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also right now there's a humble button with a bunch of Game Dev TV courses on making RPG elements I remember going through the inventory course and I quite liked it so these four are made using some really nice clean code you can get the entire pack for just 25 bucks and there's also a mega bundle on the NT accessor so this one as usual has multiple tiers up to 95 off you've got a the sound Shader a bunch of icons then over here and I see on the editor console Pro so a much more advanced console if you've got the game creator which quite a lot of people like this one we've got some vegetation some first person animations you've got some sounds some robots or maybe a kid to make your own stardew Valley so check out both bundles with the links in the description alright so on to the top 10 list starting off with the free enemies demo now you probably already know what this one is it's unity's latest visual showcase and looks really gorgeous and now you can get the demo and play with it yourself obviously note how this is an egrp demo meant to push the visuals to the absolute Max so definitely don't expect it to run well unless you have an excellent machine this uses tons of features that they made for this demo and then added them to egrp so there's adaptive probe volumes screen space Global illumination realtime Ray Trace reflection Ray trace and inclusion the LSS support and a bunch more this also includes the really highend skin and eye shaders so if you want to push Unity visuals to their limits then definitely check out how this one is made next here's a cone character it's a nice mimic lots of tentacles swirling around and touching the floor and looks really nice just a while ago I was rewatching the awesome movie Edge of Tomorrow and this character certainly would be perfect for a game inspired by that movie looking at this also makes me just want to build a character like this just for fun play around with some shaders and maybe some animation rating then for a really nice Zoom here is extra star assets this one is basically an addon for Unity certain assets which seems to add quite a lot of stuff especially for a free package it features a nice character creator script where you can choose what abilities you want your character to have you can add movement jump pushing or Sprint do you seen like the camera type maybe add a gun or flashlight and you have a working controller this is definitely a great addition to the already great star assets next if you have a Discord community and you want to make some posts from Unity then here is a nice tool I'm not familiar with the Discord API but apparently through web hooks you can make posts you can create threads and it will include attachments and embeds so I could see this as being very useful if you want to create some kind of control panel from Unity where you can manage your Discord or perhaps edit your game and post a message when a player starts playing the game for some visuals here is another free pack directly from Unity this one is urp and it's for their Adventure game environment pack this one was used in a bunch of tutorials as well as in the adventure sample game project you can follow that project or in unity and learn or you can just use this package as a nice environment in your game next up here is another interesting one it's an aircraft generator it uses modular pieces to create tons of random variation all of them look really great they really don't look like they're generated at all you have some fighter jets some with some reverse Wings a bunch of bumpers and some that look like upper planes then if you're making a 2d game and you need some nice cute slimes here's a great pack they're all in a very cute cartoony art style it includes quite a lot of variation with a whole bunch of different Sprites next up for some steampunk UI here's a nice one definitely looks very chunky very steampunk you have several backgrounds including all kinds of Sliders and buttons it even has some cursors which perhaps you could combine with my own mouse cursor system Pro then if you need some vegetation check out this one it's a low poly style all of it looks very inviting it includes almost 50 models so that's some environment grass stone Hills and a bunch of buildings if you're working on a tower defense game here's a nice turn it's very saffron looking it includes three separate modular Parts anything like this style then you can get the phone pack alright so those are my top 10 free newests on the NTS or for apron 23 there's links on the description also check out my own pass on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon
