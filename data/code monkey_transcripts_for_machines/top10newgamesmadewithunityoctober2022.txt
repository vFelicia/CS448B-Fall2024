hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity and launch in October 22. the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all of these games are unically impressive so don't listen in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way I'm currently working on my own steam game called Turtle war on Liberation it's a game with tons of systems it's open world survival crafting Automation and with turnbased strategy check out the steam page edit to your wishlist and file for Devils also Black Friday is happening right now there's multiple sales with tons of awesome stuff discounted there's the UNT asosor of the best sets are on sale and some Flash Deals at 70 off the synthy store is also having a sale so if you need some gorgeous low poly packs check it out and finally there's a Humble Bundle all about learning blender 3D modeling at 98 off so if there's any assets you need then Now's the Time to get them alright so starting off at number 10 with yet another awesome Lego game there's a bunch of these and they always look excellent it really has a nearly perfect look really looks like gorgeous real Lego this is a puzzle game where you are given a bunch of bricks and a goal and it's up to you to combine them Brick by Brick to achieve that goal features lots of Lego pieces to play with you can customize your character and also features realistic physics applied to vehicles on all kinds of Lego objects so you can build just a static good looking object or some actual functional objects like Vehicles helicopters or a crane you explore unique worlds and some puzzles and some gorgeous looking diagrams it has very positive reviews so if you're a fan of Lego then check this out next up we have contact this one is an old school shooter if you like this style then this one looks perfect really low resolution pixelated textures with some flat enemies and 2D weapons in a 3D World although it also has some Modern features like some accurate physics a phony 3D World and some high quality lighting which looks pretty great combined with the old school Sprites there are 10 maps and tons of weapons combat is fast and deadly for both the enemies and for yourself after completing the story you have a wavebased surrival mode so if you enjoy the gameplay then you have plenty of game to play it's already got over 1500 overwhelmingly positive reviews so if you're a fan of this genre then this looks like an excellent new entry then we have a game with a really fun name it's Dave the diver it's a pretty fun mix of an action and management game first you capture some fish and then you sell some sushi during the day you dive into the sea to capture fish firing the Harpoon feels really satisfying but it's not just spraying there are also some dangerous fish that you have to find so you must be ready to dodge and defeat them then at night it's time to serve the fish to the customers you pour some drinks grab the right dish for the right customer do it right and you get a tip you can build the many yourself decide what dishes you want the chef to serve and make sure you catch enough ingredients that you need it looks like a really nice mix of genres I saw a spider cat play a demo build quite a while ago and looks pretty fun already has 500 overwhelmingly positive views so people are really enjoying this nice unique mix next up a game with a very generic name but it doesn't look awesome it's called weird RPG it's a fastpaced very difficult action game the main thing about it is it looks like the combat is excellently tight all the attacks look really Snappy and really powerful it says that it's influenced by Hades and sakuro those are two games with excellent combat and controls also features a multitude of weapons each being completely different and really making you feel powerful it has over a thousand very positive views and also if you're regular on this channel then you might be immediately recognizing the assets so this is yet another excellent example of something that I covered in another video which is how players really just want awesome games to play they don't care what assets you use to make them up next if you're looking for some nice Colony survival check out settlement survival the only the group of survivors in search of a new home take over this land and make it your own he can manipulate the landscape grow some crops and set up some trading routes although do remember that this is a survival game so make sure you have enough resources and you're prepared for all the disasters that are sure to happen discover some rare Blueprints and explore the tech tree so will you prioritize trading or mining agriculture or Logistics it's all up to you also has a quoteunquote fun mode where you relieve some historical moments like the bubonic play or the Easter Island Disaster so it seems like a really nice Colony Survival game it just launched a few days ago and already has 4 000 very positive reviews so this one really selling like crazy then here we have godania it's an open world RPG with tons of freedom you can build your character in any way you want so you can be a stealthy assassin or a powerful Mage you go out on an adventure join different factions and explore and Conquer some scary dungeons you have your own house which you can build and decorate and you can also do some gardening and farm some animals every Quest has many ways it can be completed you can use Ross ranked or Charisma it's up to you and just like the other game that I mentioned a while ago you've probably noticed the synthes in this one and again it did not hurt the game it has 1700 very positive reviews so people really love the game then here we have lost idle ones it's a really cinematic turnbased RPG the attacks really are extremely cinematic there are some gorgeous camera shots with some really nice animations and effects personally I definitely need to study this one to see if there is anything I can apply to my own turnbased strategy game the combat is grid based with multiple units in your party each of them with different skills you can customize your squad from 20 characters and 10 unique classes you can train them and unlock new skills and spells then lace each the castles and take out some cutting bosses by thinking and executing the perfect strategy then for some VR here we have that second it looks like yet another VR shooter but the main thing is how it's really an oldschool arcade shooter I love playing virtual cop as a kid and this one is pretty much exactly that so rather than having commonly free movement you can only move to predetermined spots doing that allows the game to feel much better design on the encounters are handmade to make you feel really awesome and the game itself is all about style so there's lots of slow motion some quick shots and some super cool moves I really love how the trailer for this one looks it really looks like it's extremely satisfying to play if you're in the mood for a card action game check out one more gate it's a deck building roguelite there's over 100 cards you can collect and use in your deck lots of quests to complete and some Quirk characters to meet being a roguelite means that every run is unique with some unexpected Powers Divine blessings and curses all of it made with a gorgeous looking art style some really nice clean lights and some gorgeous effects and animations and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is an extremely deep and complex scifi Colony Sim called Sturgis you run the AI of a ship with some hibernating humans take your Fleet of drones and repair the ship save the crew and explore the Stars it's inspired by both factorio and rimworld those are definitely two excellent sources of inspiration you need to watch out for pressure and otune levels if there's a leak then things are not going to go well there's tons and tons of overlays to help you visualize everything that is going on with the ship there will be disasters like asteroids that hit your ship and break the whole thing apart so it's up to you to quickly get the drones to work repairing the ship before everything blows up personally as someone who loves both factorio and rim world this one looks extremely awesome alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with the Indian team launched in October 22. I hope this list until you see how the unity engine is capable of building anything the limits are really just your own skills and Imagination let me know in the comments if you've played any of these or if there's any interesting systems in the games you've been playing check out my own Sim game Total 1 Liberation and add it to your wishlist alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
