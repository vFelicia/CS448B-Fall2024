hey everyone how's it going nice to see you all here hey hey Rex hey everyone nice thanks for being here all right uh okay okay me just see if the music is okay all right good night oh is it night there yeah I guess that's the thing about living in a a huge world it's daytime in some places night time in some other place over here it's 500 p.m. so it's still pretty nice been a couple of nice days over here actually nice and sunny so that's good all right okay so basically I'm still working on my SE oh yeah it is uh hey yeah thanks again nice cup of coffee that would that would go nice uh yeah so here I am still working on the dots course still researching a bunch of things still doing a bunch of things in India is it night in India oh interesting yeah because I guess it's on the right side so I guess it's quite a bit later in there yeah I guess India is what like plus eight compared to this so I guess right now it's like like what midnight yeah I guess so it's a little bit on the right that's interesting nice all right like our videos well nice thank you I'm glad I'm glad you like them uh so yeah still got a bunch of things that I've been uh working on still got a still got a many things to implement many things to work but so far the uh systems are going well 10pm in India oh so Plus yeah five hours oh nice that's cool uh yeah so I've implemented a bunch of stuff so I got the flow field path findinding so over here these are walls so I now have the logic in order to be able to have the units Dodge the walls and it was also really tricky oh 13 PM Vietnam nice uh it was also it was really tricky to to get the path finding working because uh being dots means that it's uh data oriented in setad up object oriented so one thing that was wrong tricky was handling the pathfind request cuz usually um usually if I was making a pathfinding like regular AAR path finding on some kind of uh regular object oriented stuffff usually I have a unit request a path and then the unit passes in some kind of delegate so when the path is complated get that call back but in dots I cannot pass in delegates so that was actually quite tricky I had to figure out some way okay how do I request a path and how do I then get that path back so getting that was actually surpris tricky to to figure out how to do all that logic I end up with a nice mix of quite a lot of things where's my unit mover system open this one I had a nice little comment to remind myself of how the whole system is set up so basally I got a component for basically queuing up a path so that one in cues a tet position and is enable so I can enable or disable content thank you nice yeah I'm glad my my videos have helped you uh then this one takes those entities that have that component and basically this Ray cast see if there are no walls so if there are no walls it just moves straight so there's no point in wasting any energy on cating path finding if there are no walls just move straight but if there are walls then I need to basically request a path finding so I use this component in order to uh request the flow field path and then this one takes in the Target position that one is also enable and then I've got a grid system which again this is a grid system that is based on data oriented design instead of being based on objects so usually each grid object is one different Place whereas over here for my grid system this one is all databased so basically I've got a grid object except it's not an object it's a struct it's an i component data and it's got the X and Y and then the logic for culating the flow field and basically instead of having a twodimensional array which can't really be done instead of that I've got a native array which in itself has native array of a bunch of entities so lots of things so yeah as you can see a little bit complex and then finally so that eventually count the path finding so if you're curious about how the code Works yep here it is the code for culating the path it looks a bit more complex than it actually is in reality if you know AAR path finding you should be able to fully understand everything that I've got here when I eventually uh make the course if you understand AAR then doing flow field is actually relatively similar basically you cycle through all the neighbors then you see okay he moving from this neighbor onto the target position is that one going to be faster or slower than from this neighbor to this one if it is faster then just update the cost and then add that node onto the open list then you keep cycling through that open list until the open list is absolutely empty yeah one of those characters over here on the bottom you just have to talk and if you want to customize it you can go onto this page right here and if you're curious as to how the S thing works there's tutorials down here at the bottom of this page so the S thing is the transparent Unity window the way the characters are being animated these are mesh based animations and the way that it's interacting with YouTube API that one is done through an HTP request from and the characters themselves those are pretty much exact same characters that I use in my game batt Tycoon with a bunch of Randomness to make all the uh guest spring sheets so yep won't be able to AFF the learn Unity do so for this one I'm planning to make both a uh a paid version and then a free sample so I'm guessing the final course will be like 20 hours long and that will make a free sample on YouTube like 10 hours so if you can't afford the home course you can still watch the beginning of the course which will hopefully uh get you quite a lot of knowledge in terms of learning how to do things in dots and so on so I'll try to make the more General things in the first part of the course so anyone who wants to learn can learn and then anyone who wants to learn this specific game with all these specific mechanics you can continue watching for the rest of it so hopefully regardless it should be nice hey hey how's it going uh so yeah anyways as I was saying pathf finding so now I can click and these are little uh pathfinding blockers so they can go there so if I click normally and they there are no walls they just move straight and if I click over there they see okay there's a wall right in between so let's callete the path go in there and now get eaten by zombies yep so yeah making the path finding for this was actually quite a quite a tricky thing learning how to do all of this especially because there isn't that much information on dots and data oriented design and all that so yeah building all of this was actually quite trick actually let me show can I show I don't know if I can show uh the debug visual sec which is actually quite fun uh uh okay so CU I got to get inside of the CU I modified how this whole thing worked uh on the grid single array on index let's go on index zero try to see always the path on index zero and try to see how that one goes the grid anti array and then for the Target and that's grid Position will be this one on this one dot grid destination okay so let's see if I can showcase a visual let me just put this one on uh yeah let me put just one and then I'm basically going to erase the other one just to show a nice visual so you can see exactly what is a flow field exactly how a flow Field Works it's actually super simple literally just a field of vectors that is really uh pretty much it so so basally just a bunch of arrows that if you follow all the arrows eventually you end up as a Target So in theory it's actually relatively simple putting for Life yeah I definitely do intend to to write code for my entire life I hope that by the time I'm 80 or 90 years old I'm still writing code making games I hope so that's the plan at least uh okay let me just enable this and let me disable these zombie spawners so I can play around just with my units and let's see so here it is that's the flow field you can see the units are oh there you go that one is walking by itself so you can see some nodes are unwalkable those are the ones that have the walls inside of it and you can see this little zombie and there you go Cate the path in there and you can see the entire map all of the GD positions all of them have the arrows pointing and if you follow those arrows eventually you reach at the Final Destination so for example if I got a unit over here this one goes up left up left then goes up then goes over here on this side then goes left left left then over here goes down down down down down and eventually reaches the target position so yeah flow Fields very interesting and the obvious uh advantage of this one as opposed to something like AAR in AAR pathf you have a start and an endpoint whereas over here you just have an end point and you culate basically from any point on the grid how to reach that Target point so the big benefit is if you have some like an RTS with tons and tons of uh of units uh hey everyone uh if you have an oh hey CL VR hey nice yeah yeah I'm doing yeah I've been working been researching on how to make a uh RTS game using dots which has been an interesting thing so I've been currently researching it uh and yeah for for making an RTS game then using flow Fields is actually an excellent thing because basically if I have just one zombie or a million zombies the path finding is the exact same thing because you just calculate the path for the Target destination like for example the uh players main HQ and then I can have like a million zombies anywhere in the world they just need to follow the arrows and eventually they will't reach the target position hey there how's it going uh right so yeah so that's the rough idea behind the uh flow field which is actually quite interesting and another interesting thing was again since I can't basically give the path back to the individual unit that that created it since I can't do that basically the path is essentially cached so I've got just one unit just one entity that has this great system data which in turn has an array of this an array of 50 of these grid singles and each of these is what actually contains that grid data so basically uh if I enable the the log where's my log okay let me just hide these visuals because these are no longer necessary and yeah I actually still got the log uh where did I put the log didn't I put a log did I put a log did I did I raise the l oh no there you go yeah so it's already it's already doing a nice log so basically the paths are being uh being cached so I can do all kinds of things can I ask are using a buffer for selected units do you mean a dynamic buffer uh nope I'm using G uh unit selection uh and I'm basically just using a a selected tag so basically as I go in order to select multiple units I find I find all the units I get their position relative to the camera and if they are within that little square selection area then I just set the enti manager set a component enable to true and then when doing all kinds of actions like for example where's my move code there you go for moving multiple units I just do a query on all units that are both friendly and select so really just two tags so select is either enable or disable so that's how I'm handling the selection so yeah pretty simple this can be similar to command conquer yeah that's the rough idea so basically making a classic RTS so there are units I can move those units I'm just what did I get did I forget to disable that one wa what okay where do you know what wait where are you destroying okay that's did I duplicate any object accidentally or something multiplayer uh not for starters for starters I'm really just focusing on just get it done in single player but afterwards yeah I definitely want to want to research uh oh hey Daniel hey thanks for being here uh yeah so afterwards I do want to research uh net code for entities um any reason you're not using system API just because this one is not a the uh I'm guessing hey thanks again uh the unit selection manager this one is a regular mon Behavior so yeah that's the only reason because normally I do use the system API which is what you've mentioned many times so yeah anytime that I can use the system API I'm using that one but on things that are just regular mono behaviors yeah just doing a a uh anti query in order to find that thing although now this is a little bit strange isn't it why is this now throwing an error okay now this is random let me try unloading and reloading the SC oh God dots has so many random errors that show up but what is going on now like why why is this one running the on Destroy when it's did I change some is it still no because I've got no static data well this is strange I guess I can just add a check there but it is weird how when I start why on Earth is the on Destroy running I have no idea why that one would be running but apparently this guy right here is not the question is why is this one destroying itself before starting itself if it does then Al it is indeed no not B I mean it's the first time that it's happened to me so whatever it is uh oh okay 10 hour course oh nice that's awesome hey I hope you learn a lot nice okay so why is this one so this whole thing is so it's not the grit array is the value double is this the one that is known well this is strange this because I played around with the with the cuz I modify the size to make it just one what why is that one okay maybe I'm missing something or I have no idea you don't seem like in native English speaker nope I'm not where are you from yep I am from Portugal I'm Portuguese so yep that is why my accent is is a little bit strange okay what on Earth is going all right why is this one giving me I have no idea what is going on now yeah it runs after why is it destroying so many things all right okay now I'm definitely confused am I missing something I'm not missing something so it's F did I no everything is saved okay I have no idea why this I thought you were American really does my accent sound American I mean I I learned by watching lots of maybe a Rog function pointer yeah I have no idea why it's the first time that I've seen that yeah I'm guessing it has to do with some I was saying it was some static data because I modified this on to one or to Showcase how it works and then back into 50 so now it kind of thinks that one is one but it's 50 but but even on the why on Earth isn't even the log yeah the log itself isn't running okay so I I have no idea and if I disable this and just have the subscene nope still throws a strange thing I don't trust anyone with a white ID background well then I guess you don't trust my eyes because my eyes do not work with the Dark theme so sorry but that's kind of thing I'm trying to do a a restart very strange I never encountered that so no idea I mean the stack Trace in theory it was going over here onto the grid system but the log itself this one was not running so very strange so this one over here one of these lines was throwing a non reference but it wasn't printing any of these logs so yeah that was interesting very strange okay why are you still messed up in the system based registry thing mapping systems to their functions my question is why isn't the why are you well at least now it ran the log but it land it ran the log afterwards L is correct yeah 327 327 so this one runs but that one on a null supposedly on 329 okay I wasn't expecting to have a random bug like this I assume it's a bug cuz I can't really figure out what else might be the issue oh reference yeah I did log all of them but but nope yeah but even if uh like in theory so this perhaps not this one in the it's going through 3219 but how are you even if it's off by one even if it's this one or this one why on Earth isn't it running this log is it something related to maybe burst compile this something strange where it runs things out of order I have no idea mess up the inline numbers line up or down oh is it maybe not like in this function at all could it wait ah okay well I just figured out what is the answer it's exactly over here on this one so yeah that is a very uh interesting question yeah so yeah the issue is exactly over here cuz I disabled the uh I disabled over here my grid system debug I disabled the log so this instance is indeed going to be null so yeah I guess it is well it's uh good to know so thanks zny that is good to know it's good to know that the source generation might get the lines up or down by a little bit so it says line uh 329 but it's actually over here on this one so if I add a little question mark if I am correct then this is indeed solution and now it is not going to have that error so let's see play and there you go does work all right so that was that was fun okay that was a a good thing to to find out all right so apparently Source generation changes a bunch of things around and might end up modifying some things so the issue was not any of this not any of this had nothing to do with thisy it was just up here except for some reason Source generation said it was like eight lines afterwards all right so yeah that was fun figuring out one bug and what happened by the way Danny do you know how to get rid of this uh annoying error message that is it's really annoying it's I'm assuming that it's related to dots because on non dos projects I don't have it but every time that I use the uh the uh uh window to search if I search for something like unit then all a for some reason it shows up that bug or if I go right click and find all references then it also shows that same thing going to debug and so on so yeah yeah don't use yes Community I mean it has always served me very well it has always worked very well but yeah this is the only strange one that I have no idea why that happens but yeah from your experience what do you miss about un that you would love to see implemented uh that's tricky because honestly I think one of my biggest benefits is how I'm very adaptable so if Unity doesn't have something I can easily adapt to that and figure out some way of making it work but if I had to say something I would probably say to the pathfinding because as far as I know I know they've updated the uh the navigation package but as far as I know it still does not does not support 2D so I do think that would be something that Unity definitely should add add some 2D path finding so you can make 2D games and so on entally our source gen has to solve the problem of we don't call your code we call your regenerated version of your code that means you don't get line debugging and so we do oh like to remap oh that's interesting oh going back to rewatch here yeah the eror was a standard non reference exception so the only thing was really just the the uh line because I disabled the grid system debug I've got a uh a um I can see right down here I've got a monor behavior with that script but I disabled it in order to hide debug and of course if the game object is disabled then this awake never runs so the instance is never set so over here on this one this one was throwing a no reference exception because of course it was no so just adding the little question mark that solves it so yeah really the only issue was just the line being on another place if I had seen it was on this line I would know immediately what was the issue okay so anyways let me do a little bit of work what did I want to do uh oh yeah I wanted to try spawning a hord and try to figure out how do I make that happen okay so let me think a little bit for what do I need to spawn a horde so for a horde let me enable the other zombies as well hey micia taking a break from video editing oh nice yeah video editing is always something I got to say It's s like a task that nowadays I still very much don't enjoy it has to be done oh did I forgot to they're all on the same path findinding let me just cuz yeah video editing it's uh I mean at least even though I still don't really enjoy it I have gotten quite a lot more efficient at it so at least that is good two more days before my GD video is finished wow that is a long edit so yeah best of luck with that uh she disabl reload domain yep that's the uh the dots recommendation so yep I did do that so I've got my units move around start killing zombies and so on uh okay favorite essential asset packages you import to use in every project oh 75 minutes wow that is a super long video uh yeah in terms of packages I don't know because normally I make projects to make videos and that doesn't uh so that means that I can't really use uh any packages any asss and so on so usually I don't really use use too much I use my my own utilities that I cop into pretty much uh every project just has a bunch of nice helper things but yeah in terms of packages themselves uh not really yeah Odin yeah exactly if I wasn't if I wasn't making something to then uh publish the project files and so on if I wasn't doing that then yeah absolutely I would use Odin Odin is extremely useful if you use it it's one of those things the more you use the more it actually benefits you so yeah using Odin would definitely be one of the main things and uh the path finding project I've used that one so pretty much the things that I've covered in my uh asset reviews here or my playlist my asset review series which I haven't done in quite a while yeah basically as AR path finding really awesome Odin inspector really awesome if you have 2D games then uh this one the allinone Sprite Shader is really awesome if you want to destruction then bre fire is really awesome the uh Quantum console this one's definitely really awesome yeah I've used this one quite a lot uh in my actually a lot of these I've used in my game dinky Guardians I use the quantum console super useful for running all kinds of testing commands and feel oh crap it's not this I've got the little thing um so yeah feel is really awesome really great for adding all kinds of Polish to your game so yeah basically a lot of the things that I've covered here are actually extremely good so if you're looking for to also help you definitely look into these videos cuz a lot of these are extremely good yeah it's been like 3 years years since I've done this I definitely would like to do a lot more aset reviews I just need to uh figure out the time to be able to do it but yeah there's a lot of a lot of awesome stuff do a video on task a weit it's a bit confusing to me yeah I got to say that to me it is also still confusing every time that I have to work with with the async A8 I have to relearn how the whole thing works because yeah it is always basically you mark something as you mark a function as async I don't know it's always every time I work with that every time I always have to do some of it like public async void test function so you do something like this then up here you do like an aight test function and over here doing like a yield return something something like that I don't know it's always very and basically if you have something as async you can make it uh can make this one return a task of type object I think it's something like this like I said it's I always have to relearn how oh this one is ring code that's Yeah so basically when it comes to task a wait and a sync this is always still very complex still to myself I still don't know yeah tev he makes a lot of awesome stuff so yeah I'm sure he would use it quite a lot but yeah cuz making Ayn and a white basically yeah it is it's not just you at least for me I also find it quite confusing and every time that I have to use use it I always have to remember relearn how the whole thing works so see it is quite tricky uh okay so let me let me think for a little bit so I want to do a hoorde so what do I need for a hord I need some kind of start position I need some amount of units that I want to spawn that I want to spawn those and those should automatically go and attack the HQ which actually is a good question why aren't these guys attacking the HQ I think it's because they've got the random walking let me see what did I put on this preab news Mark Brown oh yeah la his demo yeah I saw it that is actually quite interesting and I haven't actually seen the curious to see how many wish list does he have uh Mind Over magnet I'm guessing he's got a mountain oh nice 16 100 so about 20,000 wish list so yeah very nice and the game does look quite interesting I mean I'm usually not one for Platformers puzzle Platformers I always always suck at it but yeah the game does look very nice I love the visual I think it looks really awesome yeah visually very compelling very nice that oh you got to meet Mark Brown oh nice I only met him for like five minutes Ed a unite in Montreal like two years ago I think so yeah I only spoke to him for about 5 minutes yeah he was nice it was cool that was fun uh so yeah I hope the game comes out nicely yeah cuz he's been working on this for quite a while and well does seem to be coming along nicely so that should be fun think weight is easier than dots H isn't I don't know a SN weight is something that is always always tricky but yeah I guess I mean dots is something super massive so yeah technically learning just one small thing is easier than learning a giant massive thing uh okay so let me Focus I really want to uh why don't you use dark theme because Dark theme burns my eyes by the way Danny if you're still here is there a better way of doing this like getting references to prefabs basically this is the way that I came up with I just made a a Singleton uh so just a standard entity holding all my references to all my prefabs and I've got the game objects and I just convert them all into prefabs and then the code whenever I want to spawn some kind of thing I just go inside this one so on my Barrack system that spawns some uh some units I do a get Singleton in order to find the entities references and then from that one I choose the prefab to spawn but is there a better way to do this that is my question that seems right oh cuz one thing that I do wish had because usually when I make this kind of thing where I Define some kind of uh Hey Timbo hey how's it going uh usually when I make uh something like this about spawning uh entities usually what I do is I have script Mo objects and inside the script Mo object over here I would have a film for the prefab but I'm pretty sure that I cannot put an entity prefab reference here right so yeah that would be nice would be nice if I was able to do that so that I could keep all the data directly inside the scripal object as opposed to having an en's reference but yeah you can oh can you how please please teach me uh so what do I can I put an entity here just see uh prefab entity authoring do I cuz like this if this one makes a feel then I can't drag it on or can I drag it on there okay now that I'm thinking I think I didn't actually try it out but nope because it did not apparently well do and authoring and baking yeah that is what I'm that is what I'm doing but that's what I'm doing on the n's reference over here yeah I am using the baker so I get the prefabs for like the soldier prefab I get that one then I use get empty in order to do that and so on here you just need to ensure you are baking in the saved entity so over here I put a game object so but this is going to be the prefi game object so how do I how are where you using the script object uh just got a reference for for it on usually I've got the I've got a general game mthod class which is really just a just a way to get references so I've got this one placed in the scene and then I drag the references for all these things for example I've got one for unit type list and then inside unit type list inside that one I've got references script objects for each of them and so on but basically over here so I've got a prefab so how do I convert this into an entity are you saying uh uh where's my Barracks Barracks Barracks no not the authoring wait is it no bar system where I go yeah so basically over here I've got this one so let me think that actually might not be better cuz I don't necessarily have the X I got the unit uh okay so what I was thinking might actually not be better because I mean basically game assets the instance let me go inside the unit type so and get like the soldier unit so unit type so Soldier unit type so so I've got this one in case you need the thing you currently have oh okay okay so you're saying over here on this one make this one a bakeable thing but then how do I oh are you uh okay I'm not sure I understand what you're saying but I think you're saying uh where's my oh God I got way too many things open let me close some these uh orally saying to keep the game object reference inside the scripal object and then over here when I got this one to author on this or can you save an entity inside a script B object actually have no idea can that one save something any tips on staying focused uh my best tip is use a todo list so that's my where's my camera I don't know where my camera is there you go that's my toone list for the various things that I do that is one of the main ways that I stay uh focused basically just have a list of tasks to do and then just go uh task by task do each kind of thing individually and if you do that at least you have a plan from which to to work on so usually at least for me I find that helps quite a bit um becomes the thing you put in a sub scene Baker for game assets and create an entity like an entity's reference authoring but at that point it wouldn't really yeah at that point would end up kind of the same thing so I wouldn't end up with the script object itself having an entity it would still be on some kind of entities references but does this one yeah let me just see is this technically possible can I store an entity inside a cuz in theory I could have uh for example my Baker over here Baker does a bunch of things then actually this one is probably going to throw a null reference but in theory then I could go and grab the or actually I can put the unit type so for the soldier unit type so so I could go into this one and then on this one dot prefab entity equals get entity uh wait to oh cuz this one is not on the right never mind just the authoring uh authoring for the preab entity uh the get the entity for the this one. game object and this one do dynamic will this work can I store a prefab entity inside a script M object system right en back to Theo yeah so would this technically work so if I go over here so this is my zombie unit so let me grab the zombie put it over there let me put this on the debug oh entities do not show up on debug okay I expected that to work but no okay sure fine me put over here I actually put Soldier by I so inside the soldier in theory if I pass in the soldier uh the unit Soldier pass in that one in theory this one should actually be baked I think I do a debug log technically that might work okay interesting um yeah apparently that did work okay that is all right so perhaps this might be a better approach that way I can use basically the same uh setup that I've always used basically have an so and the so has that and then yeah for spawning the uh where's my building Barracks over here on this one I'm going from that one to find that so instead of going through there I could grab the unit Soldier so for example the soldier and over here instead of spawning for that one let's spawn this one right here go inside this one prefab entity okay let's see if I can spawn soldiers I'm guessing this one is going to make a different thing so 396 let's see if now it is going to be different well I guess it is deterministic so technically I'm assuming this is a different object different entity just with the exact same name but anyways so now if I place some barracks and if I go inside and I spawn a soldier let's see if it spawns ah something went wrong Source entity is not a valent entity okay get entity essentially just means Baker please get me the already baked version of this entity if not then bake it so but you can only uh call get uh entity directly from inside a baker class right so why this one now say sources not validty did I I'm guessing the error was on that one actually use manage components to store exal script object to using un the object by oh okay I haven't I haven't looked in I I saw that component but I haven't yet uh used it myself wait the uh Source en is not AV valid en so is this one not not doing a pretty out the same thing oh crap the engine and let me Place some barracks and spawn unit and let's see what this one says hey it does say the same thing so why is this one saying Source entity is not a valid entity he cuz it is 10396 396 but it says it is not a valid entity why is this one not valid why can't I spawn this one it seems like the rest of it worked so basically I've got the S object inside it did store correctly the uh entity that was baked so that's the one on the on the where is it where is it where is it the enti reference yeah basally went inside this one called get entity for the Prefab game object inside the unit type so so yeah it looks like that one bake is different than the runtime entity what do you mean the uh so basally over here this one uh this Soldier is working which was doing the same thing yeah converting a game object into that one then this one over here for some reason is not working baking is when creates an entity to serialize then hitting play the serializes that entity so is it maybe using the one from the previous run is that the issue cuz if I try doing the exact same thing I'm guessing that one will work so then how do I make this one run at the same time my question is given the whole complexity of the framework do you think it's worth the learning well if you need the uh the benefits that it needs the benefits that it uh gives you yeah it is absolutely worth it I mean it is naturally more complex but the benefits are Monumental so if you have a kind of like an RTS or really if you have just one specific part inside your whole game that requires Extreme Performance if you have just that then yeah using dots for that part of thing it's probably not too difficult to learn how to do just one system basally the issue over here is that I'm trying to build pretty much all of it using uh using things that's interesting why is that on version five I don't know um so basically this entity is being created and destroyed is that it so if I go inside the May that exists let me see technically does this one no longer exist oh crap I didn't in unity for about 5 years now nice recently started working on projects and in real in game maker and I haven't deled into dots I'm sure they also have something similar though uh I mean dots is really ECS n component system which is a nonunity thing it's a it's a uh it's a general programming thing so I'm sure that there are some ECS Frameworks for uh game maker or unreal and if you need these kinds of benefits I mean it's not going to have look at that it does not exist interesting that is interesting uh so yeah if you need performance I mean uh in in those things you are not going to have burst in the job system which are definitely massively uh beneficial things great things uh for Unity but yeah just using a data oriented design just using anti component system that by itself is probably going to give you quite a lot of benefits uh finishing total World liberation of nut course is done I don't know the plan is later on this year so I don't know when that will be okay so anyway so this looks interesting I'll definitely have to research this uh a little bit but yeah it is interesting how the NT gets baked but then stops existing so yeah Will look into that cuz yeah I didn't know that I could store something inside of here so that might might do some interesting refactoring to figure out how to make that work but anyways Ah that's kind of the issue with live streams I get too uh enthusiastic entering questions and all kinds of things that I didn't forget to do some actual work so okay let me finally do a hord and hey AR Studio hey thanks for becoming a channel member all right that's nice thanks is not the only approach to have a hoard enemies like in the millions probably unless you want to uh write your own super fast multithread code super fast rendering code and so on if you use dots yeah that's probably going to uh save that by quite a little bit okay so let me think so I want to spawn a horde so what am I going to do let me just uh do something super basic okay so let me spawn a new empty game object holiday hordes let me go inside the authoring component and make some kind of horde authoring components and I also sometimes get setrack during our streams yeah that is that is the issue that always happens uh Baker Baker of The Horde authoring and on here for the just called hord like component data okay and I don't know what do I want to have on there so for this one what I want uh on the horde I want to have some kind of flow three for the spawn position oh pirate software is being a game jam oh I didn't know that interesting July next year that is nice uh Flo three not found let me add it uh okay so I need some kind of Spawn position then I need some kind of end for the spawn amount some kind of thing and I think that's really it because then I'm going to spawn them and in theory they should automatically go towards the HQ so it should go like that just talk to us rather than working on a project trying to do both at the same time which is a little bit tricky but yeah uh okay so for the spawn position let me put that as a game object or transform for the spawn position and the spawn Mount is like that sure then add a component onto this entity and new hoard and put something so for the spawn amount authoring do spawn amount and for the spawn position authoring do spawn position do position okay so that should give me enough data then obviously I want to spawn it at some some time and I don't want to SP okay so let me put a float for the uh spawn timer and then just make sure it only spawns in so uh I'll the spawn something like this say for the spawn timer spawn timer oh crap spawn timer authoring do spawn timer okay and the already spawn equals authoring already spawn all right okay I think that's all the data that I need for that one let me just add it and see uh word me add the for authoring okay for the spawn position let me add another game object for the for spawn position except I spawned it outside let me put it over there and now let me figure out where am I going to put this where are you here go down there all right let's spawn a horde way over there off to the side so some like over there nice uh so that's the horde spawn position let me go inside the horde and drag the reference for down okay 4 the spawn amount let our small just 10 of them 4 the spawn timer after 5 seconds and nope not already spawn okay great how script object work with entity I mean they works by the same thing meaning you can access them anywhere so for example I've had the while ago when I was was uh trying out this one so you can access a script M object from inside of this although of course a script object is not a component so you can't use a standard uh for each in order to do query and all kinds of things but yeah you can access it you could even you could have for example all this logic inside a jobs something that is super fast and then just outside grab the scriptable object do whatever you want with it pass whatever that you want to the uh to the thing itself and yeah so it does work uh quite a bit cannot think of more yeah I guess it is a a bit of a different hord but yeah I guess so um okay going to L mode going to work on my Unity code animation oh nice oh yeah and the syntax salor oh I saw yeah I saw that on Twitter that that looks nice how do you handle the colors that must be quite tricky to identify what is a function what is a thing in order to do did you use some kind of third party library or did you make your own cuz yeah being able to basically wrri in code in order to identify this is a function this is a parameter this is something that sounds super complex so yeah what's your favorite CNC game I mean I loved as a kid I loved redler 2 and then growing up I love generals so that was kind of my my two I think I still played the original Red Alert very long time ago although I don't think I played the original command conquer I think that one came out in what like the end of the 80s Comm man and Conquer your's Revenge yeah I played that one for a little bit uh when's the what is this yeah generals is definitely still awesome nowadays when was this oh the first one was in 95 was it the First Command and Conquer yes so they made Dune which I never I never actually play that oh it was 95 I thought it was a bit older interesting then R in 96 wow just the the year afterwards that was crazy the T series that was so strange R ying a crap not that uh yeah the uh U Revenge that was definitely an interesting one so when was generals out oh it was in 2K3 all right yeah generals is awesome then zero how was also awesome then I don't think I ever played uh command conquer 4 and three just played for a little bit so yeah releasing a game in just a year yeah that is definitely quite insane especially one one of these an RTS game back in the days when there were no tools yeah doing that from 95 to 96 that is quite a lot yeah 3 was great yeah I've seen the the uh Clips uh well I don't know if I can play this on stream where I won't get uh the perfect well I can't really listen to it myself because I don't have the headphones I'm escaping to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism space oh man that is that's just crazy use that clip oh nice yeah I mean if you're making a game then uh yeah using lips for from command conquer that is always hilarious yeah that's definitely definitely one of the best parts about the games is the very silly uh liveaction things yeah that was definitely quite fun what general sermons oh I didn't know there were in general sermons that is interesting an incremental fast syntax parser so it Highlights better than most IDs without the problem with the language server which is often slow oh that is interesting that sounds quite complex General soundtracks were good yeah they were really good actually found uh uh yeah there you go so if you want to listen that I found this randomly the other day and then just listen to it nonstop really awesome so yeah if you like the music which I agree it is really awesome see like definitely go on and and watch that really awesome the original m music being played really cool really nice okay okay let me finally do a little bit of work okay so I've got the hord spawn then I've got the uh some kind of hord Spawn system so let me create a new entity I system for the hard spawn system okay so now on this one I don't really need the on create don't really need theond destroy all this all right so on this one do a system API do a query query for what for the ref RW for The Horde component is that the only one that I need maybe uh doing a for each ref r w hord or the hord do I just need this one that seems way too easy but yeah I guess so so basically on The Horde I've got the uh value RW for the spawn timer count that down by System api. time. the time okay so I count it down and if that one if it is under zero then let me check if this one or actually no so uh if the wh. Val r o do is what did I call it already spawn if that already spawn then break or continue cuz I guess I should be able to have multiple hord places hey Arian good evening uh okay so count down the spawn timer and over here I want to spawn and then for spawning let me remember the zombie building what did I call it I don't remember that's kind of the issue with the uh uh with dots is way too many scripts it's kind of hard to remember where did I place all the logic uh just trying to remember how did I handle the spawning yep there you go just grabbing my entities references and then spawning it and then yeah got to get a command buffer actually did I yeah I did get that one okay good so get the command buffer and then I'm basically just going to spawn all the zombies yeah so this one is all that so yep should be that simple so I'm going to spawn a bunch of them so for anti under let's go inside the whore. the value r o. spawn amount i++ spawn all of these and I'm going to spawn them inside the spawn positions so so for the local transform let me add M transforms and go inside the horde value r o and the spawn position I should probably add some Randomness instead of having them spawn literally from the same place and at the same time okay I'm going to have to add some kind of okay I'm going to need to add some kind of logic for spawning at different times but okay save mod three for a spawn position and this is the the spawn position okay and local transform that from the spawn position all right oh now I don't want the random walking so I literally just want to spawn it right I think so I think so except right now I think this is going to have an issue okay now why am I oh cuz I can spawn but then adding components that was the thing that was causing a structural change so that is why I use the N command buffer although actually which one is the better approach should I just instantiate it over here directly or instantiate can't I yeah I can okay so I don't know which one is supposed to be the better option spawn it right here or spawned on the command buffer but uh either way so this should be working let me just put it with very few things just to see if it is indeed spawning down to the hordes uh let me Spawn spawn timer five let me Spawn just five just like that okay where's my where's my horde spawn position right there okay so let's see if they spawn after 5 Seconds should spawn something 1 2 3 4 5 there you go oh boy oh boy I forgot okay stop stop stop that was way too many all right yeah obviously I forgot to set the already spawned I kind of have to do that otherwise they're going to spawn forever so let's make sure to stop that okay so now it should spawn just five just five zombie instead of 5,000 so hopefully that should be a little bit better um yeah a bit of a stack Overflow I guess when 6.0 will be released officially if I had to guess I would say right around there you go yeah they spawn great five of them right guess I would say Unity unite which is happening which by the way they actually they actually just uh launched registration and I'm pretty sure right now I can actually say that they have invited me so I won't be there at unite so if any of you are also there it would be would be fun I hear a dog yeah he woke up and it's his paws on the floor makes a lot of s makes a lot of noise so so yeah if any of you are also going to unite Versona Spain on September something that should be fun hey Danny yeah it would be nice to really nice to see you again uh so yeah if any of you are going September and yeah I'm guessing that uh Unity 6 that version I'm guessing won be out either by then before then or shortly after so yeah if I had to guess on the final release that would be around that uh okay so yeah so this one is spawning but they are not going for the HQ even though I already did the HQ attacking system what did I call it what did I call what did I call enemy attack HQ system there you go Sly have no means of getting to Spain yeah thankful for me it's actually pretty close so it should be like a 1 hour plane right so thankfully that should be uh should be a fast uh fast flight get there and it should be fun so no issues with jent leg and so on I see use I system more than system Bank yep as far as I know you should ideally do use I system as much as possible and only use system base when you can't use it but I have to say it's been a while since I've read documentation on that so I'm not 100% certain on what are the differences but yeah as far as I know it's like that because basically right now I'm pretty sure I've used I system on literally everything that I've written so far so I'm not entirely sure what are the things that I can't do inside of an nice system that I can do on a system base but that may also be due to the fact that right now I'm still on the on the Prototype and I still haven't uh haven't done anything with jobs and so on so I'm just runting regular code and then I will and then I'll will make it but yeah so far just using I systems and yeah it seems to be going uh quite well okay what was I doing all right the uh attacking the enemies okay if you have an netive Target ignore and I think the issue over here yep exactly with none Patron positions and I'm pretty sure that I had the patron position to all of them by default so let me go inside my where are my zombies my zombies my enemy my zombie prefab cuz this one should not have a patron position yeah I shouldn't have this one on that one so oh by the way Danny since you're here is there an issue with using a native array inside a inside a component cuz that was something that I thought I couldn't do but then I was able to do it so I have no idea if it is something that I should be doing or not like for example over here on my grid system in order to generate the the uh flow field I basally have an array in order to cach on different flow Fields so flow field on index a goes into this position on index B goes into this one and so on so yeah is this something that I can do storing native array directly inside an i component is it because I'm not sure because initially when I started doing this I was making yes I no you can do it it just won't work in a job nor can you use component lookups on that compon components okay interesting if that's the limitations that I don't think it's a problem so I can't use it in a job yeah I don't think that's a problem CU I still haven't converted this into jobs but when I do yeah basically I will make one job for each of this grid single as opposed to being a job it will be a normal job as opposed to an enties job so so yeah I guess if those are the two Elations then yeah I guess this one works get Singleton to get the component yeah because I have just one uh object that has the grid system data and then inside that one has the multiple grids this case has 50 grids for 50 different flow fields that are cached and then each of those has the grid single which has the array of the entities and does all the logic so okay so yeah so good to know because yeah I'm pretty sure that I don't need to put this one inside the job I just need to grab the grid signal individually so hopefully all right great so that is good cuz yeah cuz previously what I was doing is basically basically what I'm what I'm still doing over here on the uh on the patrol positions which is I just hardcoded like 10 different grids so I just had a mountain of copy pasted code basically for each grid for grid zero grid one grid two grid three and so on hey hey Danny hey how's it going uh yeah so I basally was copy pasting a lot of that because I assume that I couldn't use a native array directly inside a component and I tried it and it worked so yeah that does help simplify things as opposed to having for example this I need to refactor this one to use a native array instead of having a mountain of positions and then doing all that if I can use an array then that would simplify this code by quite a little bit so yeah so yeah great to know that it does uh it does actually work that is nice what's a dots unity game dots is the data oriented technology sack do they have the nice page basically if you want to do things insanely fast then yeah go ahead and do it fix list is the thing oh interesting so what is the difference between a fixed list and an array because a native array is already fixed right what is a uh a fixed list oh you've got a fixed number of bytes all right okay that's interesting so I can put something on there where and manage so I can put components like a grid object that's on the grid system do grid object in theory I can have a list of 128 bytes okay that is that is interesting for raise you can attach Dynamic buffer yeah I'm using that for for some things like for queuing up the units to be spawned from some kind of from the barracks I'm using a dynamic buffer in order to do all those but yeah okay so fix list that sounds interesting I'll have to look into it yeah I'm not learning that I mean if you want massive performance then dots is really unbeatable so if you want that then it is complex but definitely worth it to learn so anyways okay so I've got the patrol positions and he's obviously doing this uh uh okay so all right let me just solve that one issue basically the issue is uh it's not running on the patrol positions and um so I think the only issue is I just want one of these enemies so I think it's this one that is meant to be walking around okay so this one is good let me copy this component get rid of it from the prefab itself so they don't all have Patrol positions automatically okay so get rid so they don't have it then this one let me add it just onto this one there you go so now this one has no on that one so that should work have t make a simple game using dots yep that is also something I very much would like to do make something like Flappy Bird something super simple super fast in just a couple of hours make it that would be a fun project okay so logic is working I just need to add the other CU I don't want all of these guys to attacking the HQ cuz they're supposed to be randomly walking only the ones over here only the ones on The Horde only those are supposed to be going okay so let meia that is actually thankfully it's super simple uh the enemy attack HQ system with all with none let me just add some thing just to make it a little bit more readable oh by the way Denny if you're still here I have another question which is what do I do if I have a query that has more than seven uh components cuz that is an issue that that I encountered which was quite tricky because from what I've read from the uh from the uh update on the dots road map apparently aspects are eventually going away at some point so I'm not sure what is the current recommend solution if I want to use more than seven components oh component lookup okay that might indeed be the answer okay thank you yeah although I assume that is going to be less uh efficient but yeah because I had a bunch on the I think it was on the unit mover system where thankfully I was able to get rid of some of them where I was yeah just over here like in order to make it work I need all of these because I I'm using a bunch of uh enable references I need a bunch of thing in order to make all this work so yeah once I got to the point where I added one more I had like an uh an extra unit and and yeah it suddenly everything broke and I saw that the limit over here on the query was really just for seven of them so yeah I guess that's a component lock up you yeah okay so good it's less less efficient but I guess that would indeed work well all right so yeah thanks uh okay so we're here with none Patrol positions and with none of the random walking I also don't want you to run that what's a query basically all the entities they have components attached to them them and the query basically checks for certain amount of components like a certain entity uh a certain group of components like component entity the component Target position and so on basically gives you all the entities that have those components so like for example over here this is the uh the system for attacking for the enemy attacking the HQ and over here I'm doing a system API I'm doing a query and I'm querying for um I'm I want to grab the local transform so that's basically the transform component I want to grab the unit if over here I'm actually not using it this is the one that has the uh data for the uh unit type and so on I'm grabbing the target which is how I Define what object I'm going to Target I'm going to attack the target position which is basically how do I move the unit and unit events that's just the way that I'm handling events so basically this one is going to do a cycle through every single entity that has all of these components if it does not have one of these and is not included and like it says here with a bunch more filtering so those need to make sure to not have Patron positions and not have random walking so basically the issue that I was having was that the uh zombies that were spawning instead of walking randomly they were going towards the HQ but now that I add the with none and nope it is still going why are I still going did I not save it I did save it okay do you not have the random walking you do uh okay what okay I'm not entirely sure why it's see random walking right that's what I called it I am pretty sure so where are those going that's strange can I actually click on the entity can I inspect the entity in some way oh crap this is opening that one yeah this is the tricky thing about spawn enties is clicking to select them is quite tricky this one is basically selecting the mesh but I have no idea which one so I got to figure out okay well I guess it's one of these spawned ones uh run time and does this one have yeah does have the random walking component okay so I'm not entirely sure as why are this is see Rand the walking did I make this enable nope they are in Tech range are they I'm pretty sure they're not cuz if I if I stop this one yeah if I just stop this system from running I'm pretty sure they won't actually attack so that is oh yeah there you go they are walking randomly okay that's a bit Str uh so they are walking randomly why are they being okay now I'm not sure no cuz if I disable this one then they they move around randomly so why is this one so I put wi none random walking yeah I'm pretty sure this is meant to be an end so that's a bit strange uh with empty exis empty entity let do on this entity right query no B query te more doing a query of a query tangling through queries are you talking about as a way of having more more types uh okay so this is really strange what am I missing here uh hey we spawning like for example 1 14 2 3 yeah it is spawning this one some Star Wars language is it I mean if you know generics if you know I mean just the it just uh formatted in a bit of a strange way just because there's a lot of things but yeah but why is this one running I'm not sure why this one like what am I missing here but they all have random walking so with none won't return anything because they all have one yeah those are not supposed to be moving towards the HQ so this is very strange so if I go inside the system API that has component has component random walking in theory this should be false because entities with random walking should not be inside of this query so that is strange okay okay so now I'm not too sure s do naturally care about the amount of generic just haven't added any yeah I guess it would be nice to add like 20 component either that to the aspects I mean again the only reason why I'm not using aspects is because I read on the uh on the uh road map that apparently they're not going to exist for very long or they're going to change massively so I don't want to do that but yeah it should be able to add their own query okay good that would be good um thought looks hard I mean any sort of game development is always hard when you're trying to do something uh but yeah that's definitely part of the process yeah over here I have no idea why this one why do I have with none but then it is running things that have am I missing something no it's with none exactly oh never mind okay I'm stupid sorry I'm pretty sure it's because you can't have multiple things so it should be a comma here oh god oh there you go that's how you find out when you make something stupid a dumb mistake and it just happens oh boy yeah it's that simple apparently you can have multiple with with none if you want you put that and you add all the things that you want to not include now I'm guessing right now it won't work correctly or maybe I'm not okay so now I'm even more confused okay I thought I finally got it but nope now I'm still even confused okay I really thought I I really thought I had the answer there but I have no idea it's I'm doing with none do looks confusing now yeah it's always uh changing but seriously why what if I had just with none with wait the no is the one an and no it it's it's an or isn't it well now I don't know okay this one is try with none before with all okay does the order matter it shouldn't matter I'm guessing because with done random walking okay nope there they go still what on Earth is going on huh wait never mind wait what okay now I'm extremely confused only now I noticed this one was returning false So in theory it says that guy does not have the component but he does have the component what in the world oh no so apparent so apparently the query is correct but this is not cor what okay I have to say I am very very confused okay so the query is saying so this one is saying false meaning this one does not have the component which makes sense to be running here but it does have the component am I running this on something else no entity yeah let me go spawn one okay so for example this one 1013 something to can I search 101 three oh crap do I have to manually yeah cuz it doesn't have that name so it won't be one of these so 101 332 then one that one wait there's no 332 or did it die let me spa another one wait now it's going for for the same one no it's only for different ones yeah why are you saying that is maybe going for the child okay let me make this a little bit easier to do for the um zombie building no building zombie spawner what do I call it building zombie spawner system uh spawn a zombie sure fine then let me go system API do what is it called set name or is there not here state. entity manager set name set name on this entity on the zombie entity zombie underscore and then put some kind of uh engine random range between 0o and 10 and two three okay so that should give it a random name which should be a little bit easier to actually I don't know if logging it will wa read chat whatevered in chat my inner demons yeah a lot of things me like I said it's own part of the part of the process kind of goes like that cuz you have a return in the if I have a return in the if what if what on the enemy attack system you mean this one no the building does exist so this is uh running uh let me see did you spawn oh crap because it's spawned but it's still okay so I got to go into the system API not system API state. entity manager get the name get the name of this entity okay let me print out this one instead of the entity name so that I can actually find it cuz yeah this is really confusing me because the entity does have the component am I adding the component to like some child object instead of the actual object itself okay why are you saying enemy okay there you go so there's a zombie 8384 8384 8384 There You Go zombie 8384 so this one is an entity and if I go inside of it and if I scroll down there you go it does have the random walking what in the world let's go okay okay I have to say I have no idea what is going on here so like this one is saying that entity does not have a random walking component and that is why it goes oh wait okay I think I I think I figured out the issue I I think it's an ordering issue because when I spawn the zombies I'm using an anti command buffer in order to add the component but that only happens afterwards so I'm guessing this one is happening in between spawning and that one so once this one happens that one does not have that component it only gets it afterwards but as soon as it does it gives it the target entity Target position so it starts moving on there on the next one gets out of the thing so on okay so I think I I think I figured out the issue now let me think how do I make this work oh crap okay so I think I figured out the issue but now what is the solution B I want this one to only run on like the next frame cuz see I'm only adding it on the end of it I mean technically I can make it run after that yeah I could make it run after the insulation but I don't know that feels a little bit dirty but at least you to verify that this is indeed the issue type of and like this if my theory is correct then now this will be correct that random manage type are you talking about on the random walking I'm using the uh Unity mathematics random and zombie or you can't okay so I don't know but on this one oh I put this one on update before the transform system group huh that's a tricky problem but I do think this is the issue right when does the uh command buffer system when does the N component I guess maybe here well let me try making a um how do I create a command buffer I think I don't remember how do I make a manual command buffer do I do it like that or do I just do a new on it I think I just do a you on it so in theory I can do this and I can do playback on the state. en manager so if I do a playback on that one that one is supposedly going to run just like that see human Dev just like us go through the stages of grief yep absolutely I mean always keep in mind whenever you watch watch one of my videos or one of anyone's video tutorials always keep in mind what you're watching is after all the frustration so like that there you go the logic does work so yeah that was the issue okay okay that was the issue that was uh the problem but okay great so yeah that was definitely a strange a strange problem but yeah so basically the issue was they were indeed adding they were indeed getting the random walking component as expected but they were getting it on the end of the frame so this one was being spawned but only add the random walking down here whereas this system this system was running in between both of those and when this one was running that one still did not have the random walking so that is why this one was running this one was giving it the target position so that is why they started moving towards the HQ and then when it gets out of the random walking that script is going to basically ignore if it already has a Target so since it already has a Target it ignored the random walking and continued moving towards the HQ so a very simple issue to do with ordering and right now yep it does work and those guys yeah the ones from The Horde the ones that are supposed to go to D toq the ones that do not have the ren walking yep they do go all right okay that was definitely tricky that was definitely a very tricky problem but look at that we found a solution so that was that was fun that was interesting uh okay let me just add a timer over here on the uh so let me do both let me do a hoorde spawn timer and a uh individual or zombie spawn timer like spawn each timer kind of like that and then up there let's put both them so instead of just one zomb timer have both those so you've got the horde spawn timer and the zombie spawn timer okay and then on this one instead of spawning them all at once so for the hord spawn timer go down yeah if you are already spawned you okay actually don't need that one but sure anyways uh so if the hord spawn timer if it is under zero then I'm going to go into the hord do Val r o and I'm going to check the spawn amount I'm assuming this one is always going to be above zero so let's put that one like that and then that one equals that one under zero and now it is going to spawn just these three okay and I need to reset the hord spawn timer so let me actually do a horde spawn zombie spawn timer Max what keyboard do you have uh I always forget what is the name of this what is the name of this yeah open it he go it's the g950 15 then the camera that's this one c99 the microphone CTI and the Pro Wireless just randomly ended up with all log all Logitech stuff it wasn't intentional but yeah it end up like that and all this all great equipment so yeah if you like it yeah uh what was I doing so the zombie spawn timer zombie spawn timer Max yeah just randomly became a Logitech Fanboy like unintentionally just end up buying stuff watching reviews and turns out they make great stuff so that is why uh people do that so you count down if that one is down for the hard spawn timer right so now going to countown not the hard spawn timer but the zombie spawn timer count it down and now if this one if this one is under Zer F then that is what I'm going to spawn it so I'm going to put this one equals This One Max need to put value r w then I count down the spawn amount then I either keep spawning or stop spawning okay so let's see if this one is now spawning quite a lot of things loads better stuff than Logitech I mean so far I'm quite happy with what I've got so yeah I don't know I'm sure that uh some people who are really into keyboards would probably find something better but for me uh as long as it works it works I mean my previous keyboard was like 20 years old and I only swapped it just because is literally died like the cable literally uh snapped off stop stopped working if it wasn't for that I would still be using my 20yearold keyboard so yeah for me if it writes then it writes it's more than good enough so okay so for the uh spawn five of them after 5 seconds and spawn one per second and one per second okay so let's see if it is going to spawn a bunch of wait where is the no over there let's see after five seconds there you go one after one second two three four five and no more nice all right cool that worked that was cool so it spawn a bunch of them now let me just add some Randomness can I add some Randomness Randomness is always tricky in in dots because you you have to you have to define the random inside of it so on the hord othering see if I if I remember how to do it so a random for that one wait did you isn't it called random oh it's random wait isn't it what is the random random walking what did I use yeah t. mathematics. random isn't this one okay oh it's ambiguous okay makes sense in. mathematics. random like that and up here oh that is actually going to be huh the issue about that one uh maybe not best explanation NY command buffer s way of queuing up commands to run later in the frame yep that is that is an excellent explanation that is exactly what the anti command buffer does it cues up commands to be executed later on either later in the frame or later after doing some things like on the issue that I was having basically the issue was this one was being spawned but then it was only running the in command buffer at the end of frame so that is why it was being messed up so basically the solution is I just made it run intentionally over here right after this script so instead of waiting until the end of the frame it runs here but yeah basically the N command buffer just cues up some commands so add a component set a component instead of doing it directly over here which would cause an error because this is inside an entities for each instead of that just que up all the commands and then play them back afterwards and doing that it makes it work uh okay so for this one for the random new random except well right now I just have one horde so this should work so if I go inside the hord spawn system I've got the hord and let me get the uh horde Val rw. random random let's grab a next float three oh Direction I didn't know there was a direction well that's fun uh so a FL three random Direction equals Zone and for the spawn Position will be the spawn position plus the random Direction multipli by a random distance so float random distance that one let's get a next float a random between say two and 10f something like this random Distance multipli by that and now it should spawn on a slightly random Place although I think this one is going to cause issues if I remember when I did this it did cause some issues so I do need to grab the random grab that random CU I'm pretty sure I had an issue with this one previously so let me grab that one do that then I do that and then I go back inside the hord component grab the value RW and set the random equals the updated random now that should work and it should be spawning random things uh is meth. random different from system and unity engine. random Yep this one is specifically made to work with dots the job system and all of that stuff so yeah when working in dots world you should be using the random inside of the uh mathematics Library okay so there it is after 5 seconds and now they should spawn on a slightly random position except there's an error why is there an error not been properly initialized what do I have to give it a a seed I assume so right now let's give it a fixed value and then do something I have had issue because made a copy of random Sate yep that's exactly what I had previously I was it was when I was making the random walking component and it was always randomly walking to the same position specially because that specially because I was not updating the random component it's always the tricky things about working with structs instead of classes references instead of not referen oh come on seed must be non zero okay fine all right there you go that should work uh oh it's ignoring an invalid I didn't even notice that is why that did not fix itself let me find that warning uh ignoring invalid update after because or course last has iron precedence okay I'm not sure but either way I found the solution on the other one but yeah so apparently that one because the order first order and last is higher oh I'm guessing that one is set as order last so you can't put anything after the last okay all right that's that's good to know that's nice so if I go now let's see after 5 Seconds it should spawn some units somewhere around there and yep there you go spawn there and then one spawn there and then one spawn there and then one spawn there all right nice awesome so yep they are indeed spawning at different times at different places so now if I were to oh I guess I can also put the uh uh let's put a only Flo Wait no that's not this one uh where am I the hord authoring for the uh Flo two spawn position min max min max distance probably makes more sense and then up here on this one spawn position min max distance this one authoring do spawn position min max distance okay and now on The Horde spawn system on this one instead of using fixed values let's go inside the horde value r o and the spawn position in max distance and this one is going to be the X and then the Y okay so that one is going to spawn a random thing so I use 210 now let me just try spawning like 100 zombies and then see what that is going to work go inside the horde uh so for minimum of 10 maximum of was like 20 so let's put 50 for spawn timer after 5 Seconds spawn every1 second wait .1 second uh and I'm going to want to spawn like 100 zombies okay so let's see if the horde does spawn 100 zombies you were hired to work in unity and was given the choice to work on anything you wanted what would you change about Unity that is a great question and I don't know I mean if I worked at Unity I would love to work on the dot team directly I think that would be quite fun that should be some real interesting challenges with that that's the the issue that I have with the flow field I still have to to fix that one uh but yeah if I work that Unity I would love to work directly on the dot team I think that should be a fun thing I'm a big fan of performance making things run fast so yeah I would love to work on that team building these things and it's nice so yeah oh Jason sorry is here is he I didn't see oh there he is hey Jason hey how's it going oh wasn't sending dots from anyone till you point out the unity Japan channel oh yeah they do have some really awesome ones yeah and you'd be my coworker yeah that would be fun is he do seam physical or is it all remote that would be nice that would be fun uh all right so yeah so this worked okay so that's fun so I basally the big problem right now is I just need to cat the flow field cuz basically uh the units are always going to go towards the uh the uh HQ so that one I need to cash that FL field as opposed to always having these because basally the issue right now is that I have a limited number of flow fields and there you go see how those are now going to the different place that is because they got a different flow field but at the same time yeah at the same time they're always going to the HQ so they're always repeating the uh same thing and they end up going straight on there but yeah so yeah got to cash out a specific full film just for going to the the HQ but other than that yeah the logic is indeed working The Horde spawns it goes in and they are attacking this little HQ oh and they are rotating around yeah I got to got to fix that there you go the HQ is down the HQ could not could not hold on that was interesting FL field solution use portals or whatever they are called I'm not sure what you mean you mean like literally portals teleporting from one place to the other cuz nope flow field is very basic just walking if you can do it uh it can go there if not then nope let start working on some sering agent stff last week oh nice that is cool yeah nice yeah I was working on some collision avoidance uh early today something super basic but yeah working on Flow field has been an interesting challenge it is something that I had never never worked on previously so it was my first time actually implementing it and I'm quite happy with how it came out it actually works out quite nicely so yeah it's uh it's fun yeah yeah Johnny his video on Flow Fields was really useful for getting a rough idea for how the whole thing works so yeah it's a it's been a fun challenge learning to work on this and doing all of this a bunch of units or is in splitting the space into big grids oh uh no I haven't looked into that but yeah that is definitely something that I would like to look into in order to be able to have some really giant uh giant uh pathf finding Maps I think that would be fun in code yeah what happened to that channel I don't know it's been a long time since I've seen them so yeah Bas on top of FS yep I again that's another thing that I've never actually implemented myself having a giant pathf finding map that is composed of different pathf finding Maps I've never actually implemented that but from what I know yep it is exactly like that you have those have entry and exit points and then you basically calate the a star from the giant maps onto the target map and then the individual Asar inside each of them going from the entry point to the exit point and so on so yeah there's definitely an interesting Challenge and something that I would like to would like to implement if I can find the time cuz that would be quite fun init spawn in building yeah right now they are spawning literally inside of it and then move outside although it still looks uh quite nice so yeah got a bunch of zombies and they're avoiding those walls over there even though that one isn't I'm guessing that one is uh cuz yeah there's the issue where the zombies are randomly walking around and sometimes they randomly walk on top of a wall and obviously that does break quite a lot of things yeah want to say thank you for what you do you didn't me course help me so much that's awesome hey I'm glad my I'm glad my videos have found you that's nice yeah great to catch a stream yeah right at the end because my voice is messed up my dogs are waking up so yeah it's going to uh just a little bit more and yeah oh Charles left the internet oh really I hope nothing bad happened that was a it was a fun Channel it was very interesting over here I got my units Spa all of them all of you go here take all the zombies even though the zombies actually don't remember if I implemented the health system on the on the buildings so can I actually can I take out the buildings go a littleit oh I can nice so I can eradicate all the zombies just go easy slowly bit by bit you go above there there you go just with this the uh prototype already has some nice RTS mechanics kind of working so I can control a bunch of them move each Squad up one by one go on don't die woo nice okay keep going in another thing I still haven't looked into is do Dot support uh thing oh by the way Danny if you're still here is that an issue with spawning lights cuz from what I've seen lights are basically I'm spawning a light every time one of these units fires they spawn a light and then destroy it and from what I'm seeing it seems to be working quite well Bon should keep going if the enem is that yep that is definitely on my to list uh see I'm spawning lights with from what I've seen lights are kind of like a companion component with uh so in theory I think they're not 100% entities so I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it but so far it is working quite well even when I've got a bunch of them shooting quite a lot oh yeah I forgot I can actually use the towers are the towers working actually don't remember if the towers are working uh yeah for spawning the lights I don't know if I'm supposed to be able to do that or not but so far it does work quite well so they shoot and they do that can make AIO using empty I don't know that is one of the topics that I have yet to research so I don't know but yeah so for all those spawning the uh lights and I don't know apparently it does work uh I turn companion objects meaning they won't create the game object every time you spawn them and destroying will use a cleanup to remove okay that's interesting so in theory I guess for that I should so is there no way of using lights directly inside entities so I guess if not I guess the answer is using a classic uh object pulling I would assume so use Supreme Commander to full Fields yep that's uh pretty much you actually can oh can you so they have to be fixed or something for this one I am spawning them where am I spawning on the shoot uh shoot light prefab where am I using this one the shoot light prefab where am I using this one uh yeah it's on the shoot attack system so basically just instantiating the prefab with light and yeah apparently does it do spawn the component so yeah manage API the engine something do light Oh you mean for quering something with lights so but for spawning is there a better way than this so basically I got my shoot light prefab inside my en's reference I've got the shoot light prefab and it is literally just a just a light that's it just as a normal light component and then just has a script that destroy it afterwards so down here this one oh why is this so slow uh so basically just has the timer and then destroys itself but so for spawning a where was I so is there a better way of doing this or not in order to spawn a light object directly in inside of it now I'm thinking how would I one is all good on R but if you want to query for it you can use the above sniping H I mean yeah I don't think I need to query CU for querying basically I'm using this uh authoring component order to count down the timer so I don't necessarily need to query them I would just I mean I still haven't encountered any issu so I don't know if this is an issue at all or not but yes you can do it to get the light but is there an issue with spawning cuz I'm guessing in the final game if I got like 100 soldiers all firing at once if it is a 100 game objects being created and destroyed I'm guessing that is going to cause a little bit of a bottleneck so but if lights cannot be created just in dots world just in ECS world if so then yeah I guess the anyways I guess I won't I won't see that if slash when I eventually see that it does become an issue oh this one isn't the shoot light just see the component what why is this one not does it only convert at real time okayy why is this one not showing up save lood okay there you go yeah so use the companion companion link transform and so on and does have a light component okay that's interesting nice so yeah definitely profiling to figure out if I need to use classic object ping but I guess if I do need to that should be pretty simple so yeah if that is indeed an issue then should be fun interesting discussion on finary search trees trees are criminally under disc in a lot of game dep tutorials that is probably right I've used them whenever I need them like when I've done some pathfinding in order to find the closest the shortest path or whatever it was it's been a long time since I did it but yeah when I wanted to make some super fast path finding I definitely used uh some really nice binary trees in order to find it and it was insanely harmful so yeah I guess if we got a lot of searching problems then that can be super useful too all right so yeah so my my dogs are already sounds like the opportunity for a video oh yeah I would definitely watch a video on how to implement binary search trees on in unity cuz I don't think that Unity actually has a or doesn't I don't think it does I think I've searched for uh binary search trees and didn't there was something on GitHub but it wasn't uh anti binary search tree I'm pretty sure there was oh no it was it was another one uh yeah there was something that I found which I don't know what is difference isn't there some yeah KD tree I'm pretty sure this is something which now I don't remember what is the difference between what is a KD tree what is a standard binary search tree something like that oh did coding train do a video on oh did they I love that channel oh then oh nice I'm going to add this to my to watch list cuz that is definitely very nice put on there watch afterwards and yeah uh basically usually make either a kitty tree or bstd they are tradeoffs to the cost of adding or removing interesting that is interesting yeah coding train is definitely really awesome I wish I had that presentation skill level of enthusiasm the guy is definitely Natural Born teacher like the videos are extremely engaging entertaining educational really perfect really excellent all right quries yeah that's not so interesting okay so yeah so my dogs really want to go and I also really want to go it's been about 2 hours so I think that's going to be it uh yeah managed to do a bunch of things and thanks Danny and all of you for answering all kinds of questions that did help quite a lot in learning about a bunch of things and solving some bugs live on stream always fun fun always fun so that people know that I'm definitely not perfect what you see in the final videoos after I've gone through all of that all that part doing all those things so yeah uh it is fun we're talking about that yeah nice that is cool uh okay all right so let me just put it like this and put that and it's going to be that uh all right so yeah thank you all so much for joining me I hope I hope it was interesting conversation is definitely quite interesting the recommendation start using ultimate editor enhancer well now I'm curious what is that I'm curious to see ultimate editor enhancer don't take what is it ultimate editor enhancer look that that's the old uh Pro Builder demo scene that's fun the ultimate productivity toolkit simplifies your workflow builtin behaviors and so on all right thanks for the tip I will look at this in a little bit does look interesting oh there you go a nice review all right that that's good I guess so I guess that does work uh so perfectly documented that's always fun that's always good lot of tools navigation project scene wow doesn't look like it has quite a lot of things the tool box of tiny features things like auto save all the way up to list of selections all right that does sound quite interesting all right I don't think I've ever seen it so that's a bit strange I check the assur all the time yeah I guess it wasn't is it a recent thing no version three so nope all right so no idea why I haven't seen it but yeah this does look quite interesting all right so yeah I got to get going so then I'm going to watch this so yeah thanks for the tip uh okay hit Hugo on The Game Dev show I don't know what is did Jason change the schedule I think so I think this time was like on Saturday or something yeah I'll have to I definitely would love to join someday but yeah as you can see my live streams are all pretty random they happen randomly uh they happen randomly every once in a while that's because my schedule is always very random very different very strange so yeah I definitely would love to join someday that would be fun uh all right so let me just put that one that one is correct that want set up it's all like that oh he had a personal thing oh okay all right interesting all right yeah that that would be fun so I'll have to figure out some way to figure out the timing and make sure that I'm home at that time all right that would be nice okay so yeah that's going to be it for me going to feed the dogs rest a little bit drink some water do a bunch of stuff so yeah uh thank you all so much for being here I hope you found this interesting and I hope you have a great rest of your week so yeah I guess I will see you all hopefully next week all right so bye everyone see you all next week byebye
