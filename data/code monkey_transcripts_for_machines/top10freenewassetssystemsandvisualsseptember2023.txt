hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey just a quick mention my game is finally coming out on Monday I'm still really hard at work on it I've been working pretty much 16 hour days these past two weeks I really want the game to be good I really hope you'll enjoy it and another thing normally I split these acid videos in three one for each type but since this month has been really intense both because of working on my game and of course the whole Unity pricing thing that really messed up my whole schedule so I merged all three in just this one video here is the list of top free assets then the systems and tools and finally visions and effects also if you need some assets there's a new home bundle with a ton of cinty aets so if you're a fan of the low poly style you've got tons of stuff here you've got the horror mention for a bunch of spooky stuff scifi C which I'm actually using a bunch of these in my own game The Heist back this one is super useful has lots of weapons and a really interesting environment one for Samurai Vikings Western apocalypse and so on as usual these bundles are always great deals so this like 97% off for just 20 bucks so if you need assets go ahead and get it okay so here are the top 10 free new assets all right so on to the top 10 list starting off with a gorgeous looking fantasy map it looks really great this could be taken straight from your Lord of the Rings game or something like that it's a modular pack with tons of pieces so lots of icons for forests mountains and so on as well as various symbols for castles quests enemies Villages and more it definitely requires our this skill to put the final map together but this is a great starting point next for an interesting tool here is a way to send emails directly from inside your Unity build like the name says this one is super simple and it includes all of the source code so this would be a great research asset if you want to see all the code behind how to manually connect to an SMTP server and send an email you can Define the subject body you can send to multiple recipients you can send HTML and even send some attachments so for example this could be great to build a feedback form directly inside your game or maybe some automated emails when something happens next for some visuals here are some nice pieces to make some gorgeous alen worlds these are simple low poly assets and you have just enough pieces to make quite a nice world you could even technically recolor it with different colors and just with this one asset pack you can make multiple worlds it comes with a demo scene preset so you can easily try it out then for another simple tool here is a missing reference finder this does exactly what the name says if you've ever seen those annoying messages in the console telling you that some game object is missing a script reference then you know it's impossible to know what object is throwing that message this to basally helps solve that just one button to search and it shows all the results nice and simple next if you're making some car game here's a nice visual pack it's got a very nice variety of cars so you have a general sedan you've got some muscle cars there's a cheap an exotic and even an F1 car these are relatively low poly so you can easily recolor them to get tons of variation then if You' like to keep a twoo list but without having to use an external website check out this one this looks extremely feature complete you can easily Define tasks that you want to do you can group them by type in any way you want you can mark them as complete or incomplete easily view the progress for each grouping and also lets you add all kinds of references so you easily know what script or what folder that task refers to if you find this one useful this dev has a pro version with a bunch of more features and up next for a nice runtime console here's one it feels like lately every month there's at least one excellent console I guess that's great for developers who want excellent free tools a console like this one is one of the most useful tools you can have this one seems to be very well built with lots of features it even includes the ability to easily add your own commands with just one simple attribute or maybe you just want a visual character if so here's a nice one with a giant hand it includes the character model as well as some animations and particle effects the proportions look a bit strange but the hand does look quite cool then if you like playing with colors here's a color palette tool you basically Define some colors you give them names and assign the color itself then you can easily swap out all the colors with one button click so for example on a multiplayer game you could have one pallet for the player one maybe something in blue and then another red color palette for player two or you can just go crazy and randomize all the colors maybe that also works and if you'd like to make a super simple internet connection check out this simple UDP tool this is a very simple implementation you've got a very very small packet SI ni you can send some unreliable data with just one bite it includes all the source codes so again this one would be great if you'd like to research and see how all this works a tool like this one can be quite useful if you're making a nongame application unity and you want to make just a simple barebones connection like perhaps just connecting your PC to your mobile phone through your local network to build perhaps some kind of interesting Electronics project okay so now on to the list of top systems and tools all right so starting off with a nice toel to add something that almost always makes your game look better it's real time Global illumination if you've ever looked at your own games and wondered why it doesn't look as good as the games you play Chances Are lighting is a big difference without Global illumination things that are in the shade are completely black but in reality light bounces so even something in the shade still has some color this tool lets you easily add Global illumination a really fast way it's easy to add fully compatible with urp you can customize everything and works on all platforms next for a simple tool to greatly improve your UI here is SDF image Unity already has a builtin outline and Shadow component but those are really basic that one is really just meant for quick prototypes it really does not look good in many scenarios whereas this one on the other hand this one looks absolutely excellent it uses stdf so the outlines are super high quality they're all extremely detailed it doesn't matter if your Sprite has rounded corners or sharp edges this looks good in every scenario you can easily tint the outline in any color you can set any thickness you want you can add shadows and set Direction you just simply use a different component and play around with all the properties in the Shader so a really simple really excellent tool I think I might get this one to polish my game thany Gardians then for a very Advanced very complex tool here is RNG needs this is the ultimate probability distribution plugin for un right away it looks really intimidating a mountain of numbers and percentages but if you're making some kind of complex RPG with tons of Loot and drop changes then you definitely do want a complex tool just like this one and despite being so complex it has custom inspectors to make it really easy to use you can easily drag some bars to Define drop rates there's no need to manually write numbers so if your game has lots of chance and drop rates and definitely get this one next if you have some projectiles and you want them to move in interesting ways check out this one you can fire projectiles in weird shapes while making them follow the path to the Target perfectly so they don't have to just go straight you can Define some weird curves for them to follow maybe you can even Define a fixed amount of time to reach a Target regardless of distance whatever settings you choose you can also predict where the projectile will go and also a projectile doesn't have to be just a bullet that can also be your player so you can see when you jump where will the player land it's quite an interesting tool if you have some idea where it involves tons of projectiles that do more than just go straight next if you're working in VR and you'd like to draw something then check out this asset it is very simple and does exactly what you expect you can pick up a bunch of pens with various colors and draw whatever you want you can use the Eraser if you make some kind of mistake optionally you can also save the image onto a file it's all using compute Shad so this is all very performant I can see this being a great addition for pretty much any VR game even if your game is something like a shooter you can just easily add this to some part of in your world to make it a tiny bit more unique then if you're working with animations and you want to avoid that transition spaghetti check out this one this is motion matching it's a different way to handle your animations instead of fixed transitions you have some Dynamic movement of your character and then the system automatically picks which animation best fits that movement so this is the kind of thing that a lot of AAA games use games like Assassin's Creed where they always have those Dynamic animations this is the kind of thing they use this can make the character feel much more natural but also sometimes looks a little bit janky way it's definitely an interesting different method if you're tired of dealing with massive amounts of transitions then maybe try this out next here's a fun and simple tool for making light poles now this is an extremely simple level building tool if your world has some kind of electrical poles you can just place them and it will automatically draw the connections it's really simple it has some Randomness so it looks a bit more natural and it seems to work pretty well you just drop the poles in your world and you don't have to worry about individually modeling all kinds of wires everything just spawns automatically all of them get connected then if you have some performance issues here's a tool to help you combine and merge meshes and materials if you have tons of unique meshes and tons of unique materials that is going to be pretty heavy on the GPU so a tool like this one merges multiple objects into just one which can be quite a massive performance boost it automatically recones UVS and creates a final texture combining all of them so with just one click you can take multiple objects and merge them into just a single one then here's one asset for all of your sensing needs basically a collection of a ton of Ray cast and different cast sens ens this looks really complex but also really capable if your game involves tons of positional logic like for example knowing if the character has a ceiling above it or perhaps if the character is near a wall or has a box in front or something doing all of those individual rast and code can be quite tricky so this tool helps to solve that it features a custom inspector so you can easily set up and enable or disable each virtual collider it features an insane amount of shapes you've got simple Rays you've got box ciders some capsules arcs radiuses even some Sight and Sound detection it's a really great tool to make it easier to manage all of your colliders and collisions then for a really simple useful tool here is a performance monitor it is very simple it does exactly what you expect you can easily monitor the frame rate the memory usage CPU and GPU how many vertices how many draw calls triangles and so on it's super easy to add you just drag and drop a prefab and that's it then you can easily view this data anywhere so this can be while playing in the editor or on a PC build or on mobile okay so now on to the list of top visions and effects all right so starting off with a gorgeous nature environment this is one of those where if you have a prototype you're working on you can just use this demo scene directly and you instantly have a great world to explore this features a nice low poly Style with some highly optimized foliage or perhaps you need some explosions if so here's a great pack they all look really gorgeous personally I love the stylized look you have some fiery explosions with lots of glow lots of fire but then you also have some that are just smoke so this could also be useful if for example your character jumps from a high position into a puddle of M you could spawn one one of these then if you're making a shooting game you probably need some pistol animations if so look at this complete pack it's an extremely complete animation pack in total it's got 65 pistol animations there's multiple shooting types you've got turn animations lots of reloads pickups and even some melee attacks you can of course then combine this with some ik to make it feel really natural next here's a really gorgeous pirate Port City just a few days ago the excellent game Shadow Gambit just came out this asset looks like it could be taken straight from that game it's got lots of modular pieces so you can build anything you like you can build various port cities or you can even build entire ships if you're making some kind of stylized part game then this is definitely the perfect pack or perhaps you're into something much more futuristic if so here is the latest CTI pack this one is all about Mech personally I really love this pack it's got lots of customization every Mac is so unique it's got tons of modular Parts you can build Macs with huge machine guns or some huge heavy swords when I first saw this pack it immediately made me want to build some kind of game with this but but I'm currently already insanely busy so perhaps maybe after I finish ninky Gardens and if you've got Mex then maybe you also want some cyber Punk characters to go along with it so look at this pack they are extremely customizable you've got tons of pieces to make essentially infinite variations with just this one pack you could randomize tons of characters and populate an entire world with hundreds of unique NPCs it's a really nice style I could also see this as a great pack for a multiplayer game with a ton of player customization then if you'd like to the Sol something here is a nice kit with a ton of the s effects everything from the standard one to dissolving with some particles you've got some dissolve with burn some that go backwards and resolve and a bunch more all of them look really great with tons of particles this one really showcased the power of the VFX W next if you're working on a 2d shooter and you need some great animated characters check out this one these are body part animation so these are not Sprite sheets because of that they look really fluid each character has 14 animations looking at this it immediately reminds me of a bunch of flash games back when I was making those I always wanted to build an animation system just like this one it's really amazing how nowadays all you have to do is just pick this one pack and you have some gorgeous 2D animations then here's another one that is also something that I've always wanted to do it's a pack with a ton of low poly gem assets personally I've always wanted to make some kind of gym tycoon game although I don't think there's a big audience for that so I never made it this one includes pretty much every single prop you could possibly need you've got various characters you've got some treadmills tons of machines and free weights it also includes lots of props for doing some martial arts if I had a time machine I would definitely pause time right now to spend 6 months making a gem tycoon game with this one pack somewhat related to that here is a myi animation pack the animations are definitely stylized they look really powerful this Dev always has some excellent animations features lots of impressive kicks punches and knees with a nice combat system and these animations you could definitely make something really special If instead of melee your game has swords then check out these sword slashes VFX lots of variation to look like all kinds of elements so you've got some that look like fire slashes some look somewhat Arcane you've got frost holy void and a bunch more it includes the slashes some lunges and some impact bfx then if you need to get a better sky for your game here is a predal generated one the demo scene looks really gorgeous it's got tons of settings so you can get it looking exactly as you want and this pack includes not just the sky box but the water as well or perhaps you're making an FPS game if so then you've probably already noticed that you need some great animations for the weapons there's tons and tons of third person animation packs but not that many in first person so this is a great one it includes 20 animated weapons alongside a first person player controller so you've got everything from rifles to shotguns to pistols and some sniper rifles if those are too realistic for you then here's a stylized pack really a massive amount of variety in total you've got 61 weapons they feature pretty much any type you can think of and since these are all low poly you could also easily recolor them then for a very unique very strange character here is a Mech wheel it's certainly very unique I've never seen anything like this it's a giant blade wheel but then it also has some spider legs this could be either a very strange enemy in your game or who knows perhaps this could even be the player character in some strange games next if all you need are just some impacts then here's a nice pack with nothing but impacts it's got 10 unique impacts with four color variations so as always it's sub to you the developer to Define what each color represents then here's a really fun one it's a bunch of generic scifi screens very unique pack I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before it's a bunch of looping videos so these are perfect to add to the background of various rooms in your games some look very scifi others look very medical or even like they belong in a detective show this definitely one of those things that really helps add polish to really make your levels feel very lived next if your game has lots of electricity then here's a pack with tons of effects you've got lots of explosions some auras Buffs beams and lasers all them look really nice they come in plenty of colors for you to use in any way you want then if your game has a level on some industry side check out this one it's some kind of mining industry so you've got lots of giant trucks you've got some trains and some super heavy machinery this looks really complete it's really cool definitely makes me want to make some kind of mining management game then here is something that looks Tak and straight out of Elden ring it's a giant very fancy Castle it's got lots of white lots of gold it's made up of modular pieces so you can easily build your own okay so that's all the top new asses for the month of September like I mentioned I'm really hard at work on my seam game I really hope you'll enjoy it stay tuned for this Monday and if you need Visions for your games check out the C Humble Bundle
