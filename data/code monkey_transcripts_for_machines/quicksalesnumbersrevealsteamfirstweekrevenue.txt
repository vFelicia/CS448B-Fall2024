hello and welcome I'm your K Mony so quick update my game has now been out for a week and here are the first week's numbers I will do a full video later on with my full thoughts but I want to make a quick first week update since the first week usually matters quite a lot if you haven't picked it up yet check it out on Steam and if you do have it please write review it is currently at just under 50 reviews I'd love to hit 50 which would put the game in another seam review bucket which can usually help with visibility by the way if you're wondering why does my voice sound so weird that's because I just ran my first marathon yesterday I was completely broken and barely met it across the finish line and today my body is still very much recovering anyway so the numbers are pretty good especially considering how it's just the first week it is guiding towards selling over a th000 copies within the first month so it looks like it w hit my first month goals and of course this is also really good considering how I made such an insanely complex game in just 6 months I'm definitely very happy with myself in terms of productivity and my skills as a Game Dev and programmer the amount of code that I wrote in such a short amount of time is really quite surprising even to myself and it's all really high quality code there's only a handful of places where I made something quick and dirty but for the vast majority like 95% of the code it's all really well structured so I'm definitely very happy with how much I've grown as a programmer since my last game this is why I'm constantly talking about the importance of experience it's because I can see the tremendous value it has in my own skills and in terms of the game itself honestly I'm really happy with it one fun thing that happened to me was on release day I've been working nonstop this past month and especially for the past two weeks in all that time I've played the game a lot but mostly just for testing not really to have fun and then on release day I finally published the game at 900 p.m. and I wanted to stay up for a while longer just make sure there weren't any major game breaking bugs that I missed so since I had to wait for about an hour for people to start playing the game and get some feedback in that time I just lied down on my couch I picked up my steam deck and I started playing normally and honestly I really enjoyed it I thought I would just play for 20 minutes but end up playing for almost 1 hour nonstop this one this is my ninth steam game but this is the very first time that I've made a game that I've played on a console and I have to say that felt pretty magical holding a portable gaming device just like a Game Boy that I had when I was a kid doing that and playing my own game that really felt really awesome that was definitely a great experience and the game itself in terms of design is also something that I'm really proud of and like I said the code is all really high quality which means it is really easy to expand modify which also means that my mind is already filled with so many ideas of where I can go next but right now I'm really fighting the urge to think about any future big expansions right now I'm really focused on adding something things that I just didn't have time before release I've been putting out updates every single day sometimes two updates per day and reading tons and tons of feedback so thank you all so much for all of your feedback there were a bunch of very strange very rare bugs that I only managed to fix thanks to all of your help beyond that I also wanted to make this quick video before I started publishing normal videos I asked you for what systems you'd like to see tutorials for and I've been adding those to my list hopefully I should be able to start working on those this week now that the game is pretty stable one of the ones that I really want to do and that a lot of people have mentioned is character customization the other day I checked out the N accur which is currently having a sale and the asset that I used for my own characters this pack with tons of characters tons of body parts this one is currently discounted it would be great timing if I had that tutorial done already but I still need to actually make that video from scratch so I can only put that one out later this month but if you're interested in character customization maybe pick up this pack while it's on discount and stay tuned for tutorial there's a link in the description and another great asset that I also use in my game that is also part of this sale is over here the text animator this is a really excellent asset it's really EAS to use personally I use it to polish up the tax in my game just making it automatically right in a super simple way it's a tiny thing but it really helps the game feel much more polished so this is another simple tool that I highly recommend and speaking of just Tools in general this topic is actually one that I want to cover in a future video basically what assets help make my game a reality both in terms of paid assets and also which ones of my own systems that I've made in previous videos which ones of those did I reuse in making this game the answer is quite a lot lot so I'm planning to make a video of all the systems and assets that I use and reuse and if you're a fan of the low po sound there's also a c hum bundle if you like their style then these humble mods are always excellent deals as you wait for me to make all the tutorials related for the game a lot of the Core Concepts behind it like the interaction System state machines CLE code separation and so on a lot of that are things that I've already covered in my two free courses actually the whole idea for this game started after I finished my multiplayer course and I wanted to make some multiplayer game in fact if you look at the lobby logic in the final game you'll see how it's pretty much exactly the same as what was originally built in that course so anyways yep these are the numbers for the first week stay tuned for the full video with my full thoughts sometime near the end of this month if you don't yet own the game go ahead and get it and if you do have it I hope you're enjoying it and please ride review it really does help all right so stay tuned for the return of regular videos coming soon thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
