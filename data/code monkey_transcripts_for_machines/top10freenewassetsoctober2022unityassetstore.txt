hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for October 22. in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them and by the way check out my own assets on the store so far I've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add Keys indoors to your game the mouse cursor system Pro which is a really easy to use tool to help you create custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out and the free health system which easily lets you add help to any object in your games alright so on to the top 10 list starting off with an official Unity sample project all about the unity UI toolkit this is unity's UI solution that is quite different from ENT UI I've already done a bunch of research on this but I haven't had the time to make a phone tutorial yet it's a pretty interesting system allows you to have separation between structure logic and visuals and the best thing of all is how it's a tool that works for both runtime as well as their UI the Legacy Way of building editor windows and tools is really difficult it requires tons of confusing code to build something simple using UI toolkit makes that process much much easier so that's UA tokit and this is a brand new free sample showcasing UI toolkit and using it as runtime UI it looks great it's got lots of buttons sliders and animations so if you're interested in UI tokit definitely go ahead and inspect the code in this sample up next is yet another free official Unity tool this is a dots character controller this was actually made by a third party and it was just recently bought by unity and they made it free for everyone it's from the same developer that made the excellent kinematic character controller so it's very well built made by someone who really knows how to build character controllers this one as the name implies it's built on dots so when dots come out of 1.0 and people start using it more and more I can definitely see this one becoming super useful it supports just about anything that you would want from a character controller so you can walk around irregular surfaces walk around to rain walk on top of moving Vehicles change gravity walk on a circular plant and tons more being based on dots also means it's insanely performant and easily supports literally thousands of controllers so you can add this complex controller to all your enemies and PCs or anything in your game and it really won't cost much performance at all then if you're making a ccg here's a nice card kit demo features lots of pieces you can combine to get the cards looking exactly as you wanted the symbols can mean whatever you want so maybe they mean an attack maybe they mean Mana maybe terrains features quite an impressive amount of content for a free asset there's also a even more expansive paid version if you like what you see then if you need some highly optimized graphs using your game check out this one supports a massive amount of grass all the blades are individually rendered you can enable the player and objects to interact with laguaras so that looks great it also supports lighting and grass painting and works in urp this one is just a free demo but it works really great so I want to include it you cannot make a build but you can use this while developing your game and if it fits your game then check out the phone version then if you need some customizable avatars look at this one if you'd like to add player customization to your game then don't like this one can be quite harmful features lots of parameters you can tweak to get tons of customization it's easily modifiable so you can even add your own custom pieces of clothing next up something nice and simple a bunch of pixel art emojis it looks exactly to expect all of it really nice so if your game has lots of text analog then adding some emojis like this can really help your attack stand out then if you're working on some kind of water game and you need a submarine look at this one this one is low poly I quite like the sound on this one I think the solid colors look pretty great for me the first thing that comes to mind is this would be a great fit in an RTS I remember playing red alert and having tons of fun with submarines and if you like this style then this dev has tons more stuff next for a nice song Here is readme light it's a tool for helping you easily and quickly create some readme objects this can be excellent for adding some documentation directly onto your objects so no need to open up a script you just select the object and read what it does features quite a lot of options you can even drag and drop some references directly in the text so this seems like a really useful tool then one that looks pretty interesting although I'm not entirely sure I understand this one is all about sign business fields which is a topic that I've wanted to research for quite some time I really only know the basics of what it means here this basically adds some nodes to Shader graph to be able to use SDF in your shaders it basically lets you create some shapes and play around the thickness and how they show up for example I use something similar to this in the transition effect from Hades so it seems like this would be useful for making that kind of effect much easier then if you use attribute it's in our scripts and you want a bunch more here's a great pack it adds 9 attributes doing all kinds of things so you can easily add some icons colors and labels you can change how they can be modified and you can add some drop downs in lists and a bunch more alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the NTS store for October 22. there's links on the description and also check out my own free input ass on store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
