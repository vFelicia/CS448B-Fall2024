hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video I'm going to give you seven reasons to use unity in 2019 let's begin so here we are it's 2019 and if you're brand new to game development you might be wondering if unity is a good choice to start using in 2019 there are lots of excellent game engines nowadays and pretty much all of them have some sort of free version this is definitely the best time ever to get served with game development at least when it comes to the availability of tools now I know this video might come across is almost an ad for unity but if you're here watching this video I'm guessing you're interested in making games which is what I do I'm currently in the middle of developing my own latest game using unity and I see no reason why I would switch in the future reason number one csharp unity uses C sharp which is a very powerful language it is continually getting support with new versions and updates both to the language itself and the compiler performance wise it's already a very fast language and with the new compiler and entity component system coming to unit in 2019 it will only get even faster also since it's one of the more popular languages you can find tutorials on just about anything you can think of as well as many libraries to help you out and also if in the future you wish to move away from game development into regular software development csharp has lots of job opportunities reason number two great for 2d and 3d despite being first marketed towards 3d game development over the years there have been many 2d features added and right now you can really create anything you want regardless of the perspective nowadays you can find just as many 2d assets and tutorials as for 3d it can make pixel perfect games or massive 3d worlds and anything in between recently they had AI key support for 2d characters so you can easily create cool animations so as you see they are constantly adding tools for both 2d and 3d reasons number three white platform support unity supports lots of different platforms and in a very simple way with a push of a button you can build your game to work on Windows Mac or Linux if you're publishing on Steam then you should know that while most people do use Windows there are still a lot of people who prefer Mac or Linux so having such an effortless way to give those people a native build is a huge plus and really help you stand out in a crowded market if you're interested in mobile development you can easily export to Android or iOS or with many optimization features make sure your game run smoothly on any kind of mobile hardware and it also supports consoles as well as VR and the web so essentially if you make a game in unity you can get running on pretty much any system you find reason number for realworld use cases the illicit games made in unity is already massive and just keeps growing you can create very complex games like Kerbal space program or prison architect or you can create gorgeous games like Orion des moines forest or kapap it is used by the smallest of Indies to the largest of triplea companies looking at that list should give you confidence that anything is possible to create with the engine reason number five extensive online services I'm putting this one under just one reason but really each of these services is the reason of its own through your Unity dashboard you can access many services which are very very valuable if you're working as part of a team there are lots of features to make collaboration very easy then you have unity ads which lets you easily add adverts into your game if that's the sort of monetization you're interested in analytics lets you set up your own custom triggers to see where your players are winning or losing so you can make changes accordingly cloud Diagnostics are one of my favorite since then let you see what errors are happening in your game this is extremely useful since it's very difficult to get bug reports from people and ask them to send their logs using this you have a lot of information to be able to tackle any bugs that you don't actually experience yourself and also you have multiplier which is getting a complete revamp in 2019 reason number six assets store the SSR is an excellent tool for getting up and running very quickly now just like any tool it can be used for good or for evil you get a lot of people complaining about SS flips on Steam and rights only so downloading a complete game pack and putting it on Steam is not the same as actually making a game but still don't let that discourage you from browsing the assets or you can find anything there from models to textures to sounds and really complex scripting tools like pathfinding or camera tools you can also get official completed games to hungry see how things are made just recently they put out the FPS complete FAQ which shows a complete multiplayer FPS in just make sure whatever you get actually makes sense and is adapted to fit into your game reason number seven future road map you can check out their road map on the website to see what features they're currently working on the most exciting one for me is the entity component system which promises extremely fast execution so you can have tens of thousands of units all at once then you also have other cool upcoming features like a complete revamp of the terrain system and also completely new multiplayer tools also there are improvements to the garbage collector who have assembly new input system and many more being able to see the road map is great because it gives you confidence that the engine will continue to get supported for a very long time so there you have it seven reasons to use unity in 2019 as I said this really is the best time to get started doing game development just a decade ago which would have cost tens of millions of dollars to get an engine with this much power and nowadays it's completely free and you can actually have many engines to choose from so go get the free version right now and get to work if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them so far for more videos and I'll see you next time
