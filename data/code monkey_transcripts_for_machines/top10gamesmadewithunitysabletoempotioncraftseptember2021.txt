hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity released in september 2021 there's lots of great ones this month and they are especially great in terms of teaching you how you absolutely need to make sure your game visually stands out almost every game on this list is very visually unique and you couldn't possibly confuse it for anything else that is also what you should be trying to do in your own games make it immediately stand out as much as possible that is where great marketing starts and again these games are your competition all of these games are uniquely impressive and they showcase the power of the engine in tons of different scenarios so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way there's a mega bundle happening right now on the unity assessor as usual it's a super deep discount up to 95 off it contains lots of interesting tools so there's one to help you manage an inventory database another one for placing some decals and the terrain system there's a digging system you can slice meshes volumetric vfx and tons more as usual with such a deep discount it's worth it if just one of these assets looks interesting check it out with the link in the description alright so starting off at number 10 with one that's been upcoming for several years and finally came out save all it was first announced at e3 in 2018 and the unique look caused everyone to pay attention right away it's a very stylized world with some great music as you embark upon your journey and guide saban through the vast deserts and mesmerizing landscapes in terms of gameplay it's an open world exploration story based game you collide around talking to people and exploring this visually unique world it's also available in game pass so if you have that definitely look into it just to admire the visuals next up another one that is also extremely visually unique while also being very unique in terms of theme and mechanics push and craft alchemist simulator like the name implies you craft potions and you do so in a very minimal way grinding flowers to dust stirring the pot managing the heat and so on customers come into your shop and they demand certain potions so then you go out you grab some ingredients use your tools and craft the final potion combine ingredients make your own custom recipes so you can make a healing potion or maybe make some poison customize your bottles in order to make your potions stand out it really is a very unique concept a very unique game which when coupled with a unique interesting look really makes for something that has the potential to achieve quite massive success it's only just come out of early access and it already has over 2000 very positive reviews so definitely another great example on how to find success with a unique concept and some very good marketing then here's a nice indie sequel origami 2. i played the first one quite a while ago and i really enjoyed the concept my only dislike was that the game felt really stiff but by looking at the trailer for this one it looks to solve that problem so i'm very much looking forward to giving this one a try since the concept is indeed very great it's a stealth game where you play as an assassin with the power to control shadows you're vulnerable in light but you have the ability to blink between shadows and create some shadow areas lots of skills and abilities you can use to take out on your foes you can also play solo or with friends for some interesting coop action this one is also available on game pass so if you have that definitely look into it then if you want to just chill out for a bit check out cloud gardens it's all about using plants to make a postapocalyptic world come to life it's a very unique concept with a great visual sound in terms of gameplay it's somewhere between a sandbox toy and a game with challenges relax as you place down objects cover them in foliage and just keep doing that it's a very zenlike relaxing experience you create beautiful dioramas and then just share them with your friends by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks next up for some vr here is iron guard vr it's a tower defense game so on the one hand you can build some towers and with the other hand you control a spaceship letting you directly damage enemies you have many towers to place resources together and upgrades to take out your enemies features 360 degree immersive gameplay with a unique storytelling including voice acting according to the reviews the game is exactly just a tower defense game so nothing else too unique but if all you want is tower defense in vr then this one is exactly that and up next one that just came out after a very successful time in early access pathfinder wrath of the righteous it's an epic rpg play your hero your own way very much focused on giving you plenty of choice to create exactly the character you want and play it in any way you desire choose from 25 classes 12 races and over a thousand spells includes two modes for combat real time with pause or turn based so that's a pretty interesting feature usually you only get just one or the other the game features some truly gorgeous particle effects tons of particles with lots of glow lots of movement everything looks really great it does make me wonder if they're using vfx graph for these effects some of them look like tons and tons of particles so they might be doing that choose your own path and lead your party to victory it's got over 7000 very positive reviews so if you're interested in this genre definitely give it a try then if you've ever wanted to play as a mouse warrior then check out tales of iron it's an rpg adventure with some brutal combat lots of enemies and bosses to battle lots of weapons to try out and many companions to meet this one features great use of 2d and lighting i believe they are indeed using the urp 2d renderer with the specific 2d lights by using that it does make the game look really gorgeous every scene is packed with detail you've got several parallax backgrounds with some particles of it perfectly lit and it also looks like maybe they are also using the 2d skeletal system you can equip all kinds of weapons with your character and it works great with any animations so if you're working on a 2d game with 2d and lighting definitely study how this game does it another one with a very unique look is toim it's in black and white with a nice mixture of 2d and 3d and a really interesting camera mechanic it describes itself as a photo adventure you set off on a delightful expedition and use your camera to uncover the mysteries of this world it's a pretty relaxing experience you've got no combat meet some quirky characters and help solve their problems by snapping some neat photos and solving puzzles this one is a great example of a unique game with a visual that sounds out immediately which makes for some really great gifts because of that it's already got a very nice amount of reviews with a nearly 100 positive rating then here's a really special one madness project nexus it seems like an odd title but as soon as i started watching the trailer i got it right away if you're around my age and you also played flash games during your youth then chances are you've played one of the madness games or watched the videos those games were so good they had the best shooting in pretty much any flash game lots of particles punchy sound effects and awesome animations so this game is exactly that but with modern technology they've somehow managed to convert the 2d sprites into 3d models in a way that looks perfectly awesome it's got all of the arcade action you expect with tons of weapons and lots of crazy characters and the game itself already has over 1500 overwhelmingly positive reviews so this one clearly is not just nostalgia it's an actually great game and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is timberborne it calls itself a lumber punk city builder game basically humanity is gone and beavers are all that's left so can they rebuild better than the humans that is the question it is certainly a pretty unique theme being a game based on beavers then naturally a lot of the mechanics revolve around controlling water which makes it send out from other city builders you can terraform to create some new rivers use the water to power your structures and stay safe during the drought by saving up water during the wet times also features some very vertical construction so instead of placing down a simple house you can actually build it up with multiple levels and floors so that looks like a pretty interesting mechanic so if you've got a game idea where you want to learn how to add rivers and flowing water into your games then study this one to see how the water behaves it's already overwhelmingly positive with over 2 000 reviews at 95 positive that's a massively good result for something that just came out of early access alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity and launched in september 2021 lots of variety for what the engine can do if you want to be successful in the game developer you definitely need to keep an
