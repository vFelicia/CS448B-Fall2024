hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the asset sword is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let check out some highlights for November 23 in this first video I'll be covering list of free assets and next ones I'll cover paid asset and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them quick reminder tons of Black Friday sales are still ongoing if you need anything definitely check it out I've already mentioned the things that I really recommend like text animator this is excellent a path fighing project this is perfect and feel also awesome I've heard great things about final K the legs animator easy save and hot reload so pretty much everything here is excellent remember to check out the page well the Flash Deals over here you can see the timer for when they're actually going to be live by the time this video goes live it's going to be these ones you've got some dots animation a realistic car controller a really nice FPS controllers some magic and so on and there's also some cinti assets although if you're specifically looking for cinti assets they also got a Black Friday sale in their store bunch of stuff at 70% off and all of the usual gorgeous ones these are only at 50% off like the fantasy Kingdom this is the one that was shown in the unite keynote if you'd like to try to build something that is just as good looking as that then maybe pick this up and try it out and over on Humble Bundle there's a bundle with a ton of blender modeling 3D courses I'm pretty sure this is the one that I went through and really taught me the basics of blender I managed to learn quite a lot Grant is a great teacher so if you need anything now is the best time to get it so check out all the sales with the links in the description all right so on to the top 10 list starting off with an official new Unity asset called quiz you this is a fully working quiz mini game and importantly this is all made with UI toolkit now if you don't know UI toolkit is the new UI system that un has been working on for quite some time I've done a bunch of research on it but I haven't yet had the time to make a full tutorial on it just yet it's very interesting compared to the regular uny it has some nice Pros in terms of separating data from the visuals this asset looks like an excellent learning sample if you want to start learning UI tokit it is meant to teach you various things like event dispatch and propagation State pattern for game Flow managing menus and the model view presenter pattern personally I will certainly be diving deep into this sample once I find the time to research some UI toen then if you've been playing Super Mario wonder and you're inspired to build something like it then here's a pack with some visuals that could be taken straight from that game it's got some very nice soft colors some nice round edges everything looks really inviting it includes a bunch of modular pieces for some grass some path you've got trees houses air blocks and a bunch more so just with this one pack you could build an entire Mario inspired game with lots of unique levels and biomes next here's an interesting tool that adds a bunch of useful cont text actions as you Mouse over a folder you can see a tiny icon that lets you create a subfolder and you can automatically give it some preset names you can also automatically create a script from various templates so automatically write the baller plates for an interface a struct in N code or a bunch more you can create and set up shaders with just one click and a bunch more options this is a tiny tool but when working on a large project these tiny actions do end up taking quite a decent check of time so this can be quite useful then if you're looking for some Trails visuals here's a free pack with some really nice variety these all look really good very nice and Wiggly it's honestly really high quality for a free pack these are all made with the VFX graph so they are super high quality it includes 10 unique Trails so things like fire ice there's one for Cosmos void water and a bunch more and this pack also includes sound effects really nice next if you'd like to prototype a city Builder game then check out this pack you've got six really nice buildings all in a low poly style but still with a nice amount of detail there's a fire station Hospital workshop and a bunch more visually I think they all look really great so basically if you grab this pack and then you grab my free grade building system if you put those two together it can make a really nice city Builder prototype in just a few minutes then if you combine that with a free character pack for some pedestrians and a free car pack for some Vehicles put all that together and you have everything needed to make a really nice city build there all completely for free then here's an interesting tool for running typescript alongside your C code personally I'm not a JavaScript expert I only know the absolute Basics the main benefit of something like typescript versus vanilla JavaScript is obviously used using types again for me as someone who does most of my programming in c every time I write some JavaScript it drives me crazy how there's no types so I'm definitely a fan of typescript at least the concept behind it this is a apparently especially great if you're making webgl games or apps and of course since it's JavaScript that means you have access to npm to download the millions of JavaScript libraries that do really anything you can think of next for some visuals here's one that looks really great these screenshots look really nice both because the assets and also the en lighting and postprocessing that to use it looks really calm really inviting looking at this one I would say this is obviously perfect for some kind of Sims game you could combine this with my grid system and get something really nice just pick up a free Character Pack add some interactions and you have a really nice Sims game then for a potentially very useful tool here we have value Observer like the name implies this one lets you observe when a value changes so you can use this custom class with whatever other type you want then when you modify the underlying value you can get notified that something changed this is something that I do all the time in my own code I modify my variables through functions instead of direct access I do that specifically so I can fire events if needed and this tool basically does all that without having to write a ton of code for yourself you just use this class and everything works it's a really nice and simple way to save you a little bit of time or perhaps as a research tool just to see how something very useful like this can be built then here's another interesting tool this one is for copying scriptable objects data this is definitely something that I've needed to do in the past and it was indeed very annoying to have to copy paste one by one this sybol to will help solve that you can copy some script ball object data and then select another or multiple other objects and simply paste that data importantly it has a nice window where you can pick what data you want to paste so you don't have to override all the fields only the ones that you want it's a simple tool and if you use script B objects a lot like you should do then this can really come in handy sometimes then if you need some nice free weapons check out this pack I quite like this style it's low poly but with some nice rounded edges the colors are solid meaning you can very easily recolor all the weapons to get tons of variation you've got multiple weapons both for shooting and for melee so if you need some weapons then this would be a great starting point all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the UNS store for November 23 there's link to the description and also check out my own fre Pon store all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
