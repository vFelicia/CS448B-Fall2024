hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the assessor is full of awesome tools and asks to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for february 202. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered all the best three new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it in the next video i'll be covering the top passes and effects let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the ask in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order also one quick note here usually in these videos i hide the prices for the assets i do that for two reasons one it's because the price is local so what i see on my screen over here in portugal is different to what someone in the us or in india would see and secondly because assets go on and off sale so sometimes when i record these videos the assets are still having their launch discount which will likely be over by the time the video is published so for those two reasons i tend to hide the price to avoid showing you any incorrect information so pretty much if you like the asset you just click on the link to check the price in your own country at that exact time but i have gotten several comments that seem to think there's some nefarious reason for why i do that i don't even really know what possible evil reason i could have for hiding the prices but regardless of my intent some people think it's shady so i guess if i have to choose between people seeing prices that are somewhat incorrect or having people assume that i'm doing something with evil intent i guess i'll go with the first option so all of that to say that i will no longer hide them so be aware that the prices and discounts that you see in the video are not necessarily what you will see when you click on the asset link alright so starting off with an interesting tool for iterating upon your animations it makes playing with ik super simple just move some sliders and easily move arms and legs or anything now this is not a tool for making animations from scratch instead it's for starting from something and making some changes to get the exact animation you want so for example you take a walking animation to create a walking tightrope animation or maybe an idle animation and you make it idle but carrying a box it's a really nice tool for your animation toolbox then here's one that is extremely important called feedback pro getting feedback from your players is essential to making a great game usually people handle that by asking the players to send an email but no one really does that so this one is a super useful window that you can place directly in your game and then it just sends all the data to wherever you want you can easily include a screenshot and system info along with any other game that you need it's all very well documented and you can export that data to anywhere you want something like discord slack or just json if you want to have some great looking ui shadows look at this one the builtin ui shando is nice but it's very simple it's a solid shadow just rendered on all four sides this one is much much softer works on all shapes and sizes and you can also change the color to make it look like a glow instead of a shadow then over here is an interesting one it's all about hiding data directly inside an image i believe this is called steganography it's a fun concept and this asset makes it easy to use this can be especially great for modding so you can encode the mod data directly inside the mod screenshot and then you can easily share that image so that anyone can load that mod also the ui for some reason reminds me of old school theme so that's fun next up if you want to place down some buildings kind of like playing the sims check out this one you can place down walls floors doors windows and more you can swap out the marginal parts with your own custom ones also the developer says this is pretty much in early access the basics are there but it will keep getting updates over time then if you want a complete game template here is a colony simulator it's packed with tons of features it's got building crafting resource gathering there's equipment and weapons there's objectives tectories factories and tons more so if you want to make a quick prototype then this can be quite useful or maybe you have a 2d game and you want to have some destruction then here is sprite breaker a while ago i covered rayfire which is an excellent destruction tool this is kind of like that but for 2d break any sprite you want into as many pieces as you want you can slice them automatically or manually define the slices and it automatically applies physics to all the parts so everything falls apart then if you want to make some procedural buildings look at this one you can create any shape apply whatever modifiers you want to get the windows doors and lights so you can make some modern skyscrapers or some really fancy buildings by just using the included demo assets you could already create a very massive very convincing city up next here's a simple one for analyzing the size of your project you can easily find which files are taking the most space so you can either remove them or compress them it's one of those that does just one thing and does very well and for another complete game template here is an rpg editor this one is version three it's been development and getting constant updates ever since 2010 so it's really solid and packed with tons of features experience turnbased battles or realtime combat it's got all of these systems you expect class factions loot research and more features extensive documentation and some tutorials to easily get started alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unt assessor for
