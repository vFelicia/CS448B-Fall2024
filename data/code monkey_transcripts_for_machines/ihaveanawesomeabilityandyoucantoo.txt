hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey over my 25 years of writing code and 10 years of making games have developed a really nice ability the ability and confidence to be able to build any game that I can imagine I've made action games I've made management games and strategy games I've made automation games racing games Platformers I've even made casual games I've made top down Shooters made a turnbas strategy game a tower defense game I've made firstperson Shooters a battle Sandbox game Park simulation game Logistics management game game a coop game and tons more mini games and prototypes building all of this has really granted me the confidence and the ability that I am capable of building any game that I can imagine this is a really nice ability to have and I'm sure a lot of you would like to have this as well basically my goal with this Channel with the tons of tutorials that I've done with all the course that I've created the goal with all this is really for me to pass on this ability onto you so you can make any game you can imagine however don't get me wrong I'm not saying this brag quite the opposite actually it did not Ed to be like this for me in fact for my very first team game what eventually became Survivor Squad this is a top down strategy zombie game so you recruit a bunch of survivors gather four supplies and weapons move around as a squad and survive all these zombies however the initial idea was not a zombie game one of my favorite games as a kid was SWAT I played a ton of Swat 2 and SWAT 3 I really love these games all of the idea of scouting and building from the outside getting all the squad members up against the door doing a breach and taking down all the bad guys in a really satisfying manner so when I was thinking of ideas for what to do for my first team game this is the idea that came to mind right away that was the plan that's what I want to do I basally wanted to make a top down SWAT game however back then I was much less experienced than I am nowadays this was 12 years ago all the way back in 2012 as I was trying to make this idea come to life is I was trying to write all the a logic control of the units getting them all to stack up against the door and all do some basic common logic doing all of that while also having the enemies react intelligently to the SWAT units I was really trying to build all that but it was a really very frustrating experience my code was a complete mess and all that logic just did not work together so after trying for a really really long time eventually had to face reality that I wasn't yet skilled enough to bring that Vision to life I tried my hardest but I just couldn't build it so at that point I decided to give up on the idea of making a SWAT game which would involve some very complex Ai and instead I changed it to be a game all about zombies zombies are really dumb so there's really not much AI required they really just move towards the Target and attack that's it with my skills at the time I was capable of doing that kind of dumb zombie Ai and for the same reason I also scra the idea of having the units all Bunch up together and do some complex breaching logic again I really couldn't make that happen so I made the units just manually controlled by the player so the player has to manually control each one individually that was my reality back then I wish I was able to bring the original Vision to life but back then I did not have the skills that I have today I did not have the ability to bring any game I can imagine to life whereas nowadays after 12 years of building tons of games and writing tons and tons of lines of code nowadays I am confident I have that ability nowadays I am confident that if I went back to that original idea with all the logic of doing the AI breaching with all the AI for the enemies and all that nowadays I am confident that I could build the exactly as I envisioned it 12 years ago so basically here on this channel I imagine some of you are myself from that time ago and I want to help pass on dis ability onto you so you can build any game you can imagine and also hopefully I can pass on disability onto you without taking as long as it took me nowadays for making a my main limitation isn't lack of ability but rather just time some of my favorite games growing up were also Age of Empires red Earth Empire Earth and later on generals and Company of Heroes I would absolutely love to do some kind of RTS someday then there are tons of really interesting Simulator games on Steam is also a genre that I'd love to tackle someday or actually one that I've had on my two playlist for ages but still haven't gotten around to it something like sardy Valley I haven't played it just because I know that as soon as I touch it I'm going to be obsessed with the game and I'm going to play nonstop for about 100 hours and whilst I'm playing I'm also going to be thinking about all kinds of videos all kinds of systems that I'd love to remake from this game another favorite game of mine while growing up was The Sims back then I played it kind of like an RPG my goal was always to start with a Sim with no money and then pick a random career and work all the way to the top I remember how keeping a certain number of friends for getting each promotion that was really tricky part making a life simulation game like this one sounds like a lot of fun there's also a bunch of building crafting combat games on Steam kind of like valheim I'd also love to build one of these games someday or another one that I also loved was Max Bane I'd love to build some kind of third person shooter with some really awesome bullet time mechanics out of all of those I am confident that I do have the ability to bring any of these to life now obviously when I'm saying that I am keeping in mind scope for example a game like the Sims 4 this one has a Monumental scope there's literally tens of thousands of objects and interactions the game has almost 1,000 bucks worth of DLC so yeah obviously it's not possible for me or any experience developer any Soul developer to build the game on this scale but something with a much smaller scope like the first Sims something that just focuses on the core game mechanics yeah that one I'm pretty confident that I could build but at the same time also another Point there's a big difference between being able to technically make some kind of game and making an excellent game games are a combination of Art and technology so it's not just Tech this is why the discipline of game design that one is more of an art as opposed to a science so whilst I could technically build all these games I'm not sure I could get the excellent game design behind them but just being able to build something technically that is a pretty awesome ability and if you want to also develop this ability the ability of being able to take any game idea you have in your mind and bring it to life if so then really my best advice is just build tons of things make lots of games and write tons and tons of code like I said in my story about my Survivor Squad game what changed in the 12 years since I made that game what changed was really just the amount of games that I've made the amount of code that I've written since that time I've written literally hundreds of thousands of Ls of code and through all that time and all that experience that is how I was able to acquire this really awesome ability experience truly is a very magical thing the more games you make the more code you write the more capability you become until reach a point where you can build literally anything you can imagine so the answer to attaining disability is really just experience if you are a beginner then I high recommend remaking some super simple games my favorite simple game is Just Flappy Bird it is super simple a very basic design but still teaches you quite a lot pong is also a simple one and also involves some basic AI then for one level above that you can make some like PacMan or Space Invaders those involve a little bit more logic or perhaps some quote unquote original simple games you can make something like a super simple platformer literally just a character with gravity jumping over blocks that's it or make a super simple racing game kind of like my own game that I showed where it really just goes left to right and Dodges cars or you can make a simple top down shoot with zombies something super basic with extremely simple AI basically the answer to attaining this ability is experience the more games you make the more code you write the more capable you become you basically just have to make a dozen crappy games before you can make something good so just get those done very quickly in order to gain a ton of experience if you're looking for a guide path you can check out some of the courses where I made some of the games that I mentioned you can see how I built a tower defense game from scratch or how I made this really awesome turnbased strategy game kind of like XCOM this is a really awesome intermediate course or how I made a coop game in my free kitchen chaos course and the followup multiplayer one or in general check out my recently released C course this one is focused on the language itself which is more General so it allows you to gain knowledge to be able to build any game or really write any code that you can think of I include my 10 years of C knowledge in this course it features over 50 video lectures each covering different topics starting from the absolute Basics to some more complex stuff and of course also importantly includes a companion project this one includes questions quizzes and very importantly it includes over a 100 interactive exercis these are exercises that required to actually write code in order to complete the exercise I designed them specifically to help you learn by doing in order to ensure you really truly learn the contents of each lecture either way regardless of what path you choose I wish you the best of luck in your Learning Journey and I hope that one day you to can have the confidence and the ability to be able to build any game you can imagine
