in this video we're going to look at the recently unveiled unity open projects this is a really interesting new initiative where a game will be made partly by unity and partly by the community there's a public roadmap and a public github where anyone can contribute to the project let's begin all right so a few days ago unity announced their new initiative called unity open projects i think this is an awesome idea and i look forward to seeing how the community will react there's an official blog post linked in the description with all details but essentially this is a project that is being made by a team from unity while at the same time being open to contributions from the community there is a public roadmap where you can see a general idea of where the game will go so here you have a ton of information on these readme cards so just click on each card and you can read it then down here we have the game design wiki which tells you a bunch of things about the game and what it's supposed to be but again the home point is to be made in conjunction with the community so as time goes on and more people contribute more systems and ailments the design for this will definitely change over time essentially the goal is to make a nice small complete game combining tons of contributions both from the official uniting team as well as anyone who wants to contribute so this will be a project that will go on for several months and every few weeks there will be live streams talking about the state of the project as well as some individual tutorials now personally i think this has the potential to be an awesome stepping stone in between making quick game jams and making a complete game with this you can focus on just a single system or element and contribute to the final game so that can be a great way to learn then the final game will be published on steam as a free download so i look forward to going through the credits and seeing how many people contributed to this final project alright so let's take a look at the project in its current starting state so just clone the github repository and open the project in unity here is the basic starter scene so like i said the goal of this initiative is to make a game with the community so what we have here is pretty much just a very simple prototype we have this player character and we can move around this map and as you can see there's a camera following we have basic movement direction and we have a nice jump so we can jump around then on the world itself you can see a whole bunch of platforms and walls as well as over here we have a nice terrain object so over here what we have is just the absolute essentials to get started on so you can already imagine populating this with tons of objects with proper textures and animations then adding some enemies some combat some sort of quest system inventory and so on then there's also another branch in the repository with the toon shader so over here we can see our main pick character it's using a really nice cartoony shader effect now personally i really like this art style and the shader itself is made in shadowgraph so if you want to see how to make a toon shader just go ahead grab the project and you can inspect this alright so for now that's pretty much it here we have just a bare bones prototype which works as a perfect blank canvas for everyone to start contributing to by the way there's also an interview with zero who is the lead on this project over on the infallible code channel so if you want more details check that out and there's also a stepbystep guide on how to contribute made by dapper dino so check out both those videos linked in the description now like i said i'm really excited for this project this is actually something that i have thought about doing on this channel but the logistics of it are very complicated so i won't be paying very close attention to how this project develops i really hope the whole unity community finds this an interesting idea and contributes to the final game i certainly intend to contribute to the project and i hope that you won't too i'm recording this just one day after the project was officially announced and there's already tons of discussion happening on the forums and already a bunch of people have contributed to the project so it's off to a great start and as you can see the name is unity open projects in plural meaning that if this project is successful this could become a really interesting ongoing series perhaps the next one won't be on making a strategy game or maybe something open world or a driving game or pretty much anything alright so that's the unity open projects initiative it's a great way to make a complete game as part of the unity community now go ahead check it out and contribute something to the project this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone alright thanks for watching and i'll see you next time you
