hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asaurus form of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video only check out some highlights for January 23rd even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these asses is enough to fire up my imagination like me the only picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is unlisted paid as in fact I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and best songs and systems as always there's links yes in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order quick update on my upcoming free course I'm almost done as usual this project ended up being much bigger than anticipating my initial goal was a two or three hour course and the final result is closer to 10. the good news is that it's extremely detail covering tons of topics that won't really help you on your own Game Dev Journey the release date is next Monday right here on YouTube I will be needing your help to make sure this mess videos as well so when the video comes out go ahead click on it and hit the like button I really hope you will find this massive free course very helpful and also if you need some discount assets there's a Unity Mega Ball right now with up to 94 off and there's also a build your own bundle on the Senti store alright so starting off with a really gorgeous Japanese Village this one has some really gorgeous looking assets the video really makes it look more than perfect I just finished watching chainsaw man the other day and this would definitely fit there it's all based on much more pieces so you can build your own Japanese Village then for a bunch of VFX here is a nice casual pack in total 126 effects so you've got lots of Airy effects a bunch of fire fog loot projectiles regen and a bunch more next here are some highend Cliffs these look like they could be taken straight from Skyrim if your game has a realistic style and lots of mountains you can definitely Place tons of these around to really populate your world or maybe your game is low probably if so look at this armor pack in total almost 600 modular armor parts this one is an expansion which works with either the paid base pack or the free base pack it's all in a really nice style I quite like the asses from this publisher then if your game is scifi and you need some backgrounds look at this one features some super high res textures all of them in 8k it includes a Shader so you can play around with some nice atmosphere effects for something quite a lot more Jolly here is a gorgeous puppy it's a German Shepherd looks about four months old really cute really nice model with 75 animations and it also includes accessories like colors footballs and a bunch of toys maybe you're working on a card game if so look at this pink Shader you can easily add some rain effects add some snow and some dirt you can add some particle Nas and a bunch of decals there is an atrp version and a urp version then if you're working on a survival game and you need tons of props look at this Mega kit I'm using a similar kit from the same publisher in my own game turn one Liberation by the way edit your wish list if you haven't already this one includes 350 models so everything from weapons to some tents a bunch of tools backpacks vehicles and a bunch more next here is an interesting scene it's a big room with a huge Globe some nice windows and a chair the first thing that comes to mind is this would be a great location for some kind of fun on boss fight maybe in a game inspired by either 007 or Austin Powers definitely a bit of a strange asset but it doesn't look great next if you need a bunch of weird fantasy monsters check this one out it includes eight unique monsters all of them pretty strange you've got a spider lady there's some weird scorpion Beetle there's a centaur Warrior and a bunch more for some low poly check out this interior and food bundle these are very simple assets but this pack has a massive amount of them I can see this one being perfect for either some kind of game kind of like the Sims or maybe something like a kitchen game possibly in VR then for a really fun effect that players always love here is a liquid container this one is a Shader effect so it's all preperformant you have 9 unique container models and different visuals for the liquids inside everyone went crazy when this was first used in a half5 Alex so now you can easily add it to your own games or maybe you just want a really highend intimidating character check out this that night it's definitely a gorgeous Model includes a whole bunch of variations the ice one looks very much like the Lich King there's a bunch of modular pieces and you can easily change the color for any of these parts next if you need tons and tons of icons check out this arrival mega pack I definitely could have used a pack like this 10 years ago when I was working on my games on these icons all of them look really gorgeous it includes a thousand icons which comes at about just 6 cents per icon for a fun low poly character check out this trend it's a really nice model looks quite intimidating but also really nice this one is made by Infinity PBR so as usual there's tons and tons of Sliders to do all kinds of mesh morphing and also includes a whole bunch of animations maybe you want something a bit more realistic or scifi if so here is a Mars Rover vehicle it's got a very realistic sound I quite like the model really nice design it includes both the outside as well as a fully model interior then for some fun to the characters check out this pack very cute sound all of these characters they're all extremely round it includes 10 characters of them with several animations so this could be fun to use in some kind of multiplayer game where each player chooses a different character this Dev also has a free pack with a sample character so maybe pick that one up first to see if you'll like the style next for another fun effect here is a hologram of planet Earth it's exactly what you expect just a nice fun model with a bunch of love and for some textures here is a pack with a hundred Pavements oh my are Taliban they're all seamless you can use them in urp but they also include all of the maps necessary for ajrp or maybe you want something more Sunrise so look at these guns very unique style some of them look quite futuristic While others look a bit more steampunk and concludes a bunch of guns with multiple variations for each gun alright so those are my top 20 new visual assets on the UTS store for January 23. there's links on the description and this bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also check out my own free and paint Astron store alright hope
