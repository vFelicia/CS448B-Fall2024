here's a quick entity tip so here is my player character and i have some simple movement implemented now as i move left and right or up and down i have this speed but if i move in any diagonal then the character is now suddenly going faster that is not supposed to happen movement should be at a constant speed in any direction here is the code which just grabs the inputs and creates the movement vector the issue is with regards to the vector magnitude if you just move in one direction then the magnitude is 1 which is correct but if you move in two directions at once then the magnitude is more than one which makes it move faster the solution is simple whenever you have movement vectors always make sure to normalize those vectors normalizing means it will keep the same direction but set the magnitude to 1. so now i can move in any direction and movement is always at constant speed exactly as it should be ok subscribe for more tips
