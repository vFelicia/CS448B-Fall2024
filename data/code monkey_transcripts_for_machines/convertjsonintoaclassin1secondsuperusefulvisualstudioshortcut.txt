hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey here's a super quick video about a really useful Visual Studio feature that you might not know about when working with Json you need to define the class or stru to hold the data with all the names and types so as an example over here is the YouTube API which has tons of endpoints this one is for listening videos and if we scroll down we can see how it's structured so here it is this is the structure for the response it's got a bunch of string fields and the page info and then array with all the items and the items are all of type video resource which in turn then has this huge definition so manually you'd have to build all of these films yourself if you want to get this Json in your game or app or alternatively there is a much simpler automated method that I just found out a few months ago first thing you do is you get the Json so over here I'm going to make a request on this endpoint let's just grab my liked videos then just run this query and if there you go here is all of the return data so now what I can do is just pick up all this Chon so let me copy the whole thing select it all and copy and then over here in Visual Studio here is the one second method you just go up into edit then go into paste special and then paste Json as classes and if there you go it creates the entire structure for all the Json in the clipboard so our entire complex Json object was automatically converted into a proper class definition you can see that on the root object we've got the kind e tag which over here yep that's exactly what we've got and then we've got an array of items for all of our video resources and Y here it is the same thing so we've got items so it has an objective type item so here it is it's got the kind e then inside we've got the snippet then the snippet has the channel ID title description and so on so the simple method just going into edit paste special and past on classes this is super awesome it really saves you a ton of work for example I have my live stream overlay which use the YouTube API when I first built it I did not know about this so I had to manually painstakingly create the entire structure one by one knowing about this awesome visual studio feature would have definitely saved me a ton of time so hopefully this quick video helps someone and another quick mention C also has the Dynamic keyword so one alternative is if you're using json.net you can do it just like this all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
