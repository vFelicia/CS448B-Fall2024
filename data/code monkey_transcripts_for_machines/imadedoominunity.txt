in this video we're going to look at a doom like I made in unity it features the classic movement aiming level design pickups and more let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with enough tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing alright so here let's check out the doom like I made in unity I'm going to first showcase the game and then talk about how it was built you can play it for yourself with the link in the description in that page you can also find links to all of the various elements that were used in making this game this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone alright so let's check it out so here I am with my player character and I'm in design as close to the original doom as possible so for example I can only aim left and right and not actually up and down so I'm carrying a normal pistol and I can shoot now the level has a bunch of interesting doors and buttons that I can interact with so this door in here it can be opened by interacting with this button I covered several ways of interacting with doors in another video so in this case I'm using the button interaction so approach the button press the button and there you go the door opens so go through here and then we have another door this one actually requires the red key so first we need to find it I made this one in the key door system video so we go through this area and as you can see with the movement it also acts exactly like the original doom so there's the bouncing up and down of the camera as well as the weapon alright so we go through here now in here we have some nice targets so I can aim and shoot in order to damage them take down that one and now there's no ammo so pick up some more ammo and shoot this one then over here we have a nice lava pit so if I go inside there you go my health starts going down go outside and stops and then a nice I'll pick up so go in and my health is now back No alright then we go through here and we have another door this one does not require a key so I just approach and press the interact key in order to open it then go through and we have a very nice elevator so press a button and there you go the elevator starts going up and you have to know I'm on the second floor and then over here is another interesting area with a bunch more targets so shoot them and that one as well and there you go now here we have the red key so pick it up and there you go in the UI you can see that I have tricked up the key get some more ammo go through get some more health and as we go through there you go we open the secret passage and now we're back in the original area all right so now from here we have the key so we can go back through here and now with the key we can open the door hey there you go there's our nice trophy and we pick it up and there you go we won the level right awesome so here is the game in action it works pretty much examined like the original doom so there's doors keys buttons obstacles enemies ammo shooting and so on again you can download the complete project files and try them out for yourself so maybe use it as a starting point to make your own doom like now if you like this type of content don't let me know in the comments what are the January season like to see me create okay so now that we've played through the game let's take a look and see how everything was made alright so here we are in the editor now let's first look at how the level is made now first of all a while ago I started playing around with unity snaps in case you're not familiar go check out that video but essentially there are packs of premade assets that are very easily snapped together so using it you can very easily build some nice 3d levels so as I was playing around with snaps that's when I thought why don't I try to recreate doom in unity since the Class C game is all about 3d levels mixed with 2d sprites so the entire level is built using unity snaps specifically the szerik pack which has a very nice siphon look to it there's a link in the description in case you want to pick it up so you can see that the home level is built up with these snapvault objects so each of them has a specific size and they easily snap together now something very specific to doom and those oldschool games is the moving and aiming so here it is in game first where the aiming we only aim a little right to never actually up and now so doing that is actually very simple here is the player character controller script and over here there's a function to handle the and essentially all I'm doing is getting the access wrong of the horizontal mouse movement and we'll leave the Y at zero then we just normally rotate the transform so here it is in game I cannot look up or down but I can look left and right now next is the camera and weapon wobble now the way that this is done is some simple animations the weapon itself is actually an image on the UI so here is the UI it is just a basic image with a animator component and if we open it we can look at all of our various animation States so we have a basic idle a weapon walking any weapon shoot so it's a pretty simple animator then over here in the parameters we have a boolean for is wonking and a trigger for shoot so again here it is in game right now the pistol is playing the idle animation so just bouncing up and down and as I start to walk there yo it goes from side to side so just like that and as I stop the transitions back into idle then when I click it simply triggers the trigger and there you go plays that simple animation so that's the basic weapon and missions then we also have the camera wobble so right now it's static when it's I don't but as we start moving you can see the camera bouncing up and down so the way that it's done it's pretty much the exact same thing except it's an animator applying to the player camera so as I move it goes up and down and as I stop it reverts back to normal so those two are some pretty essential things to getting this game feeling just right just like the original doom then right here we see a simple door and then in here we have our nice button now I made a video covering several methods of interacting with doors and here I'm using the exact same thing but apply to 3d so we have this button and here in the editor we can see how the button is built so it's just a simple game object and inside we have the sprite and then on the button we have the button interact script as well as a boxing leather set to trigger so there's a button and I'm controlling the player and now I can press the interact key and when I press a key it thoughts for interactive all objects that are near the player so it tests for colliders near it and since the button has a coiler if I'm inside and I press the interact button so I press it and there you go the button changes and the door starts to open so it's a very simple interaction and built in a very nice way all I have is the button with a simple script that implements an interface and then a box on whether I set the trigger so we open door and we can go through it all right so now over here we have the second door this one requires a key now I first made this system in the key door system video then I converted into 3d which also used in the FPS game that I made so in here I'm using the exact same system so without the key as I approach nope I cannot open the door so I need the key now another thing about this level is the lights so everything is lit pretty much just with the air lights so here in the editor first of all we can see all of the ceiling so let's hide the ceiling so as I hide it if there you go we can see everything and over here I have all my lights and there you go just like that they are all air lights so just place on the various positions and the only accordingly so they are all set the rectangle with the mixed mode and a slightly warmer temperature then we also have postprocessing so over here I have the postprocessing volume and it's pretty simple just simply moving yet and M in a collision so as one looking game for example disable bloom and there you go the lights go down so bloom looks pretty nice and even get over there on the corners just like that and then ambient occlusion which looks pretty nice all right so that's postprocessing now let's go through here and we have our second area and then in here we have our targets now initially I was going to recreate doom as much as possible so I really wanted to recreate the original game however as I was doing that I couldn't Leary lies that that plan would require a ton of artwork which is wrong on my strong points so I would need to draw the enemies in various poses draw a bunch of weapons and so on and so on so that's why here the only enemy is this static shooting target and there's only one weapon now the targets are static but they are constantly looking at the camera so I can only see the front of the target and that one is done by a very simple script here it is the rotate towards camera script we simply grab the main camera which is going to be the player camera then we just get the camera position in the position of these transform we calculate the angle and simply rotate this transfer so it's pretty basic and makes it so that the sprite is always pointing towards the camera now the targets are also using a very nice health system so it's pretty much the exact same script that I made them on the very first video on this channel so once again that's the power of writing clean reusable code so here I'm reusing something that I built over two years ago so they have the health system and let me just pick up some ammo and as I shoot them if there you go you can see that the health bar updates and they also have a tiny quick animation so there you go just bouncing back and once they are done yep they get destroyed and now for the player to actually handle the shooting now in the game there's no aiming up and down so the shooting is instead of being just a direct ray cast it's actually a virtual box and from the player testing for collisions so as I shoot it as a box cast it looks for all the targets within that Collider and if it's a shooting target then we damage it so it's working pretty much examine like the original doom meaning that this would also hit objects in front the player but above it as it should since that's the original design so that's how the player shoots and hits the targets then as you see we also have some ammo so the ammo is pretty simple here it is in the player character controller just a basic integer counting the ammo then for the UI it is shown as a simple text object so here on the UI there it is the ammo text object and that is handled by this game Hut script and over here you can see that we have a reference to the player character controller so how the mo text works is it simply subscribes to the on amount count change so we're using events in order to update the UI so you suddenly have the Refresh and we update our ammo and our health count so we're here on the player as we try to shoot some ammo we lower the ammo count and we fire off the event so everything is written in a very nice clean way using events now I cover the events in detail in another video so check the link the description now the player Hamill's pickups by checking for collisions so we picked up some ammo and over here we have some health so next to the health we have our own lava so this one is just some basic environmental damage so as I step on it there you go my health goes down as I go the way it stops going down so it's a very basic environmental damage and now for the lava itself it's pretty simple it's say quad with the texture and through code the texture offset is constantly increasing you could also do this with a custom shader rather than through code and for the visuals pretty basic it's using the standard shader then we have just a texture tinted in red and we have an emission matte in order to give it that nice glow so that's a level with a nice script and approximate letter set to trigger in order to damage a player and then over here we have the health pickup it's again pretty much the same simple thing we just have a boxing letter set to trigger so here I am with 174 health and as I approach inhale pick up there you go I pick it up any help updates so again it's using event so we're here the player has a on trigger enter and if we can ride with a health pickup we simply heal we destroy the health pickup and as we heal we heal the health system and then the health system itself fires of an event and then the UI and listens to that event and updates the UI so there it is that's the health in action all right so over here we have another door now this one is just a simple door so there's no button or key and again this is using the interaction method that I covered in the other video like I said those methods of interaction can be applied to anything so first in the beginning of this level I applied it to a button and over here I'm interacting directly with the door so I just press my keyboard key and there you go the door is open then over here we have the elevator which again is using the exact same interactable interface so if I'm inside the elevator and I press the interact key and there you go it plays the animation and moves the elevator up so I can press it again and there you go I start going back down so it's just a simple animation triggered by the interactive own interface okay so then we go through here and we have some more targets and some more lava pits and then over here we have the key so as I approach it there you go I've picked up the key and there you go it shows up in the UI again I cover the HOME key door system in another video then I go through here pick up some ammo pick up some more health and get down these stairs and as I approach a Collider there you go the secret door opens and then I can go through the corridor and now with the key as I approach if there you go the key is consumed and the door is open and with door open I can see my gold and I star trophy and now I can see we go through it and were ignored to win the game so that's the game in action and how it was made he can download the complete project and try them out for yourself maybe use it as a starting point to make your own doom like and in that page you can find links to all the other videos where I covered various systems in detail and that also showed here so here is a very nice and simple doom like doing let me know in the comments what other genres you'd like to see me create this video is made possible thanks to
