hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here's some quick news unity has acquired sync sketch i wasn't familiar with this one but it sounds really interesting it's a realtime collaboration tool so you can drag a file of pretty much any type so it can be a simple image or a video file or some 360 content or even a 3d model you just upload it to the platform then it works on your browser so you really just share a url and it's easily accessible you can easily play it in sync with all of your other team members and then you can easily control the playback pause at a certain frame and start drawing any notes or changes and unlike other video conferencing tools this one has no lag and no drop frames i assume the way it works is it downloads the original file in the background so you're not constantly streaming as you move the playback back and forth it's already being used by some of the biggest studios in the world so it has all the features you could possibly need for this environment they also mentioned a bunch of security centers that i'm really not familiar with but i assume they are industry standards so this is a proper professional tool these views really is one of the main selling points there is no need to download any complex software you really just open a browser window and everyone on your team can collaborate works on your desktop but also on any smartphone or tablet in today's world as things become more and more remote i definitely see the student becoming more and more useful so i can definitely understand why they bought it unity is very clearly pushing hard on a feature with more creators and making it easier and easier to create anything just like with the wet news a while ago there is no specific mention of pricing although there is a price on the sync sketch website it's pretty cheap so just 9 bucks a month for indie devs but i wonder if now that it's part of unity if there won't be some sort of free version included with the engine i could definitely see this one as being quite useful especially for small indie dev teams or specifically maybe it can be excellent for making game jams with the team especially if this becomes more title integrated with unity then that might be really useful so i'm imagining a feature where you can perhaps draw notes directly inside of unity and everybody on your team can see it at once that would be a really interesting use case so for you what do you think is this something that you would use how many of you actually work in teams versus solo i'm curious about that for me i'm mainly a programmer who works alone so for me i don't think i'll use it much but i can definitely see how it's a huge helm for artists and teams either way once again some more news that shows that unity just keeps getting better and better and i'm all for it alright so thanks for watching this quick news video and i'll see you next time you
