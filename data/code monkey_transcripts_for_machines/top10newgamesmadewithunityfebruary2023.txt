hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity and launch in February 23. this one is an interesting list I was actually really busy at the time when I usually start researching and writing these videos since at that time I was just about to finish my free multiplayer course so I didn't have as much time to research tons of games but still I had no trouble on finding lots of asomons again that's great as a player lots of awesome stuff for you to play but It's Tricky as a developer lots of really tough competition the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the element is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out the test of these games that are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way I'm currently working on my own steam game called turmoore Liberation it's a game with tons of systems open world survival crafting automation strategy check out the steam page edit to your wishlist and phone for the Devils by the way right now there's a Humble Bundle with a huge 97 off discount on Senti assets there are so many game ideas you could build with all of these maybe you could build a World War II shooter or a a plane simulator with warpack maybe even Lord of the Rings inspired RTS with this one then perhaps use the gang Warfare pack to make some kind of tycoon game maybe make your own life for that with the boss zombies you could build something like fallout shelter with the apocalypse Interiors maybe make some kind of Battle Royale with a better round pack or perhaps a songs like with the dungeon pack or really just prototype anything with a very useful prototype pack personally I'm a huge fan of their low poly song and if you also like it and you want tons of assets with a huge variety for a super deep discount then check it out to the link in the description alright so starting off at number 10 with a huge hit it sense of the force this one is the sequel to the very popular The Forest game it's survival horror with some Base building crafting and exploration elements you start off by gathering some resources and build a shelter for you and your friends but you're not alone in this Forest so you better be prepared to fight for your life there are lots of very creepy creatures and some gorgeous but scary looking environments exploring large open worm with changing seasons which also affect how the worm behaves survive alone or with friends in some nice Coop survival it just came out and already has 70 000 very positive reviews even though it's only normally access definitely a huge hit they've already sold millions of copies then from that let's look at something a lot more calm and relaxing here is my dream setup it's pretty much exactly what it says it's a simple calming game where you just build your dreams out of play some Furnitures and customize it you can paint your walls choose your computer the shape of the room and listen to some music it's interesting how this has sort of become a genre there are now a bunch of games like this one like for example unpacking or townscaper where the goal is really just calm relaxation with 400 very positive reviews it looks like this is a final genre next here we have a huge game it's an MMORPG built with unity it's called Glory evictus the way they describe the game is Mountain blade means PlanetSide 2. I must say that combination definitely intrigues me those are two excellent games you become part of this world and take on various roles so you can become a soldier assassin Huntsman blacksmith and more features nontarget combat so it's very freeform just like with PlanetSide 2 you have a huge world where you can control certain territories and includes a player driven economy where players craft all kinds of items and sell them in their own stores also has some classless progression every skill I use you improve on that skill so in all the concept seems really interesting although it does have mixed recent reviews so apparently the 1.0 release left some people wanting more if you like gorgeous 3D art and some mystery then definitely check out the panel Beyond it's a resource management Survival Story game lead your crew on your ship explore this world and gather enough resources for survival keep your crew safe and fed if you don't you might get a mutiny as they show their loyalty to a different Captain what's the decisions to make and then an engaging story to experience it has over 500 very positive reviews so if you like this type of game definitely give it a look then for some VR here is the Light Brigade it's a roguelike VR shooter combining both realistic Gunplay as well as some light magic the guns are very physical it's always satisfying to handle a bolt action rifle very Punchy very satisfying sound effects and of course beyond the guns you also have some magic at your disposal cast all kinds of spells for both offense and defense you can gather some Loot and find some new abilities it it's a roguelike so you also have lots of upgrades at your disposal to make every run better this combination of realistic Gunplay and some nice magic really looks quite interesting it has 250 very positive reviews which for VR game that is an excellent result then here we have some magical strategy with spell Force conquest of EO looks like a very well made game great visions and UI quite a lot of complexity tons of Interlocking Systems plenty of unique characters in a huge world this one isn't really a genre that I have much experience with so I can't really tell what is the quarter differentiating hook for this one it just seems like a very well built game it has 900 very positive reviews so apparently fans of this genre do really like it next here we have a deck building game with something that I haven't seen before it's Aces and Adventures nowadays there are tons and tons of deck building games on all kinds of genres with all kinds of rules this one seems unique in that it uses poker rolls so it combines unique character and Attack cards alongside regular cards if you have a simple pair you can do some small damage if you have four of a kind you can deal massive damage you can combine the flush with an ability to do some really interesting actions so in all a very interesting concept it also has some excellent voice acting alongside handcrafted campaigns and a procedural mode with 600 very positive reviews it seems to people really like this mix so if you're a fan of card games and this looks like an interesting new take next here we have another one that also has an interesting mix of genres this one is corpse keeper it describes itself as a very challenging action strategy roguelike basically you control a necromancer but you cannot fight directly so you bring some corpses back from there to fight for you in terms of games it's kind of like a fighting game you encounter an enemy summon your fighter and engage in a duel each corpse also has tons of stats that you can level up with some very unique movesets so it's an interesting mix of strategy and fighting game then here at number two is Plan B terraform this one was almost my personal pick of the month it looks really awesome these are on this Baron Rock Wasteland and it's up to you to terraform it into a lush habitable world begin by gathering some resources to feed your first settlers then more colonists will join which means you need to grow with them use trains and trucks to transport them around and get to work on making this planet livable features a deep simulation of atmosphere temperature water in the forest it is out now in Early Access which is perfect for this type of game the devs seem very active with 1 000 very positive reviews this looks like an excellent new entry in the genre and at number one for my personal pick the month here is Phantom Brigade when I first heard about the concept for this game I was immediately hooked it has a very inventive timeline mechanic where you can scroll through the timeline and see what will happen in the next few seconds then you can use that to decide how to move your mechs it's a really cool idea making for some really interesting strategy gameplay it is simultaneously both turn based and real time visually it also looks really great I love the art sound some gorgeous giant Max with a really nice sense of scale you have tons of weapons and parts to equip your Mech alongside some very satisfying destruction this one has actually been out on Epic Early Access for 3 years and now it has come to steam with the 1.0 release it already has 700 very positive reviews and what I mentioned the word hooked is really applicable here since this game is being published by brace yourself games this this one is a studio headed by Ryan Clark who has some of the best indie game marketing talks of all time if you haven't seen this video on finding any game hoax definitely go give it a watch it is no surprise that the game they have decided to publish has an extremely unique hook I definitely look forward to trying this out in a second find some time alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with the Indian team launch in February 23.
