hello and welcome I'm your code among him in this video I'm going to give you five ways to make money and game dev let's begin number one work at a game studio this is the most straightforward option you just get a normal job at an already established studio if you're just starting out it's probably the best and least risky option you will be working with people who are much more experienced than you and more than a lot from them so if you're interested in learning and becoming a better game dev you will improve a lot faster when surround by experienced people then if we try to learn it all by yourself if you get a job at a big triplea studio you will be able to see a tiny bit of your work being sold in a box copy this can be a great feeling and having some real tangible proof that you have reached your dream of becoming a game developer the pros are hopefully you won't find a job in a good studio which will give you stability in terms of hours and income so you don't constantly you have to worry about how you won't get income this month as long as you're working you won't get paid the cons however are you don't get to work on exactly what you want working in a large studio means working on someone else's idea so if you're a huge fan of management games or pointing clicks you won't really be working on those types of games in a large studio so hopefully you get a lot of stability at the cost of not having control number two freelance work being a freelancer in any industry is always an interesting and extremely challenging option it can be really interesting since you work on a multitude of different projects however it can also be extremely challenging to consistently find work and deal with all the bureaucracy of being selfemployed there might be months where in letting the great contract and get paid a nice amount for some really interesting work in some other months where he can't find anything and as a result you don't get paid at all being a freelancer is also very much dependent on your skill set if you're an artist there is a lot of places where you can put up your portfolio and try to contact for example some of any types but there are thousands upon thousands of artists looking for work so it's very tough to get paid a nice amount it is a job with a lot of supply compared to the demand and if you're a programmer unityconnect always has a bunch of interesting jobs and since code is code you can do freelance programming in any area if you know code it doesn't have to be just limited to game dev which increases the amount of offers you have available essentially when it comes to being a freelancer the main difficulty is finding work so having a nice list of recurring contacts makes it that much easier so in here it is more risky and less stable than working at a game studio but you do get to work on interesting projects and you have full control over what projects you take number three make an indie game this is the one everyone wants but also the one with the most risk it's great to be able to work on your own game ideas and create exactly the kind of game you want to create you are completely free to create anything you want you decide on what genre you want to make what weapons you create how the story goes and so on you have complete creative freedom however in choosing this path it also means that everything is on you if you work on a game for two years and it sounds 0 copies you will get zero income for all of that work so unless you have a ton of savings to burn through this can end up in a disaster poly can absolutely make any game you want you also need to make sure there is a market for it in the end this is a hypercompetitive business and when where 90% of games actually fail there are tons of games coming out every month and you have to stand out from all of them to be able to have a chance just go browse this team new releases list and see how many games fail to get just even 10 reviews but I don't want to completely discourage you I want to encourage you to make your own games but be aware of what it takes and what the chances are you won't make a profit this path can be extremely satisfying but it does come with a very large risk so if you're just starting out I would suggest you grow your skills and try to make your own games on the side once having a stable job this way you won't go homeless if the game fails but you'll still gain experience and the more experience you have the better your games will be and you will eventually be able to make it and go fulltime so if you do follow this path keep that in mind it is very risky and you might not make it but also very fulfilling when you do make it so figure out a way to minimize risk as much as possible and to it number for some assets there are several stores where you can sell assets directly to other developers if you're an artist you can sell your 3d models or textures it can also sound sounds and various scripts for things like camera control animations or shaders for example on the Unity assets or you can browse it to look at everything being offered and also while selling assets you may come across people looking for freelance work so if you're an artist and you make some great art you might be contacted for someone looking for that specific style unity promotes their assets or heavenly so if you do manage to make something good enough and useful for a lot of people you can find quite a lot of success however there are also a lot of websites offering free assets so whatever you try to sell you need to make sure it is actually worth the asking price and similar to making an indie game once you can create literally anything you want you do have to make sure that there's a market for it otherwise you won't get paid number five teach inside this option you have several different options each of these is obviously dependent on already having good knowledge of game development you can really teach people if you're just starting out first you need to gather your own knowledge and then you can try to teach people so you could get a job as a professor in a school with a game that of course nowadays there are more and more schools offering courses related to game development you could also create and someone complete premium courses this is a relatively crowd market and something I personally wouldn't like to explore in the future there are plenty of websites to jambe some courses and there's always a lot of people interested in learning game development the games industry is constantly growing so the more it grows the more there is a need for game developers so you can rest assured that there will always be people looking to learn or you can also do what I'm doing here make free videos covering all aspects of game development however I'm currently making any money on this channel so I wouldn't consider this event alternative just by itself making videos and especially on YouTube is an extremely difficult path once again there's a lot of supply relative to the demand in order to make an income you need hundreds of thousands of subs and views which are quite difficult to get the only way I can afford to work on this channel is as a side job to my indie games hopefully one day this channel will grow enough to start to pay for itself but until then it remains a side job so there you have it five ways to make money whilst working in game development they range from very stable to very risky it's up to you to decide what you value most creativity or stability if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
