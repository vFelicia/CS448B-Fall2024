hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out two awesome assets made officially by unity in order to give you a great starting point you have the first person and third person character controllers they are very feature rich and super simple to use if you don't already have some controllers you made yourself then these assets can help you get a prototype up and running very quickly they feature movement gravity camera animations and even some prebuilt touch controls they are completely free so after this you can go ahead and try them out yourself so let's inspect to see exactly what features they have and then we're going to do a very quick guide on how to add them to a brand new game now before that if you prefer a more guided path with stepbystep lectures then check out my complete courses learn how to make a bundler defender game using c sharp just like i make my own steam games or learn how to make games internally using visual scripting or learn all about unity with the ultimate overview course which contains over 13 lectures each covering a different tool or feature of the engine to help you make better games faster i'm always available in the courses q a section answering your questions every single day so check out all the courses with the link in the description okay so let's look at these two assets the first person and third person controllers like i said you can grab them for free from the unity assessor just search for it or use the links in the description just add them to your assets and open them up in ent now first of all these are made to work with unity 20.3 which is the latest lts version it's the version that i'm using here so you've got both assets the first person and the third person you can import them both into the same project they share quite a lot of files now as soon as you import them you might see a popup talking about the input system these packages are made to work with the new input system so you get this popup which has if you want to disable the legacy input and restart this project with only the new input so if you want you can just go ahead and click on yes in here but personally i still like to use the legacy input system especially for these demo videos since it's so easy to use and thankfully you can use them both at once so for me i'm just going to click on no and then go up here into edit to go into project settings and on the player tab just scroll down under other settings and down here you see a film for the active input handling and you can select the old input manager the new package or select them both so do that and it will restart the editor okay so with that everything is nice and important so i've got my star assets and over here i've got both packages the first person and the third person controller now these packages actually have some dependencies they use the new input system like we saw and also syn machine those should be installed automatically but if not you can go up here into tools start assets and reinstall dependencies so the answers themselves they've got a nice readme file so you've got links to the asset packages got some notes on dependencies and there's also a link if you want to give feedback on these packages and then there's also a pdf with documentation so here you've got a bunch more detailed info okay now to see them in action let's simply open up the demo scene so let's begin with the third person controller go inside the scenes and open up the playground so here it is and right away we see that everything is on pink now these packages come with shader for the builtin render pipeline but as usual they can be automatically converted to work with any pipeline so here i'm using urp that's why it's on pink if you're using the builtin then you don't have to do anything and if you're using urp or grp just go into edit go down here into the render pipeline universal and upgrade project materials to urp materials so just that and yep now everything is correctly using urp shaders okay and with this we can test out our scene to see it in action okay so right away here we have a really nice character in a third person view so by moving the mouse i can actually move the camera around the character and by pressing the usual movement keys was d i can simply move the character this demo comes with a bunch of animations so you've got the normal idle animation you've got a wonk animation by holding down shift i can sprint and by pressing space i can jump so all these animations are really nice all included in the project this character controller supports going up some ramps there you go as well as going up some stairs so as you can see everything works exactly as you would expect in a third person controller and now here i am on the other demo for the first person and once again everything works is all the same so i can walk i can sprint i can jump i can look around and yep everything works correctly so go up the ramp go up the stairs yep all of it perfect so as you can see these two assets make for a really awesome starting point and since this is made to be using the new input system it also automatically supports pretty much any input so i can move around with the keyboard all the great and look around the mouse and over here i've got an xbox gamepad so just by moving the joystick there you go everything works so i can sprint i can jump and yep and i can automatically change between keyboard mousepad everything perfect and on top of that the assets also include some premade touch controls you just set up the prefabs and everything works okay now that we've seen the final product let's see how the scene is set up so over here on the hierarchy the first thing that we have is the main camera so it's a pretty standard camera and it's got a send machine brain so that's pretty much it everything else is normal then you've got the player follow camera this is the virtual camera and on the type here on the body it's set up to third person follow and over here on the follow target it's set up on the player camera root which is an object inside the player so if you select it you can see yep it's that object it's an invisible object that is right around shoulder height so on the virtual camera of course you can play around all of these settings for example if you want to modify how far or close the camera is to the shoulder you can just here modify the camera distance make it closer or further away if you want to make it a bit more offset you can play around over here with the shoulder offset put it a bit more to the side and then you can play around with the camera side in order to shift from the left or right shoulder then for example if you were to build upon this to make a third person shooter you would have this as your normal camera setup and then you would make a separate virtual camera for the zoom in state so on that second virtual camera you would lower the fov in order to zoom in you'd perhaps go a bit more to the side you would push the camera a little bit forward and so on so you would make one virtual camera for normal state another one for the aim state and just swap between them let me know in the comments if you'd like to see a full tutorial on how you could take this and build a third person shooter on top now this virtual camera over here also has the optical setting so that makes it so that the camera does not go through walls so it's got a collision filter so any object with physics on the default it will not collide with this and obviously it's going to ignore the player then down here on the noise it also has a bunch of simple noise so if you play the scene if you can see the camera slightly swaying back and forth just to add a little bit more life to the scene by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks and over here on the first person for the player follow camera everything is pretty much exactly the same over here they are also still using the third person follow camera type however one thing here which is on the shoulder offset the x is set to one now only this is a mistake since it should be on zero so it's right on top of the camera so if you're watching this in the future chances are there's been an update that fixed this so that's pretty much it and everything else is exactly the same now back on the third person scene the next object we can inspect is the player itself so the first thing it's got is a simple animator the first person has no animation so no no matter what this one does and on the included animations you can see a whole bunch of animations so you've got idle wonk run you've got jumping in the air jumping and landing so it's a pretty simple state machine over here with a handful of parameters and some entries and some transitions so just with this you've got the basics and you can easily build upon this to add tons more states then on the player it's using a standard character controller everything is pretty normal with a height of 1.8 meters then you've got the third person controller script now you can mouse over each of these to see exactly what they do you've got the basic things like you can modify the movespeed the sprint speed and so on you've got some jump logic then some ground logic and over here the send machine part now here there is actually one pretty important thing that is missing which is the rotation speed for me based on my mouse settings the sensitivity is way too high so just by moving the mouse a bit i can see it rotates way too much so this sensitivity field isn't exposed anywhere but you can inspect and see all the source code so here it is the third person controller and you can see all this it's all written in a nice clean way so you can take some time to study this code now for example in order to add that sensitivity field we can just go and find the function that handles the rotation of the camera so here it is the camera rotation function and here you can see that all they're doing is taking the input log x and look y and just multiplying by delta time so you can modify this and add a simple flow to multiply so for example going up here making a public float or a serialized field i'm just keeping with the same standard use here so let's go with look sensitivity and just default it to 1f and then down here on the camera rotation we multiply the unlock by time dot all the time and then by our analog sensitivity and yeah that's pretty much it so now here we do have a field for look sensitivity and since mine was way too intense we need to put maybe 0.5 and yep now as i move the mouse around now it looks a bit more natural so just like this you can easily customize the sensitivity which will work both with mouse or gamepad or touch input so the other components you've got a basic region body push this is simply to apply a force to push some other objects and then you've got the script that handles the inputs now this one is using the new input system and if you want to see all the inputs you can open up this input action asset so you click on it and shows up over here on the project files so just double click on it and it shows up this window and here you can see all of the actions that are defined and they are defined both for keyboard as well as the mouse so this new input system is actually something that i haven't yet covered on a dedicated video but i might do it soon it's insanely powerful so you just define the actions and it works with pretty much anything and then again back on the player script over here you can see you've got a toggle for auto switch so that's how you can very easily transition from using the keyboard to a gamepad without having to do anything so it's a really awesome system okay that's the third person controller and on the first person it's all pretty much exactly the same so you've got the usual parameters and on this one you actually have the rotation speed exposed here so this one kind of works like sensitivity and everything else is pretty standard so same inputs and so on okay so now that we've seen how the demo works let's see how you can add this to an existing environment now over here i've got a really nice map this is from the cindy studios battleground pack there's a link in the description if you want to get it now for starters let's first import the first person controller since it's so simple let's just go into the certain assets inside the first person controller inside the prefabs folder over here we've got all the prefabs now the first thing that we need is the main camera so just drop the prefab here yep there it is and now if you have a main camera on your scene just delete it in my case i already deleted that so there's only one camera then next thing that we need is the player follow camera this is the virtual camera and then we need the player itself so just the player capsule and there it is now to set this up we just need to assign some things so first over here on the main camera by default this one isn't using post processing so if you have some effects just enable it there it is then on the player funnel camera the virtual camera over here it requires the follow to be assigned so this phone should be the object inside the player so just expand it grab the player camera root and put it there there it is everything else is already set and with just that if we hit on a play and yep here i am inside the map i can walk around i can see everything and yep everything works so as you can see it literally takes just 30 seconds to add it to a new scene now let's see how to add the third person controller it's pretty much the same thing so let's go inside of that folder let's go inside the third person folder and let's see the prefabs yep so first thing drag the camera then the player follow camera then if you don't want any animations you can just import the player capsule but i do want some animation so let's import the player armature okay there it is there's the character now the same thing let's just go into the font camera and just assign the player camera root there it is and once again just with this just hit play and yeah there you go it's already working so here i am in the map i can walk around i can run i can jump i can do anything yep it's got collisions everything works perfectly all right so now the next thing is i want a different character so on this same battleground pack there's a whole bunch of characters so let me pick just a random one so i've got a random character right there now i can drag this onto the scene and there's the character okay and inside it i can see this one is using this mesh so if i click on the mesh and look at it and let's see the fbx file here it is the characters and over here very importantly you can see on the rig that this one has an animation type of humanoid so that means that i can very easily swap out this character and use the exact same animations that we were using previously you can do this with any character that is set to a humanoid brick now in order to modify the character first of all we should not do any modifications to the original prefab so for that you can just right click go into prefab and unpack completely so that essentially breaks the prefab connection so now these are just normal game objects and over here inside the geometry let me just drag the character and get rid of the previous one and over here on this character prefab it comes with an animator but we don't need this since the animator is all the way up here okay then the skeleton which belongs to the other armature we can also get rid of this one and then on the player armature game object over here we can simply swap out the avatar for the one using this mesh so over here i've got the characters that's the mesh that we're using and down here it has the avatar so just drag this one and there you go all the warnings go away and everything works so if i just hit on play and there it is here is my custom character fully working so once again in just a few seconds i got a custom character fully working i can walk run jump and look around everything works i'm reusing the same animations included in the free package and this time with my nice new character alright so as you can see these two assets are really awesome they are the perfect starting point based on how easy this is to implement i could see this being a huge help in making some quick prototypes or some game jam games you really just have to drag and drop swap the assets and you have a fully working character in literally seconds really awesome stuff and once again it's all completely free so go ahead and download the packages and check them out for yourself again if you're looking for a more guided path with stepbystep lectures then check out my complete courses alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
