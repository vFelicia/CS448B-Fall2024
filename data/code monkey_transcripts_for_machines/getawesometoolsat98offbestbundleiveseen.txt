hello and welcome i'm your code monkey unity is once again collaborating with humboldt for yet another excellent bundle with an insane discount this one is all about interesting tools and as usual there's a super deep discount at 98 off so if just one of these interests you then the whole bundle is worth it usually these bundles are all about assets which means they're only useful if you like the style but this one is all about tools so regardless of whatever genre or whatever style you're working on regardless of that these tools can definitely help you quite a lot of these are completely new to me very unique tools that give me ideas for all kinds of games that i could make i've already went ahead and picked up a bundle myself so over here let's do a brief overview of all of these tools and what they all do first up here we have the top down engine this one is one of the highest rated apps on the store like name implies it helps you make topdown games either in 2d or 3d it's also one of the most complete s of all features dozens of demo scenes includes a really tight character controller and it's got excellent game feel there's lots of visual assets an inventory system ai system it even has touch controls and is multiplayer ready so if you're a fan of complete game builder tools then this is without a doubt one of the best ones next up is magic light pros this one is basically a tool to help you more easily place all of the light probes in your scene now if you've ever tried manually placing light probes then you know just how much work that is so this simple one connect tool can definitely save you a huge amount of time then the prefab world builder like the name implies this one helps you build the world with your own prefabs now for me world building is definitely one of the tasks that i most dislike i suck at making a level look good and placing all the prefabs so a tool like this one certainly helps that process you just select the prefab and click in your scene it features lots of tools for replacement so you can just click and drag to place with some randomness you can place just one object place lots of objects aligned in the grid it even lets you place objects with gravity so everything ends up with a really natural feel next up is unistorm this one lets you easily add storms to your game so this can be rain or snow or just some intense fog it definitely makes it look great so if you want your game world to feel much more alive then this would be an excellent addition then is smart lighting 2d handling lighting effects is always pretty tricky for example i cover the very basic thing in my line of sight video this tool helps you add 2d and lighting with tons and tons of options the results definitely look very impressive lots of colors lots of merging everything looks really nice and despite all that it's also mobile friendly after that is storyteller this one is a nice tool for helping you organize text dialog sound and so on definitely looks like a great tool for any kind of story heavy game up next is destroying this one is all about destructions this one features some very impressive results but these instruction tools are all about how easy it is to set up the objects looking at the tutorial videos it seems this one is more manual read than automatic but the results definitely look great then over here we have the phone screen editor this one does exactly what you expect so it makes your editor view in full screen so there are no black bars no unity interface everything is complete full screen this is definitely really useful i remember when making my own steam games that taking screenshots and recording trailers that was always a very tricky process basically if i wanted them to be in native 1080p then i had to make a build so with this tool that process would be so much similar you just press the play button everything is 100 full screen complete 1080p and also this works not just on the game view but also on scene view so this combined with the previous world building tool that can definitely make you very efficient at creating new levels then we have the better ui this one is essentially a bunch of components that extend the default ui components definitely sounds quite interesting and has quite a ton of options so this would be very useful if your game is ui heavy next up is fluxi or flux xy this one is a fluid simulator that runs in 2d or 2 and a half d it runs internally on the gpu so it is extremely performant so you can use this to simulate fire smoke water maybe simulate some paint or some really interesting effects then comes the endless book this one is a pregrade pretty simple tool easily lets you create a booklike page flipping animation honestly this is the first time i've seen this asset and definitely looks excellent so it does exactly what you want really nice great effect after that is the script inspector 3. this one is an integrated ide directly inside unity now for me i enjoy having my visual studio as a separate window but if you want to write code directly inside the engine then this can definitely be useful next up is the dialog system this one is a nice tool for helping you manage download trees you can use the graph editor to manage decisions branches and so on it was already used in this google legion so that definitely means that it can help you build an awesome awardwinning game up next is the ccg kit this one is a complete template for making a card game so very much like hearthstone gwent and so on it features a deck builder so you can easily build any cards there's a custom editor to easily set up all the rules and it even has fully integrated multiplayer support then it's very animation as you might know unity does not let you edit humanoid animations directly inside unity so this tool lets you do that compound with a bunch more features then is the mech combat kit this one is a template for making a mech game so you can easily swap between third person and cockpit view it features mechlike movement you've got a loadout system limb damage and a bunch more if you don't like visual scripting but with blocks then here is the blocks engine this one could be an excellent learning tool for anyone who learned programming by using scratch so maybe if you have some kids and you want to introduce them to programming and game development then this tool would be great after that is the train controller this one is definitely a niche tool it helps you control trains in your game so you can add set up stations stops and a bunch more so this could be interesting for example if you have a game like gta and you want to add trains to your world then is the broccoli tree creator this one helps you easily create trees and all kinds of vegetation you've got lots of randomization so no two trees won't ever look the same there's tons of settings for you to play with so the results are really nice and up next is performance tools this one is a collection of tools to help you improve performance in your game so you can optimize draw calls you can call invisible objects make some billboards and so on then a simple tool true shadow this one lets you add some nice pretty shadows to your game so the builtin ninty shadow that one is extremely basic and this one lets you take shadows to the next level you can add effects to the shadows make them more or less soft there's quite a lot of options then if you want to do some kind of 3d modeling inside unt you have this one archie matrix pro this is a node based parametric modeling tool i'm not entirely sure what that means but apparently it is based on modeling through logic the results definitely look very impressive now i've seen something sort of like this on twitter but they were usually made with blender nodes so i didn't know there was a tool to do this kind of thing directly inside unity so this one definitely looks quite interesting then we have a package for helping you handle mmo and action rpg camera this one i would need to research this to see what exactly does different from syn machine but it does have quite a ton of options and after that is modular motion this one is a really nice and simple ui animation tool the results in the video definitely look excellent adding some ui animation is usually a pain having to deal with the legacy animation system or perhaps handling it through some kind of warping library so this tool certainly has me intrigued and after that is the bone stimulator not simulator it basically lets you add wiggly body parts so you can click to play some bones and they become very wiggly there's a quick setup so it's super easy to just click and add some bones it definitely makes your animations feel much more alive alright so that's a bundle honestly i'm very impressed this might be the best bundle that i've ever seen i wasn't familiar with quite a lot of these tools despite the fact that i'm constantly looking at sales and the new ads that i released i didn't have most of these so i definitely picked it up right away as usual with such a deep discount at 98 off if just one of these looks interesting to you then home bundle is entirely worth it there's a link in the description and that link is an affiliate link so if you pick it up
