hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey 2024 is here and the new year is always a great time for some personal reflection one year ago I made a nice video talking about goal setting in general and encouraging you to make your first game in 2023 I just watched it again it's still a really great video the advice here is really Timeless so if you haven't seen this one definitely go give it a watch in general my best tip on goal setting is simply write down your goals if you just do that if you just write down your goals at massively increase your chances of actually achieving those goals so if you watched this video one year ago I hope you wrote down your goals and I hope you achieved your 2023 goals then here I also talked about my own personal 2023 goals so let's go through them one by one and see if I achieve them I the find some really important primary goals then some interesting secondary goals and finally some fun personal fitness goals so let's go through them one by one and I'll try to come up with some general takeaways that should hopefully be helpful to you starting with the primary goals and starting with the very first one which was the goal to release total World Liberation on Steam this is the game that I announced all the way back in 22 it's still a really interesting game with tons of interesting design logic it's kind of a mix of XCOM mixed with some automation elements and a persistent open world I'm still a huge fan of the idea that I have in my head however as you might know I pivoted away from this idea earlier this year I Bally realized that Total War Liberation this was going to take a massive amount of work to actually finish it was highly unlikely that I was going to be able to do with it in this year but still I really really wanted to publish another steam game in 23 my last one was battle round Tycoon which came out all the way back in 2019 that's way too long ago so I definitely really wanted to publish a game this year that's why in the beginning of this year I pivoted the way to a much SAR idea that I could actually produce in one year that turned out to be Deni Gardens which was indeed fully produced and fully developed and fully published this year it was quite stressful to build that game in just about 7 months but I'm still very happy with the final result I'm very happy with how it came out so while I technically did not achieve this goal I technically did not launch to one Liberation on Steam I did achieve the actual goal behind it which was to launch another game so yeah for this one I do consider it the success and now for 2024 the hope is to finally get back to to Liberation the takeaway from this one for you is to Simply know that it's okay to Pivot it's okay to analyze your plans and if something isn't going according to plan it's perfectly okay to adapt to a new plan I mean obviously don't just constantly pivot from idea to idea basically don't just constantly aband every idea as soon as it becomes difficult don't do that constantly but definitely do know that it's okay sometimes to adopt a plan once you analyze your current state then you see that things are a bit different than they were when you first originally made the plan then my second primary goal was to publish a free complete course and Yep this one was indeed a huge success I did manage to publish the course actually was two courses one on making it in single player and another one on multiplayer and thankfully the reception has been pretty excellent it is by far the most successful video on this channel with 1.8 million views and all the comments they are all extremely positive with tons of people really happy with knowledge included in this course they're really happy with how it's completely free and how it's really high quality personally I especially love how so many people really enjoy the focus on writing good clean code the course is not on just making a game but actually making it properly that was something very important to me and I'm really happy to see that people also value that reading the literal thousands of comments reading all of this has been wonderful and answering tons and tons of questions has been really great for my own personal journey to help me better improve in the ways that I teach and provide extra clarification on just about anything and of course I also like how despite the full video the full course being available over here for free on YouTube the full 10 hours despite that there were still over 400 people who bought the completely optional paid version and a bunch more fired some super thanks on the video I invested a bunch of money in the course by actually hiring an artist to build all the assets getting musician for all the music just so I had the rights in order to be able to distribute them along with all the project files and thanks to these General people I did manage to break even on those costs and even made a little bit of money that was definitely not something that I expected based on a completely free course so I'm really happy with that it was the T of work to make these few courses the 17 hours of excellent content so I'm really really happy with the very positive reception looking at this I definitely want to make some more free courses I have some interesting plans to mix both paid and free courses in 2024 so this should be a really interesting year in fact right now the next big project that I'm currently working on is a complete C course going everywhere from complete beginners to Advanced and I'm planning a similar plan trying to make it free with an optional paid version so stay tuned for that now this topic I'm not sure I can come up with a good General takeaway that is applicable unless you also have some kind of Channel teaching game development maybe the takeaway is sometimes it's good to do things just for the community as opposed to always for profit so perhaps the takeaway could be contribute to some open source software maybe if you have have some knowledge maybe Mentor some beginner or simply spend some time answering questions on Reddit or Discord so for this goal yep I can also consider this a massive success then the third primary goal making complete dots 1.0 course now for this one yeah it didn't really work out the reason is simply because I really really wanted to make a game this year and making dinky Guardians alongside keeping videos on this channel doing that was a huge challenge definitely more difficult definitely a lot more worth than I originally anticipated so I didn't have time for even more big projects other than these ones so technically this one did not work out although right now I actually just recently got back into dots I've been spending the last few weeks researching entities 1.2 to make another huge free tutorial I still have to record and edit this one this is going to be the next video on this channel so stay tuned maybe this Friday or Saturday and after I finish the C course the next big project that I want to make is indeed this Dot scor and speaking of that let me just ask you a similar question on making a DOT scor what kind of game would you like to see made I've got a bunch of ideas for genres that I think would be useful to make something using dots but I still haven't decided on anything so do let me know your thoughts on the comments and the general takeaway from this topic General takeaway is really based on the fact that I failed this primary goal and the takeaway for you is simply don't be too hard on yourself if you eventually don't complete your goals personally I could be really upset at myself right now for not achieving this goal but really two things come to mind number one I know the reason why I couldn't do it is perfectly valid I was already working on a game and a ton more stuff so it was literally impossible for me to work on another big project on top of everything that I did and more importantly number two is I simply know that would not be helpful punishing yourself when you don't acheve achieve a goal is really not a good use of your time and energy if you quote unquote fail to achieve a goal just like I did then simply accept that and move on there's simply no point in punishing yourself and dwelling in the past just move on and try to achieve that goal in the future which is exactly my plan exactly what I'm going to do in 2024 so out of my primary goals I managed to achieve two of them and I failed one of them so I think that's a pretty good result I'm definitely happy about this then on the secondary goals first of all make more live streams I just checked the numbers and I ended up doing exactly the same amount that I did in the previous year I did a total of 10 live streams throughout the year so it didn't quite work out but still I wouldn't call this a Miss while I could have done better I do think this was a pretty decent result honestly for me making live streams is still quite stressful I am very much an introvert and just being here facing a camera this is still quite stressful still quite intimidating thankfully I have gotten quite a bit better at just this recording to a camera but doing it live is a whole different thing so the fact that I push through it and still managed to do 10 live streams I'm pretty happy with that although this goal I'm definitely keeping it for 2024 I would really love to one day get to the point where I can easily make a live stream every week and keep a nice regular schedule speaking of schedule the next goal was keep a regular video schedule so the goal was to continue posting two to three times per week and on this one yep I definitely did achieve this one honestly I'm pretty impressed with myself I'm pretty happy with the fact that I achieved this goal again because I spent so much of this year working on both the free courses and on thinky Guardians like I said it was really tricky really stressful working on the game and making regular videos at the same time in total I think I made 160 videos this year and even though I grossly underestimated the amount of to be able to do this whilst making a game at the same time even though I still managed to achieve both of those so I'm really happy with myself although in 2024 one of my goals is to hopefully have a bit more of a balanced life rather than working nonstop the whole year and one of the things that supposedly helps me with that is what was one of my secondary goals her and editor and Y this year I did experiment with a bunch of editors and the experiment has been pretty successful now I still edit most of my videos I would say maybe about 70% of them that is techly still quite a bit high but it is less than 100% which was the case for the past 4 years years so compared to that I would say it's going pretty good hiring an editor gives me a bit more time which I can then dedicate to make more complex videos or simply have a little bit of time offs the next goal was hit 500k subs and if this one was awesome I did manage to achieve this one right after unite so really thank you all so much for watching the videos and subscribing to the channel it's honestly really insane for me to imagine 500,000 people clicking that button these past 5 years have definitely been crazy I'm really happy with this journey and I really hope you've learned a ton from the videos so thank you all so much for being here I do love doing this and I definitely plan to continue doing it for many many years in the future who knows hopefully in a few years I'll hit the 1 million Mark then the next goal hit 50 million views this one not quite but kind of almost got it the current total is 47 million so we should be able to hit that within the next 3 to four months in terms of views at the channel technically didn't grow too much but in terms of watch time that one did increase by quite a bit some like a 40% increase probably a lot due to the free 10hour course so this one technically didn't hit it but still very happy with the current growth in the channel and then finally something very personal are my fitness goals like I've mentioned several times is something that is really important to me and I really think it's one of the main reasons why even though I work way too much I still haven't suffered from burnout I work nonstop 7 days a week with no vacations holidays or even weekends and the two reasons why I can do that without burning out is well first of all it's actually my dogs I love going with them on regular walks that really helps me disconnect a bit from my PC and secondly my gym time which I really don't sacrifice for anything it is really extremely important to me in order to be able to continue functioning so for these goals first of all hit a new deadli PR and for this one I didn't actually hit it I didn't Focus too much on deadlift this year and I haven't really tried going for an uppr in a while I did a few sets a few weeks ago with 175 kilos and that one felt pretty good so if I tried maybe I could get a uppr then on the bench the goal was to get a new PR back then my absolute Max was 110 kilos and this one Yep this one I did manage to achieve it just a few weeks ago I did two reps with 115 and that felt pretty good the bar was moving nice it was controlling that was great lately I've been doing sets of eight with 100 kilos which a few years ago this was was my dream to be able to get to the point where I could reliably do sets of eight with 100 kilos with two plates and Y right now I can definitely do that for me the bench was honestly usually not my favorite exercise but lately this year this has definitely been something that I've been loving the next goal was run 20 km now just before I Define these goals for 2023 just before this I had run my first NK race ever so back then the goal was to run 20 km and Y this one was definitely a massive success back in March I did join the enison half marathon and I did manage to complete it then I did a ton of train almost ran 1,000 kilm this past year and in October literally just one week after launching my game d Gardens I did the El leson full marathon and I did manage to complete it I mean I did pretty much Lim to the Finish Line I was all messed up for the last 10 kilm but I did go past the Finish Line my total time was 5 hours and 7 minutes so definitely a lot of room to improve but I'm very happy with this result and the final one hit 10% body fat honestly I've had this goal for the past some like seven years and this one nope I definitely did not achieve it personally I have a lot of trouble with food control and despite running a ton last year I still managed to eat way too more than I ran lowest I got was probably 15.5% body fat with about 81 kilos I have to say when I first started going to gym seriously that was about 7 years ago and that was when I learned about the concept of bonking and of course as soon as I saw that I definitely love that concept right away basically you're tell me I can eat whatever I want and I'm going to be able to put on muscle and that's actually a good thing I was around 76 kills back then I thought that was awesome so I just ate everything I could find and in about 3 months I went from 76 to almost 90 and I have pretty much say buol up ever since I'm always going between 82 and 84 so this goal of hitting 10% this has been my constant goal for the past few years and I still haven't hit it but hopefully 2024 is the final year on this topic of Fitness I highly highly encourage you to do something you don't have to take it as seriously as I do personally I love it so I do it a lot but you can just do something basic just something like 45 minutes three times a week that is more than enough if you just do that that will give you a ton of benefits and you don't have to do lifting there's a million ways to train so just find what you enjoy the most especially considering how Game Dev programming these are very sedentary jobs you are sitting all the time so combining that with some physical fitness I think that is extremely important personally I want to keep making games by the time I'm 80 so I definitely take this part quite seriously so looking at this whole list I'm quite happy with the results I did manage to hit most of my goals like I said the original video is great and on the topic of goals this advice is really Timeless so I definitely encourage you to go watch this video and title that I made for the video was make your first game in 2023 so let me ask you did you make your first game in 2023 did you achieve your goals both your professional and your personal goals I really hope you had a great 2023 and I really hope you have a successful 2024 personally I'm very much looking forward to all the projects that I have planned for 2024 so once again thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time
