hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the SSR is full of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video I'm gonna check out some highlights for apron 23. this one is a list of paid systems and two owns in the last video I'm already covered the best three new assets and next one I will cover top visions and effects as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order this video is sponsored by gamedev Guild this is a 5 Day online Game Dev conference specifically tailored for Unity devs and focus on giving you practical actionable usable advice watch over 35 Tonks from industry experts including Unity Co John riccatello Jason Wyman Thomas brush lionelux turbo mixed games and many more join the virtual expo hall where you can walk around visit booths and network with people using the integrated proximity chat the ticket also includes over two thousand dollars worth of free bonuses including some very useful assets and some subscription to tools like Unity Pro and jetprint's writer and there is also a free one day pass which includes free access to all the sessions from the first day it starts on May 1st until the 5th so if you want to improve your yinty gamedev skills check it out to the link in the description and use the coupon code monkey20 to get a nice 20 discount alright so starting off with a really impressive rope tool it looks extremely natural very impressive the ropes can sway back and forth they are connected in various ways you can connect ropes to other ropes you can push them around you can modify the mesh to simulate some chains you can even drag some objects with ropes attach them to an object and even bend it so really it has tons of possibility adding something like this really helps the game feel much more natural adding these kinds of tiny physics always makes it look great it runs on your GPU so it's extremely performant allowing you to have tons and tons of ropes in your game next up we have a fun one it's a volumetric hit map you define a volume and size it then you can add data at any point inside that volume and easily visualize it in multiple ways the data is just a simple list of vector 3 which you can populate in any way you want so perhaps it's your player's movement pattern perhaps it's in a list of where the players died maybe wear some coins were either spent or acquire it's a really nice data visualization tool which could definitely help you as a developer in order to analyze some gameplay or you could include it in your game so your players can visualize their own data and learn how to play better then here we have a nice enemy AI system perfect for any kind of stealthy game you define the enemy Patrol areas you can throw things to distract some cards they won't walk there and go into another state it features a cover system where enemies will not see you if behind cover then over time their alert level goes down although if you do get spotted they start shooting other enemies can listen to the shooting and attack the player so you could see this as being an excellent starting point if you want to build a nice stealthy game kind of like Splinter Cell up next here is an interesting tool that can be very useful if you use any external assets it's a mesh extractor so you can grab any assets you have maybe from an asset pack then you can click to select only the parts of data that you want and you can extract them onto their own separate mesh it definitely looks like a very useful tool I've needed to do this exact thing a bunch of times and the only way that I knew how to do that was using Pro Builder however Pro Builder the cut to only is quite a bit janky it always has has some issues whereas this one seems to work perfectly in every scenario you can extract the mesh position the pivot extract the textures and Export it as an obj definitely a very useful tool to have in your tone box up next is another very useful tool this one is for painting meshes so you pick up a mesh any mesh then you can simply use the mouse to select individual polygons and paint them with a different material this can be especially useful if you don't like using a low poly Style just like I do it works great for selecting each individual polygon and painting them in any way it works on static meshes as well as on skin meshes so for example if you have some character and you want to change the visual without changing the entire material then with this you can just select the parts you want and color them differently it's simple and does exactly what you want next up if you want to make some node based visuals check out this one it helps you create your own nodebased elements during runtime so this one is not an additive tool for making notes rather it works in game so perhaps you could use it for drawing something like a circuit board or maybe some waypoints maybe you could include it in your game with some kind of Muddy tools to allow the player to create some custom AI or something you can click and drag to move some nodes either remove some connections Define input and output points and Visually it looks really nice with some animated errors and dynamic shapes and the nodes themselves you can also change the visual so they can be just squares or really any visual you want definitely very interesting tool then if you want to generate a ton of trees and look at this one it features a ton of generation settings all of them based on sliders or Curves which makes it really easy to quickly iterate the results are certainly very unique lots of different types that you can create if you need even more control you can also modify the actual tree mesh itself it includes some animated shaders so the trees can move with the wind and also includes a placement tool so you can Define some settings to generate something and then easily Place hundreds of them in the world up next we have a nice flocking algorithm you can spawn some objects and watch as they flock together and move around now these objects can be whatever you want so perhaps they are birds flying around or maybe fish swimming they flock around in a nice satisfying manner there is a CPU and a GPU implementation worse on both 2D and 3D then if you have some performance issues with your game you should probably be using LEDs if you don't want to build them yourself then this zone for generating them in runtime can definitely help the generation is extremely seamless I cannot notice when they swap at all it works on both static as well as Skin meshes it's super easy use just drop a script on your object and that's it it uses a native library for mesh generation so it's all super fast then here is a very interesting one that could definitely be very useful it helps you easily add tabs for just about anything you can make a tab for a specific game object or a certain folder you can create new tabs shifts between them or close them it's a simple tool that does exactly what you expect alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the NTS store for April 23 there's only so in the description and as bonus you can use a coupon code monkey tend to get 10 off your earning also check out my own free and paid Aston store alright hope that's useful and check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
