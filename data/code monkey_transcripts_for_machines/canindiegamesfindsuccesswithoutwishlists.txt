hello and welcome I'm your KMI now if you're an India Dev you've certainly heard people like myself and other of devs asky to wish list their game that's because wish lists are extremely important nowadays I mention it pretty much every chance that I got while I was working on my game in the end it launched with about 4500 wish lists and found some pretty nice success now every once in a while when I mention just how crucial wish lists are nowadays when I say that there are always one or two comments that disagree and usually their argument is twofold first of all they say how wish lists don't guarantee sales because it's really just someone pressing a button for for free and that doesn't necessarily mean that they won't buy the game when it's out this argument is somewhat true meaning that wish lists do not guarantee success I won't cover a few examples on that in a little bit and then the second argument this one goes something like look at the games like vampire survivors and look at how they found massive success even without any wish list and again that one is technically true vampire survivors is indeed a huge mega Indie hit I Believe by now they've sold over 3 million coms on seam that is an insane amount and looking over here at seam DB we can see how many wish lists they had before release we can't directly see number of wish lists but we can't see number of followers and as a general rule wish lists are about 10 times followers as an example my own game launched with 4,500 wish lists and if I go down in the charts and I see just before release I can see that my game launched with about 300 followers now the numbers are a little bit off in my case probably because I have this channel so that kind of changes things a little bit but the general consensus is that wish lists are about 10 times followers so with that information we can look at the vampire Survivor stats and if we go down into charts and we see the wish list number for of all we see an insane increase this is how successful this game is and the release over here this one is the 1.0 release but we can see all the way back into the Early Access release the Early Access launch was on December 17 2021 so let's really zoom in onto this tiny part of the graph and up here we have 21 December 2021 and they had just 30 followers meaning they had roughly about 300 wish lists at launch so looking at this example it seems like those people are correct this game did not have a ton of wish list at launch in fact they had a tiny amount and yet this became one of the biggest hits of the past decade yet another example is phasmophobia this is another huge hit they've got 500,000 reviews in a previous video I covered the math on how you can estimate game sales based on reviews generally the multiplier for that one is about 40 so with 500,000 reviews chances are they sold 2 million copies and again we can go to steamdb and check out how many they had before release and in this case we can see phasmophobia had about 400 followers so about 4,000 wish list so a bit better than vampire survivors but certainly nothing compared to the massive amount of sales like I said my own game launched with about 4500 wish list and definitely did not sell 2 million copies that is an insane amount so selling that many based on this number of wish list once again that seems to be an example of how wish lists don't matter because again another one that had a tiny amount of wish list and sold a massive amount of copies but of course if you know anything about statistics and you can probably already guess he FL in this argument the argument of technically you don't need wish list to find success for that argument these games are really the exception these are not R so while it is technically possible to find massive success without wish list doing that is essentially winning the lottery which here of course every single week or every single month everyone always wins the lottery there's always someone who gets millions of dollars but that of course overshadows all of the millions of people that also bought the lottery and didn't win anything I also made two really interesting videos a while ago related to this topic one on how the game punch a bunch found massive success and another one on why my free game my free kitchen chaos game why that one did not find success definitely go watch those videos because pretty much spoiler alert the answer to both of those the answer is the same which is wish list we can go on to seam and check out the list of popular new releases over here we can get a nice idea of just how many games are being successful pretty much any game that manages to land on this list pretty much any of those are going to find some success and again over here we can look at the number of views in order to get a nice proxy for how many s sold for example here is fly out which as of right now has 274 reviews again the multiplayer nowadays is about 40 so we can guess admit that they've sold probably around 12,000 copies this one came out 5 days from the time this recording so definitely a huge success and we can go into cdb and see how many they had just before release and the answer is they had 3,000 followers so about 30,000 wish list that's a huge amount that's definitely enough to find success let's look at another example like this one below the stone this one has 80 user reviews so it has probably sold about 3,000 copies in 5 days again pretty nice result and we can go and check out the follower stats and see that Yep this one also launched with about 40,000 wish lists so looking at these successful games we can see that for the most part they had a decent amount of wish list before release now compare that to the all new release list so this is the list of Games published on Steam and literally everything and right away as we look we can already see something we can already see that tons of these don't even have a review icon meaning they don't even have 10 reviews 10 reviews would be about 500 copies sold so we can see that the majority of games don't even sell 500 copies like I've mentioned several times I definitely encourage you to make games just because it's a very fun activity it's a very fun thing to create but also remember that this is a real tough business anyone can make games for fun but making games that are financially successful you can see how that is quite a bit more difficult so again we can inspect all of these games like for example this one over here which should actually managed to hit 10 user reviews it's called you have no time and this one launched with 13 followers so about 130 wish lists then let's see this one which looks like a competent platformer but seems to have just one user review and looking at the followers again just about 10 followers so just about 100 wish list or this one super dungon designer which sounds like an interesting concept and again we see about 300 followers so about 3,000 wish lists that is actually a somewhat decent amount but in general you need about 7,000 order to get on the popular upcoming so even with a decent amount sadly it doesn't really turn into much success now coming back to that first argument where wish list do not guarantee sales that argument is actually somewhat correct meaning that pressing a button just to add the game to your wish list that pressing that button is free so that is actually very different from actually spending some money there are examples of games that had wish list but did not find success here's one example a game called curiosity and if we see we can see that before release they had about about 1,000 followers so about 10,000 wish list that should be enough to have a successful launch but we can see sadly just got 22 reviews so that means it probably sold around 800 copies another example is called USC counterforce this one launched with about 2,000 followers so about 20,000 wish list that's a really nice amount but sadly looking at the reviews only 44 reviews so only maybe about 2,000 copies sold so definitely not terrible but you would definitely expect more from 20,000 wish list I'm pretty sure I even saw this one in a splattercat gaming video so this one did get quite a lot of knowledge and reviews seem positive so this definitely a strange sadly subpar result so basically with regards to this argument the answer is actually quite simple wish lists do not guarantee success but lack of wish list almost certainly guarantees failure although another part of this argument is indeed with regards to wish list quality that is certainly a possible Factor however that generally only becomes a factor if you're trying to do something Shady if you're doing things like giveaways giving something away in order to get people to wish list your game so they have to wish list your game in order to sign up for some kind of giveaway if you do that then you yeah those people generally have no interest in the game at all so that will definitely Pat out the numbers but it won't actually convert it won't actually sell to any players or even worse if you literally go to something like the Amazon Mechanical Turk and you pay pretty much 1 cent to have random people wish list your game if you do that then yeah that won't definitely gather a ton of wish list but those will not convert at all so that will really not matter but in general as long as you're not trying to game the system in general the quality of the wish list won't be normal so the total number of wishes does end up being a great predictor of success for the game for example in the game car has a Monumental amount of wish list it's one of the most wish listed games on seam and we can see over here the follower count right now it has an insane 1,000 followers so probably above 1.5 million wish list and since the audience is more casual chances are it's more than that so chances are it's probably over a 2 million wish list that is an insane mind boggly amount it is literally number 19 on the entirety of scene now those wish list might not convert as well as regular games just because his audience probably leans more towards the younger side although at the same time time by now some of those kids have probably grown and have probably gotten a job but still those wish list those were all gathered organically through his videos they were not gathered through any shady means so when the game does come out even if a lot of those do not convert the game will still pretty much be a guaranteed massive success so my advice to you is if you're an indie daav trying to find success then definitely make sure you do everything you can everything in your power to gather a nice amount of wish list before release the general number you should aim for is at least 7,000 that is roughly the amount that you need in order to get on the PO coming list if you want to try doing this as a job if you want to try finding success if so then marketing really is not optional it is something you have to do you can go watch my marketing video to learn the basics do that and gather as many wish lists as you can through whatever method you can so these could be blog posts they could be rivs posts on Twitter Dev Vlogs meme videos shorts tutorials really whatever method works for you for me my main method is this educational channel so I make tutorials and people enjoy the tutorials that I make and they also see nontutorial videos so for example days on my devlogs and through those I managed to gather the 4500 wish list and with that my game had a pretty successful launch but at the same time like I always say you can definitely make games just for fun so if you don't want to turn this into a job at all then feel free to ignore all this and just make an awesome game and if you want to learn how to make games better and faster check out my ultimate T overiew course I just put out the 5if three update bringing the number of lectures over 70 each one covers a different tool or feature of the engine and many of which you might not know about and might be super useful to whatever game you're currently working on or all you need are just some tools and there are two excellent bundles right now there's one on Humble Bundle with a massive amount of stuff all at 98% off and one on the assur ending soon containing tons of assets to build pretty much any game you can think of all right so I really wish you the best of luck with your games thanks
