in this video I'm going to go over my highlights from the unite 2019 Copenhagen keynote there's lots of awesome news on dots to the AR and more let's begin so I just got back from the unite and it was an excellent experience tons of great thoughts on just about every topic and booths filmed with awesome people doing cool stuff all the unity people were really nice and Copenhagen is a beautiful city I also met a bunch of other inunity youtubers for the first time and we had a ton of fun so it was a really actionpacked week again it's a great event and if you haven't been I definitely encourage you to go someday now let's check out a keynote how it's so for me I have to start with dots how much performance so naturally I adore dots so far the main comments against dots and ECS that I've seen in my videos are mostly to do with the amount of code that you need to write to do something simple well thankfully it seems unity is tackling that problem ahead on starting with twenty nineteen point three there are two things that greatly reduced the amount of code one of the things is actually something I haven't covered yet but it's on my list which is the conversion workflow previously you would need to override a function to implement the dots components that match up with the mono behaviors you add it to an object now you can simply use an attribute if you don't need any custom logic so that helps cut down quite a nice chunk of boilerplate code the most awesome thing is you no longer need to define a job struct for simple jobs you can just do an entities for each and it will automatically create and complete the job all while using bursts this is a massive awesome change since previously the way I would do things was I would always start by making a normal component system I would get on pelagic working and only then I would convert the component system into a job system now with this change I no longer need those two steps just do one entities for each and your code is automatically benefiting from multiple threads and burst for very easy insane performance so you go from this to this which is much more condensed faster to write and easier to understand also on the roadmap talk it was announced that a dot score stack which is ECS the job system and we'll all be out of preview and production ready in 2020 point one and again everything is still available as a package including the source code so you can inspect it to see how it works and if you have an issue you can follow along with East actors now unity is pretty much designed on what they think should be the correct dad's workflow they want people to continually using game objects like they've always done and then in run time it all gets converted into superfast entities to achieve that in an easy manner there is now in 2019 point three a simple box you can take to convert a game object into an entity if your object requires specific logic in order to achieve conversion you can still make your own conversion script when you run the game the object will be converted into an entity and by selecting that object and Luckman the inspector you can see the various ECS components that were added to the entity and the values that they currently can think so it's now very easy to visually see a specific entity and see the EECS internals all this makes it very easy to work with game objects like you've always done but benefit from the massive performance during run time there is a new complete thirdperson shooter which is built completely using dots and contains a ton of features it has animation physics multiplayer audio live link and more I think it's the first project that is completely 100% done using dots so I'm really looking for this one and picking it apart I've seen some talks on how the multiplier works and it seems really interesting speaking of lively that was something they showcase some more essentially you can have a build running and the editor still open then you can easily make changes in the editor and see them change instantly in the build the build can also be running anywhere like on another PC or console or mobile so this is gonna be an awesome tool for quickly iterating on things like level design and general testing to find the perfect values that make your game great it's also great for iterating on performance for specific parts of your mother so for example if a specific areas are running slow you can very easily remove things and watch how the build player performs multiplayer was mentioned in the thirdperson shooter demo and like all the other features should be coming out in 2019 three I'm really looking forward to fling around with the normal implementation as well as just using the transport package directly they also highlighted the various extra features that are also coming like the dedicated service and matchmaking and also voice communication again all of this should be implemented in the third person shooter which will be able to inspect and see exactly how its implemented a Argentine needs to be supported and improved this is another area I'd love to play around with being able to build your project once and have it run anywhere is an excellent feature and one of the main reasons why unity has been so successful so it's great to see that apply to a are you can also now include the in library in native apps which sounds like an excellent way to add AR features to an already built native app they also showed someone driving a Volvo wearing a our classes no idea if that's meant to be something real or just a weird ever but it worked quite funny and this is just an example of unity expanding into different areas there were lots of automotive focused features and Boots present that show another area a unity is expanding into is for architects and construction they show the demo where you edit the building specs and the 3d model automatically refreshes and you can also use AR to visually see your building on for again now really relevant to game developers but it's awesome how unity has so many different use cases and they continue expanding more and more then there's the scriptable and render pipeline VFX graph and shadow graph which are all becoming productionready so you can safely use them in whatever game you're working on also in case you don't know the almighty wait render pipeline has been renamed into the universal render pipeline so now you have the universal and the high definition what's a focus on awesome 2d features for me I really like 2d which for quite awhile felt like it wasn't really getting much attention since all the features were 3d focused however in these past few years things have really changed and now there's tons of awesome features already done and more coming they show that gorgeous demo using the universal render pipeline which now has a 2d specific render you can see glowing particles dynamic shadows a day/night cycle by easily moving a slider to the lights with easily five volt gizmos reflections on the water using a shader made in shader graph spreadsheet for easily placing curves bound based animations with the option to easily swap out sprites the whole demo looks absolutely gorgeous so yeah a ton of 2d features to help you easily create awesome 2d games I'm really looking forward to playing around with all these features in the future continuing the story from the previous unite we saw the hair tech part 2 as always unity cinematics are just gorgeous and insanely high quality we've gotten used to it so it really makes you almost forget just how impressive they really are I mean they're running this cinematic with this insane quality on a normal rate running at 30 frames per second just 10 years ago you would need a server farm and spend several hours to render a single frame with this level of fidelity so that really puts it into perspective just how impressive all this tech is and more than that there's really nothing special hidden there using the shadowgraph Cena machine lighting animation and more of the things you see are made using the exact same tools that all of us have access to so it's really great to see just how far you can push the engine and apparently the beard is using the C sharp jump system to update the position of every hair in runtime then they showed something called EMT simulation and game tuning these seem to be powered by a machine learning and the cloud to help you test your games thousands of times in a short number of hours the concept seems excellent but I'm not very clear on how the implementation works so does it just push buttons randomly until it encounters a wind condition or do you need to train it to play properly if so how complex is a training procedure so not too clear on the specifics but definitely interested in what they're trying to do so that's the keynote and it had a lot of great stuff that are already available and even more to look forward to in the future Dodd's continues to be awesome and I look forward to playing around with these new features when they come out in 20 19.3 it seems unity is simultaneously building up its core features while also branching out to completely different applications like automotive and building and for you as someone who is learning unity all this should make you feel really good about your future prospects the more integrals both inside and outside of game development the more job options there are the future is looking bright and I look forward to doing my research so I can do videos on these exciting features so stay tuned all right see you next time
