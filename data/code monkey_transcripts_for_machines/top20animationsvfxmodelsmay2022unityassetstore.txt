hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asus zor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for may 22. even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can immediately picture all the kind of games that i could build this one is the list of paid ads and effects i've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and the best stones and systems go watch the playlist if you haven't seen them as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 percent off your order alright so starting off with a great animation pack full of traversal animations one of the tutorial topics that i've had on my list for quite some time is doing some kind of parkour system and for that using an animation pack like this one would be perfect it's got tons of actions from some very generic ones like just climbing a ledge to some more exotic ones like bouncing on a beam or doing a cartwheel then for some nice effects here's some fire and smoke really great looking with tons of variation so if your game involves massive fires or some colored smoke points and this one looks great up next here's some asian architecture very unique if you're making something inspired by ghost of sushima then this looks perfect it's got plenty of modular pieces for you to make your own buildings or maybe you need some general animations to liven up your crowd so look at this one in total 190 animations tons of unique ones you've got wonk set stand dialogue cheer and tons more then for a single gorgeous looking model here's a nice dragon really gorgeous i love design and texture on this one it includes this super high resolution model as well as a bunch of animations so this would be perfect for a boss fight or perhaps the player in some kind of dragon game then something very jolly and stylized here's a nice environment it's really nice and cartoony with an ancient setting tons of building pieces you've got trees bushes rocks and many more then if you want just a great map instead of having to build yourself here's a nice desert map this one also has a really nice stylized look and some parts of it are clearly inspired by those two which i love right away and of course you don't have to use this specific map you can take all the parts and build your own up next if your game has guns and you need some muzzle flashes check out this one it's got quite a lot of variety in the shapes some are pretty small like for a small pistol where there's others look truly massive and very intimidating and as usual you can color them into any color so you can make some regular standard guns or some scifi looking particles but if your game is medieval then perhaps this gorgeous knight would fit it's a super high quality model with a bunch of customizable parts if your game is set during the crusades or something like assassin's screen then this would be perfect up next if you're looking for some 2d here's some great environmental sprites perfect for any 2d side scroller you've got lots of variations so you can build several unique biomes for your game then if your game involves lots of loot this loot animation set would fit perfectly you have regular animation just opening a simple chest and then some more interesting ones like for example picking up some item from the floor you've got some opening up some drawers loading a body or opening a backpack if your game requires some warships look at this one it's a bunch of super highend detailed models include seven unique ones includes a drone carrier a submarine destroyer hovercraft and a bunch more for something a bit more casual here you have a bunch of interesting hypercasual characters lots of unique body shapes i can see this one as being perfect for some kind of minimalist management game where each body shape does one specific task they all have skeletons so even though they have different shapes they work with any humanoid animations then a nice screen space effect it makes crevices much more pronounced with some much more intense highlights and shadows i very much like the look on this effect it works perfectly with low poly assets which is usually the sound that i go in so i'm thinking i might pick this one up to add that tiny bit of extra polish to my videos then a nice pack with a bunch of survival or construction tools there's over 200 models of all kinds of useful tools and props plenty of barrels drills boxes containers and lots more or maybe if your game involves a bunch of character buffs then this effect pack would be perfect you've got lots of auras that can represent pretty much anything you want so maybe you have some special berserk mode for characters or maybe some characters on fire another one has cross resistance really tons of variety that again can mean whatever you want in your game for something more realistic you have this coworking office great models definitely very realistic so perhaps if you're making some sort of office tycoon game or maybe you just need an environment for your vr game then this looks like it would be perfect if you're working on a racing game and you need a gorgeous looking car check out this one obviously very much inspired by porsche also has a very high detail interior and if you like this model then this dev has tons more cars with this same level of quality for a highly customizable character you have this one it's a cartoon kid so if that's your target audience and this looks great and then for some ui here is one meant for casual rpgs and mmos it's the usual mobile style with tons of objects and tons of elements alright so those are my top 20 new
