hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with un launch in October 23 I think this was actually one of the toughest months ever usually when I go through the new release list I find about 15 to 20 games that look interesting and then cut them down to just 10 but this time there were over 30 that look really awesome really unique it was definitely really tricky to get them down to just 10 and a lot of these actually have overwhelmingly positive reviews which is an insanely difficult score to get the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all of these games are inally impressive so the list in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick the most and of course let me start off by mentioning my own game which also came out in October I don't want it to take up a slot on the list itself so this is an honorable mention it's a fun game with automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you build a colony automate it and keep the tiny defenseless dinky safe from harm you then colonize other planets gather more resources with the ultimate goal of colonizing every planet and automating everything so your dinkies can finally relax it's out now and seam I hope hope you like it and please make sure to write review your thoughts also right now you can get a free asset on the assur it's a really great basic animation pack now Technically when this video goes live the sale will have changed however the last time that I mentioned this people said in the comments that you could still use the coupon even after the sale changes so just search for this pack basic motions and use the coupon Kevin Legasus and it should be free let me know if this does work and whatever new s happens by the time this video goes live that one will probably also have a free asset I don't know what it's going to be but it should be free using another coupon all right so starting off at number 10 with a game that is seriously blowing up it's called outpath this one had one of the most successful demos of the last seam festival and that demo success definitely translated into massive sales success the game is basically the definition of the word satisfying it's a nice exploring crafting building game with an interesting 3D style features lots of very satisfying animations and sound effects one thing that I heard about this one that made me immediately interested is when someone described it basically as forager in 3D I absolutely loved forager that's another game where it's just just so insanely satisfying every action feels so good and this one seems very much like it but in 3D which certainly changed things you start off on a tiny Island and gather some basic resources but after a while you expand and expand until you have this massive island with tons of buildings and resources all over the place if you like building crafting games and this is definitely one you can't miss it's out now and in less than a month already has almost a th000 overwhelmingly positive views at 95% positive that's insane then here we have a really unique one it's a motor Vania called Leica H3 blood so it's a Metro Vania but you drive a bike definitely very unique concept I don't think I've ever seen anything like this and on top of that it's actually western themed so this looks like a really weird mix of genres visuals and mechanics but based on reviews it really does work you've got all kinds of abilities and a weapon to take down enemies you can do an air Dash while driving your bike then in midair fire your shotgun and watch as the enemies turn into a mist of blood the controls look really nice and fluid it's all in a sid scrolling perspective with some ramps that allow you to make some really nice tricks and the movement is also a mechanic itself you can Parry bullets if you block them with the underside of the bike so that involves lots of twisting lots of back flips in order to both survive and attack the enemies vehicle games are actually usually Prett Niche but this one is finding massive success it is out now and already has a th000 overwhelming positive views at 95% positive next if you're looking for a SciFi super fastpaced FPS Rog light then check out battle Shapers it features some real intense action with a multitude of weapons and abilities being a Rog light means you go on multiple runs you can make your build from tons of unique weapons and defeat some really interesting enemies your right hand holds your weapon whilst the left hand controls your abilities or simply punches some enemies for every boss you defeat the next run becomes much harder you can do all of this while looking awesome in this excellent visual style someone mentioned in the reviews that this game is basically what would happen if Mega Man and doom had a baby so if that sounds interesting definitely give it a shot it is out now in Early Access with 150 very positive viws then here's one where honestly I'm interested just based on the name it's called wizard with a Gun there's certainly something to be said about coming up with a funny unique interesting name for your game if you come up with something like this then just having an interesting name will make marketing the game so much easier but thankfully for this one it is not just an interesting name the game itself also looks great it describes itself as an online sandbox Survival game for up to one or two players it's very much along the lines of Don't Starve which for me don't starve is one of my favorite games I played it all the way back when it was a game that you played on Chrome and back then I loved it so based on that comparison alone I'm already interesting you explore this world in nice 2D 3D style like name implies you've got a gun but obviously you have tons of customization to make that gun exactly as you want it tons of upgrades and unique ammo that you can craft by gathering resources from the world you can make bullets that go through enemies or bullets that return to the player or maybe Grant your life or poison enemies your gun is also how you build things which is certainly unique there are some areas you can only access after you use your gun to build a bridge the game is very systems heavy and with all kinds of creative combinations you can experience things the developers never imagine you can play either Solo or along side of friend it is out now with almost a thousand very positive reviews then this month there was a surprising amount of really great XCOM likes this is the one that I picked called cyber Knight flasho it's an XCOM like so it's turnbased you've got multiple controllable units various weapons and abilities all in a really interesting cyberpunk world so lots of hackers and futuristic weapons build up your base with all kinds of unique buildings that allow for research crafting and a bunch more then check out the world map to see where you'd like to go next pick your next mission carefully once you go in take advantage of the stealth mode before you engage position your units accurately so that when you finally go all out you can take out a ton of enemies at once setting up ambushes was always my favorite part of XCOM so I really love how this game seems to have a nice focus on that engage with unique factions and interesting stories to explore this world outside of combat but then take your best soldiers and complete the mission it is out now in Early Access with a little bit of a muted release with only 70 reviews but they are all very positive next for some VR here we have a fun one called Under Pressure this one is all about various use Cas is for a pressure washer so naturally you can wash things now for me I really enjoyed my time playing power wash simulator so playing something like it in VR sounds like it can be a very relaxing experience however this one builds upon that and includes various other activities as well all of them based on using a pressure washer so for example you can play football and push a ball around in multiplayer you can use the pressure washer to fly around like a jetpack it also allows you to easily import custom models and wash them that's a pretty awesome feature so all in all this looks like a really relaxing experience in single player or a fun time with friends it is out now on Early Access with 20 positive reviews then if you're looking for something spooky here is lethal company this is a coop Scavenging horror game all about exploring abandon moons in order to gather resources to then sell and obviously do that without dying it's very much focused on Coop you can go out into the world while another player stays in the control room monitoring everything do make sure to take a flashlight because things get dark quite quickly and when it gets dark you must hurry up and get back to the ship hopefully without leaving anyone behind then you sell the loot you acquired buy better equipment and tools and go out on riskier and more dangerous missions I really quite like the concept of this one I imagine it's a ton of fun with friends I'm usually not into horror games but I'd love to give this one a try the reviews certainly do seem to point that it's a great game it is only out in Early Access but already has 1,700 overwhelming positive views at 98% positive so people are really loving this one next if you want something more calm and jolly here is ubets it's a farming game with a really very Charming style there are creatures called ubet which you can grow train and collect they can also help you out on a farm so the game has some minor automation elements instead of combat you solve disagreements through the medium of dance where each ubet has a different unique move there are tons of things to do lots of mini games to play and a huge world to explore alongside many unique characters to meet you can even set up a store to sell your goods and follow a nice overarching story basically this game really is the definition of the word Charming it is out now with 500 very positive reviews then if you'd like to experience massive battles here is executive Assault 2 this is an RTS FPS hybrid with a really huge scale you can fly some truly massive spaceships and then you can also play as a tiny Soldier and really experience the massive scale difference this game really lets you experience some huge battles in either single player or multiplayer in RTS mode you control the entire fleet and give ERS to push your goals forward and then you go down into FPS mode and actually achieve those goals you can control the entire galaxy and capture buildings and spaceships build up your base gather resources explore a massive Tech Tree engage in some espionage or go out guns blazing it just launched out of Early Access so it's already packed full of content it is out now with a thousand very positive reviews and at number one for my personal pick of the month here is another one that is also being extremely well received it's called do age this one is made by a so inded developer over the course of 9 years and it's really awesome to see how it's finding so much success I've seen a bunch of gifts from this game over the past few months it looks really nice and Charming the game is a Rog likee survival turnbas city Builder that's definitely a unique mix of genres you control the Elder of a v Village it's your job to guide your villagers to a better life decide where and what to build gather resources and unlock new tech but the apocalypse is coming so do make sure you're ready for when the disaster strikes it can be everything from a plague a tsunami or really just the whole world going on fire personally I'm really intrigued by the turnbas aspect of the game the game does not completely stop between runs the world is nice and Alive as you take your time to make the next decision so it's certainly unique mechanic and I'd love to see how exactly it works and based on the player response it seems that this weird mix of genres is very well made it is out now with 700 overwhelmingly positive views at 97% positive again that's an insane score all right so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity launch in October 23 I hope this L something to you see how the unity engine is capable of building anything the the only limits are really just your own skills and Imagination check out my own game Dy Guardians and I hope you enjoy playing it
