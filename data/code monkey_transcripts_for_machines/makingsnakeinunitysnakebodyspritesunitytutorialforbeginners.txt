hello and welcome I'm your code monkey Linda series were making snake in unity in this video we're going to add sprites to our snake body let's begin so this is our scene we have the snake that we can move around food is spawned and I can go to it and have the snake eat it when the snake eats you can see that the body grows and the body is correctly following the path that the snake took so right now we want to actually give it a proper visual so here in the textures folder I have the snake body sprites so let's are off by just replacing the white squares with this texture so here is the snake class and here we have the handle word movement which moves the snake tests if it did eat some food if so it increase the size and checks for all the positions and here is the code that we were using for temporarily displaying our white squares so we want to replace this with our proper texture however we don't want it to constantly be creating and destroying same sprite so we want to create it just once and then reuse that same sprite so let's go up here and let's set up a list to hold our transforms so we have a list to keep track of all of our snake body transforms let's initialize it on our awake and let's go down here when we are increasing our snake move position list and when we increase the size let's create a body visual so let's make a function for that again in order to grab the sprite for our snake body let's go into the game assets class and have another feel for the snake body sprite and we use it in here so in this function we are creating a new game object calling it snake body and adding it with the sprite renderer component and with the correct body sprite so after we create it we simply go into our list and add our snake body game object transfer so we create a new game object and we add it to our list and up here when we increase the body size and let's create one okay so let's see if we are creating a new game object every time our snake eat some food okay there's a snake there's some food I go to it and yep there's the body right there on the corner now I eat another one and now let's pause and check the hierarchy and you have there you go one snake body and another snake body okay so far so good now obviously the issue is we don't want our bodies to be spun on 0 0 parameter correctly placed to follow the snake body so let's see on with that so here we move our snake we increase the body size and create the body transform we validate our snake move positional list and let's comment out this code for now and here we are updating the position of the snake head and afterwards let's also update the rest of our body sprites so let's do a simple cycle on the snake body transform list then here we're going to put our body position base on the snake move position list then we set the snake body dot position to be this new position okay so we are cycling through the entire list and we are setting the position based on the snake move position list which is what we were using previously to see our temporary white squares so let's run the code and see if every single body part now correctly follows the snake path okay there's a snake there's some food now I go to it and yep there you go that's the snake body now I go to another one and yep we now have three and they are all following the path correctly and so is that one so we now have our snake body correctly following the path of our snake now one potential issue we have in here is the sorting order of the sprites we want each body part to be under the previous one so when we create them let's set the sorting order to match their index so to modify the sorting order we simply go into the sprite render and modify the sorting order the entire is already on default as it should be and we simply set it to the own list count so when we create the first body part it gets added to the list and then gets the sorting order of minus 1 we have the second one minus 2 and so on and so forth so let's see an yep as you can see the bodies are now correctly displayed so you have the head right on top and you can see it when it goes out ok great okay so now let's keep our code organized by creating a class to handle each snake body part so let's go down here and make a product class snake body parts let's create a constructor and inside the constructor and let's copy the snake body let's receive an int for the body index and use that instead and here and let's store our transform and let's also store the current great position now let's make a function to relocate the body and just like that we have a very nice class that can handle everything regarding the snake body so now let's go up here and instead of having a list of transform so let's have a list of snake body part of the private boy create snake body we simply add to the list a new snake body part instead of this we have a update snake body part and we copy this in here except we are using this list instead instead of setting the position directly we call the set worth position function and we give it the snake move position ok so our code is now much easier to follow since we have a dedicated class to handle each body part so we go up here when we increase the snake body we create a body part which in Senshi eights a new instance of that class and adds it to the list and then we have a function to update all the body parts and it does so by calling the function which gives it a grid position and then it takes that great position and moves the transform so let's run the code and see if everything still works ok there's a snake there's the food and yep it grabbed the food and it spawned a new body part and the body part is following and another one and where I'm not a piece of fruit and it is growing perfectly fine and all the sprites are being correctly instantiated so there you have it we took our previous snake body size info and added a visual as well as a simple pass to Hamlet in the next video we're going to deal with the rotation of the sprites including handling corners as long as you can download the project files and utilities from ent code monkey comm if you
