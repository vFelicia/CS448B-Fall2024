hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the SSR is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for December 22. even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all of the kinds of games that I could build this one is the only set of paid ads and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and best songs and systems as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order oh by the way I've got two very interesting videos coming out tomorrow and Monday so definitely stay tuned and when you see these thumbnails click on them and if you need some SM tools there's four humble bundles right now with huge discounts there's a repeat of the excellent tools and art bundles there's one all about asses from blink very nice low poly fantasy style and one all about sounds beyond that there's a new year sale on the accessor with the usual on top as at half price but mainly stay tuned for the those two upcoming videos alright so starting off with a fun animation pack all about drunken martial arts all the moves look really creative they're all really unique in total there are 73 animations with some really great modern combos so this is pretty fun to make your game send out from the usual standard fighting animations next up if you have some kind of Matrix inspired game then here's a matrix inspired Shader you can apply to anything so it can be a statue you can apply to an animated character or any kind of environment you can combine it with your own custom shaders made in Shadow graph or amplify Shader editor the final effect with glowing letters really looks really nice up next here is a really nice stylized orc character it includes the character along with various skin colors and on top of that a bunch of modular Parts had on top you can add some tusks add a beard some hair and even some armor if you like this style then this dev has tons more packs then if your game is Pixel Art here's some great looking military objects it's some really high quality pixel art you've got tons of weapons gadgets knives resources tools and a whole bunch more so the whole thing looks like a really great very complete icon pack if your game has some sand where the player can walk on then maybe this Shader can help punish that you have some sand you can remove the sand in certain parts so it's a simple effect but adding this to your character's footsteps or maybe some vehicle tracks adding that would really give it that extra bit of punish then if you need a good realistic sitting look at this one it's very realistic looks a little bit dystopian very Brown very dark in total you have 120 prefabs and a whole bunch of decals next up to puncture a UI here's some VFX it's a whole bunch of nice effects you've got some squares some hexes circles and some interesting shapes all in multiple colors which you can make it represent whatever you want then here's a gorgeous pixel art dungeon pack it looks really great reminds me of that sounds great game you've got over 300 prefab so it's a really huge pack lots of stairs platforms elevators traps tables doors and a bunch more it includes a demo scene so if you have a quick prototype you want to try out then just use that then here's a bit of a fun one it's an art gallery museum with a whole bunch of dinosaur bones definitely a very Niche environment but it looks really great it's all in some really high fidelity with some high resolution textures it says that it's VR ready so it sounds like it would be fun to just import this into a VR project and walk around looking at dinosaurs if you're looking for something more gamelike well here's an anime natural environment it's got some very inviting colors some very cute sound shaded characters real looks very nice very pleasant very calming the foliage colors are customizable so you could make summer autumn or a winter scene next here is another animation pack it features some great very realistic very powerful moves there's over 270 animations it's as a female fighter but I guess it would work on a male mesh as well so if you want to do some punches and kicks then check it out then here's a fun one it's a hot rod Constructor you've got tons and tons of modular Parts you can mix and match to make an endless amount of really interesting looking cars it definitely is a very unique sound you can make it look like a car from the 30s or you can change the wheels make something more scifi like something out of the Jetsons so and only very unique pack for making some really interesting cars then if you need some survival props here's a great pack I'm using a similar one from this Dev for my own steam game turnover Liberation this one has over 400 modular prefabs so everything from buildings a whole bunch of props some walls environments so pretty much everything you need to mix and match and build your own world then here's a huge pack that looks like it was taken straight from the game Mafia I love playing that game I still remember crossing the bridge and having to go super slow so I don't get a ticket from the cops this pack looks exam like that which I guess looks exam like New York in 1950s so if you're making a game set in their area then this mega pack looks like all you need then if you're making an RTS game and you need some units check out this one it includes not just one but four factions all in an interesting low poly style and the whole thing also includes animations next up here's a nice pack with a bunch of scifi Badges and ranks they are modular so you can come up with endless variation by adding more and more layers you can make the badge look more and more impressive to signify some kind of rank progression then for another modular pack here's one to help you build thousands of Tower Defense turrets it's got a really nice iPhone look with 10 variants for the top 8 for the middle and 9 for the bottom all in multiple colors so quite a lot of interesting variety and the models do look really great so this would be perfect if you want to make a quick Tower Defense prototype or perhaps inside you want to make a card game then look at this pack it's got some nice pixel art some very simplified cards and elements so the whole thing looks really great and this one is actually pretty cheap next if you need some modular guns here's a great one they have three base models so you've got a sniper rifle an SMG and a pistol you can start from those bases and then add tons of modular Parts on top so you can change the slide magazine suppressor sights and a bunch more or perhaps you want something modular but inside some trunks so look at this one they are some really nice slow poly models you've got various truck cabins various bumpers bodies trailers which you can then mix and match you get some real interesting results again don't forget these videos coming out tomorrow and Monday I'm working on something really special alright so those are my top 20
