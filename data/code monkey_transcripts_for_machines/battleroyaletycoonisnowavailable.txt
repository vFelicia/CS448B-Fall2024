hello and welcome I am your code monkey and as you may know I am an indie game developer and I've just launched my own latest game on Steam so I will now play the short trailer and then talk about what's coming on the channel so that's a game from a programming standpoint this is without a doubt the most complex game I have ever made there are a lot of real interesting systems all working together but with the underlying code nicely separated as a bonus to the viewers of this channel I have further reduced the price on the bundle of all my games to just 5 bucks so you can get on those games and then go to steam to pick up battle royale Tycoon through the steam bundle page which will add an extra 30% off to the normal price if you're following this channel that I'm guessing you're interested in making games and I think it's very useful to view how what I'm teaching in these videos is applicable to a real final product if you do pick up the game feel free to ask about how any particular system was made going forward that won't be back to making videos there are a lot that I have queued up and now that the game is out there are some systems in the game that I wouldn't like to do a video on the first one I'm planning is covering on how the guest sprites are created as you can see they are randomly generated which has a lot of variety to the game this involves some interesting code where you manipulate the texture to create a random final spreadsheet beyond that I want to start tackling the videos that have the most votes on these suggestions so that's the plan I hope you like the game and I'll see you next time
