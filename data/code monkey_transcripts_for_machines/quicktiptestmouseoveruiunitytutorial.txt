Oh hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this is a quick tip for testing if the mouse is over the UI so for example in the scene here I have my unit over here moving around to where I click as if it was in RTS and over here I have a UI window now obviously I don't want to give the unit the order to move when I'm interacting with you I so when I click a button I don't want the unit to move in here so let's check out the code so in my game handler script here I have something very simple I have a reference to my unit and I have a function to set it to move to a target position and on update we are simply testing if the left mouse button is down we are giving the unit the mouse warm position so it moves towards the mouse great ok let's start by making a function to return if the mouse is over the you want so private ball is mouse over you are now in here we're going to use the event system so up here make sure you are using unity engine dot event system so the event system contains a function testing if the mouse pointer is over a game object it's in event system dot current dot is pointer over game object and in here on our input we're going to test if the mouse button is down and it is not over do you want let's test it and there you a very simple implementation I can click around here and my unit is moving I can interact with the UI and the unit does not move now let's add some more functionality say I do want to connect through some things in the while I kiss transparent element around here I still want the most people when I interact with this UI almond but I want two colleagues to go through with this talent so let's make a function that won't do a ray cast on the mouse position and check each element that it hits whether it should be ignored or not so let's go into the code and create a new private ball call it is mouse over UI with ignores so this one test for ignores before returning the result so in order to test we're going to create a pointer event data which we're going to construct with the event system dot current on our pointer event data that position we're going to give it the input dot mouse position let's create a list of raycast results precast result was and we're going to go into the event system dot current dot raycast all we're going to recast using the pointer event data and we're going to put the results and raycast results list so we're going to cycle through the results list and now in here we have to identify which elements should be ignored and remove them from the list now in order to identify which elements should be ignored you have several options you can test the name the tag the layer or my favorite way just add a dummy component so we're going to go into our game and create a new C sharp script and just call it Mouse you I clicked through inside just remove everything and leave this just an empty class so in here we're going to go through all the raycast results and test if they contain the component mousey iclicker so if raycast result list on a dart game object i get component of time mouths you I click through if it is not know so if we have this component we're going to remove it from the list so remove at I and reduce the I and down here in order to test if the mouse is over the UI after the ignores we're simply going to return if raycast Rizzoli's count if it is bigger than zero and up here instead of using his mouse over you I just use it with the ignores and there you go right now this should do a recast on the mouse position go through on the raycast that it hit remove the ones that we want to click through and in return if we still have elements on the list so in here go to the element that you want to click through and just add our dummy component and hit play right now we can move normally we cannot move through this UI element but we can click through this URL and there you go it works correctly you can block clicks where you want and let them through where you want okay hope that helps if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer then alright see you next time
