hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the ssor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights for january twin 22. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video already covered all the best free new assets so go watch it if you haven't seen it and in the next one i will be covering the top assets and effects let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the asks in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order right now you can get a massive discount of 95 off on not just one but actually two unity mega bundles these are full of awesome assets first on the daring mega bundle you have some adorable items and a massive cartoony ui pack then a fluid simulation some rocky hills and a ton of spell icons and on the last year make your characters more natural with a leaning animator tons of tools to help you make mobile games some spells awesome effects and tons more the second bundle has a mech constructor asset some force fields and cartoon monsters then you've got some melee and pistol animations water system a turnbased rpg template and lots more there's tons of variety in both bundles and with such a deep discount if just one of these assets looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it check out both bundles with the links in the description alright so starting off with this ragdoll animator it lets you simultaneously use ragdolls and animations at the same time you just select your character and easily set up the rectangle then with a bunch of sliders you can control the muscle power so for example if your player gets hit with a really strong punch you can disable on the muscles and let the player fall down with the ragdoll and then you slowly increasing muscle power as you play the get up animation i've only briefly used ragdolls but combining them with animations is definitely tricky so this asset looks super useful it's also made by an experienced developer with tons of tools already on the store so you know this one is a stable wellbuilt asset then here's a really fun one you can easily create your own trees directly inside unity it uses splines so you can make whatever shape you want so you can make the trunk perfectly straight or something a bit more exotic with some loops for the leaves you also have tons of options using sine distance fields you can define the shape size and how many leaves as well as changing the density this one is definitely a very unique tool but maybe instead of buying some packs with some prevail trees you can simply pick this one up and bum them yourself or maybe this is perfect if you're going for something with some really unnatural wacky trees and up next here's another really interesting and unique tool this one lets you build all kinds of graphs and charts everything from simple line graphs to some bar charts and pie charts it's packed with tons of features for how to display your data and how to interact with it it even supports ar and vr which sounds like fun i actually made a fulllength tutorial series on how to make a graph in unity i made it for my game battleground tycoon it took a massive amount of work and it was nowhere near as feature rich as this one so i can definitely see this package as a huge time saver then for something nice and simple here's one to easily make tons of icons right away i can see the ability to add postprocessing can definitely be a huge time saver imagine using this to make some sort of achievement icons where usually you need an icon for achieved and one for unlocked you could just lower the saturation as a postpressing effect and easily make the unlocked items or really just any ingame buttons or icons the setup seems really easy you just select the prefab and you can see a view of the icon in an editor window then you just rotate and move the object change the background apply any colors or anything you can even add some overlay images and easily save the image file and of course you can apply the exact same settings involved to make tons and tons of icons all at once very simple and very useful tool then here's another fun wacky one a stylized hair tool essentially you click to add a bunch of hair follicles then you grow the hair as much as you want with whatever thickness and color you want and the hair is also physically simulated so it bounces up and down you can change the weight stiffness and manually brush the hair definitely makes for a very unique look if your game has a stylized art sound then this asset might be excellent for making your game stand out any player that sees a bunch of these wacky hair physics will certainly keep paying attention then here's one that is an extremely useful tool for just the right type of person it's a floating origin tool if you have no idea what that means then chances are you've never tried making a really really huge game the unity world is based on floats and the bigger the value the less precise it becomes so if your game goes into the millions or billions in scale as you get further away from the origin you start to see some really weird behavior pretty much because the positions don't have enough precision what this asset does is it constantly moves the origin of the world so you're never too far away and never cause those issues this one is also specifically designed to solve this problem in multiplayer games using mirror and up next here's one that does something that i've always wanted as you know when you add a component to a game object you can't really pass any parameters you just have the component and then maybe you call some kind of setup function whereas with normal csharp every class has a constructor where you can pass in any parameters you want so what the sus does is it adds an initialization function to your scripts so you can easily add components and pass in arguments at the exact same time it's a really simple thing that is really very useful it also works with scriptamol objects so that could also be useful for making your own tools so this one is a simple one and does exactly what it's meant to do then here's another fun one called now we're talking it's a tool for easily adding mouth movements so your characters can actually tone the mouth is simplified so this is primarily meant for low poly acids which just so happens to be the style that i really like it's really quite amazing how just adding some simple mouth shapes and some blinging eyes really improves the feel of the game the setup also seems very simple you just find the face or mouth bone and just add the prefab that's pretty much it and up next here's an interesting texture tool this one is a tool for taking your textures and then baking them directly into the mesh so the final result looks exactly the same but it's using mesh data instead of separate textures so that's an interesting one one of the benefits seems to be memory since you don't need heavy textures also there is no need for baked light map data so that saves a ton on memory another benefit is making a blend map directly inside the vertex data you can also bake sky boxes and cube maps so this one is definitely an interesting unique tool and finally here's one that can be quite useful it's a collectorbased object fade exactly like the name implies you can fade objects that the camera collides with if your player can freely move the camera then having a system like this is a musthave this one looks so much better than if the camera just goes inside the objects making them fade and look so much better so that's pretty much what this one does alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the ent assessor for january 2022 there's links to on
