hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the assessor is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for july of 22. this one is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video already covered on the best new free assets so go watch it if you haven't seen it in the next video i will be covering topics and effects let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them and as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 percent off your order now you might have noticed that i didn't do one of these videos last month the reason for that is because i was super busy working on my turnbased strategy course which is finally out after five months of work if you want to take your game dev skills from beginner to advanced then check out the course and if you need any visuals right now there's a massive sale on the cinti store almost everything at half price they've got packs for pretty much every single theme or genre for medieval you have their gorgeous fantasy kingdom pack for something cyberpunk you have the sapphire pack for military games you have the military pack or alternatively the postapocalypse fact there's the heist one that i've used in so many videos the street racer pack for some really nice racing games shops bag for any tycoon and much more so if you're a fan of their style just like me and you need some ass for your game then check it out to the link in the description alright so starting off with a nice simple tool with a very humorous name here is yet another prefab painter just like name implies this is a tool for painting or easily instantiating prefabs pretty much every massive terrain tool usually has something like this but if you want a tool that does just this then this one looks great i'm always a fan of tools that do one thing and one thing alone very well and this is exactly that it works with any prefab so you can drop some rocks trees humans buildings and really anything you want you can include physics or not so to make your scenes much more natural you can even have multiple brushes so one click to place individually or place them along a line or a spline so this looks like a great tool that does a single thing extremely well next up a tool for easily setting up custom inspectors this one features a really nice really easy to use drag drop interface you can add all kinds of fields like some text fields add some colors some game object references booleans and so on you can do all of that without writing a single line of code so this one looks really interesting usually for custom inspectors the best one would be something like odin but this one seems even easier to use in just a few seconds or a few minutes you can have a great custom inspector so this kind of thing that can really help you save a ton of time next up if you want to paint any objects look at this tool honestly this one looks perfect for nonartists just like me to be able to easily modify any of the assets that i use there's a ton of brushes you can use you can just click to paint on any object it's a really advanced tool it also features layers opacity blending modes tons of options also supports pixel art it supports physics and legends for them like paintballs it works on all the render pipelines it's super performant so works well on both mobile and vr it even works in both 3d and 2d there's an undo and redo system and tons more so this looks like a really great tool for getting the most out of all your assets next up if you need some rocks but you don't want to use a static asset pack look at this awesome generator every result generated by this is really unique you have tons of parameters to play with using those you can really see just how much variation you can get it even includes 19 premade rock materials so you can get them looking perfectly just like a stylized rock and the rocks themselves use triplaner projection meaning that you can use a single material you can have hundreds of rocks and all of them rendered in a single dracon this one is a really impressive asset personally i think the generated rocks look great so if this town matches your game then definitely check it out then we have another simple but super useful tool the pivot cursor tool this one allows you to click to place the cursor anywhere so it can be on the corner of an object it can be in the middle on a side and so on and then you can do all kinds of operations using that point as the pivot you can scale rotate scale only on two axes easily rotate along the edge or scale in just one direction for me one of my most searched videos is a super quick video that i made on how to modify the pivot basically you need the apparent object and then offset the channel to where you want the pivot to be so the builtin way of doing that is pretty tricky whereas with this tool it seems like it makes the process so much simpler up next we have another simple tool the animation preview it does exactly what it says so basically you just grab whatever character you want to test you dump all of your animations into a single animated controller there's no need to create any transitions anything and it automatically creates a bunch of buttons in the inspector to play each individual animation so it's a really simple tool for previewing whatever animation packs you have and try using them with any character you have then for something a bit more complex here we have a physics joint tool unity has physics joints by default but they can be quite a bit tricky to set up these look much easier and much more capable it includes all kinds of constraints and limits so you can see how it even works with mechanical meshes that are not supposed to deform it also includes some ik so you modify just the target and the other bones rotate and move to reach the final position it features stretching and contracting there's some wiggliness you can even collide and handle collisions with other objects so really quite a lot of possible use cases from some very simple joints to very complex if you have trouble with the builtin tools and maybe some like this can be useful then if you're looking for a character controller here's a pretty advanced one making a simple controller is pretty easy but making one that supports every single interaction that your players expect doing that is pretty difficult this one supports every interaction you can think of so it features some basic movement it also slides on slopes you can push around physics objects you can climb up ladders do a double jump crouch going to antigravity and much more you can even apply it to a vehicle and just drive around the demo scene looks like it perfectly shows all the various use cases looks like pretty much a perfect character control up next if you've got a card game and you want to add a character and look at this tool it adds ik to the drivers arms and legs making the character perfectly grab the steering wheel and change gears with their hand this one is a simple thing but really adds up on the immersion factor especially in the first person camera you can really see the massive difference it looks so much better like this rather than just having a ghost steering wheel move by itself also has an easy integration with various other popular car controllers or if you don't have any of those this one also includes a car controller and then over here we have an adaptive split screen tool this one like the name implies it slices the screen to showcase multiple players all at once it has a really natural look so it's not just a boring vertical line up and down the middle instead it dynamically splits and merges the screens depending on where the players are it's really awesome to see it in action it almost looks like magic how all the areas split as the players come apart and they merge back as soon as they get closer to one another so if your game has local multiplayer then this looks like an excellent tool alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unity accessor for july of 22. there's links to on the description and as a bonus you can
