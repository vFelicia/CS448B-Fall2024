check out some highlights for april 22. in this first video i'll be covering a list of free assets and the next ones i will be covering paid assets and tools check the phone police to see all of the highlights every month you might find something that would be perfect for whatever project you're currently working on and actually before i start the list let me do a bonus mention of my own free asset which i did release last month the health system it's a really nice health system with all of the features you could want it's what i've used in so many videos whenever i need some help it's really adaptable and the package comes with a nice video walkthrough tutorial going through all of the code step by step so you can learn how it all works it's free so check it out and maybe use it in your next project and while you're browsing my assets i also have a free key door system to add keys and doors to your games and the mouse cursor system pro to help you make animated cursors to really help your game stand out also next week unity is starting their spring sale there will be tons of assets at 50 off and also just like in the black friday sale there won't be flash deals at 80 off right now you can already get a sneak preview of the various assets that won't be on sale there's also a timer for when they won't be at their max discount so check out the sneak preview page link in

animations but really a lot of these work on any game you have idle walking strafing and so on some really nice rolls a bunch of melee attacks bow and even some magic animations this one is made by blink which is developer with tons more acids on the store then here's a fun tool a hand pose recognition it uses machine learning to identify it based on the quick video it works very well it is now required to have any special gloves or any special equipment you really just feed it an image and it will output whatever the pose is really interesting and up next nice and simple we have a modular house this one is pretty nice with some chinese architecture pretty unique it's got a realistic art style and looks pretty great then for a nice shader effect here is a seethrough shader it allows you to see through walls or any other objects has tons of options to play around with then another fun animation pack from another great developer some free giant animations these would be perfect if your game has some kind of ogre or some giant or some elemental character this dev has tons of animation packs for all kinds of scenarios i own a bunch of them and i really like them and for a really simple tool here is a gradient generator it uses unity's builtin gradient tool to design whatever gradient you want then you can select the size select the path and save it onto a phone it's really simple and works great so if you need some gradients but you don't want to open up photoshop then this can be quite useful for another simple but great tool here is notes it allows you to add notes to all kinds of objects could be game objects or scripts or materials or really anything there's a window to only see all of your notes and even a nice button to ping the assets so you can find a quick one and up next for a fun visual here is a realistic computer keyboard both low poly and high poly it's exactly what you expect so if you need a keyboard here it is then here's a potentially very useful tool rich tax plus it lets you add tags onto your text objects then you can define those tags and what text they should be replaced with so it makes it super simple for example to display the player name and text or maybe some hotkeys that are customizable or really any dynamic text i've pretty much had to build a system just like this one in every game i've made so this is certainly useful and if you want to add some destruction to your games here's a bunch of nice destructible props i covered how you can slice objects in a previous video and this one pretty much just comes with presliced objects alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the unt s store for april 22 also check out my own free and paid ads on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos
