hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here is an action rpg that i made entirely using visual scripting it features a player with multiple weapons so there's melee and projectiles it's got coins keys and doors there's dungeons to explore and lots of pots to smash and again all of it without writing a single line of code this is an excellent project that really showcases the power of visual scripting and how you can really build anything you want with it here i will do an overview for how all of this was made internally using visual scripting but if you want the complete stepbystep guide then check out my visual scripting course this is just one of the three games made in that course the others are a simple platformer and a really nice fps all games are complete from scratch and go step by step until the final punished games in total the course is 20 hours long and it will take you from beginner to advanced it will teach you everything you need to know on how to make games using only visual scripting go check it out to see this game being built step by step okay so here let's play the final game and then we're going to analyze the project and see how all these visual scripts are working together as i said this is a fully featured rpg so it's got all of the mechanics you would expect it's got multiple weapons keys doors enemies dungeons objectives health coins shops and so on so we start off on a very basic main menu and here we see all the game controls of it pretty simple so we've got an attack the ability to fire some arrows use a pusheen to block enemy attacks interact with various kinds of objects and buttons and have a really nice dash so we just go ahead and hit on play and right away we are spawned inside of our world so we have the player character and we can move around it as you can see the world itself is composed of a bunch of really nice tiles the player also correctly identifies collision so i cannot go through solid objects then there's a really nice dash to quickly move in one direction there's obviously sword attacks and the ability to fire some arrows and the errors themselves they reload over time so there they are i can fire on three then i gotta wait for them to reload and fire them are now in the ui we can see the current health as our hearts as well as the current number of coins and our star fragments which is the goal of the game for the enemies down there we see a really nice melee enemy he is currently in the patrol state so just moving between his various patrol points and if i approach if there you go he sees me and he starts chasing now if he goes if i get within range if there you go i take some damage but if i use my real nice shield yep there you go and i can obviously hit the enemy now that i took some damage i can go ahead pick up this coin that's nice pick up that one and yep there we go so now there's this one now let's attack him so if i just get within and boom there you go all right so those are the enemies then up here some really nice spots to smash so just smash them and get tons of coins then down here a portal so a really nice and i go in yep i get teleported into the portal and over here we've got an example of a shop so this one takes 50 gold which obviously i do not have so that is why i cannot open the door in order to buy the item so i can go and teleport back onto into the main world the world itself is pretty massive so there's all kinds of things everywhere so over here turns more coins and more enemies i constantly have to attack them and again all of this without writing a single line of code so all this is being run just based on visual scripts over here really nice chess so i can just smack it and get tons of coins really awesome and over here is a different door this one requires the red key so i gotta find that one and go inside a different dungeon and the dungeons have that really nice moving lava and they're all pretty different and over here is the red key and i can pick it up then over there is one of the star fragments so that's the goal of the game to collect all of them and if i go in this one actually has a trap so a bunch of enemies get spawned and i have to somehow survive there's also some buttons that i can interact with so for example open and close the door the logic for that is really general so it works with just about anything as i'll see in a bit and there's also some upgrades over here if i pick it up yep now i've got a maximum hearts of four alright so there's only one more star fragment left and this one happens to be behind this shop and to go into the shop i just need to have enough gold then approach and there you go the door opens and i can go in and open up and there you go you win alright so that's a game as you can see this really is a fully featured rpg and again everything you see here works internally using visual scripting so there's no written code anywhere let's explore the project to see how all this is set up by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks so here i am with the editor window open so for example let's inspect how the player works so here is the player game object and you can see all the components attached to it so for example you see tons of variables that are required to make all of this work as well as multiple separate flow machines that's one of the very important things is how you can have multiple phone machines on a single object so you can keep all your logic nicely separated then some scripts are pretty massive like for example this one this is the main player script so as you can see very very massive but again it is actually quite readable thanks to all these nice groups so if you take the time to properly organize your own logic then all this can actually be quite manageable so for example for handling the player attack over here we go into the input manager we listen to an event that happens when the player presses the attack input we set a trigger on the animator to play a certain animation then do a whole bunch of things like play some sound we generate a bit of screen shake we spawn some sword slash particles and so on then we do a circle cast to identify all the hits of the objects that can be damaged and if so then they are damaged try to give a knockback to the object and so on so you can see it's a pretty massive script but thanks to the groups everything is nicely separated there's also some scripts that are reused so for example here we've got the health system we can look at it and see yep we have a maximum amount of health we have an event listening to take some damage another one to heal check if it is a full health check to add some health amount max and so on so this is the health system which is on the player and it is the one that is also placed on the enemy so the enemy itself over here it also has the exact same health system script so being able to reuse scripts is something you should always try to do it will greatly increase your productivity then the enemies also use a very nice visual scripting feature which is over here the state machine this is a really awesome builtin feature you can define the various states and all the conditions for swapping between them so it's a really awesome way to handle all the states like for example over here it's very easy to see what this is doing we've got a patrol state then we've got a chase state and a attack state and the connections between them which handle all the various conditions so for example he's on patrol and on patrol he's doing all this logic again with groups to make everything nice and easy to understand so it constantly cycles through all of the patrol positions then on the condition to change from patrol into chase over here it simply grabs the player it does a vector3 distance it checks if it is within the player detection radius if so then it triggers the transition so then it goes into chase then again checks if it is within attack range and if so plays the animation and so on so the state machine is a really awesome easy to use feature another thing the game has is some nice custom shaders made in shadowgraph for example when the enemies get spawned they have a really nice effect i actually covered that effect in a separate video previously it's a simple on the song shader which works great as a spawning effect the grass is also swinging in the wind so that's another effect that i covered in a separate video then over here everything's nicely organized with a whole bunch of spanish scripts so for example here the coin spawner script this is what is called whenever the chest takes damage so whenever it takes damage it spawns a coin so that's what it does simply goes into this script fires off a function which instead it instantiates a prefab and adds some velocity just make it look a bit nice so there's all these spawners and all those references are stored over here on the scene variables so this is an easy way to access the references for all these objects in order to be able to fire off events to do pretty much anything so despite the fact that this project is pretty huge it is very well organized which makes it quite easy to work with one interesting system is the key door system so for example the way that works is over here this script is on the player and it is listening to trigger collisions when a collision happens it checks the layer for that object that's how it identifies what object did it collide with so it checks if the layer is on the keys then this one connect with the key and if so the way that the system works is it simply has a variable of type kill list and simply adds this key onto that list so over here on the variables over here the player has a key list which is just a list of game objects so as the player picks up keys they get added onto this list and then there's the doors which again work pretty much the exact same way so on trigger enter so when it collides with an object it identifies if it is door if so then checks if the player contains the key that is matched up to that door and if so then it simply opens that door so for example over here is the red door as you can see it has the physics collider so that one is walkable as well as the trigger collider which is a bit bigger so when the player enters into this area it goes inside and checks the variables for this door and it sees if it has this key then it checks if the player also has this key if so then opens the store so it's a really interesting system and again not a single line of code here then for another interesting system are the interactable buttons so on the player over here there's another group for the interact so it goes into the input manager listens to the interact event when that happens it does a physics overlap circle it checks out for objects within the button layer and if it finds something then it triggers a interactive end on that object so this works with buttons but also read really just about anything that's the interesting thing about events in visual scripting which is you're not directly calling a function you're just firing off an event and if that object is listening to that particular event then it can run some logic so it makes it possible to make some really modular code so for example up here is this button and on the button it has a toggle button flow machine so what this one does is it receives the interact event that is fired by the player it triggers its own event for the toggle button since this is a toggle button and then it just handles all the logic for inverting the button state it updates the visual and then in this case this is a very general script so this one simply fires off another event which in this case that event is over here stored as a variable so it goes into this target object which is the door so it's this door and fires off this event which is set door open state so by the player interacting with this button it will open up this door and as you can see ophthalmologic is commonly separated so this basic logic for an interaction system this works with just about anything you want to do with it so you can open doors disable some cannons spawn some enemies anything you want then for the map visuals it's using the builtin unity towel map so it places all the background objects then all the objects on top so all the grass ground and so on then a whole bunch of them for the collectors and so on and if i zoom all the way out i can see this is the main world and then down here on to the side are all of the various dungeons so when the players enters into a portal it simply gets cell port onto one of these positions and the ui itself is also nicely decoupled from the rest of the logic again it's using events which is essential in visual scripting to make all of this work so for example over here the health ui it has this graph which as you can see it simply listens to an event on the player so the player fires off an event when the hunt amount changes and then the ui simply handles the logic in order to showcase and update the visuals there it is just updating all the full hearts or empty hearts and all of the input logic is abstracted away onto a separate input system so thanks to how all of this setup it is very simple to make this game work with a keyboard or with touch input or with a mouse or with a controller or really with anything so this project is an excellent example of just how much you can build with visual scripting alone the game is pretty complex packed with tons of features and all of it works perfectly without having to write a single line of code and as i mentioned all of this was built from scratch step by step in my complete visual scripting course so if you want to learn how you can build this go ahead and check it out this is just one of the three games made in that course the others are the simple platformer and a really nice fps all games are completely from scratch and go step by step until the final polished games in total the course is 20 hours long and it won't take you from beginner to advanced it will teach you everything you need to know on how to make games using only visual scripting go
