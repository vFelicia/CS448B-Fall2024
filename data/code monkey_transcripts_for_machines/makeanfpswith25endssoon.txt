hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and if you've ever wanted to make an fps then here's your chance with this heavily discounted bundle let's inspect some of these assets to see what they do and what they look like you can get some awesome characters a bunch of monsters and humans make a really giant gorgeous looking city get some awesome animated first person weapons play around in a gorgeous outdoor environment or a shooting range so you've got lots of awesome visuals as well as tons of useful systems so easily make some tone tips handle bullet physics with some impact sense for nearby objects do some multiplayer or use the ultimate fps to get your game idea up and running super quickly some of that is really awesome stuff and all of it just for 25 bucks in total everything is worth over a thousand dollars so it's a massive discount if just a single one of these looks interesting to you then the whole thing is an excellent deal i've certainly picked it up myself right away this one is a pretty quick deal i'm actually a bit late with making this video it ends in just a few days so if you're interested definitely get it quickly the link in the description is an affiliate link so if you use it at the same price to you and you'll also be supporting the channel and of course with this being a humble bundle some of the proceeds also go towards charity and they picked some very important ones so that's always a nice bonus the bundle contains assets but also two interesting games verdun and tenenberg these are great world war one shooters and verdan also has some really interesting mechanics which i actually remade in another video go watch that video if you haven't seen it yet i really like making these how it's made videos recreating some interesting mechanics but for some reason those videos don't do very well so if you haven't seen it definitely give it a try one more quick thing this friday on the 24th i won't be participating in the official unity and live stream we're going to check out some of these assets we're going to place them for done and i will be answering questions from chat so if you like live streams come check it out okay so let's inspect some of these assets to see what they do and what they'll look like there's timestamps in the video if you want to skip ahead to a particular asset or tone the main one for this pack is the ultimate fps this is a very advanced tool for very easily creating an fps game it's got an excellent demo scene so let's look at it so here it is right away there's some text up top it guides you through everything that the asset can do so right away we can walk around move around jump then you see a weapon right away so just move it and pick it up there you go some nice weapon animations the weapon also has a really nice zoom and of course you can shoot so just fire and yep you can aim anywhere there's some bot particles some decals all of it looking pretty great then this controller is also physics based so you can interact with other physical objects there's even some exploring crates you can pick up a bunch of other weapons like some pistols some other rifles a shotgun some other things this also has some magic abilities so you can fire some fireballs a bunch of particles nice healing effect just want a nice shield to defend from bullets yeah there you go so lots of versatility it also includes an interaction system so you can touch all kinds of buttons you can open up a bunch of crates and also go through the doors so just interact open the door or play an entire animation of actually moving through the door and then back to controlling as you can see there's tons and tons of things you can do with this asset all of it included and it's a really nice starting point how you add it on to a scene is also super simple it comes with a really nice main menu so there you go it's got an entire window you can't just go into the character make a new character and just disable the animator to go with the simplest thing possible just build character and yep there it is right away just like that just with a single click you've got a fully functioning first person character so as you can see this one is really capable of lots of features it's a really complex zoom so that can really help you to quickly get an fps up and running but being so complex does mean that it does have a learning curve now thankfully they do have some excellent documentation including stepbystep video tutorials so if you take the time to learn how to use this tool you'll certainly get a lot out of it now for me i actually prefer smaller assets that do just one single thing and for that the character movement fundamentals is perfect it's a very easy to use and extremely capable character controller now moving a character is something you don't really think too much about but it actually has quite a lot of complexity if you've got to answer the questions like how does your character handle steps slopes terrain moving platforms physics and so on so this asset handles all that so here is the demo scene where you can see all kinds of different obstacles and also this one works in first person but also in third person so for example making a custom gravity so you can go in and yep the character is always like that so this is pretty tricky for you to make but over here you get it out of the box then moving platforms also something that if you try to do you've probably encountered lots of issues with it so once again very easy then of course it works on all kinds of terrain so going up and as you can see everything is really nice and smooth same thing for going up any kind of slopes any kind of stairs the character is really smooth and it perfectly matches all the terrain and if you want to make some puzzle games then this one also has some inversion of gravity so you can flip it around and make something really truly very strange so personally i would say this is probably my favorite asset from the bundle i never like having to deal with all of the edge case when it comes to character controllers so for me the bundle is worth it just for this one then for tons of super highend characters you have the scifi characters mega pack the wrong price for this one is 250 dollars so again if you want just a single thing then the whole bundle is a great deal these are some great looking characters and they're all animated so they range from some normal looking humanoid space characters then you also got some very weird very strange monsters then you've got some super giant bosses perfect for making a couple of boss fights so look down really huge really strange and then with this being scifi you also have a whole bunch of mechs so look at all these look at all that looking really great and according to the description on the essence or they are continuously adding more and more characters to this pack and there's 10 more to come if you just want some animated weapons then this pack is also great so you've got everything from a bunch of rifles some uzi some shotguns some pistols even some melee weapons some grenades and so on all these are perfect for making a first person game and they come with all sorts of animations as well as a bunch of really nice scopes and attachments so you could easily combine any of these with either the character controller asset or use it with the ufps asset if those weapons are too realistic and you want some more scifi weapons there's another pack with a whole bunch of them for a super useful effect you have highlight plus so it does exactly what you expect it lets you very easily add some highlights to pretty much any object so this would be great for highlighting some weapons or maybe a weapon that you can pick up or pretty much anything that you want the player to see another useful tool is the pro tips tooltip system it's really advanced very versatile if your game has tons of items or weapons or skills then this would be a great addition you can use it with any style you want display any text or images and it's always on screen so no issue with the tooltip being hidden for some environments you have the seascape city system this one lets you easily generate a pretty convincing city with just a single click so if you want to quickly make a gtmlike prototype then this would be a great starting point for building your world it builds roads and all kinds of buildings the buildings themselves also look pretty great they even have a window shader with fake parallax interiors and you've got lots and lots of settings for changing pretty much anything for other environments you have the postapocalyptic world pack so the asset page for this one says that it's inspired by the last of us and that definitely makes sense it looks pretty great and of course this is a whole demo scene and all this is composed of tons of different unique objects so you can easily just take them apart and build your own unique scene and if you have a training area in your game then you can use these shooting range interiors so lots of games have place where you can test out your weapons and this would be the perfect place for it if instead of fps you want to make a third person shooter then the bundle also includes an excellent asset just for that based on the demo scene looks really capable so you've got lots of locomotion actions the character controller handles all kinds of terrain it features third person shooting some ragdolls ramps hazards and accurate foot placement also it even has vehicle support so you can go inside and drive a bike or a car looks really awesome and there's even more awesome stuff in the bummer so for example you've got a ui pack lots of ui elements of course tons of sound effects music and so on you also have a really complex ai system then a physics interaction system a bunch of scifi props you even have a multiplayer shooter template have some sensors to identify a bunch of things and of course the two games that i mentioned so as you can see there's tons of awesome stuff that you can get for a very low price like i said if just a single one of these looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it this is a pretty quick deal i'm actually a bit late to making this video it ends just next week so if you're interested definitely go ahead and get it now and like i mentioned the bundle also includes those two games so go play some for done and then go watch my video on remaking some interesting mechanics from it and don't forget if you like live streams come and join me this friday on the unity live stream alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
