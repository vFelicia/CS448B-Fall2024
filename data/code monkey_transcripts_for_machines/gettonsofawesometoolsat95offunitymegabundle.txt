hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here is the fill your toolbox megabundle now active on the unity asset store as usual it's a massive discount at 95 off on over a thousand dollars worth of assets this one is full of really interesting tools there's one to help you manage an inventory database another one for some decals and terrain system there's a digging system slice meshes volumetric vfx and tons more with such a deep discount it's worth if just one of these assets looks interesting these are also assets that haven't been bundled before i only had one of them so i picked up the bundle right away on the first year one of the asks is enhanced scrawlr if you have lots of scrollball objects in your ui this can help make it look quite a bit better and much more performant it dynamically creates and destroys objects so you can have lists with thousands or millions of entries and it all works great the asset comes with tons of demos showing all kinds of possible use cases with lots of different cell types both vertical and horizontal bars it features auto scrolling pull down refresh nested scrollers and tons more so if you're having ui performance issues in your game or you really just have lots of scrolling then definitely give this one a try on the second tier one of the interesting ones is easy decal just in case you don't know what are decals this is how you can essentially draw a sprite on top of a mesh so things like bullet holes graffiti and so on it uses multiple techniques it can be baked on awake or be dynamic it can fit whatever mesh you want and ignore certain objects you can use just a single material or apply decals from the entire atlas this kind of thing that is super useful for giving your levels that extra bit of polish then you have the mesh slicer now a while ago i made a video on how you can use pro builder to slice meshes for me that wouldn't always work great but some people in the comments did say that meth didn't work for them that too is an experimental so maybe there are some cases where it doesn't work so here you've got this tool which is dedicated to just slicing things so it should work in every scenario also one of the main comments on that video was asking if you could slice in run time using that method is a bit tricky but with this asset makes it super easy it comes with a whole bunch of demos for example there's one with a moving skin mesh render so it's a animated character and it perfectly slices exactly where it should all these slices have physics and they all fall apart it can slice anywhere any part and a couple more demos showing slicing objects with multiple methods there's plenty of slicing methods to make it work perfectly during runtime the code runs asynchronously so it doesn't lock your game while calculating the slices looks really good and seems to work in every scenario next up you've got dungeon architect this one is a really massive tool tons and tons of features it has been development since 2016 with tons of updates over the years it allows you to manually create levels or generate them automatically you can swap around all the props and get different themes it also generates a basic navigation mesh for pathfinding so tons and tons of features it comes with a very well organized custom editor and lots of samples it's a pretty massive tool so there is definitely a learning curve involved but if you take the time to learn it you will have a massively powerful tool at your disposal then another interesting asset is digger pro as you know the unity terrain system is pretty awesome for making terrains but not so much for making holes so if you want to dig down and make some caves then this one seems great it works on top of the regular terrain object so if you already have some terrains in your game you don't have to rebuild them all from scratch this works on top of it you just go into the menu and automatically sets up your terrain to support digging holes you can use whatever brace you want whatever size and texture you want it really is very easy to do and does the exactly what you want alright so those are just some of the helmets and there's many more in the bundle for example you've got the space graphics toolkit lots of space ui things for making any kind of scifi game then you've got one with some realistic eye movements so if you've got a character heavy game this can be great if you've got s100 pro for locating assets in your game then you've got performance tools this one is great for optimizing your game by placing complex meshes with simple impulsers another one also focus on slicing but this one is more making fractures so instead of making just one big slice you really just break the whole thing apart so great for glass or any kind of shatter effect and as you can see lots of more interesting ones it ends in the end of this month so check it out with a link in the description and as usual that's an affiliate link so if you get it you get some awesome assets and you also help support the channel alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
