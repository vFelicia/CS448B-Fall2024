hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the SSR is full of awesome tones and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video only check out some highlights for May 23 even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great and look at them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these asses enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is a list of paid as an effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and best zones and systems as always there's links yes in the description and it's bonus you can use your coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your Earth also right now there's a new Humble Bundle I think this one might be the biggest bundle I've ever seen it has over 5000 models everything from a city pack some houses for us a bunch of survival props some construction characters there are some Vehicles something medical Wild West farm and tons more stuff it's just 25 bucks so real if you need some low polyester then this is a great deal you could build a million game ideas with all these packs so check it out the link in the description alternatively there are two more bundles there's one with a bunch of realistic materials and tons and tons of stuff and there's another one with lots of topdown Sprites or if you need some tools then check out the spring sale on the unity s store I highlighted some of my favorite dances in another video all the ones that I covered in my asset review series are on sale for example this is a great time for you to pick up the quantum console so you can easily follow my free multiplier course and they Flash the ones are also still continuing definitely check that page to see which ones are starting soon so you don't miss the deepest discounts alright so starting off with a really nice space Skybox pack changing the Skybox is one of the easiest things you can do to make your game look much much better these Skybox they all look gorgeous I could see myself using this next up here is the latest in the studios pack this is a fun one all about a casino it's got some really flashy characters with some very unique outfits then it also has a huge Casino environment with tons of unique rooms so the obvious games would be some kind of Casino tycoon or perhaps some kind of Heist game maybe something inspired by Ocean's 11. if you need some Sapphire particles then here's a great pack feature some very strange very unique particle effects some bars and some screens which kind of look like Radars or Target indicators this is a kind of thing that you can add background to your game and make it feel much more alive or perhaps you're working on some pixel art game and you need some Heroes if so then look at this one features tons and tons of customization you can change the body hair skin color equip a bunch of weapons and armor then easily use it in game with included animations either in skeleton form or export to PNG or something much more realistic here is a Gothic interior features some insanely high quality assets looks very Gothic which is actually quite spooky it includes modular parts so you can build your own levels next here is a fun stylized horse looks very friendly it's got multiple visual variations and includes several animations great if you need some kind of Mount fairy game the next here is a nice Mediterranean island and army base this looks like it was taken straight from something like Far Cry or perhaps just cause so if you'd like to make games similar to those then this would be a great starting point or perhaps you're working on some kind of Wizard game if so check out this magic wand animation pack it includes one hand with six ones and seven animations the animations have names but really it's up to you to decide what each animation represents you can make them cast all kinds of spells and this also includes a trunk character just for fun if you're more into scifi then look at this nice weapon pack it features quite a lot of weapons that are all very high quality models they've got tons of polygons they're all very detailed with various skins the weapons have separate parts so you can very easily animate them then for a fun VFX back here's a nice one it's got lots of interesting cartoon effects meant to work in urp you've got 24 animations with nature Fire and Ice next up here is a nice looking low Poly map pack right away I still like this one because it reminds me so much of this too I spent a significant portion of my childhood inside that map this one is a pretty cheap pack with some really nice assets includes 100 prefabs which you can mix and match to build whatever map you want you can do that or really just use the included demo scene for something super high quality check out this Knight character it looks really gorgeous really great design very interesting style kind of looks like some kind of dark Paladin all of it is done using some very high quality 4K textures next here is a fun animation pack all about death animations it's quite interesting to have an entire pack just focused on death animations I guess there are tons of ways your characters can die this one includes 30 animations everything from a basic one just falling down to some that look pretty gruesome and very intense if you like this pack then this tab has tons and tons of excellent animation packs up next here is one that I hope doesn't demonetize this video it's a pack with super realistic human organs and Bones definitely very freaky this would be perfect for any kind of horror game or perhaps you could use this to make an xray vision mechanic kind of like Mortal Kombat for something a lot more jolly and cartoony here are some fun animated wrong lists very nice and cartoony style includes 18 stylized Brawlers the characters are all very creative then each character also has a bunch of animations so you can easily use them in your games next for some UI here is a nice scifi pack features lots of buttons sliders and icons you've got various headers notification elements and really anything to make a SciFi game UI then here's a very Niche but very interesting one it's a bunch of dirt bike animations there was an awesome game that I played as a kid called Motocross Madness it was simple but it played really great you could do all kinds of Tricks that's exactly what this pack reminds me of could be fun to build a game just like that this one has five dirt bikes 5 characters and 60 animations everything from some normal ones do some really interesting tricks or perhaps you're working on some hex game if so here is a nice asset pack you could use this combined with my hexford system that I made in a previous video it includes lots of unique titles some with some houses others with resources or maybe some soldiers so this would be the perfect pack to make a quick prototype kind of like Civilization if you're not looking for something more underground here is a deep tunnel pack it's got a realistic sound looks really nice features tons of rocks and all kinds of props so this could be a fun level in your game or maybe look at this board game set making board games is an excellent way to get a few more games under your belt and game sim experience so with a pack like this one you could really build a bunch of prototypes and make them look interesting features chess Checkers dominoes go playing cards and a bunch more alright so those are my top 20 new visual SS on the NTS store for May 23. there's links on the description and as a bonus you can use your coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order
