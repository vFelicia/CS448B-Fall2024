in this video we're going to look at the new features and changes in the in latest version of unity 20 19.3 Universal render pipeline terrain homes new editor interface that sample with multiplayer and many many more let's begin ok so unity 20 19.3 has just come out and it contains tons of really interesting new features and especially lots of stuff becoming productionready first of all the most visible one is the new editor interface as you can see everything has a new flat design honestly at first this new design was pre jarring since I did spend thousands of hours looking at the old editor UI but I've been using the beta version for a couple of weeks and by now it doesn't look normal I do think it looks a bit cleaner with less distracting elements a bunch of 2d tools are now verified packages meaning they are out of preview and become production ready the base thing is studio lights which are now officially supported so they are no longer experimental along with those neon lights also come to these shadows which make your 2d games look great and you can also now efficiently add sub textures so you can set it to the normal maps and masks then there's the 2d animation with all the tooling for creating skeletal animations the two DPS the important which lets you import a Photoshop file and automatically separate layers this is honestly insanely useful especially when you combine it with the 2d skeletal animations then you have to the pixel perfect to the shadowgraph spread shape and town map all of those are now in verified packages as you know I love working in 2d so having more stable 2d features is always excellent news the High Definition render pipeline is out of preview and the own lightweight render pipeline has now been renamed into the universal render pipeline with the u RP also comes the e to the renderer fully supported previously it was in experimental and now everything should work great so that includes official shader graph support for 2d there's also a new postprocessing built directly into U R P so this replaced the separate postprocessing v2 package although functionally everything should still work the same but be more performant you simply don't need to install a separate package I've used postprocessing before but I've never done a video on it so now that we have a different new tool let me know if this is something you'd like to see a basic getting started video and the long with the release of H ERP also comes retracing in preview so that's quite interesting another one out of preview is the VFX graph so this is excellent news and certainly something I plan on covering in the future I've seen a lots of great stuff done in the VFX raft but I've never really used it I've been really enjoying making all the graph tutorials so now playing around with thousands or even millions of particles should be lots of fun how it works is similar to shadow graph so I'm hoping the learning curve isn't too steep the terrain system is also getting some terrain holes this is not something I have ever used but from what I know this is a highly requested feature so it's great to hear let me know if you'd like to see me do some terrain videos I certainly would like to try them for myself the incremental garbage collector is now production ready this is potentially a great new feature that I have yet to try it out essentially if your game is generating garbage then at some point you will know the same massive prawns dip in a single frame that's the garbage being collected it gets on bundled together and then everything gets cleared in a single frame with the incremental GC you should see unless of those massive spikes and more tiny collections we should help your game stay more stable now there's a bunch of new options when entering play mode you can set it to enter without domain reload meaning if you don't modify your scripts you can get into play mode pretty much in an instant this is really excellent for speeding up iteration time so you make a change hit play mode and you're instantly in the game rather than having to wait multiple seconds for the scene to compile this looks like an excellent feature to really speed up iteration but there are some caveats like for example you need to handle reloading you're screwed to yourself so this is a very interesting topic that I definitely want to research also something extremely important is a change in the unity 2020 release cycle a couple of years ago with unity change from one massive new version to three tech releases and one LTS release tech is where new features get added and LTS stands for the long term support where it only contains bug fixes so if you want stability stick with the latest LTS version which right now is 2018 point for the change is in 2020 instead of three tech releases like now there won't only be two so 2020 point one should come out in spring with 2020 point two coming out in the fall and finally 2020 LTS coming out early next year one of the reasons for this change is because now all of new features are being worked on as packages in the 2020 release there won't only be two main tech releases but again all the packages won't continue getting releases as they're ready so for example the entities package was just updated to 0.5 a couple of days ago entities and the entire dot stack are being developed at full speed and I believe the target is still to get the core ready out by 2020 point one the feature of dots continues to be very exciting and something I intend to continue covering so related to that they knew that sample has also come out this is a fully working multiplayer thirdperson shooter it definitely looks very interesting so it's something I plan to research to figure out how it actually works I especially want to look into the dots netcode present in this sample I've read lots of comments asking for multiplayer content so I might actually prioritize them dots lifelink is another potentially very interesting feature since dots is all about data this lets you easily sync data between devices so that's another thing that is extremely useful for a quick iteration cycle there's also the entity conversion workflow I'll have to look into it but I believe this is the inspector update where you can see what components your game object will be converted into another package also moving along is visual scripting it's still in the experiment on stage but it seems to be coming along nicely there should be a new drop just around the corner and when that comes I want to look at it again and possibly make a small complete game just using visual scripting and beyond that there are tons more new features and improvements that I don't have time to cover here so check the official page to see everything new there's the mobile device simulator there's unity as a library which lets you insert unity directly into native apps the input system continues getting developed quick search in the editor the address of an asset system for referencing offline and online assets the serialized reference attribute profiler improvements UI elements and the UI builder several AR and VR improvements and many many more again check the official page to see everything new in this version this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone so that's the longawaited unity 29.3 version as always unity continues to improve with every release and tons of new features coming out with others becoming more and more stable I'm really excited for the future and I can see how unity is currently right in the middle of restructuring everything so you got the new release schedule you got the package manager and you got dots so by now I can definitely see where they're going with and how the next few years are guaranteed to be extremely exciting so go ahead and download 20 19.3 from your unity how I'm going to go ahead and research all of this awesome stuff all right I'll see you next time
