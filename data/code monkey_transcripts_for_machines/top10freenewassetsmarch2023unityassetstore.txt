hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tones and assets to help me make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for March 23 in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them by the way right now there's a Humble Bundle with a huge 97 off discount on Senti assets there are so many game ideas you could build with all of these maybe you could build a World War II shooter or a plane simulator with war pack maybe even Lord of the Rings inspired RTS with this one then perhaps use the gang Warfare pack to make some kind of tycoon game maybe make your own left for that with the boss zombies you could build something like fallout shelter with the apocalypse Interiors maybe make some kind of Battle Royale with a better round pack or perhaps a songs like with the dungeon pack or really just prototype anything with a very useful prototype pack personally I'm a huge fan of their own low poly style and if you also like it and you want tons of assets with a huge variety for a super deep discount then check it out to the link in the description alright so on to the top 10 list starting off with a really nice looking toon Shader there are tons of tutorials out there where you can learn how to build this kind of thing but having a simple free package makes it so much simpler personally I'm always a fan of tune shaders always makes the game look really interesting regardless of what assets you use so if you want to make your games a little bit different then this is a really easy way of achieving them next here is an interesting tool that does exactly what it does it helps you serialize dictionaries this is also something that is quite a bit annoying dictionaries are really awesome but not being able to see them in the inspector is quite a bit of pain usually what I do is I have to find a struct with the key and Valley types then I make a list of that type and on a wake I fill up the dictionary using this really makes that process so much easier next if you want some nice low poly houses here is a nice pack features quite a lot of variation for a free pack looking at this makes me really want to make a quick City Builder prototype just with the road tunnels alone you can really make something quite interesting then here is another interesting tool it's a graph for your object references meaning that you can inspect an original object then that object references a Sprite and another object and you can easily visually see those references it's a very inventive tool I've never seen anything like this so this can be really great if you have tons of references for your objects like for example if you use tons of scriptable objects to hold all kinds of data if you need some VFX here is a bundle with a whole bunch of magic effects they are all excellent quality and quite a lot of variety for a free pack feature some magic circles some auras a bunch of slashes explosions and more adding some excellent VFX is a super easy way to really add some punish to your games this one is a free pack and if you like it then this dev has tons more if instead your game has some weapons here is a nice low poly pack it features a pistol a knife and a rifle all with separated body parts so I think this would be the perfect pack to do a quick prototype on a kind of weapon attachment system by being low poly means you can start from this one as you build your system then you can buy a complete pack to use in the final game this nav has packs with tons and tons of weapons for a really low price up next for another tool here is a simple rest server this one is quite interesting basically you can make Unity into a server which can then receive and respond to http requests and that could be obviously a server on the Internet or it could also be religious localhost if you want to build some tunes just for yourself for example I researched how to do csharpening pipes which is quite tricky using this tool would have definitely make that process much easier it looks extremely well built and really easy to use honestly I'm quite surprised that this is free if it helps you may not look into picking up one of the paid assets to support this stuff if you have a 2d side roller then look at this robot pretty nice character with some separate body parts and multiple weapons so this would be a great starting point for a size rolling shooter then for another tool here is simple atoms this one appears to be an implementation of that famous Unity script object song it supports variables events and listeners so you make a swordball object and you can easily link up logic by linking that object it's an interesting pattern one that is more designer friendly than just linking up regular events and if you're making a cute game look at this Sparrow very tiny very cute quirky character it includes the character and 18 animations as usual if you like this style then this dev has tons more alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the NTS store for March 23. there's links are in the description and also check out my friend alright hope that's useful check out these videos
