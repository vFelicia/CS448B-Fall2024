hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey and my game is finally out right now this has been quite an intense journey I definitely underestimated how much work it would be to make a game and regular videos at the same time but I finally reached the Finish Line I'm really happy with the end result I wanted to make a fun game with some automation Colony building and defense elements and I wanted to make it work in both single player and Coop multiplayer and yep I did manage to achieve that lately every time that I go to test the game I end up playing way too long because I'm just enjoying playing the game that's always a good sign so I generally hope that you enjoy playing the game and speaking to you as an instructor I highly recommend that when you publish your games you ask your players to leave reviews reviews matter a ton on the same algorithm so now speaking to you as a developer myself I'm asking you to go ahead and review my game I really hope you like it and I'm looking forward to reading all your feedback as always this channel is all about learning and full transparency so I will be doing a video covering all of the sales numbers all the costs whether I hit my original goals and doing a postmart down the game what went right and what went wrong I'm really happy with how the game is right now but there are still lots of ideas that I'd love to EXP spend upon this but before I do that now that the game is out I will be constantly reading all the feedback and spend this week pretty much fixing any bugs and doing any improvements that I can after that for the rest of this month I really want to get back to making some tutorials some courses regular videos and so on basically all the things that I put on hold whilst I was working on this game now as you play the game go ahead and tell me which mechanics and systems you would like to see some tutorials on like perhaps the character customization perhaps you want to know how I built that or perhaps you're curious as to how the off Works maybe how I made this really nice 3 the UI maybe how all the dinki is set up and how each machine works personally I'm really proud of the game both in terms of just being a good game but perhaps even more so the quality of the code that I wrote especially these past few weeks when I was doing this super huge Sprint I wrote a massive amount of really high quality code I'm really happy with that so basically later this month I want to cover a bunch of tutorials on a lot of these systems let me know which ones you'd like to see most and I also want to thank you for following me on this journey this was quite stressful making videos alongside making a proper game this was quite a bit more worth than I anticipated but I really enjoyed reading all of your comments especially on dev Vlogs and your feedback for the demo build that was super helpful so thank you all so much and I also really hope that foll me along on this really nice six month journey I hope this was helpful to see how I make games how I take something from prototype onto a final game on scene you can go watch the very first prototype to see just how far the game has come I really hope that watching this journey has helped you and inspire you to work on your own projects okay so go ahead and pick the game and please remember to write a review they really do help and stay tuned for the video covering all the revenue numbers and everything that I learned with this project all right so go play the game thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
