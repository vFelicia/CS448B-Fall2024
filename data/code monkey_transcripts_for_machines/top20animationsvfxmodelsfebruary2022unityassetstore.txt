let's check out some highlights for february 22. even if you don't pick up any of these it's still great to look at them just to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can manually picture all the kinds of games that i could build this one is a list of paid ads and effects i've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and the best tools and systems let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the ask in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your org also a few quick mentions here there are several bundles happening right now first up there's the cinti asset bundle this one ends pretty soon so if you haven't picked it up yet i would highly recommend it it's got a massive amount of assets that would enable you to make hundreds of unique games and all in their gorgeous lowpoly style then if you're interested in making an rpg there's also a bundle with several game dev tv courses they are extremely indepth and they're about making an action rpg very much like diablo and finally as you know from watching the news there's currently a war in ukraine and unity has just made a mega bundle with a bunch of interesting assets all of the proceeds from this bundle go towards several charities working in ukraine so you get a bunch of nice assets and help support a great cause from looking at my analytics there's about 10 000 viewers from ukraine and 30 000 from russia so i really hope all of you are safe and i hope this needless war ends soon alright so starting off with a fun unique one a really nice realistic drone pack obviously perfect for any kind of dedicated drone game or perhaps also great for any game where your character uses gadgets kind of like watch dogs and one of them is a drone then for some animation check out this bow and arrow includes over 100 unique animations you can move run draw shoot and tons more comes with a rigged bow and of course a nice apple then if your game has a construction area look at this one it could be excellent for making some sort of city builder game it's got a nice low poly style and over 200 objects or maybe you want something a bit more realistic here's a medieval npc it's modular so you can mix and match tons of clothing faces hats and more if you're in need of something super natural check out this beast this will look great in a doom like or some diabolo like game contains four beasts all of them with some really nice animations if all you need is some basic sword animations then this one is great it's exactly what it says basic sword animations for making a survival game you need some weapons and materials this pack is really nice has quite a lot of variety all in a nice realistic art sound then if you want to make a city building game look at this one it's a massive pack with a nice slow poly style over 800 models everything from buildings vehicles sea landscapes and tons of props if your game takes place in a police station then this one is great looks really nice a real nice realistic art style so maybe for making a jail breakout game or perhaps something resident evil inspired then this can be really useful up next here's a slot ui pack with tons of effects if your game features equipment of any sort then this is a great way to add some polish so if you have a system kind of like the atom equipped system that i covered quite a while ago then this can be great you can make your rare items look really special or add above to a certain equipment are you working on some kind of restaurant simulator then if you need some food here it is you've got pizzas burgers fries shakes hot dogs and tons more for another really highend scarylooking character here's a demon it's a gorgeous model really highres also includes animations if you're making a shooter or a worldlike game then look at this pack it's a nice modern setting in a nice low poly style lots of buildings weapons vehicles props and characters if you have a shooting game where you want to give the player a testing area then this shooting range would be great quite a lot of objects and props it's a nice variety of targets some of them are generic some with a bad guy others with hostages also a bunch of modular parts to build anything if you're in need of a low poly medieval character here's a really nice one i quite like the sound on this one very much inspired by dark souls but in a low poly style features lots of animations and if you like this style then this dev has a bunch more up next here's another environment a coffee shop interior it's really cozy would be perfect for a coffee shop similar game or perhaps just a nice environment for a cutscene then if you have a game where your player is crash land on some place then look at this helicopter really nice highres model also includes flames and smoke vfx if you need some more effects then here's a great fantasy pack lots of hits slashes and impacts another great environment is this jungle so this one would be perfect
