in this video I'm going to offer what I've been working on that around tycoon along with an overview of how each element works guess money restaurant double damage steam achievements and trading cards let's begin so I continued to work on been around that goon the plan is to get it fully completed and out of early access by the end of this month you can pick up the current version on Steam and if you do please make sure to write the review since review something game stand out here I won't go over what I've been working on and a brief overview of how each element works if you like a more detailed video on anything I show here please post it in the comments so in total I've been working on finishing the maintenance system making transporters carrying multiple weapons guests money more overlays restaurant arena items and started designing these team achievements and trading cards on the maintenance system I've managed to complete it which was started on the previous level essentially each building is composed of various lanes that the guests used to entertain themselves now when they finish using a lane the lane gets a small maintenance hit if the maintenance state gets too low then the lane is no longer usable until any maintenance worker goes to repair so we're here you can see an icon that shows that this lane is broken and cannot be used right now so we need to go up here hire some maintenance workers wait for one of them to come in and there he is and he's preparing just like that and after a while he repairs everything goes back to normal and only is usable again here is the simple class that handles the maintenance State as you can see it simply has a simple float for the maintenance State serif by default at one then we can repair it which sets it back to one we ask if it needs repair which is if it's under one and if it's user bone which is under point zero five so we can repair the object ask if it needs repair ask if it's usable and actually spend the maintenance amount so this is a very simple asset essentially in sentient on every single object link and then down here we have a simple function to create the visual so it's Emily subscribes to the on maintenance a change depend and if it's not usable it shows that sprite and if it is usable it destroys the sprite and remove the icon then when something is broken the workers simply go to repair now one of the most significant features I've added was the ability for a transporter to carry multiple weapons at once this was something I've wanted to try out for a long time since playing the game it's very frustrating to constantly be waiting for weapons to be delivered the solution was to simply hire more transporters but it looks quite bad when the park requires 30 transporters just the function so I finally decided to tackle this problem and surprisingly it was actually much easier than I previously thought I thought I would need some really complex extra actions with more data when creating each task however in reality it was much easier when a transport as the test system for a task I run a simple function to try to merge those tests so for here is where the transporter requests an order and right before I give them an order I try to merge all the nearby tasks so over here there's a maximum distance it does a cycle through all the tasks and then it simply tests the distance between each task position from the from Andy to position since essentially an item goes from a position to a position so if two tasks are nearby on both the front and the two then they are together and I simply merge those tasks so this is the part that I thought would be very difficult but actually is extremely simple i similarly created a new task type and this task type simply contains both of the different tasks then all I need was to modify the transporter in order to be able to execute this new task tank so essentially goes to the first item grabs the item then goes to the second item grabs it both atoms have been grabbed it takes the first item to the target position Trump's the item goes to drop the second item drops the second item and requests a new order so over here we can view the end result let's buy some weapons and see if they transport them correctly so we're here a bunch of weapons having spawned this one comes and there we go we're at someone and he grabs two and he's moving away so as you can see this essentially doubles the speed at which the transporters transport weapons there he goes and let's see where he's going and he's going in there and simply drops both weapons so there you go just one transporter made one trip and move two weapons so this whole thing helps the park run much more smoothly with much fewer transporters and that same code was also applied to the arena workers so over here when they go to set up let's see if one of them grabs two weapons and there you go that one grab and now he goes there place one there another one there and so on so everything is now much faster also related to that the cleanup functions now also check for the closest nearby tasks so as you can see that one cleaned up that one cleaned up down and cleaned up down so that makes it much faster so oh no a lot of new invisible features that help the park run much more smoothly now one great addition was giving the guests money so when they are spawned they start off with a certain slightly randomized amount of money and as they go through the park and interact through the various buildings they spend the money from their wallet and when they think about which building to go to they first check if they can afford it and if they can't afford anything they leave the park with no money so over here is the guest park roaming AI it's a very simple script that essentially decides what the guest won't do so we're here we have the basic asking if the guest is too tired if so leave the park then here we have asking if the guest still has money if he has under 4 bucks then we leave the park and now the way to counter that system is with a new ATM building here it is very simple place it in there and there it is now guest goes in there thanks about for a while there you go he has five bucks and he interacts with the ATM and Rigo now he has fifty five bucks so that is taken care of in here so essentially he checks if his won't amount is under a certain ATM mount in this case seventy bucks so if he has under seventy bucks he tries to look for a nearby atm if he find one and he can join it he goes there and grabs his money now in order to ensure that the guest does not say in the park forever there's only mid to how much money he can withdraw the same is true of the coffee shop essentially if they could go to the coffee shop and withdraw money without any limits then the guests would never leave the park since the energy would go down get some coffee money go down get some idea so both those are limited and here is just a very simple function so the gas has a simple integer to define how many ATM visits and you can go there if it's under a certain maximum the same thing over here for the coffee visits so that's how each guest has a certain money now in this update also a couple more overlays previously I just had overlays with icons which look very nice however now I've added some overlays that display text so here this shows how many guests have visited a particular building and in here the revenue from that building now I like the information that this overlay shows but I need to figure out how to explain to the player which each number means essentially and here the top one is how much revenue this building generated on the previous month and underneath is how much revenue to generate this month I like having those two pieces of information but I need to figure out some way of explaining that to the plan either way right now you can easily see which buildings are bringing the most profit for every month then also an overlay here for the guest wallet amount something very simple if it's red then he only has eight bucks and this one here and slight green NES 55 bucks so just an easy way of seeing how many ATMs you need to add over here you can see quite a bit of red so I would probably need to add a couple more ATMs and you break billing to some of guests hunger and thirst is the restaurant in here the billing is composed of three inner buildings there's the stove where the food is made the counter where the waiter passing in order to the cook and the table where the guests sit so I guess goes in sit asks the worker for his order the worker goes places the order in there he cooked where as the order starts cooking the food after a while the food is finished its placed back on the counter and when the worker is available there he goes he grabs the food and he gives it to the worker to guess any starts to eat and as he does he solves both his hunger and his thirst needs so this building is more expensive than down here the simple food and drink kiosks but it allows for greater efficiency by quickly serving many guests and solving both needs so it's a very nice extra building that adds a bit more complexity and makes the park a lot more interesting then down here on the arena added to new arena items the double damage and the Frank Renee so when he goes grabs the grenade fires it and it causes an explosion and the double damage stays active for a while and doubles his amount of damage so they do exactly what they're mean to they're very simple and add some nice extra frame so here I can add quite a lot of them and there we go he has double damage he fires he fires a grenade explodes and it all looks quite nice so just two more items had more variety to each arena then he also started designing the achievements and trading cards I'm planning to release the game at the end of this month so it's about time to start adding some steam features I want to add achievements trading cards cloud stats and leaderboards and Workshop support if you've never dealt with any of this stuff then it might sound very intimidating but in reality it's actually rather simple there's the awesome open source teamwork net which is written in C sharp and very easy to use so for most things it's really simple the more complex thing is implementing the workshop but for that I have all the code that I've used in my other games so reworking that code to fit this game is probably not going to be very difficult so these have been the elements that I've been working on battle royale tech maintenance system transporters carrying multiple weapons guest money more overlays restaurant arena grenade and double damage and started designing these team achievements and trading cards the game is coming along nicely and I'm really looking forward to having a finished game it is up now on Steam early access so you can pick it up right now to play in the current state in doing so you won't be supporting this channel the features shown in this video and the previous table were at down today's update with version 0.14
