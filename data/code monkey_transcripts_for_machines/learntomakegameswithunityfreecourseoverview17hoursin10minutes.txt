hello and welcome I'm your code monkey a while ago I launched my two free complete courses one is Target that complete beginners on learning how to make a game in unity starting commonly from scratch and the second one starts from where that first one lets off and is on converting that game into multiplayer the project starts coming from scratch and go step by step like your band lecture until the final polish game so here is a quick overview of everything done during those two courses so first of all we're going to start commonly from scratch by selecting a Unity version and creating a brand new project with that new project we will then learn all about the basics of the UNT interface and setup plane layout then the other important part is Visual Studio which is where we're going to be writing all of our code after that comes an extremely important lecture all about coding style in naming rules like I said the code in this course is on the same level of quantity as my Steam games so having proper naming rules and good code sound is Paramount next we're going to download and import all the assets that we're going to use in the course everything is included so you can follow along with every step of the way with yes it's important we're going to set up some quick post processing just to make the game look good then for our first piece of logic we're going to make a simple character controller with that logic working we will then Implement a proper character visual with the included assets next we're going to learn the basics of animation and the animator component and with that we're going to make our player really come alive with some simple but really nice animations then we're going to install the send machine package this isn't actually used too much in this course but I still wanted to include it because it is such a useful tool so I do want you to know about it after that comes another extremely extremely important lecture with regards to writing some good clean code we're going to do a nice refactor to replace the Legacy input manager with the brand new input system learning how to refactor is an extremely important and very valuable skill that will massively improve the quality of your code with that then we're going to implement some nice Collision detection to make sure our character doesn't want through walls next we're going to create the very first kitchen counter and make a script to handle how to interact with it then we're going to learn all about csharp events and create a proper interact input next we're going to build a selected counter visual which will require us to learn about the extremely useful Singleton pattern with the counters working we're going to start working on the kitchen objects themselves so these are going to be the ingredients and the plates we're going to use scriptable objects to Define all of the types then a very important part of our design is each kitchen object will have to be placed somewhere so we're going to take some time to really think about the best way to achieve that all while riding some good clean code next we're going to enable the player to pick up an object in doing so we're going to learn about csharp interfaces then we're going to make a container counter this is from where we can spawn new objects with that we will enable the player to pick up objects and drop them anywhere where there's space then we're going to make the cutting counter this one enables the player to cut an ingredient into slices so to do that we're going to make an alternate interaction and for handling the cutting we're going to once again use script more objects to define a proper cutting recipe then we're going to learn about a really awesome ENT feature we're on canvases and use that to display a nice progress Bar for our cutting progress after that is a quick lecture just going to make a very useful generic script to make any object look at the camera next for another counter we're going to build a trash bin this is where the player can drop objects to destroy them then the stove counter this one is going to be quite a bit complex we're going to create recipes for cooking and for burning we're going to learn how to make a basic state machine and handle timers next we're going to make the plates counter this is a simple encounter that just spawns a bunch of plates after that we're going to make some custom Logic on the plate to be able to hold other objects with that logic working we're going to build a complete visual for all the objects that can exist on the plate then make a nice UI element on the plate itself to showcase the icons of what exactly is on that plate afterwards we're going to make the very last counter the delivery counter this is where we drop the completed plates and in this lecture we're also going to learn about the entity graph and make a quick simple custom Shader then we're going to build the delivery manager class that generates the recipes that the customers are requesting next we're going to build a UI to showcase the wedding recipes after that comes something pretty crucial we're going to add some music and then add some sound effects for all kinds of game actions with that the game won't be almost done so next we're going to build a proper game start and a game end then make a simple main menu and handle scene loading after that hand on creating a basic pause window then make an options menu enable the player to modify the audio levels and rebound keys after that we're going to enable menu navigation with a controller and in the end as usual comes the Polish stage so we're going to add all kinds of small tweaks and effects to make the game feel really great like I've said many times polish is what separates good games from great games after all that we will have our final completed single player game then for the multiplayer course so first we will Begin by taking a brief look at the starting game this is what was made commonly from scratch in the ceiling player course so here we're just going to do a quick overview as a refresher to see how all the code is set up then we're going to begin by installing netcode for game objects this is unity's official multiplayer solution we're going to install the package and do the basic setup with all these settings and spawn a player object after that we're going to begin by synchronizing the player movement and also at this point we're going to talk about one extremely important thing in multiplayer games which is server authoritative versus client authoritative with the movement synced we are then going to synchronize the animations this one is pretty simple to do thanks to the builtin components next we're going to synchronize is our first proper gameplay logic we're going to begin with the delivery manager so we're going to synchronize how the recipes are spawned make sure only the server spawns them and all the clients see the same list and also synchronize delivering the recipes either correctly or incorrectly after that is just a quick lecture to fix the selected countervision this is something that showcases one of the many differences between making single player games and multiplayer games we need to think in different ways especially because in multiplayer we no longer have just a single player object then we're going to synchronize picking up objects this involves learning how to spawn objects on the network so that all of the players can see it after unlearning how to spawn them we're going to synchronize the kitchen object parent so that multiple players can hold objects and everything is correctly synchronized across the network then we're going to synchronize the plates counter make it so that only the server responds points then for the trash counter this one involves learning how to destroy Network objects after that is synchronizing the cutting counter so this one will involve thinking about what parts we need to synchronize eyes and what logic can be just local then for the stove counter for this one instead of using rpcs we're actually going to use a network variable the server won't keep track of the stove State and sync it to the clients next is synchronizing the logic for adding ingredients onto the plates after that for an optional design question we're going to implement some player collisions then we're going to synchronize the complete Game State SO waiting for all of the players to be ready before starting the game and also synchronize the game timer and game over next we're going to learn how to deal with pausing so do we unlock it or not in this case we are going to allow it and all of the other players must wait until everyone is unpaused then for something very important which is how do we handle disconnects how do we clean up all the objects so the game doesn't crash when a player leaves in the middle related to that are only joins so how do we handle a player that joined after the game has already started or should we even allow that then comes a really important and relatively complex lecture in this one we're going to handle the complete connection scene flow how we begin in the main menu in Sim a player then we have an online lobby after that we create the netcode connection and go into the character select scene then when all the players are ready we then go into the main game scene and after that just play the game as normal this is one of the most important lectures in this entire course after that with the connection from we're working we're going to build out a nice character select scene this is one of the main things that I saw people ask about in my netcode video so we're going to make a nice scene where the players can join and customize their character next we're going to build the game lobbying so the player can create a Lobby or Join one then we're going to implement relay in order to allow our players to connect to one another easily without having to open ports next we're going to talk about some more yinty multiplayer Tunes dedicated servers with game server hosting Matchmaker and vvox after that we're going to talk a bit about all of the tools at your disposal to test your multiplayer games then just before the end we're also going to add a really important option we want the game to work in both multiplayer and single player so we're going to make it so you can basically bypass all the multiplier connections and play in an offline single player mode and with that everything is done so we're going to inspect the funnel game and have some fun so as you can see you will learn about a ton of Topics by following these two courses if only you want this just learn how to make single player games and you can just watch that first course but still if you get to the end that one I would encourage you to follow the multiplayer course simply to gain more knowledge and really solidify all those clean code principles the single player course about 10 hours and the multiplayer 1 is about seven if you go through both of them you will gain a ton of knowledge the response to both these cores has been really positive of so I'm very happy with the results if you find the course is helpful there's an optional paid ad free version but there's really nothing different in that version there's nothing behind a paywall so everything here all the lectures all the project files all of it is commonly freeing so only pick up the optional paid version if you find the course helpful and if you can afford it beyond that if you've already seen my two free courses you can check out my other ones I just recently released the 43 update to my ultimate TNT overview course which now contains over 16 lectures each covering a different two or more feature of the engine then if you enjoy the focus on clean con principles then a great followup is the turnbased strategy course alternatively maybe unlock into visual scripting or learn how to make a builder Defender game so if you want to learn how to make games or improve your already existing skills then check those out alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
