hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're continuing to create a graph in unity we're going to add some separators to our x and y axes to make our graph easier to read let's get started so we previously created this graph here which is displaying all of our values our valleys are represented in code as a list of integers right now we can't really tell what values does each not represent just by looking at it what we're missing is a visual for the scale of the x and y axis so essentially very separators on each value so back in my editor here on my window graph I'm going to go into my graph container and create a game object inside it and essentially I'm going to create a template for the text that I'm going to use to display the x and y axes so in here let's call it from label template essentially this is a game object that we're going to copy/paste in order to display all our various labels so in here I'm going to add a text component make it overflows no what no hi let me anchor it to the lower left sign so right there and for text let's say a random number and this one will be the label template for the x axis which won't be aligned in the center okay so this is what we're going to use to copy/paste and let's duplicate one make a live label template for the Y and align this one to the right and the middle okay so now let's disable these game objects since we only want to use them in order to copy paste and we don't want the templates to actually be visible so now that we have our labels for our axis separators let's go back into our code here and in here when we have our show graph when we are creating the circle we're going to create our separators let's start off with one on the xaxis since that's the easiest essentially the x axis separator is only one per index so after we spawn a circle let's just duplicate our x axis label so first of all let's go up here and grab reference to my rect transform for the label template X and simply on the Y and we're going to grab our references in here they are inside the grab container fine little template bags get component rect transform do the same for the wine okay so I have my references to my own labels that I'm going to duplicate so go down here and I'm going to make a rect transform for my own label X which will be the instantiation of that template label X dot set parent set the parent to my graph container I have to go into my game object and set the active to true since my template is disabled and now let's go into my anchored position which won't be in terms of the X will be at the same X as our circle game object but for the eye it won't be under the bottom of our graph so let's say 20 M and finally going to label X I get component of type text and we're going to set the text to be essentially our I I dot string okay so back into our scene and let's see if the labels are showing you yep there you can see our xaxis correctly aligned with our dots and they are displaying the index of each of our dots okay let's shift them a bit upwards but in terms of logic everything is working as we want okay so now that we have the X axes labels working let's take care of the y axis here it's a bit more complicated first we need to decide how many separators we're going to have so let's make an int separator count and let's say I'm going to have ten separators for the vertical axis of my graph so in here let me cycle through all of my separators oh it's been a separator count I plus one okay and now in here I'm going to spawn a label but this will be the label Y and based on the label template Y and on my anchor position for my X I'm simply going to shift it to the left side so let's say 7 F and now for my Y I need to calculate where this separator won't be in the graph so let me grab a normalized you for this particular index so let's make a float normalized value which will be the I divided by my separator count since these are two ends let's convert one of them into a float by multiplying by one so this will be a normalized value between zero and one of this index based on this many separate accounts so now that I have a value between zero and one in order to position it vertically all I need to is multiply that normalize value by my graph height so if this is one then it's gonna be on my graph height and for my text I don't want to display the index but rather the value that this separator represents so I'm going to make my normalized value multiplied by the Y maximum so if it is one this will display the y maximum which in this case is a hundred let's just round off our value and make it two string okay so we have defined a number of separators we in sin she ate our unleavened template we set the parent we set it into active we calculate the normalized value of this index we position it on the left side and in the correct Y position and for the text we multiply the normalized value by our Y maximum we round it off to an end and we convert it into a string okay let's see if our code is working yep there you go you can see we are dividing by ten since we have to find our y maximum as a hundred and we got ten separators then each of them is 10 so 10 20 30 and so on and our axe axe ez is also correctly displaying every value we want to have am live on tops and let's just say minus or equals but everything else looks okay so first of all in order to have it let's put minus equals and now it should display the hundred as well okay yeah there you okay great so now that we have both of our axes with our own labels let's set some dashes so we can easily follow the separators with our eyes okay so let's create a new template for my dashes that we can then duplicate it so going to my graph container and create a new empty game object and name it template X okay so this will have a image component and I have been here a texture of the which is just you know half in white half transparent going to set the height to let's say three and set it to be very transparent so just about just about there and set the image type to Thailand and I'm going to anchor it to the left side the pivot to the left side but the anchor on the bottom right there and there you go I have my dashes and I can modify the width to occupy the whole thing so let's put it a bit to the left so it matches with the labels and shifted completely to the right yep there you go exactly so I have my template everything is working correctly so well it's duplicated to make our Y and set this to disabled so let's make template 40 Y and let's just rotate it 90 degrees so it's facing upwards and for my Y yeah I'm going to place about in there so I might say minus 4 on the line and for my height let me place it okay there you go I have my vertical and my horizontal dashes so let's again raise this back into our code and first of all we need our references so make a private rect transform template X and template Y and grab the references in here okay we grabbed our references now in here when I'm creating the label I'm going to do the same thing to create my template X and call it X and let's remove the set text and there you we are positioning in there and in there okay so I have my X is correctly being spawned now let's take care of the Y so in here when I'm creating the why label let's create a for my Y in sin she ate the template for the Y and for my exposition let's just put it on for and for the Y will be the same as my label okay okay so we are now adding the dashes at the same time as we add the labels and in here the same thing so let's test it and we should now see dashes on both axes all right there you have it we can now easily see what values are on the graph so I can see that this down here is between 40 and 50 and it's in the xaxis on the three so the graph is now much easier to read so there it is we have successfully added separators or graft make it easier to read our data in the next video we're going to customize our axes and labels as always you can download the project files in utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them ok see you next time
