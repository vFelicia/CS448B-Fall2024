hello and welcome I'm your cmy and here's a nice December surprise two excellent bundles are now available I was wondering if this year there would be something to match absolutely excellent bundles of last year and finally there's something like it there is a Unity Mega bundle I was planning to do a video just on this one because it does have tons of awesome stuff and then out of nowhere Humble Bundle also made a Unity bundle also with tons of awesome stuff as always these bundles are on a super deep discount so if just one thing looks interesting then the home bundle is worth it and regardless of what game you're making there's definitely more than two Assets in these that I'm sure you'll find very helpful so first over here on the Humble Bundle this one has 30 tools and assets for 35 bucks technically you can just pick the first year you can just get this one for a buck maybe if these are the specific ass that you need but the whole thing has such a huge discount that you might as well just get them all first thing is the survival engine this one is a ful featured complete Survival game template it features crafting building farming it works in Mobile and PC Works in first and third person these complete templates are always great for quickly making some some prototypes although personally I prefer similar tools that do just one thing like for example this next one right here the mesh slicer like name implies this lets you slice some meshes now in a previous video I showed how to add destruction to your games you can slice meshes with probuilder but that tool is experimental and sometimes crashes so if you want something that just works and has tons of features including realtime slicing then this one looks great something that helps you make better games is getting feedback from your players so if so here's a great feedback form you can easily receive bug reports from your players including screenshots and any extra data then if you have a car game here's a tool to help you add vehicle physics that's one of those things that is really hard to get right so getting a proper asset is a huge timesaver or if you want a complete car game template then the Hard Road engine would be a great starting point this one is made by the same developer that made feel and the Corgi engine and the top down engine so this is a great asset made by asset professionals if you have character especially in a low poly you can make them come alive by adding some talking with this tool it automatically animates the character's mouth along with some audio if you have some performance issues it can try solving that with a dynamic mesh combiner if you have a 2d game that you want to be squishy use a 2d soft body one tiny but very impactful Polish thing is adding a dynamic Lan to your characters you can do that easily with this asset and this bubish share has another one for making some really great Tails or manage your assets add some lens flares pick up a dialog system do some visual scripting get some projectiles get some tune effects transfer some files load something and so on so this is a huge bundle with tons of super interesting stuff and again the whole thing for 35 bucks so if just want of these is interesting then the whole bundle is worth it and then Unity has their own Mega bundle this one is also excellent these are 23 asses for 23 bucks again a great deal even if all you need is just one here you have a gorgeous stylized environment or if that's too cheery check out this industrial Factory perhaps you need a ton of gorgeous looking orus or simply a nice postprocessing effect to make your scenes look really pixelated if you're annoyed with how long your code takes a run then perhaps look into the Liv script reload if you want to make something like an old school retro game then this template looks excellent I just recently made a character customization system you can download your project file for that one and apply it to a pack like this one or make your game a bit more spooky and interesting by adding a punch of fog you can add a bunch of transitions to make your scene changes a bit more interesting then you've got a mobile FPS you've got the LSS to make your game Run much better a bunch of super useful editor tools some more UI a really nice Port City and here is one that I'm actually surprised to see in a bundle this one looks like a really excellent really complete Game template I saw this one in one of my assd videos because they look really excellent It's got some automated food placement then you can make some third person melee games you can make a top down shooter you can make an FPS game with tons of movement make it a s scrolling shooter it features inventory it's got Mobile support you can modify the gravity you can even add some Vehicles so yeah this one alone looks really impressive and it has five star reviews I've never used it but it looks really great so just this one alone makes the home bundle worth it and everything else is really just a really nice bonus honestly personally I really love the state of assets nowadays when I got started making games I had to build everything myself and my games were always visually horrible because I have no skills as an artist whereas nowadays you can just pick up some super useful tools and some really gorgeous assets to help me make some really excellent games if I was just getting started right now I would definitely pick up these and spend the next month making several really interesting prototypes with all these tools and assets so I really hope that these help you on your Game Dev Journey as always the links in the description those are a film links which means if you click on them and you buy them it's the same price to you and I get a nice commission all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
