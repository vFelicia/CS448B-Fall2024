this video is made possible by my game bong in this video I'm going to give you some tips on how to work from home effectively I've been selfemployed working alone from home for about 10 years now and this is how I stay productive let's begin so given the current circumstances it seems a lot of people are having to start working from home so I thought I'd make a video sharing some tips since for me this is my normal and not much has really changed I've been working from home my home life and through a lot of trial and error I found similar ways that help me stay productive here I will cover 8 tips that have helped me work from home all these years as I said this is what I've come up with after 10 years of working from home however working from home and working alone are also very personal journeys so my hope is that you take these tips and apply them to your own life where they make sense every person is different so figure out what works for you and do that this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone alright so first of all work from the list this one is probably the most important one it's already very important for a regular job but even more so when working from home alone working from home has the potential with having tons more distractions and having a clear task list won't greatly help you fight that everyday set up a list of specific things you're going to do during that day and also keep a total list of things to do there are many ways of making effective lists so play around with various methods to figure out what works for you for example for me when I make my games I have a list of the next 20 or so tasks that need doing since making a game is a longterm process I prefer to keep a more longterm list rather than just a daily list however when making the videos which is a shortterm process I do it more by just setting the task for that specific day combining a game takes at least six months so it's a very long process compared to making a video which takes two or three days so I have to list times depending on what project I'm working on here's some book recommendations on creating lists and working effectively eat that frog getting things done and deep work making effective greatly help you give guidance as you work from home so it's very important to get right also very related to that and another external important thing is study up on selfdiscipline this is the thing that won't either make or break how effect if you are at working from home if you're at home alone you need to be disciplined to work when there is no boss watching you this is definitely tricky at first there's pretty much nothing stopping you from opening up YouTube or reddit and just wasting an hour so it starts off very difficult but selfdiscipline is like a muscle the more you work at it the better you get working from lists really helps makes things easier so again make sure you do that once you apply some selfdiscipline and get started working on a task and then complete it you will feel great when you cross that task from the list essentially selfdiscipline is the idea that you do what you know you should do whether you feel like it or not there was one audiobook that really helped me a ton when I was just getting started which is the miracle of self disciplined by Brian Tracy I first listened to that back when I was really trying to turn a game development into a job and it really greatly helped me so I definitely recommend you give it a listen and apply it to your life this next one applies to working from home but also working from an office which is take frequent breaks after about two hours of focused work your productivity will almost certainly drop heavily so do make sure you take a break around every two hours or so and then go back to work with a more clear mind one great thing you can do is go for a walk so for example if you have a dog then take him or her for a nice walk just a nice 15minute break is great for resetting your energy levels and letting you get back to work effectively you won't be much more productive if you take breaks then if you try to work for eight hours straight now this next one is very important to me personally which is stay physically active honestly this one is what I consider to be the big reason why I've been successfully working from home and being productive without going insane over all these years staying physically fit greatly helps your energy levels and also helps you stay mentally fit while providing a muchneeded break from work so this has also been my one big challenge during these times I normally go to the gym everyday but now the gym is closed so I'm trying to make do with what I can by going for run doing some pushups pullups or whatever I can do to stay active if I don't then I can clearly see my productivity drop like a brick working from home will undoubtedly end up being more sedentary than working in an office at least in the office you still have to go there and go back home and while in there you probably walk around a bit maybe go a few stairs and at home you won't have any of that so if you don't focus on consciously increasing your activity level then you'll just end up sitting in your chair the whole day and only getting up to eat so make it an active goal to stay as physically active as possible it will greatly help you both physically and more importantly mentally then it is absolutely essential to have a routine just like your a normal job where you probably work something like 900 to 500 you should also have a very specific schedule when working from home if you just work whenever you feel like it then you will not be productive at all however one huge benefit is it does not necessarily have to be 900 to 500 some people are not productive around with the standard routine some people work much better in the morning and some are more productive at night so use working from home as a great opportunity to find a schedule that works better for you than the standard ninetofive for me my brain works a lot better in morning so I have developed a routine that is very focused on starting early and like I said I also take frequent breaks so as an example here is my regular routine first I wake up around 530 so get up and make some coffee I write down my list for day and I start working I work from 600 to 800 then I go to the gym and do a nice workout get back to work at 1000 until about 1000 1130 then take a break and go walk my dog then back to work at 1145 and how about 230 then walk my dog again and have some lunch and in the afternoon my brain clearly doesn't work as well so I just do some white work from about 300 to 400 then take another break go back to work at about 600 until 700 or 800 again usually doing some light work and finally going to bed at around 900 so that's pretty much what I do every single day again one of the benefits of working from home is that you can be much more flexible so sometimes like right before I'm about to release a game I pretty much end up working nonstop with only breaks for the gym welcome my dog and have meals and on the other hand if it's one of those days where my brain just isn't working at all then normally I stop working right as the afternoon starts and pick it back up on the next day and again this is just my personal example of what works for me the goal is to find a routine that works best for you personally I find my brain works a lot better in the morning so that's why I focus on the mornings also I did not come up with this schedule on the first day I start working it's something I've developed over several years as I learned better how my brain worked when I start working on my flash games back in 2008 I definitely did not have this schedule back then being able to work for two hours a day it was already a success if your brain works best in late at night then use that to your advantage rather than trying to fight it try out various routines focus on getting plenty of breaks and figure out what works best for you next one is eat right this one isn't necessarily specific to working from home but it is one of the things that can be difficult I found that if I have tons of snacks lying around and I won't resort to eating too much whenever I get stressed from work and as the saying goes if you eat like crap you will feel like crap so if you eat tons of crappy snacks then you will end up really sluggish which will make being productive a lot more difficult again this is not specific to working from home lots of offices have tons of snacks lying around but you pay attention to it since it can greatly affect your productivity related to that also drink a lot of water if you're used to going to a normal office then chances are you're also used to going to the water cooler a couple of times a day so remember to do that and drink water while working from home then this next one is honestly not an issue I ever faced with but I seen lots of people struggling with it so I figured I should mention when you get up to your work get dressed just because you're alone at home that doesn't mean you can slack off on your appearance well technically you could work without pants or while wearing pajamas don't do it it won't be much hard to convince yourself that it's worth time if you're still wearing pajamas so when it's time to start working get dressed shower shave and do whatever you would do when you go into normal work it won't greatly help reduce the amount of selfdiscipline needed to get started working and finally work from a dedicated room now this one is going to greatly depend on whether you have the space or not but if you do then this can greatly help separate work time from leisure time but it's not a requirement for me I never had a separate room so I've always worked and played on the same place and I can make it work however even if you're in the same physical space do make sure you have some changes so if you don't live with other people make sure you tell them you're at work and close the door put your phone away and leave it on mute especially if you're a programmer interruptions won't completely destroy your flow so protect yourself from them only have workrelated programs open definitely don't open up YouTube during wartime unless it's to learn how to do something stay focused and constantly see yourself work all the time you work when work is done then you can point so these are my tips for working from home effectively I've been doing this for about 10 years now and through tons of trial and error this is what I found works best for me it is definitely very difficult at start so if this is your first time then don't beat yourself up too much if you fail if you do then you'll just end up frustrated and gets even harder instead accept your failures and make it a go on to do better tomorrow as with anything experience is key working from home and being self disciplined is an extremely useful skill and more you do it the easier it will become and everything that I mentioned here is just what I found works for me personally every person is different so take what I said here and test it out to find what works for you so go for it and best of luck in your own journey this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code McKee to get some perks and help keep the
