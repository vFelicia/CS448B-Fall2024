hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here we have a massive unity mega model you can get over 800 worth of assets for 95 off this one is all about level building tools it's a super deep discount so even if just one of these assets looks interesting then the home bundle is a great deal the funnel is split into three tiers all of them deeply discounted with the biggest deal on the third tier at 95 off all right so let's check out some of these assets starting off on the first year with runtime transform gizmos just like the name implies you can get the usual transform gizmos that you have available in the editor but use them during runtime while playing the game this is super useful if you have a level editor tool that is made for working during runtime being able to do a level design while playing the game and moving the player character is great for some super fast iteration the hardest part of making a runtime level editor is the handle so this is incredibly useful then in order to handle loading between levels here is loading screen studio easily creates some good looking and smooth loading screens with this package includes a bunch of easy to use presets with titles tips and backgrounds supports async loading press any key and it all runs on a single line of code next up on tier 2 for some visuals here is fog volume 3 adding some fog will instantly add a great sense of sound to your game it's designed to model a wide range of atmospheric effects everything from simple clouds to some fallon storms combined with some lighting for some awesome god rays to make some truly gorgeous worlds it looks great it's fully controllable and very performant if your game involves dungeons then here is dungeon maker it's a tool for helping you connect some rooms together to make large and complex dungeons build your base room set them up as prefabs and define the room entry and exit points then create the dungeon object to set up all the rooms and the various connections and finally take all that design data and dynamically generate a dungeon the rooms are all randomly generated but they do keep the same dungeon layout so it keeps things fresh while keeping design control over the layout and then the final tier is full of awesome stuff make your games feel really alive with the mesh deformation full collection this is a massive collection of mesh tools you can manipulate meshes paint over them sculpt morph deform it's been around for five years now so it's a very mature tool if you have some meshes that you wish were just a tiny bit different or you wanted to massively modify them then this is the perfect tool it even works in vr which is great for playing around and sculpting objects while you're directly inside the world for some more assets here is a medieval village environment it's a great looking village lots of wood everywhere build some exteriors with a bunch of prefabs and fill in the interiors with over 50 props includes a demo scene to see it all in action if you end up building a giant world and performance starts taking a hit then look into impossers it's a tool that takes your highend 3d models with tons of vertices and simplifies them down to simple quads the end results can be pretty drastic achieving up to 20 times performance improvements while looking visually very much the same it's super easy to use no need to do any special asset preprocessing and doesn't create any extra assets no need to manually make any lods yourself everything is generated at runtime and it utilizes dots with burst and the job system in order to achieve some massive performance since this bundle is all about creating levels this asset is simple but extremely useful the full screen editor it does exactly what the name implies it takes your editor and makes it completely full screen so naturally that's super useful when you're level building just select the scene view and put it on phone screen to get tons of space to work with and it also works when in play mode so if you're testing your game sometimes there's some things that need to be tested in full screen and with this you no longer have to make a separate build then there's gravit i've mentioned this one before in some previous sales it's a tool for easily making some natural looking environments just grab whatever props you want move them and watch as they fall according to gravity so you don't have to paint syncingly position every object to ensure there's no clipping you just grab it drop it and that's it i've had maya on this one for a while so the whole bundle is worth it just for this one then here's an interesting one for you to keep track and help you actually finish your games it's called task atlas and lets you place down notes and postits all over your level so you know what needs to be done you can view all of your tasks and all of your landmarks in a nice list definitely a unique asset that has a lot of potential to be extremely helpful all right so those are just some of the highlights from the bundle it's a really deep discount you get over 800 worth of assets for just 40 bucks so if you're interested in just one asset then picking up the home bundle is worth it i've picked it up myself mainly for grab it and the mesh deformation collection the link in the description is also an affiliate link so if you pick up anything through there you'll also be supporting the channel alright so thanks for watching i hope you found some interesting assets that can help you in making your games and i'll see you next time
