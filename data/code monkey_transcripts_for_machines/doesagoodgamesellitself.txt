hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this video let's explore the question does a good game sell itself this is a question or rather a statement that is usually made by people unfamiliar with just how difficult it is in the indie game market this video is meant as a companion video to the one i made on the most important skill you need in order to be a successful indie game developer make sure you watch that video before this one especially if you have aspirations of being a successful game developer in there i briefly talk about an example of a game that looked great but failed to find success due to lack of marketing so spoiler alert for the answer to the question in the title no a good game does not sell itself so here let's look at another example and really dive deep and analyze why it failed and what the developers could have done differently to find success my initial goal with this video was actually to cover multiple examples but i think it's better to really dive deep into a single one i have researched this game extensively to figure out why it failed to find success and what could have been done better especially from the standpoint of marketing and i will also give you some tips and hopefully you can apply those to your own games so that your game does not fall into this trap where you don't do any marketing and even if you have a good game you still don't find success and let me just quickly clarify the intent with making this video the goal isn't to bash on this game so if you're the developer please don't take this wrong way in fact the game that i chose is a game that i think looks great i think it's very well made and the players that picked it up do enjoy it so my goal with this video is to analyze what could have gone differently so that a game with this level of quality could have found success and of course this is a learning exercise both for me and for you to see what we can learn from this example and learn what to do and what not to do so your future games have a better chance at finding success so here is the game that i researched really heavily it's called gear shifters it's an arcade action card game it's a pretty unique concept visually the game looks excellent the cars look great and all of the effects are extremely high quality features some interesting boss battles a bunch of car customization with tons of upgrades and many levels even though card games is usually not a genre that i'm all that interested in i still think this one looks great regardless if you're a fan of the genre or not i think we can all agree that this is definitely a wellmade game this one is not something that was made by a beginner simply following a simple 5 hour course this one is a proper wellmade game so that's the good news the game looks great and if we look at the reviews we can see that it does have very positive reviews however we can look at the number of reviews to get a sales estimate using the box slider method which means you multiply the review amount by a number between 20 and 70 depending on how optimistic or pessimistic you want to be so let's say we multiply by 40. currently the game has 25 reviews so that times 40 means an estimated thousand copies sold at a price point of 25 that means around 25 000 gross revenue that's not such a tiny number but that's gross revenue so it is not what the developer gets at all from that gross revenue then we have to take away refunds and chargebacks like i mentioned in the other video one excellent newsletter is game discover co and they actually did a case study on refunds they found that the rate for refunds is around six to eleven percent and chargebacks are also around one to two percent so for both of these let's assume 10 meaning that the initial 25k gross revenue is now just 22.5 k then we have to take away steems cut so that leaves 15.75 after that we take taxes which is going to obviously vary greatly depending on the specifics of the developer maybe on a low tax country that could be something around 10 to 20 percent and maybe in a high tax country maybe around 40 to 50 percent so let's take a number in the middle let's say 30 percent with that we can't wait that the final total net revenue going into the developer's pocket is around 11k that is much less than the initial 25k which by itself was already pretty small and of course this is revenue it's not profit everyone has costs the developers have to eat so it's doubtful based on this number that this game turned a profit so with this tiny amount we can definitely say that the game sadly failed to find success despite looking like a high quality good game now let's try to identify why that happened and what they could have done differently like i mentioned in the other video one of the most important metrics is followers and wishlist so let's begin there we can go into steamdb and we can see that the game had just 300 followers usually the rate of wishlist to followers is somewhere around 3 to 10x it's a wide range depending on if the game participated in a steam festival or did a free prologue or things like that for this one i couldn't really find any of that so for this game i think we can assume on the lower end of that scale so they probably had around a thousand to 1500 wishlists that is a very very tiny amount once again i'm going to mention the awesome game discover code newsletter by the way this one isn't sponsored or anything i really just love all of the data that they provide they made a study to calculate first week sales from wish lists and the resulting median was about 0.2 meaning that a game that launches with just a thousand wishlists will likely sell just around 200 copies on the first week that does seem to track with the sales estimate of around a thousand units for this game the game has been out for four months so it likely sold around 200 copies on the first week around 600 on the first month and then 400 more in the following three months so the first reason on why this game flopped is simply insufficient number of wishlists with so few wishlists very few people were notified when the game came out then even fewer of those converted into sales which in turn caused the steam algorithm to just bury this game under tons of other games that were simply selling better again that does not mean that those other games were better than this one it really just means that this one did not sound well compared to the competition right at the start and that start is very important steam essentially promotes more of the games that do sell and less of the games that don't sell we can also see that the steam page only went live in april and the game released in september that's just 5 months pretty short amount of time together wish list especially with limited marketing from what little i could find it seems the game was in development at least since early 2020 but i cannot find any mention of it before it was officially announced there's no alpha or better screenshots anywhere the only thing i could find on the game was really just screenshots with the game already fully polished so my tip to you is get that steam page up and running as quickly as possible so you have as much time as possible together wish list and of course post as much as possible obviously you do need to have something to show but don't wait until everything is perfectly polished as long as he chose a nice hook for your game you can definitely post alpha and better screenshots to start gathering an audience that will actually be interested in your game it appears the game did not have any marketing beyond an announcement and a gameplay trailer the publisher really only has a thousand subs on youtube although the trailer does have 30 000 views so that suggests that they experimented with some paid marketing i also couldn't find any launch trailer so that suggests not much of a push when the game actually went live which you absolutely need to do again the goal is increase the number of day one sales so lunch they should have a big push i did manage to find a single mention on reddit on a shmup subreddit like i said in the other video one good way to use reddit is to go to several edits of the genre of your game but it seems like this one was supposed by a player so not really even the developer the game does have a twitter account but almost zero followers the developer has a bunch more but not too much this one is a very giftable game and the store page has some great gifts they did post some gifts on twitter but nowhere near enough they pretty much just starting posting one month before release and at a very slow rate of maybe just one per week the gifts themselves are great i think they are very visual they showcase the game in great light so i think that if they had just posted more over a longer period of time that alone would have made a huge difference these are the kinds of gifs that have the chance to do well on twitter imager reddit and possibly on tiktok so another tip to you if your game is giftable make tons of gifs in advance then slowly release them on every single one of those platforms maybe three to five per week just imagine if the game had the steam page visible for 12 months and posting 3 gifts per week that would be 156 gifts meaning that's 156 chances of finding viral success also the lack of a clear hook didn't help i mentioned the excellent talk by ryan clark in my other video having a good hook is really essential to standing out the game is clearly very well made but there's nothing too unique about it it's a great looking topdown car shooter it's interesting but not something you absolutely feel you need to try for example a game with a really strong hook is super hot the tagline is time moves when you move and as soon as you hear that you know you absolutely need to try it it's a very unique very compelling hook whereas here it's a car combat game so that's more unique than a simple car driving game but not too hockey that you absolutely need to try then we get to price which might also have slightly hurt the game it looks excellent at doing exactly what you expect but like i mentioned there's no unique hook it's really just a very well made game charging 25 nowadays is a really a premium price point for an indie game you really need to give the player something truly special for that price point just think of all of the awesome games that you could get for that amount 25 is definitely on the upper range of the triple a indie games and it is an especially high price especially when you have a low amount of wish list with that few people that already know about the game you're really only going to sell to impulse buyers and 25 dollars is way off on the impulse range now as to what i think the game did well in terms of marketing i think the trailer is great and like i said the game itself looks great marketing is very visual so the fact that the game looks great definitely helps the name is also pretty good it's unique but not too unique that's a good thing you want your game to give the player some idea of what the game is like but you also don't want it to be too unique that no one will remember it i think the capsule image is well made and the store page is very well crafted with tons of high quality gifs that sound great they also have a mailing list on their website so that's good although not sure how much traffic they get on the website so without driving people towards it from external sources i would guess they really didn't have many signups so in the end it really comes down to those wishlists the game launched with a very tiny amount of wishlists which means no one knew about it answering the question in the beginning of the video does a good game sound itself in this case the answer is a very clear no the game looks great the reviews like the game but it absolutely did not sell itself now i should also mention that this one is also available on the playstation store on xbox and on the nintendo switch and on top of that it even has a physical edition so it's possible that maybe this game as a whole did find success it's possible that it's owned much better on those other platforms compared to steam so in the end maybe it might have done well but still we can say for sure that this game despite looking like a great game definitely flopped on scene however this is also not necessarily the end of this story on scene you can participate in the weekly sales every two months and you have the regular steam sales on spring summer and winter given how the game is of a high quality i do think it will have a decently long tail as the discount goes up to 50 and higher i do see the game selling more and more and if more and more people enjoy and review the game it will possibly be promoted more and more again coming back from a difficult launch is extremely difficult but even if you can't really come back from a battle launch you can still have a decent tail also one quick note specifically on the steam algorithm there are four buckets of reviews which greatly affect visibility if you have less than 10 reviews the score isn't even visible this is really bad so you absolutely need to get 10 reviews asap the next one is between 10 and 49 reviews at that point you do see the score but it's still pretty bad for visibility the next one is above 50 reviews this is where you want to be as quickly as possible ideally on the first day or maybe second or third by then you should really be at 50 or more reviews if not it's a really tricky start and the final one is at 500 reviews and that one is really tricky and that's when you start seeing scores like overwhelmingly positive as you can see this game did not manage to hit 50 reviews even now several months after release until it gets that much it's going to be really tricky to attract a large amount of players so my tip to you as a game developer is definitely encourage your players to leave reviews and also my tip to you as a player if there's a game you're playing and you're enjoying it do make sure to write a review they really help the developer again let me mention one more time if you're the developer of this game please don't take this video as negative criticism i'm literally saying the game is good and i think sales are subpar compared to the quality of the game i really don't want anyone to see this video as me bashing on some game that didn't do well i know what it feels like to have a flop and i really don't want to make anyone's day worse all i want to do with this video is explore and learn from this example so that you or i can have better chance of finding success with our games let me know if you'd like to see more videos kind of like this where i dive deep into some game and investigate why it did not do well i think that could be a useful format to learn more about marketing and how to actually find success with your games learning from others mistakes is one of the best ways for you to avoid those same mistakes yourself alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
