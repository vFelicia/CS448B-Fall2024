hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and it's that time of the year again time for Black Friday time for picking up any assets you've wanted at a nice Deep Discount Unity sponsored this video to do a nice overview of the Black Friday sale on the asosore there's over 500 nests on sale including the usual top assets as well as a bunch of new ones that came out this year and the sale also has some really nice Flash Deals these are 70 off really nice discount there's a bunch of them and they change every single day so make sure you watch your sound page so you don't miss them unlike the previous five steals these don't have a limited discount so they are 70 off for the entire day and also one more bonus thing on this sale Unity gave me a special coupon code monkey bf22 which you can use to get an extra 10 off on orders over a hundred dollars it works on all of the assets on sale including the Flash Deals so that's a really nice bonus so don't forget to use the coupon so let's check out some of the helmets on sale all of these assets are excellent there's lots of tools and visuals I'm sure at least some of these won't be super useful for whatever project you're currently working on let's start off by looking at the first batch of Flash Deals I think there are about 14 hours left by the time this video goes live starting off with an excellent Cynthia low poly pack the apocalypse pack as you might know I just recently officially announced my next steam game total warm Liberation that game is all about a zombie postapocalypse so this asset is one of the main ones that I'm using it's a massive pack with tons of characters buildings and lots of props with the 70 flash deal it becomes pretty cheap another great flash deal today is the flat kit it's a really nice tune Shader I experimented with some tune shaders for my game I tried out this one although I ended up choosing a different look this is one of the best tune shaders on the store so if you want to make your game Stand Out definitely get it with the flash deal alternatively another interesting one is quickly I tried this one out a while ago and does produce some great results also features tons of options and settings so you can get it looking exactly as you wanted and another flash deal today is the World building bundle this one is a massive bundle with tons of World building tools including guy and many more there are some extremely capable complex tools for example Gaia can help you make gorgeous worlds in hours instead of months it really is a tool that I'd like to research in more detail extremely powerful and this bundle also includes a level ability tool a world streaming tool cutscene fly through and some interactive soundscapes so pretty much everything you need to build an awesome world for your games on the store Page you can also view all of the assets that won't be live in future flash deals so that means you don't have to wait until the very last day of the cell to pick something up if it's on this list then wait until that day to pick it up but if it's not you can pick it up right away there are some really awesome ones that won't be getting a flash deal for example tomorrow you've got the RPG essential kit this includes the awardwinning RPG Builder asset along with tons of visuals weapons armor and characters if you want to build an RPG with a game builder asset then this one is without the best one if instead you prefer a realistic fantasy style then in two days you have this nice Infinity PBR pack one great thing about these assets from Infinity PBR is they always include tons of blunt shapes so you have lots of Sliders to change pretty much anything in all of these units you can modify the face body remove armor change the weapon and so on then if you need textures then over here is a really huge pack with 600 textures then in four days there's a really nice home designer pack if you want to make game like The Sims and this seems pretty interesting then you've got some cute robots in seven days a MMORPG game builder if you like fighting games then this Universal fighting engine looks really awesome so as you can see tons of flashlights coming up they refresh every single day so make sure you check out this entire page it has five pages worth of Flash Deals all the way up until December outside of that some of the assets that I covered in my asset review series are currently discounted there is the astar pathfinding project I've used this asset in pretty much all of my scene games it's insanely fast pathfinding helping you to create games with thousands of units all of them pathfinding around large worlds it also has many map types so you can have a Nev mesh or a grid map or just a simple Point map if you want more control over where the player can move you can check out my phone review to see what it does and how it all works another one that I've also reviewed is rayfire it's an excellent destruction tool the results really speak for themselves it works in runtime and is also externally performant this is one of those things where you can use it to build an entire game around it or you can just add that extra bit of Polish to your game destroying everything really feels quite satisfying then the excellent Odin inspector is also on sale most of you probably already have this one if not not then this is a tool for helping you build tools so depending on how you use it it can be a massive multiplier on your own productivity you can watch my phone review to see a quick getting started guide and see just how easy it is to make your own tools if you're making a 2d game then I can highly recommend the allinone spray Shader super easy to add tons of effects to your game also made a review on this one and there's another one by the same developer the allinone VFX toolkit I haven't yet looked into this one but it doesn't look really excellent and it's actually pretty cheap the last one that I also reviewed is feel this one is an excellent tool for helping you add polish your games like I've said many times polish is what separates good games from great games if you want to find success you need to make your game stand out so definitely do spend some time polishing it feel is an excellent tool for helping you do exactly that and speaking of Polish one thing you can do to punish your game is use a custom cursor if you want to do that then my own asset the mouse cursor system Pro is really easy to use although Suddenly It's actually not part of the main Black Friday sale these sales are invite only and since the asset hasn't sold much it hasn't been invited to the sale but there's actually another sale happening at the same time as this one the 1111 sale and yes it is part of that sale however that one seems limited to only a handful of countries so depending on which country you're from it might or might not be at sale obviously I'm biased because it's my own asset but I do think that it's great and adding a custom cursor really adds a nice bit of extra polish I will certainly be using it in my own game just before release now some more interesting things on sale you have zebra and liquids if you want to simulate some liquids then this looks excellent liquid simulation is one of those things that is extremely difficult to do in a nice performance manner so picking up a tool like this one is definitely worth it if all you wanted some visuals then there's tons of gorgeous stuff on sale lots of the synthes are on sale if you're a fan of their Style just like me then definitely browse around for some animations here is a runner animation pack really quite a lot of insane animations great if you're making some kind of Parkour game if you want to pack with tons of animations using tons of weapons and this one is great I picked this one up a few years ago and it's quite impressive how many animations it has here is one with some really powerful Archer animations this dev has some really impressive packs for some spread effects here's a pack with tons of Sword slashes fire water and a bunch more if you want it in 3D there's a bunch of gorgeous looking ones like like this one one super easy way of drastically improving your game is changing the Skybox so having a great pack like this one definitely helps another way to instantly improve your game is using a proper UI pack instead of just some basic swear so something like this one if your game has tons of graphs and a proper student can be really useful for example here is graphing chart this one helps you make line graphs bar charts you can make pie charts interact with them and so on if you want to modify and manipulate your meshes then look at mega fires it can help you make some really strange results this one wouldn't look perfect in pretty much any kind of cartoony game shapes is also another great one also on sale it's a great tool for helping you create all kinds of shapes and easily animate them the results look really nice if you're making mobile games and there's also a bunch of us that have some useful tools for example here is easy Mobile Pro it helps you add ads inapp purchases you can trigger notifications game Services sharing and a bunch more another asset that I'm also using in my own Sim game is volumetric lights just in case you don't know volumetrical lights are how you can add an actual shape to the light if you just create a light in unity it won't just eliminate the target area it won't have a visible shaft this tool helps you easily add that you just attach the component play with the settings and that's it really nice and it definitely helped my game trailer look quite a lot better if you want to paint on top of your 3D objects and look at paint 3D it does examine what you expect so this could be useful in a game where you want the player to paint their own objects like for example perhaps adding decals to a car when making some gorgeous games using big lighting is usually the best approach and one asset that I've seen recommended time and time again is Bakery I haven't used it myself but the results definitely look impressive if you want maximum Fidelity then big lighting is the way to go if you want to make platformer games then the Corgi engine is one of the best reviewed assets on the store it's been around for ages and is constantly getting tons of awesome updates something else that also used in the making of my game trailer is some music and sound effects I just browse my asset list and found that I had this really awesome pack it has music and tons and tons of sound effects really useful to have a giant pack just like this one alright so those are just some of the highlights on sale there's over 500 excellent assets on sale go ahead and browse the store chances are some things on your wishlist are currently on sale and don't forget you can use the coupon code monkey bf22 to get an extra 10 off on orders
