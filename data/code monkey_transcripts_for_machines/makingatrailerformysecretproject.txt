foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign how's it going thanks for being here all right quite a lot of people already let me know if everything is okay everything seems right all right and hey uh brand new channel member I totally forgot that this popup thingy this element was working so great thank you thanks for joining and thanks for helping me test this because I hadn't seen this in quite some time so yeah all right so thank you all for being here this is hopefully going to be an interesting live stream so basically the goal is the game that I'm currently working on in order to announce the game I basically have to make a trailer in order to make the public steam page in order to make that basically I need to create a whole bunch of interesting scenes to show in the trailer that's pretty much it so basically what I'm going to do here just kind of creating those scenes to then record to make the trailers then publicly announce this project and so on that's pretty much it I travel so soon yep I mean pretty much you have to how you find success nowadays especially on seam is you definitely need to keep your coming soon page visible for as long as possible and you technically don't need a trailer in order to make it public but it really helps so yeah my tip to you is to announce your game as quickly as possible but make sure you have a a steam trailer and make sure the steam trailer is good why can't I speak in Arabic I don't know probably the text mesh Pro default font doesn't have Arabic I'm not sure I'm not sure how do we change outfits so all right let me get rid of the background so just like that if you want to customize your character you can go and follow this mini tutorials you can go on the website you can modify just the colors or you can even draw a custom Sprite sheet all right so there's a link so if you want go ahead and do that all right okay so let's see what do I need to do so basically uh if you didn't see the last uh must be the record capture footage in the editor there's actually the yinty recorder although I haven't looked into it yet but I'll definitely be looking into right now usually the way I recorded is just the way I recorded any of my videos so I use OBS and just record and just either make a bell to record the phone 1080p or just record like this and then cut off the thing that's pretty much that's pretty much a thing okay nope that's not a bug that's a really nice it's kind of similar to it's the same UI element that I use for the Super Chat just made for a new channel member and J Phantom just joined so that's really nice so thanks again so much all right okay so if you weren't here for the previous live stream I basically talked about what is the top secret project that I'm currently working on which is essentially it's my next steam game which I'm hoping to have released let's say around July of next year so that's kind of gone so I've been working on it and I've already done quite a lot of stuff even though obviously visually it's still very much basic but in terms of systems I actually already have quite a lot of stuff working so as you can see it's based on my turnbased strategy course so it's a turnbased game so I can move around a bit I can select this unit and move around one of the things that I also implemented was the idea factions so those are enemies and this one is a neutral NPC so right now I cannot control him but if I interact with him there you go now he joins my team and now I can move him around so I can for example tell him to shoot although actually doesn't have ammo so he cannot shoot because it doesn't have ammo in the inventory but this guy does so he can shoot and boom there you go the enemy goes down drops a bunch of loot these things are items so a whole bunch of stuff then there's tons of systems already made here so this one over here this a power pole so this is for the power system so basically there's a generator there's a power pole and the power main so as things are connected to the power they expand and a bunch of these machines need to be connected to power thanks for your tutorials that's awesome I'm glad you enjoyed it uh right so yeah don't trust the neutral NPC yet because they will shoot you uh yeah so basically already got a building system working there's a crafting system so over here I can click to select some kind of thing so this little icon this is actually ammo and this one takes one lightning bone to construct so let me move over there and on this unit let me pick up that one now I actually don't have any more movement so let me just end the turn just to get back and now I can move in there and I can drive to the crafting and track again and there you go I just created an item now I can use the atom transfer action to pick up some items and pick it up to myself I know I've got one more ammo so yeah pretty much already got quite a lot of the systems working that I would like to do but obviously as you can see in terms of visuals it's still very much basic so it's not very much a work in progress so my son the goal is basically instead of working more on these systems right now I'm going to work on making the making the trailers so that I can finally publicly announce the game and then continue working on it and so on all right do the characters move with enough mesh no [ __ ] regular astar pathfinding so what I'm using is pretty much what I covered in a video quite a long time ago so just regular a star and yep just like this one so if you want to know how a star works that video is pretty great pretty great for teaching you how the algorithm works pretty interesting make the Eternal one really unlobby yep I would like to do that lately I've been working on on this game for these past two weeks but yeah now next week I'm going to be back to making some tutorials and yep that one is definitely on my list so yep okay right all right so I also made a little storyboard of the trailer that I want to make hmm so this is kind of the whole idea for the trailer so I just threw this as you can see I'm definitely not an artist so yeah basically for the trailer starts off empty just one Survivor then Survivor opens up the opens up the door and sees a zombie eating another Survivor and just shoots them and you can see a zombie counter going down and then that one says you save me can I join you so they join then both of them scavenge for resources then one of them goes into a crafting station in order to Showcase crafting then equips brand new items shoots a bunch more zombies shows the country going down a bunch more then a bunch more people join then showcase building an entire base shook his entire map becoming the green which is the the good guys taking over the zombies Iran then showcasing two different teams one going in different direction one of them shooting zombies one of them building an outpost once again the map expanding so the humans taking over for the zombies showcasing the power grid the atom transport then a bunch more teams maybe some boss zombies once again the map the map being taken over the zombies going down and then finally ending so this kind of the storyboard that I made for the trailer that I'm trying to make and also in the beginning before all this so this is kind of a I think it's an interesting story I think it's an interesting idea for the trailer so if I can build it just like this it should be a good trailer and then before that I just want to make a quick bumper so pretty much the the main hook for the game is the main hook for the game is how it involves tons of interesting mechanics and some interesting systems so before all of that I basically seems a little longer on paper yeah kind of I mean these shots are going to be pretty small so I think this whole thing can fit into about two minutes and then before that I basically got the bumper which is going to Showcase all the mechanics on the game so this is kind of going to be a whole bunch of scenes that each are going to be on screen for just about 23 seconds so it's okay is how the game is open the world it's got survival elements automation crafting strategy and turn base and so on so that's pretty much it basically going to show each of them and show the game with those mechanics and so on so what I'd like to do in this live stream is pretty much just prepare these scenes so pretty much just making them kind of like interactive things just so I can record them for the trailer that's kind of the idea game trails are usually 30 to 90 seconds yeah that's kind of what I'm targeting for at the most about two minutes that's kind of it what program will use he had a trailer yeah same thing that I always use so just Premiere so pretty much it all right so over here let me Begin by trying to make the visuals for this scene so I want some barbed wire in there I want a whole bunch of zombies increasing I want the human to be Scavenging for resources and then throw out a trap then the zombies get caught in the Trap and so on so each of these seams is going to be kind of like a kind of like a gif pretty much so just looping around and this is going to be the very beginning of the trial okay right so let me try to look into this and I've got here A whole bunch of assets that I already got so right now I got just a basic zombie and yeah we got some movement animation so pretty much it's got the basic thing okay so let's try making that scene so first of all I need I'll actually already prepared a bunch of um I grabbed a whole bunch of props and I dropped them into a scene so let's see yep so over here I got a scene I just went through all the acid attacks that I've got pretty much all of the synthy acid packs that I picked up in many sales and just dropped them all over here so got a whole bunch of interesting assets that I can use to populate pretty much what I'm trying to do so for the first one the main thing that I want yep definitely a ton of props and there's even a lot more because I got so many packs so yeah selecting all of these I pretty much just went through and uh I went through all of them look at all these packs apocalypse about around city and so on so I went through all of these each one has tons and tons of prefabs tons of props actually this one doesn't have much band they have a whole bunch of them so just selected which ones were interesting and dumped them all in here okay so I kind of want a a right here a barbed wire selling copy this one yep these are all from City Studios I might also use from some other packs just because it's on low poly so low poly is actually sound that you can pretty easily make it interchangeable so I might look into that one and right so for this one I just called the test let me just um oh right because I deleted the other one okay let me just simply get this one call this the trailer scene survival going to showcase the survival elements I'll just put the scene there let me go okay so now let me go into the props let me pick up the top that I want and go in there and do just make sure is the music coming on okay so I think so because I can't actually hear the music only you can hear the music but yeah it seems like it's going okay good all right okay hey look at that a custom character that's really nice thanks for being here all right okay so I'm going to make a whole bunch of them and let me just position the camera so where am I going to put the camera in communication with the city team yeah I've been with them I have yeah I definitely do enjoy their art I use them quite a lot yeah I've been uh I haven't affiliate link that I use for their own store I've used that and I've promoted that a whole bunch of times they tell me when they get some interesting sales so yeah definitely been in contact with them they're pretty great yeah uh okay so I want kind of a topdown View but not too much stop down or actually yeah it should be a bit top down or maybe more zoomed in uh yeah let's say something like this by the way here's a quick empty tip you can move the camera I've got the send machine virtual camera selected so you just position the scene camera where you want and press Ctrl shift F and it places the camera exactly on that position so if I go very good with the camera is in there so if you want instead of having to move the camera transform you just move the scene camera let's say I want this view control shift F and there you go just like that okay right so this is actually a bit too Zoom then because I also want to show them kind of gathering resources so let me also get the units so I'm going to want one Survivor and then a bunch of zombies so this one is actually using the uh this one is using the zombie model do I have any yeah I don't think I have you know these are all just zombies okay so let me pick up a Survivor model so shortcut more recently when I want to take screenshots yep definitely very useful uh right so let me go into the polygon apocalypse let me find the characters but the prefabs so the prefabs for the characters what are they did I not import the characters okay that's strange are they in a different place thanks I got the characters here but they're not in there why are they not okay I'm not sure all right yeah because they should be here okay I probably forgot where the nice shirt yeah it's on the on the Indian logo but yeah it's pretty nice those characters aren't precubs yeah for this one it's just a mesh but it's okay that works let me just I just need to assign the material so yeah because I'm not sure I probably forgot to actually import the characters model hey Super Chat thank you give them something awesome can't wait to play it all right that's awesome yeah I might do something like a sort of prealpha before I make a build on Steam something like that so yeah if you're interested in hopefully before the release that should be should be fun to to make kind of a nice uh nice little play test the idea that I have in my head is really nice so I really hope that I can build exactly the idea that I want that's that's pretty much the goal uh okay so on this one let me just see yeah I have no idea why the probably forgot to drag the prefabs in some way but it's okay uh yeah yeah because that one went just like that okay so anyway it doesn't matter right so let me just pick up the animator where's the animator this one and just put it in there and let's see this one well the game be multiplayer probably not uh the idea is making it a a turnbased strategy game so I'm not entirely sure how I could make that multiplayer but I'd love to just as a personal challenge just to try it out but yeah I don't at least right now the plan is not like that but we shall see we shall see okay so I've got that character and I've got the let's get rid of the zombie here uh yeah I'm going to need the the scene okay so basically I want two survivors on this side so thanks again for the Super Chat thanks so much uh right so on the characters let's put a different one like patient female okay not a patient I don't think that looks very good Scout where's this one yeah okay that looks okay I just noticed that they're bald uh is that supposed to have okay yeah I don't know so later I'm definitely going to have to look into that all right using Maximo for the animations uh yeah right now I'm using miximo animations but eventually for the final game I will be using uh uh proper animations so but miximo is indeed great for when you want to when you want to try and get something up and running very quickly it's pretty great okay VR turn based game that would be interesting how would you handle turn base in VR that's an interesting question I guess you could handle it from the top down there's a bunch of a bunch of interesting topdown games like that so that's one approach uh right so let me just actually add a bunch more animations do I have any animations here I don't know if I do yeah I don't think I imported my long pedal animation so let me just import them let me go into the package manager into my assets uh except I can't remember the name uh that's always the tricky thing when dealing with with the packages which is oh let me just stop this uh it's imported some ah what did I call them let me just oh I think I've got my assets or page yep right here so I can just go animation is it animation and the one that I'm looking for is one that is really awesome that is a bunch of idle animations uh where is it where is it is it this one basic motions okay maybe it's this one yeah I think it's this one with the whole bunch of basic animations so but let me open into the right project someone may open up into this one open immunity and let's load it up okay so the basic motions let me import them and let's see okay so a whole bunch of animation when does the character refresh uh it refreshes automatically but if you modify that the validation is manual so let me let me see if there are any brand new textures okay that thing is loading some reason there always gets quite a bit slow I think it's because I'm streaming every time I'm streaming my internet gets quite a bit slow but okay so that one is handling uh right so I can now find some idle animations basic motions this is idle and Crouch I don't want Crouch oh and just a regular idle animation yeah pretty much just like that I put start Crouch oh did I double okay oh I think I opened the wrong thing yeah I want this one and let me drag the basic motions item let's put this one on the earlier default State just make sure that all these are okay let me see the that's not refreshing the page but so far all of the custom textures are validated still waiting a bit by the way don't forget to to link your YouTube account on the website otherwise it doesn't know which character belongs to you there's a bunch of people that made custom characters that do not okay there's one here so I'm going to validate it even though it's going to look very strange so I don't know if that person is here so let me update the character customization I don't know if that person is here I have it linked but it is not loading what isn't loading yeah I basically just validated all the ones but so yeah learn a lot from your turnbased strategy course are you planning to upload the hex rate system yep I I think it just went live actually today so the hex rate system uh the lectures they're on the bonus section so right at the end yep I think that did go live just today so if you go and see it it should be there already it's about five lectures it's actually a pretty simple change so yep go ahead see that then let me know if you have any issues should be read according to the page and I'm great oh you're talking about regular uh yeah because for the thing I think it automatically updates okay so I'm not sure I think I thought I was talking I thought you were talking about the thing so I'm not sure okay right so let me just keep track all right uh okay so I want a whole bunch of enemies so let me make a whole bunch more enemies so on this one we're going to have another one there another one there let's just make them a bit different so on this one instead of this one let's say that one and on the other one instead of this one let's say that one and okay so I got a bunch of zombies okay so that's good now I wanted them to be kind of so where's my where's my uh where it is here it is so basically I want this so I want a bunch of zombies up top I want a bunch of barbed wire and then they are supposed to be uh Gathering some loot so let's try and pick something okay but not from this one let's try and pick something salute so let's see let's go into the props and let's pick some more props all right so for looting actually I think these packs right here with a whole bunch of random generic stuff I think these look pretty good so let me pick this one up let me go into the other one and just drop it over here let's pick up some more okay so that one and also wanted kind of like some cupboards so maybe like this and maybe like this okay just copy these which Castle does not uh I don't know these are from tons of synthy assets yeah are you going to use in the s in final game as well yep I mean I definitely cannot make anything better so yep I'm definitely going to make very heavy use of professionally made visual assets I'm pretty good when it comes to programming but I'm definitely not an artist so I'm going to pretty much use assets that proper artists have made and then I'm going to basically use my own programming to make the interesting part of the game that's kind of gone okay so make a whole bunch of things something like this I'm probably going to put the camera a bit more up top something like this except like this is a bit too much on top so yeah this actually odd angle but I don't want to look too much maybe like this can you soon multiply your video yeah hopefully within the next few weeks I've been uh pretty much working on this project but yeah next week I would like to get back to making a whole bunch of tutorials so yep next week I should hopefully start working on the multiplayer tutorials I still want to cover Lobby and relay so yep should start working on that next week okay let me just stop selecting the plane because it's always blocking this like that one move it just to the side okay so I got some barbed wire a whole bunch of things let me just no crap what did I duplicate candles yeah I don't want that let me not touch the canvas all right how many commercial games ever released so far uh I think eight or nine I'm actually not sure but I think yeah I think it's eight you can find them all on the well you can find them all on steam or on the website the game bundle so this bundle contains pretty much all of them except Barrel around Tycoon because it's the most recent one but yeah pretty much all of my games right there all right good so like this I think this is a pretty decent scene I just kind of need a floor texture all right so for the floor texture actually that's the one thing that is quite tricky so yeah I think I'll probably handle that later all right let me just get a trap prop so let's go back into the props I'm pretty sure I found a bear trap on some some of these asset packs so that's some luggage some things first aid kit nope to unbox a battery and a bunch of electrical things and a laptop and kind of like a bump or something a generator nope there was a trap around here somewhere a bunch of tools what is this oh right it's a saw uh nope none of these I swear I saw a trap kind of bear trap oh there it is there you go really nice bear trap right here so I think this is going to be fun so let me grab this one let me go into the scene survival and drop a trap and okay so basically then for the animation the player is kind of like going to throw these straps then the zombies go in they die on the traps and so on all right okay so that's the basics of what I want from this scene so I want you a bunch of zombies there they move forward they die on the traps and so on and this is meant to showcase the survival mechanics on the game so yep I think like this is pretty good except for the I think that would look better with a bit more of a barrier rather than just having just having some barbed wire did I have some barriers actually don't know if I picked that up you can take 50 hours sure what you mean by that all right uh yeah I had some barricades but apparently I didn't pick them up so yeah okay no barricades all right it's okay is there one planning to do more advanced topics about multiplayer uh I would like to do a full mini course really going into detail on multiplayer making a real nice game I very much would like to do that but I'm not sure I have enough time to do that so I'm still questioning whether that that plan is possible to do or not I hope so but yeah I'm not not internally sure but yeah I definitely would like to research it into quite a lot more detail packages PBR ready what does it mean to me there's anything to do with urpgrp PBR just means physically based rendering and both urp and egrp as well as the builtin rather pipeline that is also physically based rendering so just by itself it really all it means is that material was made in the last 10 years that's pretty much it so yeah you should probably yeah you should probably see whatever package you're looking at if it says what materials what rendering because it should say on the S4 page what rendering pipeline it supports so that's what you should focus on pretty much I think that in the future I only use dots for my game for example jobs isn't manipulate yep I'm definitely I'm probably going to be using the uh maybe not dots maybe not entities itself but definitely going to be using the drop system in the final version of this game I'm pretty sure that it's going to be very much a necessity in order to make it all work profitably uh in order to make it all work with good performance yeah right so I'm just thinking of what kind of floor I could get but yeah because these buildings are all separating like that all right not a monkey yep that's right uh okay so yeah what's a new project I'm working on what will eventually become my next team game so it's a very longterm project or I guess medium term depends on your context uh but yeah pretty much planning for release around July of next year and I just started working on it recently and right now on this live stream I'm pretty much trying to make a whole bunch of scenes trying to make my storyboard for the trailer so trying to make this a reality so that I can make a trailer so that I can publicly announce the game and so on that's kind of gone glad you are making a 3D game yep I'm also excited to be doing that all of my other games were in 2D so I'm definitely excited to be making something in 2D into the in 3D it's pretty interesting all right keep the Innovation the unity version the same or well you updated yeah this game uh the course was made using Unity 22 so yep I will definitely be using this just operate it to the LTS version which should be out by the time that I finish the game so yep around March of next year unlock create the project to 22.3 on TS and yep I won't be using that and releasing that they deal with that one with it yep that is definitely the plan since I'm going to be making this over seven months I definitely want to make regular devil walk showcasing the project and everything okay right so so for this scene I think I kind of have what I want let me just make some super basic uh just some scripting so let's call it trailer survival and let me make a script for that crap well that's not meant to be named can wear survival you find 2D easier than trading uh the main easy thing is that I I can draw I mean not really with quality but I can open up Photoshop and Draw Something uh whereas I really can't make a model although I have tried modeling and I've learned quite a bit so I could make some basic 3D models but yeah that's basically the main limitation is making 3D assets is much more difficult than making just 3D Sprites but nowadays since I already have so many assets that I picked up from the asset store because of that yeah I think I can now engage in a 3D project and I'll be using all kinds of 3D assets made by the store that's pretty much it so that's the big difference in the reason why right now I'm going to be using 3D okay so this one trailer survival and let me just get a serialized field uh what did I call it unit trailer so the unit trailer and uh uh what am I gonna count so this is the Survivor one unit trailer and Survivor two and then I'm going to have these zombies so the zombie one then all the others and let's just do a start and this is going to oh boy and let me just use my own new tones which is going to be super helpful all right uh so over here on this one I made a super basic movement code just so that I can tell it to move somewhere and it does something so yeah surprised that models don't have LEDs all these can help for performance that's actually going to be an interesting question I mean like I said this is going to be my first uh 3D game so I wonder if I'm going to come across those kinds of performances with the models but yeah like you said they are low poly so I would assume that is why they don't have LOD instance they already have pretty few polygons but yeah I guess we shall see if that is going to be a problem or not should be interesting or not from your event so thank you that's awesome I'm glad the videos have held you okay right so let me tell the units to go somewhere so let me just pick up my pointer so on the first one I want to tell them to move in there so let me copy oh no not that over there so on this one I'm going to tell this one to move to and you're going to move to 14.2 F and 0 and then 2.38 f and then for the Survivor two let's download to go into that position so that's 6.43 so 6.43 and then 2.75 of okay so these two go in that direction and then for example on this zombie oh what did I move I should move the parent so let's turn him a bit back there and for that one let's go over there and step on the Trap so go down move two what is that 12.6 12.6 f just zero out on the Y just make yeah make sure I'm on the right position 7.5 okay great so what you see it's gonna be a game yep I'm working on what will eventually become my next team game so yep it won't be a game all right so did I yeah I was actually not moving the pointer but it's okay it doesn't really matter so on this one let me attach a script then let me pick up so the character so that is the going to be the Survivor all right I forgot to add the scripts so this one has so on these ones let me add the trailer oh boy added yeah it's not on this one okay not that secret yeah it's a very shareable secret uh a righteous writing the animator and on this one drag that one then let's select so that one is going to be number one then down is going to be number two and then for the zombie threes going to be down so let's break down okay great how to get good at coding the answer is experience that really is the main thing all right weird I cannot see my custom character did you make a custom texture because that one has to be manually validated so let me Let me refresh the page see if there are any new custom characters is this game a commercial thing are you making it to share with the command Yep this is going to be a a standard steam game on Steam so yep a commercial thing yeah that's pretty much but I won't be making tons of devlogs explaining what I do so yeah it's a steam game but also with the community is there a way to buy get the UNT shirt no I don't think so this pretty much just merged from one of their uh unite conferences I don't think they have a a public uh store so sorry no you have a tutorial about timing of action so you want to use the hit animation when the animation reaches a certain point uh for that you can look at where's my thing you can look at animation events which I haven't made a video on that I don't think but yeah if you want to trigger things at certain points in the animation definitely look into animation events so that's one way and another way is to simply not use animation use what I'm going to be using here so for example for the survival one I want them to move in there but then after some time I want them to move somewhere else so for that I can use my own super awesome class the function timer and I can basically run some code after a certain amount of time so let's say after one second then I want to move let's see where let me pick up the pointer so this unit is going to go there then go perhaps back around here so 11.6 so 11.6 then 0 and then 1.96 so going to go there and then after some time more so after I'll input inside that one so he gets there and when he gets there then let's go to a different one what it holds the bottom with your head because it's faster than using the twisty things that's pretty much it all right and one F so basically if you want to make timing uh timing things then using a function like this which is part of my utilities but also covered in a video is delegates it's pretty nice extremely useful so if you want watch that video to learn how to create a function timer which lets you trigger an action after some time depending on the humble nature manufacturer assets yeah I I just briefly saw that bummel and it doesn't look really interesting if you want some uh some high poly realistic visuals it does seem pretty great actually I think I added it to the description on this live stream didn't I I think I did because I saw the other yeah I did Yeah so basically there's there's someone bundle so if you don't like realistic visuals instead of low poly then this bundle is actually a pretty great thing so if you want definitely look into that how do you make a custom avatar you follow this tutorial right here you draw on it then you tell me when you created something so it appears two people have created a custom avatar so let me just validate those two my website is super slow now let me update the characters and I have no idea if some people down here are the ones using these oh there you go there's a custom character right there so that's how you do it you draw it you'll link your YouTube account and yep it shows up in there what's your opinion Godot I've never used it but lots of people saying lots of positive things about it so I assume that it's pretty nice okay right so uh right so I just wanted to test out the timing so that's going to be something and there you go another custom character yeah just go ahead and delete the the borders that one is not necessary that one is just to help you yeah just delete those in the character looks real nice hey there you go custom characters uh right and I kind of missed the the timing I was talking about timing a while ago and yeah look at that one it goes there and after a second goes there and then goes there now let me actually just change the animations so on this one I changed it for now let's make down the default say just because I want to see them wonk I'm going to use vs light mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much the answer all right so with that it did work although it moved way too fast let me actually lower the speed on this one so for the movement speed maybe just three units it's a little fast yeah yeah definitely the timing and things it's only going to be there you go moves there that moves there and then moves there although it rotated in a strange way I think it's because I use slurp that it rotates yeah that is some strange rotation I think it's because I experiment with changing it for slurp dark mode burns my eyes I mean yeah a lot of people say that so for some reason my eyes are indeed strange but yep that is what happens I guess different people have different eyes but for me if if this whole thing is black and the and the uh Texas white my eyes get really messed up trying to focus on those tiny letters so yeah that really messes me up but then again I also like to work on a welllit room whereas a lot of people like to work on a really dark room okay I have no idea why the characters all messed up did I forward is not being strange I don't think that's odd all right anyways dark mode at night and day mode during the day yeah I mean if your eye is working like that then yeah definitely use whatever causes you the endless strain okay that is strange why is he that is very strange I guess maybe I gave it the strange this is the character no the character is on zero zero all right anyways yeah that is someone being very strange I'm not entirely sure why but it's okay tried making textures with AI text image nope but I very much would like to research that topic for someone like me who has no artistic skill then those AI generators do seem like they are potentially very useful so yep I definitely like can make progress with all of us pestering you uh yeah I would say I'm definitely quite a bit slower since I'm answering questions but it's a nice different change of pace pretty much yeah looks like the acid pivot is out oh you know what that's actually right or I think so right basically this should not have root motion I think that is the issue is it that might be yeah there you go that is indeed the issue it was the root motion so it's not the not necessarily the pivot but yeah since I drag the model instead of duplicating the other ones I forgot to disable root motion so yeah everything gets messed up all right some cool pen spinning combo one but yeah I really don't know any any cool combos I just know this one pretty basic and then the thumb around also prebasing so yeah I just know the absolute Basics just to keep my mind occupied while I'm thinking that's pretty much my hands occupied alone thing that's candy gone all right okay so so yeah so this one was working actually doing that kind of fixes the other issue that it was actually moving too fast it was moving too fast because the thing it's also yep root motion does mean the animation say control so basically these animations they've got movement baked into the animation oh that's not the project uh so yeah basically the animations were moving it forward as the transform was also moving forward so that's why it was moving a ton then rotating a ton yeah it really gets really confusing when you use root motion it's a it's an interesting tool but definitely very tricky all right so there you go some basic timing so that's how it's going to be now I obviously need some animation about looting that and actually let me look into the animations uh because I'm pretty sure there are some mood animations let me see what I've got here okay so I've got in loot at the bottom okay but no that's not the one that I want but there is a uh let me see uh where's my oh there you go the asset sword because I had yeah there you go I think it's this one the crafting mechanism animation I think this pack has a bunch of really interesting animations so let me try and see this one how much time do you allocate for work sleep pleasure if I may ask I must say one thing that I am not a good example of is when it comes to work life balance so I am not the right person to to to give tips on that for me I work way too much so yeah I'm not sure I can I can say that although I can't say that for me sleep is definitely very crucial if you cut back on sleep you're going to be all messed up so that does not seem like a worthwhile tradeoff for me so for me sleep oh apparently I already have this one um so yeah so for me sleep definitely don't cut back on that make sure you only sleep eight hours or however much your body requires that's pretty much it then yeah for me just work way too much that's kind of it take constant breaks I actually made an interesting video I think I mentioned it on the last live stream as well work from home yeah there you go a bunch of tips from how to work from home and one of the main tips is also take a break so I go out I want my dogs I get up I drink some water and do a bunch of things that's kind of thing so make constant breaks and don't give up on sleep those are my best tips um yeah so for this one apparently this one's already on this project let me just close it and it's on the and I already forgot the name there you go it's this one yeah the crafting mechanism animation pack because I'm pretty sure this one has some animations for chopping oh because they are all inside the thing that's why crawling digging item item carry it's on Spanish and Italian and Portuguese so you're kind of close I guess uh okay so there's one hammering on the wall play games I call it research yeah that is definitely that is very important playing games is important to make sure that you don't commit mistakes for no reason just watch how others have solved similar problems and yeah uh do you know Danny I actually met him briefly when I went to a unite conference in 2019 I think quite a long time ago yeah he was there it was pretty nice yeah that was fun um right so I don't think I have some I've got item back away I need some animations kind of like looting something gather kneeling okay so this one actually looks pretty good although the root motion yeah that is going to be are you still employed by unity I'm not sure what you mean by that because I don't work for Unity I use the ENT engine in my work but I don't work for ENT the company uh uh right so actually the fact that that one has some some yeah some root motion that is actually going to be tricky but yeah I'm not seeing any others I mean there's a item pickup animation so now I'm going to Zone I don't pull up oh that could also be interesting all right so yeah I think that one is the best one I thought they sponsored you yeah I've done some sponsored videos but I'm not a Unity employee but yeah I have I have done some sponsored videos with them I mean I use the engine so yeah whenever there's something that is great for both let's say you win win all right uh so let me just pick up this one which one that I want already forgot this one the gather okay let me just export this one and it's going to export the whole thing is it actually yeah actually why don't I yeah this one is an animation pack so I can just import this one thing and it won't really clutter up the project too much so let's just try open link not the basic motion Z crafting mechanism animation pack really nice pack so let's import it what's this game about it's going to be a turnbased strategy game with a large open world some automation elements some crafting elements some survival a whole bunch of things it will hopefully be very interesting That's My Hope all right so I'm going to need to run some animation so basically let's just just play around a little bit with this um yeah for this one is just some scripting how are you doing sounds I have no idea I'm probably going to pick up some things from the assets or because obviously me making sounds that doesn't really work uh right so let me just lay these by a little bit and beginning so the Survivor gets there and then Survivor let's kind of get component to get the animator and then I'm going to need to kind of set trigger set some trigger to play the Gathering animation something like that how much this project how far are you into so far I mean I started designing it about I don't know three four months ago but I only actually started working on it about two weeks ago so still very much very early days uh okay so let me go inside this one and let me find The Gather animation so together don't let me put it in there and I'm going to make a transition from any state into gather and transition is going to trigger uh let me make a trigger called Gathering and on the Gathering trigger okay so he does not goes in there oh crap I'm stuck okay well that's a strange bug I've let go of the mouse but it's still moving okay that's range okay that is very strange all right let me close the animator window okay that's a weird bug all right okay that's fixed all right uh oh boy yeah oh a bunch of weird I have that bug all the time really 477 is me very strange all right yeah I guess that is why I usually stick with the LTS version but for this project since I started from the course code base which was based on EMT 22 I'm using 22.1.0 so one of the least uh stave on things but that's okay uh right so go into that one the gather and that one is actually going to look quite a bit strange because it doesn't have hoping um on the animation and yeah let's set it to Loop actually do I want to I'm not sure anyways for now let me just just make the basics just the basics of the timing so the character should go there and actually that's not quite so yeah because I made this one but I actually do want them to um yeah because I want to make a transition back so that it stops Gathering so for the parameters for Gathering you know let's get rid of this one yeah just delete it and let's make it a bullying instead so is gathering and on this one let's transition when is gathering is true and then you say there and then you exit when is gathering becomes false okay so now for the scripting I can set both set the Gathering into true then play the animation then before I start moving set it to false so that it goes into the movement all right so let's see if this basic logic of that one is okay if you just joined then basically what I'm doing is kind of creating a bunch of scenes that I'm going to use in order to make not Gathering all right thanks for that I was going to have a weird bug all right thank you uh yeah so basically um I'm creating a bunch of scenes to kind of like making a concept trailer for the game that I'm working on that's kind of what I'm doing right now so that I can record the trailer and there you go got broken why did you get broken foot why does the foot okay this animation apparently has something strange deterministic physics that is a really complex topic so yeah for this game physics aren't really something that I'm worrying too much about so no there you go why does this one why does this animation have have some animation events okay I'm not sure but well let's use the usual trick so let me go into the animator together needs to be read only so I have no idea why this one comes with some animation events but that's okay that's an easy fix somewhat's going together and just get rid of these events so foot R and maybe it was some animation events for handling some foot placement I assume so let's see if it works so the character moves to the right and places did I put it on update I don't think I put it on update yeah but it is gathering true on start code generation yeah I also wish it generated the C sharp plus that I didn't have to use some strings that would be very good I definitely hate using strings uh okay so why is this one a bit strange uh do not maximize it it's normally let me select is this character I don't know uh nope it's the other one this one why is that one constantly jumping that's strange oh because I'm from any State uh yeah that's why because from any state it's always going to be jumping so obviously that does not work so let's go from down to down and yeah obviously that's the issue it's constantly going from the same one so it's Gathering to true and get rid of the one from the any state and now it should work it's not been too fast no it was just basically being constantly called whereas now there you go it only calls once and hey that actually looks pretty good all right I thought I was going to have to modify a whole bunch of things but actually no that works countries into the sound of phones oh is that an option I actually didn't know that that's interesting so there you go he goes there and he gathers then he goes then he should get him down all right so that's kind of the basic scripting that I'm going to be using in order to make the Drone so that should be interesting but before I really go deep on one specific scene I really would like to get as many scenes done as possible so then for example uh where's my where's my there you go so so that's this scene so I've got a bunch of zombies that are going to be walking down stepping on traps and dying and so on so that is going to Showcase basically the survival mechanics uh animate your custom avatar no not really that would be a fun uh a fun addition but no right now they're just one friendly uh anyways okay so this one is pretty much basically you know the core idea that I want to make so yeah that's pretty much this all right so that's good I'm happy with that so not only make this one I basically just want to make the crafting table that's one of the main things so let's just take out of this one watching since 2019 wow is that right that's awesome thanks for being here wow that's it's quite crazy how time flies It Feels Like Only Yesterday I started this Channel and yet it's already been four maybe five years almost five years damn it's crazy time really does fly yeah uh okay I'm going to the test for the other one if I may ask why zombies I mean of all things because I want basic dumb enemies but lots of them that's pretty much it so I want the the I want I like the idea of having kind of like an overrun effect so you got like four or five survivors and you're against 100 enemies and if it's a hundred human enemies with weapons that's a very a very lopsided encounter so yeah making zombies makes that makes sense I mean the zombies just use they're pretty dump they just use melee so with zombies it does make sense to have a matchup with just a handful of survivors and a whole bunch of them from my avatar okay let me refresh that uh okay right so the other one that I want to feels bad when you kill the zombie yeah that's kind of it no one feels bad uh okay so the other one that I want is the crafting scene so let's do that one so let's make a new folder trailer for The Crafting scene let's rename this one for the preferencing and the main thing that I want from the crafting scene is just making the workbench so let's pick up some props to make a workbench I picked up a whole bunch of tables so let's see which one do I use a bunch of things there okay uh a bunch of dressers bunch of trash there's a thing okay so for a workbench yeah I think that one is probably yep the update with the hex Ray just went live so yeah that's awesome I hope you enjoy it all right so we're here there's some electrical things nope not what I want yeah I think for tables I've got a more wooden table is that one better no I still think that one looks best uh so let's see because I think I had a table with oh no that there you go I knew I had this like a this really looks perfect for a workshop setting we're not the only Invaders because usually Alien Invaders they've got they've got weapons you know like in XCOM the enemies they all shoot you whereas I want kind of like a fighting against a giant Force so yeah that is why I'm going with zombies not that it's actually maybe this table looks a bit better all right so let's go like that how would you recommend learning blender I learned quite a lot with uh there's actually a uh well a game devtv course which is actually how I made them in conjunction with them the turnbased strategy course there's this nice bundle and oh boy this is yeah my internet gets really slow when I'm streaming so yeah uh yeah basically this complete blender course I went through it and it's really really awesome so if you want to learn blender I can definitely recommend that one and yeah it's actually surprisingly I didn't make a video on uh what I learned with blender and there you go I spent about 10 hours going through that course and so on and you actually learned how to make quite a lot of things say oh look at this this final game was all made using the the things that I learned so I made a whole bunch of cars a whole bunch of cities obviously it all looks pretty basic if you compare it to a professional modeler but seeing as how I made it and you know I learned how to make this in about 10 hours so with that I'm pretty happy with what I managed to build so yeah I wish I had more time to research monitors some more because yeah it's a fascinating thing okay right so where was I uh right so let me pick these up let me go out let me go into the let me actually pick that one up as well these right here there's not updating uh which one I just validated one more I don't think there are any more oh no there is so let me validate that one let me click on the update character and now in a few seconds it should there you go there's your character hey really nice really custom character nice job that's nice all right so there you go now into crafting and let's just dump these assets here where's my character right in there and there you go so basically I want to make a a crafting station so I think something like this visually should be interesting obviously I'm going to need to is that flat it is flat all right so let's put it kind of like that why is that in a weird angle so 180. and let's move it up a little bit uh do I scale it okay let's see in relation okay that actually looks pretty good except this one is not supposed to be a zombie but I'll leave that for now let's just put the unit there and for this one let me actually take away that and let me make a crafting so a new animated controller so for the crafting too far away from the tools yeah I guess he apparently could not reach there yeah about your turnbased strategy course and it is very good and love the amount of details you get into each topic well that's awesome I'm glad you're enjoying it yeah that course was a ton of work but I'm really happy with how it came out it really teaches you a ton of stuff so yeah so yeah it's awesome I'm glad you're enjoying it use hdrp for game or just use urp1 for the game that I'm making I'm going to be using urp so yep basically unless you're chasing the absolute top tier visuals which for me I'm not an artist so I'm using a low poly acid so for me nope but yeah only if you're going for the absolute high end you should use agrp for pretty much all other use cases you should be using urp that's pretty much the way that I look at it okay so uh because for crafting there were some interesting animations you know let me see which ones are in here animations hand off nope carry overhead what's a secret project it's basically my next steam game so I just started working on it a while ago and it won't hopefully be out let's say around July of next year so still very much early days the name of this asset which one this one the crafting mechanism that one is it's called crafting mechanism animation pack a whole ton of animations and if you mean the visuals I'm not sure I picked up a bunch of props from a whole bunch of Cynthia Studios assets so yeah not sure oh and look at that another custom character really nice what do you think about Unreal Engine I don't know I've never used it but I've heard great things about it so if you like it I would definitely not discourage you from using definitely go ahead pretty much nowadays all all engines are excellent so there's pretty much no wrong answer so just pick something and get to learn that's pretty much it okay so for working on something like that crawling it up that's a fun animation uh yeah The Gather that one is a fun animation like that annealing that is interesting item vent what is that oh picking up an item from the belt that's funny uh hammer on the table and hammer on the wall okay so I think I'll be going you this one or no the table because he goes down all right that's fun okay so let's go into that one the hammer ah I missed it there we go this one except for this one move to function oh that one is pretty basic over here doesn't even have any any pathfinding so basically just assigns a position list so just a list of active threes and keeps track of the index and then just grabs the current one on the current index calculates the movement direction to go there sets the forward in order to rotate the Transformer forward and pretty much just move towards that direction if it's above the stopping distance then it moves within that direction if it is closer than the stopping distance and just goes to the next position index and if it reaches the end pretty much just stops so some pretty basic movement here that's pretty much it awesome chat Paul again yeah if you want to know how I made it I actually covered a whole bunch of videos on it so the first one is how to make EMT transparent that one is pretty important that one is a a pretty excellent thing and uh then for the characters the characters are all based on Dynamic meshes so if you want to learn how to do that you can watch that video and finally for interacting with the YouTube API that's pretty much just an HTTP request uh no not this one this one how to download that in images from inside Unity so if you combine all three of those tutorials and you have pretty much what I have down here it's a pretty fun thing all right okay so I've got this one and let's just see how that looks did I put it on that one I did so for this one yeah it should be yeah pretty much like that and this animation actually has the same problem that is strange why do these animations have have animation events that is so strange I'm going to have to clear up all of them because then I cannot edit them so I need to duplicate to edit this one to then go select that one and over here let's get rid of the animation events that is really so strange anyways fine uh and since I'm here I can probably just make it loopable yep like that all right okay and there you go the character which yeah should be a character not a zombie but yeah pretty much these get scriptable object data at runtime not sure what you mean I mean if a scriptable object is referenced just like you reference any other asset any other thing so if you have a field then you reference a script along object you can access it that's pretty much it so yeah not sure what you mean by that if I join YouTube channel does I give you less money than patreon uh yeah I think so I'm trying to remember what is the patreon rate I think patreon charges 15 I think and YouTube charges 30. so technically yes but if you want to support hey whatever whatever works for you that's pretty much it I'm definitely not going to to force you to go to a specific place if you want if you film the videos are helpful and you want to get my course or support patreon Channel member whatever just yeah thank you uh right getting data from the code without needing a reference I mean a scriptable object is an object so you always need reference to that object maybe you're looking into something that you don't have to load so maybe you need to look into addressables which actually have a video on that coming out soon so that should be like that experience in terrain nope I've uh I've only used terrain very little so yeah not much experience with using terrain okay so for this one I want to put the camera kind of a bit more like this so for this one the idea is I've got the crafting station then a bunch of UI on the side that's kind of that awesome Yep go ahead and watch those tutorials and you will learn how to build all of this how is YouTube Avatar actually running there you go watch the D3 tutorials that I that I posted on chat and yeah if you combine all three of them you can make a chat overly just like this one uh okay so this is pretty much what I want actually let's just a bit shift to the right yeah kind of like this and then I'm going to have the canvas controller game character on your screen via YouTube live chat I mean it's possible you can do whatever you want but right now for this specific live chat characters no it just says the text and they randomly move around but yeah if you want you can create your own code to connect to the YouTube API to do whatever you want there's a bunch of interesting things you can do if you combine live chat with proper game you know uh what was I doing right so on the canvas I'm not actually going to make the canvas right now because that's quite tricky but let me just just make it pretty basic so I'm going to basically have back to that I basically want a bunch of windows so one of them is going to be the inventory the other one moved the inventory of the crafting station and then the atom equipment and so on so I'm going to have a bunch of windows yeah something like this so this is kind of going to be the second shot pretty much which is not an outline and also the shadow just for fun so five minus five just like that all right so that's kind of going to be the second shot on the trailer this one is showcasing the crafting mechanic okay so pretty much like this I'm going to need to edit the animation in order to get rid of the feet movement but yep I think this looks pretty good pretty interesting all right okay so that's the second shot that's what I wanted to be like just need to change the character of course uh why is that one sampling uh right so that's that one so the workshop actually pretty pleased with this how many units is this I actually didn't notice trying to think if this would fit on the final game and actually it would fit yeah this is exactly two units long which if I looked I'm not a channel member here's my equipment I actually don't know what emotes that I use I don't remember yeah it should be interesting it's an update to your strategy course kind of I'm basically taking my strategy course and I'm building it up into a full steam game that's kind of the goal uh yeah so for my workshop over here with proper assets it uses pretty much two units on the width so yeah it's going to perfectly match on the final game there okay so that's going to be fun all right foreign okay so this second scene on my storyboard that one is correct now let's say this one that I want to showcase pretty much the automation mechanics so for that I'm going to need a bunch of items so let me make this one tutorial for new UI toolkit yep I very much would like to do that I've already done a whole bunch of research and it is an interesting thing so yeah I very much want to do it just not sure when but yep definitely on my list so the trailer automation let me just duplicate that one for the trailer automation and okay right so on this one for the automation I know with PHP how to call an API is it similar to PHP or not yep I mean calling uh just watch that that video that I mentioned this one and yeah you just do an HTTP request so yeah as long as you've got an get API it's super easy to work with it pretty much um okay so for the automation I would like to have something like this so I need some power poles and then some item transfers then a bunch of items and a drone Gathering resources and a bunch of things what do you use only theme because Dark theme burns my eyes that's pretty much it uh okay so on the prompts I'm pretty sure I had a drone somewhere it's a bunch of trash there you go there's a nice drone although this one is probably way too small but okay so let me pick up the Drone go into the scene for the automation and yeah we get to learn this in the course already building this is your next team again uh this is going to be my next team game so obviously the whole thing will not be uh in the course that would be pretty much impossible but uh whatever I work on this I would like to make some some extensions to the course showcasing a bunch of things that I'm going to do here so so yes and no pretty much is the answer to that many times the screen do you answer questions about Dark theme yeah pretty much every stream I mean a lot of people seem to enjoy dark mode Dark theme so yeah they always ask me why and it's okay I mean different people have different preferences okay so I've got a nice drone so that's fun probably going to need to make some animation oh the propellers are actually separated so that's going to make it super simple all right so I've got a drone then I'm going to need the items and for the items I'm actually going I really like the the thing that I use for the Prototype where's my prototype let me just see uh where's my my game scene no not this one the demo scene there you go so on this one yeah I've got these items right here I actually like this one having a nice cube with the item icon on top I think that actually looks pretty interesting so these are some prefabs so let me Spawn these on the other one so that's on the trailer scene for the automation let me dump a bunch of these items right in there oh not that one not the atom transport world just these how do you decide what next game to work on find that as we become successful I can seem to find my own ideas both interesting and commercially viable uh I mean the answer is think about whatever you're interested in and then do some market research to find out if that is a potentially good idea there's a I made a really I mean nowadays marketing really is the most important thing so I made a video All About It uh yeah actually it's not called marketing I found it most important so if you haven't seen this video definitely go watch it and another thing that I mentioned in this video let me go into the description and because there's uh what is there we go just like this how to make video game hooks made by uh Ryan Clark from the color tank so definitely make sure you watch us because nowadays you really need to have a good hook if you want to be successful so yeah definitely make sure you watch this video study this video in order to study what are what is a good hook what is a successful hook what can be successful and so on that is super important nowadays so yeah definitely if you want to be successful as an indepth if you're doing this as hopefully more than a hobby if that is your goal definitely do not neglect uh coming up with a good hook because that alone is going to simplify our marketing so much more so yeah uh all right so I've got a bunch of items and they have rigid body so that's fun are they gonna all jump around yeah they are that's interesting uh yeah so let me put a whole bunch of items around here okay so I'm basically going to have a bunch of items then the Drone is going to have some kind of hmm trying to think for my over here so I basically need a drone station and I also need uh something okay you know bye thanks for the great views all right it's awesome bye see you next time enjoy the rest of your day if it's day I guess okay so I'm I need a drone base station and then a whole bunch of power poles so let me see how can I get that for PowerPoints I'm pretty sure I've got a whole bunch of them so I've got like this one or something much more basic I'm not sure actually which one should I go with huh I think this one I think it's visually more interesting rather than that one it's way too basic but I'm thinking on the final game this one might be too visible but anyways I can always change it later so let me pick up this one into the automation scene and let's place it and let me position the camera so for this scene I kind of I actually want yeah I actually want a big wide view so much bigger than this yeah maybe something like this and put the game view um so I take the power pole and I'm going to have kind of like this so powerful another one another one and maybe another one then for this one is maybe going to be down here I think it's worth getting into Pro I mean if you need it if you've made over a hundred grand with your game or rather 200 Grand if you've made over 200 Grand with your game then yeah definitely do get it but if not then yeah there's really no reason to so yeah it all depends I mean if you've already made 200 Grand then congratulations that is insanely successful so yeah okay right okay so then I'm going to dynamically create some some meshes to go around and transfer power then I'm also going to need okay let me just okay I'm going to need another one there so that I can push it like that okay so I'm going to need a whole bunch of power stations right and then the items also transfer trying to think going back into because I want a crafting station do I put it I guess which Cynthia this is I don't know I picked up uh I pretty much populated this um this prop scene with props from pretty much every asset that I could find so a bunch of them are from the apocalypse back that's probably most of it then there's a bunch from the uh military pack a bunch from the Battleground pack some from the shops bag so yeah pretty much just went through all the packs I went through all the props some of the items and just drag them all into the scene anything that looked vaguely interesting anything that could fit what I'm trying to build yeah that's pretty much what I did so let me go in here which in the csharp programming course suitable for a teenager program around 15. uh that depends on on what level of skill you're at if you're a complete beginner then I would suggest uh over here you got a bunch of csharp videos so if you want to learn a whole bunch of things about csharp just start off with this one where the C sharp Basics really quickly then I dive deeper into each one more about C sharp Loops then about interfaces generics delegates events the differences between value and reference types so a whole bunch of interesting info here so if you want if you watch these vids you won't become quite a bit more knowledgeable and if you want a more guide path then maybe look into my courses so if you're a bit more advanced maybe look into the turnbased strategy course if you're a bit more of a beginner and you want specifically on csharp maybe they build the defender core so depends on where you are in your Learning Journey okay so let me just pick up these three things so I'm going to want on the automation scene I'm going to want just try and think of where am I going to place this because I kind of want the items to be transferred along this area but I want to be able to showcase the drones doing things especially going to be tricky because if I put it over here it's not really going to be visible because the idea is for the trailer for it to be pretty much the window separated into just six boxes showcasing the six main Mechanics for the game so each box is going to be pretty small so if I have this scene and it's actually yeah it's actually going to be about this size so with this it's not really very visible hmm but yeah I guess the Drone comes here picks up drops some things there and that one picks it up maybe on this final one if I push it more over here on to um move two in real yeah I'd love to have some time to try it in real to see what they do better but yeah that's always my main problem it's always a lack of time so yeah if I had infinite time yep I would love to try out in real see what they do differently because I'm sure there are some things they probably do better so it's always fun to see how different engines do different things Okay so hmm it's actually going to be a tricky shot because how do I showcase both the scale I guess maybe I'm thinking too much maybe I put the crafting station down here and just showcase the items being transferred all over yeah I guess this one picks up items drops them over there then some other drone pick some items over here and puts them to the Trap crafting station and yeah oh crap I have to ah I'm going to need to make it into that okay uh right so yeah I think like this it could work let me just duplicate these these are probably going to be way too much skim pot what's the hook the hook is way too many systems and mechanics that's kind of the main hook so it's open world survival crafting automation defense management so that's main hope that it's got tons of genres and the whole thing works well that's a hope so yeah tons of systems very systems heavy game which will hopefully do well on Steam so yeah that's pretty much the hook and tone hopefully do well let's see okay so anyway so like this here I think it does so that's how this scene is going to be so basically the Drone comes over here picks up an item then goes to a base station drops it then I'm going to have the item transporters so that is one thing that is going to be okay so I need the visual for the Drone base and the Drone uh in the atom transporter so how do I make those two so for a drone base um they work on its Graphics too yep I won't be using I mean not myself I won't be using access to the accessor in order to make sure that the game looks good because I by myself I cannot really build much but with access to the asset store yep I can actually make something interesting uh right so for the for a drone base what can I use sure that looks a bit interesting if the Drone would spawn from there or maybe the battery table here that's tricky where I find out what I'm interested in making I mean you make whatever you like that's kind of it you know like programming systems I don't like procedure but that's not like I mean there are tons of programming games so if you want to start with something like that all of the electronics games or the uh store that's the power search for uh what's the name space Cam that was on quite a while ago so you feel like systems heavy game oh there you go got it got a little visitor uh yeah so if you like systems heavy games then there's no trailer for space cam that's range well all these Electronics games so you can like systems heavy games then pretty much all of these won't be what is the one about yeah there you go the shinsenio or actually the test so yeah basically anything can be a game really so yeah whatever games you'll like to play try making one of those because if you don't like playing them then you know what makes that game good so many lords yeah I've is that one out I thought that one was still uh waiting for it yeah metal words doesn't look really interesting and yeah so yeah basically find out whatever games oh they had demo last week oh so it's not out yet yeah it's not out yet it does look really interesting so yeah definitely the kind of game that I very much wouldn't like to play looks really systems heavy and also seems to be doing very well so if I go into steam DB particle by going to steam DB and I search for Manor wards uh if I go into the charts look at that oh God 150 000 followers so if you want to guess if you want to guess how many wish lists it's usually about 10 to 12 times this so this game has about 1.5 million wish lists so that is really insane so when this game comes out yeah pretty much guarantee this is going to be a massive success yeah so if you want to guess how well a game is doing before release you can check the public followers count multiply it by 10 you get the wish list and if it is above I don't know 20 000 then probably going to do quite well that's pretty much it all right okay all right challenge yeah uh right nice now his name is stikon Tico talking to but I mean they were a bit a bit spooked when they first saw me making videos but yeah nowadays I think they already see it as pretty normal see me just talking to nobody yeah I don't really use that okay so I think I'll use this one as the base for my drone I don't know I like the color I think that looks interesting so that is kind of going to be it's supposedly just a briefcase but I think it won't work well for a drone base can I make it more square like a little bit okay so I think this is going to work well for drone base and maybe add some more props and make it more interesting but yep like this why is that oh right yeah with the level of Zoom I'm going to need to play around with the ambient occlusion because that one looks like it has no shadows and then looks quite a bit strange say I'm going to need to play around that anyways you make trailers before you've made the game is that to get the same age up as quickly as possible and yep that isn't the answer basically you want to announce the game as quickly as possible so you can start Gathering wish lists so yeah right now the game is still I've already done quite a lot of things so over here the the game already has quite a lot of systems but obviously as you can see on the visuals they're just cubes so over here this is a this is supposed to be building a turret so I can pick up some things I can go there I can interact with it so all the systems work so there you go creates a turret which again is nothing but black boxes then I can also it's a little really nice let's pick up some items and let's transfer some items over there oh we don't really have some I don't know okay so let's create an item transport route transport items in there and then in there and let's create that route and now if I end the turn there you go a bunch of items get spawned and they start being transported from this position to that position and then they go into that one and actually they can't get there because that one does not have power so I need to construct a power pole in order to expand over here the power grid so I need to go with this unit I need to pick up something to build it and I need to move over there so as you can see all of the a lot of the systems are already working and there you go now that one is need transferring atoms so I already got quite a lot of systems but as you can see the visuals are not done it would not look good if I if I made the trailer looking like this so that is why I'm pretty much just making some some concept scenes in order to be able to record the trailer which is kind of like going to be kind of like a concept trailer so I make the trailer so that I can so that I can eventually make the make the same page public so that I can publicly announce the game so yep that's kind of cool don't look very different from what I imagined that's great uh tutorials are great really appreciate all the work you've done all right that's awesome hey I'm glad the videos have helped you it's really nice thank you advice for developer to start a YouTube channel for UNT stuff uh I'm not sure just know that it's extremely difficult that is that is all that I can say uh yeah really advice I don't know focus on searchable results that's kind of thing I mean if you're making tutorial content like me that is not the kind of thing that goes viral so definitely do not expect to be making videos there are tutorials that get millions of views that is not going to happen so focus on to focus on topics that can be searchable and yeah that's pretty much my advice it's extremely difficult so if you do it definitely do it on the side don't make it as a job I mean for me it took me uh 20 months before this channel made any money whatsoever before I got the first paycheck from YouTube ads took 20 months and before it started taking a profit was maybe about 40 months so yeah definitely don't go into uh Unity YouTube If that's if monies are gone yeah definitely just do it as a side thing if you enjoy it so sorry for being so down but yeah that's a reality it's a really tricky business that's pretty much it yeah 40 months yeah it was a huge amount of time yeah I've been doing this since 2018 so yeah it's it's been four and a half years quite a lot yeah hey thanks for all of you being here I mean the the channel only works because all of you are here watching and hopefully getting value from the video so thank you all for being here watching yeah all right so what was I doing let me just make a bet uh it's almost time for them to have dinner so that is why he's jumping up to me so just a bit more um right from your accent sounds Portuguese yep I am Portuguese uh okay so so recently I want the drones and then let me have another drone all right so let me then I'm going to have another one sort of around here then going to have another drone and I'm basically going to move the Drone and the Drone is going to handle some crafting pick up some items and things so I just need the item transport okay where did you get the code monkey name I quite like the term Code Monkey even though technically it's supposed to be sort of an insult or not an insult but it's not supposed to be a positive thing it's supposed to be someone who just dumbly writes code but for me I always found that term to be pretty funny pretty interesting so when I was coming up with the name for this channel yeah Code Monkey seemed like a a fun a fun name that's pretty much it but yeah it actually the term actually exists as sort of a negative thing but I I enjoy it so yeah for me it's a positive um right let me just make the item transport Hub and then I think that's gonna be it I'm back how's this trailer going yeah going pretty well I'm working on the 13 so that should be pretty fun you're not worried you don't get an idea not like it items to me quite often sure but at some point you have to have confidence in yourself confidence that you picked the right idea and then just push through it I mean making games is extremely difficult so definitely don't don't expect to always love working on the game 24 7 you're definitely going to have some difficult moments so yeah you definitely have to push through those that's kind of it as long as you pick something good something interesting and you thought enough about it then I would say yeah push through the difficult moments but do make sure that you picked an idea that makes sense in the beginning yeah uh right so I want an item transport Hub but I have no idea what that is supposed to look like do I make like some crate because for the transport Hub it's kind of meant to be something that receives the item the item then goes underground and gets transport that's kind of the rough idea is there a way to get a range any of these assets I mean these are mainly Cindy serious assets so if you look in the in the asset store search for Senti Studios and you won't find pretty much everything that I have here uh oh boy I'm really not seeing anything that I maybe this one I think it's meant to be kind of like a kind of like a liquid container but maybe that could work maybe that couldn't look hey super shot thank you for watching on streaming right now well actually I'm not watching anything but now that um I think rings of power has just ended I don't like watching things as they're coming out so now that it just ended I'm going to binge watch that hopefully it's good should be interesting so yeah I'm planning to watch that beyond that I still have to watch The Witcher season two still haven't seen that really enjoyed season one so yeah definitely would like to find some time and I've also still haven't finished watching Naruto I finished uh what she put in for about 80 episodes so I still only got to watch about 400 of those so I really would like to finish watching that so need a whole bunch need about 100 hours to be able to finish watching that so that yeah it's always tricky to find the time that is always the main issue uh okay so I think I'm going to sort of use that one maybe put some things on top yeah I think of the s's that I have here that is one that makes most sense so let's see I am from Brazil Portuguese is a shame yeah this word Eternal self give you what's your turn back course uh I helped you get a job oh that's awesome hey I'm glad hey best of luck with John that is really nice yeah content in Portuguese I would definitely encourage anyone interested in game development or in kind of technical topic to really learn English because finding things in different languages Portuguese or Spanish German whatever it's going to be really tricky so yeah I would definitely advise everyone to really learn English It's Tricky I mean it definitely sucks that it's not you don't have as much content in your native language but yeah if you really want to learn then yeah that's really the best way but hey I mean you're here so you already know English that's awesome so best of luck with the job uh okay so let me just see where this is um yeah kind of like this so I guess I'm going to use this one if an Arabic I agree yeah I'm sure finding content in Arabic is going to be tricky so yeah definitely learning English is probably the best way to get access to the most amount of knowledge possible thankfully for me I've always been interested in English so it's never something that I had to force myself to learn I pretty much learned while watching Cartoon Network as a kid watching Dexter's Lab and Powerpuff Girls that was always really awesome stuff so yeah learning all of that I managed to learn English pretty easily because I enjoyed the cartoon so yeah just kept watching them kept learning one letter at a time and yeah by the time I actually learned English officially in school I was already I was already pretty comfortable with it so yeah that was a fun Journey are you ingame Dev full time aren't you scared that your ID is bad you could end up in debt homeless I mean that comes to you managing how you spend your money I mean for me I'm keep in mind that I'm in Portugal so one very big thing is how much money do you spend for me I've been making games since 2013 so this isn't really a new thing and at that time I've definitely managed learned to manage my finances keep my expenses very low basically if I was if I was living somewhere really expensive like San Francisco and I needed a 10K just to just to survive then yeah in that in that case making Indie Games is insanely uh risky but over here in Portugal If you make something like 700 bucks you can make a living so yeah at that point it becomes much easier for the map to make sense so if I'm working on a game for one year I just need to make about seven Grand and I can live so yeah having low cost is really the best way to lower the the risk the stress with going into indie game that's that's kind of it so yeah keep my expenses low and thankfully it has worked over the years yeah uh all right so I think that's gonna do it for today my voice already messed up my dogs want to go have dinner so yeah thoughts on new nature humble it looks really nice so if you want if you like realistic Visions realistic heart Zone then yeah I was looking at it a while ago so you feeling like realistic visuals this bundle is actually pretty nice all realistic visuals for me I prefer low poly but if you prefer something realistic with that really high quality really gorgeous really nice all right okay thank you and Google look nice how often do you go to the gym I work out six times a week it's really nice it's my it's my happy place it's where I go to destress so going to the gym or walking my dogs that's how I handle my brakes so that I can do all this work without going crazy foreign okay so I think that's gonna be it um uh right so yeah so managed to make three of them so thanks again for the Super Chat so I've got the the crafting scene so that should be pretty nice there you go goes there gather some things and some zombies come in okay so I gotta handle all that scripting but yeah so that's the scene showcasing the survival elements then a scene showcasing the crafting elements with a really nice crafting animation just need to play around with the feet just make it not have that but yep that also looks nice and then a scene showcasing the automation so a bunch of drones picking up things and a bunch of items in traffic and so on all right so pretty happy with the progress on this next stream I'm not sure I'd like to do them at least once a week so maybe next week maybe we shall see did you make the inter change background point you can go into edit and then go into preferences and over here you have the colors and one of these yep the play mode tent so you can set this to any color you want and it's going to be the color to make it really visible that you are in play mode so that is super useful best way to make 3D animations uh that really depends on how you are using animations it could be Sprite shape and Sprite based animations if so then it depends on where you draw them and if you're using Unity ik then you draw them into Unity so if you're using that then I would recommend you unlock into the I actually made a video on that into the dragon pressures yeah there you go see I'm looking to their official sample which showcases a bunch of uh ik based animation so if that's what you're using definitely go ahead and do that all right okay any assets all the assets that I'm using they're on the accessor so if you go into the SSR and you search for centipacks search for Cynthia Studios you'll find lots of gorgeous low poly assets so that's pretty much what I'm using okay right so I think that's gonna be it I think I gotta go just like that all right okay so this was fun this was productive I hope you enjoyed I hope you I answered a bunch of your questions so hopefully it was interesting for you thank you all so much for being here this was really awesome so hopefully a bunch more live streams in the future so that should be nice all right let me turn on the thing just like this and okay all right okay so thanks again thank you all for being here I hope you found this interesting and useful so thank you all so much and I'll see you next time bye bye everyone foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign thank you foreign foreign
