hey everyone here's a quick update video with everything that's happened what's coming up in the future so first of all just recently the channel surpassed 200 000 subscribers that's an insane amount that's really awesome so i'd like to begin by thank you all for your support these videos really only exist because you watch them so thank you for that and i hope i can continue producing videos that you enjoy watching and learning from as you know i've just launched the complete visual scripting course this was a ton of work and kept me super busy for several weeks so because of that i really didn't manage to have the time to do anything special to commemorate the two hundred thousand then before that i was super busy working on the building defender course and before that i was working for months on the code monkey steam app so i spent the greater portion of this year focused on making some massive projects and i'm really happy with how they came out but in doing so it kind of limited what i could do with the normal videos over here on the channel so my goal now at least until january is to focus only on making interesting and awesome videos my main thing with this particular video is to ask you what type of content would you like to see this channel really only works if i make the kind of videos that you want to see so i need your feedback there's tons and tons of interesting topics i'd love to explore for example i would like to experiment with some live streams i think that could be interesting for some more realtime interaction and realtime learning then i haven't touched dots in ages so that's something i'd really like to revisit i'm guessing the dots multiplayer package has also evolved quite a bit so i'd like to look into that one i'd also like to make some more gamedev reacts videos those are always interesting to make and provide a different look into popular games another topic i'd love to explore is machine learning unity has some great tools for it and it has enormous potential to help small devs make some very interesting games there was also the idea of making some asset review videos so this could be a great home since there's tons of extremely useful packages then there's also vr which unity has excellent tools for it so i'd like to look into that one and the same thing for ar which again unity also has some awesome tools so that could be something interesting so from all that what is the type of content that you'd like to see are you interested in any of these topics or maybe you'd like to see some more complete games like i did for the top down shooter and wash your hands game or maybe just some normal tutorials if so let me know on what topic i've already done tons of tutorials but there's still some genres i haven't covered yet for example i was watching initial d a couple of weeks ago and it reminded me that i've never done any racing videos so like i said there's tons of topics i'm interested in that would make for some great content for you to watch and learn from but i need your help to decide what to prioritize so let me know in the comments by the way next week there's the mixing game jam happening i haven't done a game jam in ages so i'm thinking of participating this one is managed by andre from mixing jam so it's bound to be very interesting also if you did pick up the courses please make sure to write a review the more reviews the courses get the more visibility they get and the better i can make the next ones and as always if you have any issues post them in the q a section i'm always there answering every question and also the unity mega bumble is still active for a few more days i covered some highlights in another video so check it out before it ends and lastly a big thank you to all the supporters on patreon it's been almost a year since i first started the patreon and having that support has been tremendously helpful like i said this channel really only exists because you watch a video so i hope to continue producing awesome videos for you to enjoy and learn from alright so once again thanks a lot for listening and i'll see you next time you
