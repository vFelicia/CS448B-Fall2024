hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tones and asks to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for January 23. in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next ones I'll be covering paid ads and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them by the way quick update I'm still hard to work on my upcoming free course this will end up a lot more detail than I anticipated the core script is a massive 7000 lines long and I still have a few lectures left to right the recording and editing should hopefully go quickly so I'm hoping to have it out by mid to late January alright so on to the top 10 list starting off with a nice pack with a whole bunch of status effects these are always useful for just about any game this pack features three Buffs one debuff and one status element it's up to you to Define what they all mean and you could also recolor them to get some more variation then if you're making a 2d game and you want some Undead Survivor assets look at this one it's got some really nice pixel art great if you'd like to make a quick Survival on Prototype I either top down or side scroller it's actually a precomplete pack you have some four tiles some items three tools three weapons some humans and some Undead really nice if instead you want something much more highend then look at this part this nav has tons of assets all of them insanely high quality they are super detailed models with 8K textures this character has a humanoid rig it has a bunch of modular pieces and even has some cloth physics this one is a really nice sample so if you don't like this sound definitely check out this entire Publishers page next for an interesting tool here is smart console one asset that I've recommended so many times is quantum console this one seems to be trying to do the same thing but as a free package it looks very capable you just add the command attribute and you can easily trigger a function from an ingame console very useful then if you'd like to build an entire medieval town here is a nice modular pack it's in low poly cartoon fantasy it's a pretty nice pack with quite a lot of variety you could definitely build a huge sprawling City by mixing and matching all these pieces if you like this then this step also has tons more great low poly acids next if you need to take lots of screenshots with all kinds of sizes then this one looks very useful it features an easy to use menu where you can fill in all of the resolutions you need along with the name and with a button press you can automatically take on screenshots and save them so if you're publishing a game on lots of devices or platforms then this can definitely help then for another tool here we have lazy Builder this one is extremely interesting basically it's a library funnel of cc0 assets meaning assets that you are free to use in free or commercial games although even though it has that many assets it's also very lightweight the assets aren't actually included in the package they're only downloaded when you actually need them so the tone itself is only 5 megabytes it comes with 500 sh but you can easily add more by creating your own Library all in all a very interesting tool if you want to make VR games then look at this one to help you handle interactions it features lots of interesting interactions you can obviously pick up and drop objects you can phone levers and so on but also some interesting ones like handling a screw it's made by a very well established studio with years of experience this one is a free version but in terms of features it seems pretty complete the main limitation is no commercial use so you can try this out for free and if it helps you make your own game then you can pick up the phone version then for another very simple tool here is a csharp generator basically you can just Define some settings for creating a new csharp file like preadding some musings or defining a namespace then with one click you can easily create all of those templates for me I'm a pretty fast typer and my brain subconsciously edits the default template immediately but if you'd like to save a few seconds then this could be useful next up for an interesting side scroller 2D pack here is neighborhood it has quite a lot of pieces you have a background and a whole ton of foreground elements everything for a house with a whole bunch of Interiors so I'm looking at all of this really makes me want to build a quick prototype of something like the Sims from a sidesrolling perspective I think that would look really nice alright so those are my top 10 free new assets on the NTS store for January 23 there's links on the description also check out my own free and paint S1 store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more
