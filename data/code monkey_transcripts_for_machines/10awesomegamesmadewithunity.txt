that is cuphead this is one of the biggest hits of the last few years it was prominently displayed at e3 and it immediately caught everyone's attention visually the game is absolutely striking it has this awesome hand animated look like the cartoons from the 30s so visually it is extremely unique the game itself is a really nice platformer with some very interesting boss fights it was very hotly anticipated right up until the final release and it received great reviews this one combined with some other games on this list perfectly showcase the power of dnt engine with regards to making your game visually striking it's always a sign of a good engine when it can produce both cartoony 2d games and hyper realistic 3d games so cuphead is an awesome game made by a tiny studio and now let's look at a unity game made by one of the largest studios in the world which is called duty mobile it is an impressive display of what you can build in a phone nowadays personally i still come from the days when all i played on my phone was just snake and some basic matching games so now seeing just how far you can push it it is indeed quite amazing and the fact that you can use the same game engine to make awesome aaa console titles as well as simple mobile games is a huge plus the game itself is the standard call of duty experience it has not been dumbed down for phones so you've got a fast paced multiplayer first person shooter with tons of maps guns upgrades and so on and visually it looks great especially considering how this is something that runs in a tiny computer that you hold in your pocket it has already had over 250 million downloads which definitely proves that unity is more than capable enough of building massive mega hits next up one of the best vr games beat saber i've tried a bunch of vr games and beatsaber is without a doubt the one that i've played for the most hours it's just so simple and so satisfying all you do is look at the arrows and move your arms so it's very easy to explain but in order to understand just how good it actually is you really need to try it for yourself the natural progression of the game is something that i find extremely compelling essentially in the beginning it feels like the higher difficulties are completely and utterly impossible everything just moves way too fast but then as you improve your skills by using your body it suddenly becomes possible and you start to feel pretty much like neo from the matrix so this one also works as a really good workout when the whole quarantine started and my gym was closed this was one of my workouts if you put it on expert pause and do a couple of songs you will definitely be sweating all over and have your shoulders completely burning if you have a vr headset and you haven't tried it yet then i strongly encourage you to give it a shot even if you're not usually interested in rhythm games this is a perfect example of a game that simply would not exist without vr vr is actually something i haven't tried developing myself but i definitely want to give it a shot it's very well supported by unity so getting something up and running is quite easy i definitely want to explore that sometime in the future next up we have another recent huge hit and that is fall guys this one came seemingly out of nowhere and really took the whole worm by storm it's a very fun party game the perfect way to have a simple good time also it's very simple there's a dozen different maps but all of them with very intuitive rules so it's very easy to learn it encourages lots of fun mayhem by having tons of players on fighting for the same goal and the punishment for failing is very light the visuals perfectly match the part nature of the game with some very nice friendly colors and it also uses unity multiplayer which is a service for managing live multiplayer games and despite the massive success from what i've heard that haven't been any server issues now from a party game onto a hardcore survival game rust this one came out back when daisy was on top of the world and every other game had survival elements russ stood out by giving the player the freedom to build their own world it's a massive game and when it came out people were very surprised that it was running on unity it has received tons of updates over the many years that it's spent in early access and the result is a very fun sandbox this is a great example of the scale that you can achieve with unity a massive open world with lots of players and tons of player created structures and items and now for something a bit more casual pokemon go this is what really made people realize the potential of vr games and just like with vr unity is always at the forefront supporting new technologies there's tons of tools to help you make your ar vr or mixed reality apps this game appeals to almost everyone thanks to the pokemon brand as well as the simplicity of the design it tracks where you are and how far you walk so you battle and catch pokemon just by walking around there's also gyms and shops in physical locations in the real world and also the egg mechanic which requires you to take a ton of steps in order to hatch the egg so it's a really interesting game that has tons of mechanics to encourage you to explore the real world around you it's a great example of the potential of ar and i look forward to seeing more experience like this happening in the years to come one really complex game made in unity is rimworld it's an excellent colony simulator you have a massive randomly generated world where you pick the starting point for your colony then you get a bunch of random colonists all with different skills names and personalities so it really is that kind of game where it will never ever be the same it features base building combat exploration research and tons of things it's the kind of game that people can play for thousands upon thousands of hours also features a very robust modding support with a massive community that makes mods to completely reward the original game and make it into something completely different so this game is a great example and greatly showcases how you can make really complex games in unity that are really engaging and fun to play now for another relatively recent mega hit untitled goose game it has the perfect concept and art style essentially you play as a goose and annoy humans by doing a whole bunch of tasks it's very easy to understand and it has a strange but very effective appeal the name itself is a great example of how indie hits can happen nowadays the game was first shown in random gifs while in very early development and since those gifts spread like wildfire and gathered millions of views eventually the name untitled goose game stuck so it's a really interesting example of finding massive success with low budget in the marketing all you have to do is make a game with an interesting concept and make it visually striking and then see how people react to animated gifs if people respond well then you already have a very good indication that your game is on the path to success for another excellent game made in unity there's subnautica it's a very unique game in that it is entirely based on being underwater it features survival elements crafting exploration and more of it in a massive open world that is completely different from everything else it's another example of a game that had an excellent early access journey over several years and was greatly improved thanks to feedback from the community also features vr support if you really want to immerse yourself in this underwater experience so if you're looking for a very very unique survival crafting game with a large open world then this one is for you and lastly for the game that actually gave me the idea for this video which is orion the blind forest as well as its sequel a while ago as i was playing both origames and pretty much all the time that i was playing i was constantly in awe at just how gorgeous these games are you could essentially take any still from this game and turn it into a wallpaper this is really one of the best looking games ever made it has excellent use of both 2d and 3d along with tons of postprocessing and lighting effects in order to make a really really gorgeous game and the gameplay itself is also great it's a metroidvania platformer with very tight controls a large world and tons of upgrades if you're looking to get better on how to make gorgeous 2d games i would definitely recommend you study this game extensively the way they group together sprites with splines and shader animations mixed with some 3d elements really makes for a great looking game alright so as you can see from all of these awesome games the unity engine is really practically limitless you can build anything that you can think of you can build small focused games like the untitled goose game or massive aaa games like computer mobile you can make games with simple visuals like fall guys or you can go really complex like the gorgeous ori games so i hope these games inspire you and convince you that anything is possible with the engine the only limitation is really just your own skills in your imagination this was really interesting to look at and see all the popular games that were made in unity so let me
