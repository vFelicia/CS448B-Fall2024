hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for December 23 in this first video I'll be covering a list of free assets and next one is I'll be covering paid asset and tools let me know in the comments if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them by the way the unity Mega bundle is ending really soon this is an excellent deal with tons of visuals tons of really interesting tools it has this complete third person shooter game kit which looks really awesome and beyond that the Humble Bundle is also excellent also has tons of stuff tons of visuals tons of really awesome tools all for a really cheap price so if you need anything definitely get it quickly all right so on to the top 10 list starting off with some great looking fire VFX this is very high quality all of them look great it features lots of fire both big small there are some that are on the floor some with some smoke and some that are pretty simple this includes both the VFX as well as some sound effects then if you'd like to make your own sea of Thieves or maybe Ship of Fools look at this one it's a really nice low poly ship you can imagine lots of players roaming around doing all kinds of things interacting with the Cannons finding off some kind of C monster all kinds of things looking at this one really makes me want to make a quick prototype just like that just imagine a player up there scouting out for an nearby Island and thanks to the awesome multiplayer tools that exist nowadays building something like that is actually surprisingly easy or if you need a tool to help you populate your world with some prefabs check out this one there's a bunch of these prefab placement tools this one seems very capable and again this is free this this one is the free version of a pay tool it appears that the only difference is that it has the unlimited number of brushes so it should still be great to try it out and easily populate an entire world then if you need a fun cartoony ghost character check out this one it's a really nice really cute character this could be your player or could be some kind of enemy if you like this cute cartoony style then this dev has tons more stuff or maybe if you need some foliage to make your worlds feel much more alive check out this one it's some nice foliage shaders it includes various examples alongside tons of parameters and Shader nodes that you can play with you can modify almost anything to get it looking exactly the way you want it this one also has a win system and featur some translucency this is some great looking foliage definitely go ahead and try adding something like this to your projects to see the massive difference that it makes then if you have curve paths in your world check out this tool you can generate meshes with curves and very easily animate the visual it features lots of gizmos that you can easily drag to get the exact shape that you want you can easily add or remove points you can move objects at a consistent speed alongside the spine there are plenty of these tools and this one seems pretty great if you want to learn how a tool like this actually works then you can go watch my spline tutorial then here's a bit of a strange tool it's for spawning objects that automatically move alongside the colliders in the world the example shown in the video is some kind of ants that are just moving all over the world they can climb any object even if that object is dynamic definitely a strange use case or perhaps a more standard use case simply positioning objects in in the world it automatically finds Solid Surfaces and places the objects then of course those objects can be somewhat randomized making them look more natural so this can also be a nice World building tool then if all you need is just a single anime character check out this one it's got a nice stylized Shader and the character proportions make it look quite anime likee this one is fully rigged so you can also easily animate it if you like this particular style then this dev has tons more and if you want a super quick and easy way to massively improve how your game looks one of the easiest things you can do is just using a custom Sky Box like on this pack this one features a dozen Sky Box so there are some really nice blue clean Skies there are some dark night skies some very cloudy some very clear and even some that look quite strange again change the Sky Box is really something super simple that will massively make your game feel much much better all right so those are my top 10 free new assets on the UN assur for December 23 there's links the description also remember to check out the bundle on the accur it's ending in just 3 days so if there's anything you want definitely get it quickly all right all right
