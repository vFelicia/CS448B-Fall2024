hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey it's time for a pretty big Unity release Unity 22.2 is out right now this is important for mainly two reasons first of all it contains tons of awesome additions and improvements which I'm going to cover in a bit and being version 0.2 means that this is the last big release until the LTS version so this is the version and feature set that you will probably spend most of your time over the next year for me this is especially important because I'm currently working on my SIM game turnover Liberation go ahead and add it to your wishlist if you haven't already since the game is only launching next year I'm building it in unity 2022 so this new version is one step closer to the LTS version that I will be using at launch UNT sponsored this video to do an overview of all of the new features and changes coming out in this version so let's first look at the new features and changes that they highlighted in their main page and then I also went through the entire huge change log so I'll talk about my own highlights from that list there's a bunch of new interesting things that do not appear on that main page there's quite a lot of stuff everything from Graphics multiplayer UI iteration speed to the physics lighting platforms and tons more so starting from the official highlights the very first very exciting very important thing is that dots is now finally efficiently supported it has graduated from experimental into preview which means it has now an officially supported DNT feature this gets it one step closer to the final production rated release which will happen in the 22 MTS version with that the most important thing is that dots now in version 1.0 the syntax is mostly fixed meaning that while it's not necessarily yet time for you to use it in projects that are out right now it is already stable enough for you to start learning the syntax so you can edit your own games when they come out next year for example that's exactly what I'm doing with my own game I'm learning the syntax right now so whenever I come across any performance issues as I develop the game I will remember that I have this awesome.co in my toolbox to help me solve any performance issues so that's the big news if you want to learn the syntax I made a super detailed video on it alongside NTS 1.0 comes a new graphics package also the dots physics and even a new DOT net code I haven't looked into this one myself but it's intended to be super ferment highly scalable so where netcode for game objects is meant for smart signal games that's netcode is meant to handle anything you can think of I definitely would like to link into it at least briefly before the final protection valid release and Beyond those new releases the other two parts of dots the burst compiler and the job system have also continued getting updates so this is definitely the most exciting new addition to UNT personally I'm big believer in dots and I can't wait until it's finally production ready to see all of the awesome games that will be built that could not have been built without dots the next highlighted section is on multiplayer a while ago they launched netcode for game objects so after years of unity not having any official multiplayer solution since they deprecated unit they finally have an official networking sack I made a really detailed tutorial on it it's a really awesome tool set it's very capable and very easy to use one of the best things about it is how ENT also has a whole ton of tools under their Unity gaming Services brand and all of those tools they work together to make multiplayer games really easy to build you have net code for game objects for handling your multiplayer Logic for joining players together you have Lobby for connecting them easily through firewalls you have reeling which by the way I've been working on two really detailed tutorials on these two tools so stay tuned for that those videos should be out soon and then the new updates is now game server hosting which by the way is what used to be called multiply this one is their dedicated server tool this one alongside Matchmaker which is a tune for defining rules to match your players with another both those tools are now in some serve meaning you don't need to manually contact Unity to start using them just go through the dashboard click a button and start using it right away all of these Stones can be used independently but they obviously have sdks that make them super easy to work with one another so for example like I mentioned a while ago netcode for entities you could use that in conjunction with Lobby and relay or another example you could use netcode for game objects with Lobby and Game Server hosting so if you want to make multiplayer games then UNT has a really awesome very complete tool set then the section on graphics for me I mostly use basic graphics with urp but even so there's some awesome stuff here then you should grab phone screen masternode is really nice previously if you wanted to use Shader graph to make phone screen effects it required some very nasty hacks so it's really nice to have a proper way now and thanks to that new node you also have custom post processing so you can create your own effects and add them to any volume component there is also LED Crossfade so instead of your lods just snapping in a very drastic manner now it's a nice invisible fade and with Ford plus rendering you now have the ability to support many more lights for hdrp you have tons of awesome new features there's a new water system you have Cloud layers and volumetric clouds and you even have the extremely high definition eye Shader from the enemies demo so building a super high fidelity game with egrp just gets easier and easier next up in terms of productivity improvements there's updates to the terrain tools there is a new AI navigation package although this is actually a package that has exists for quite a while but it was only available on their GitHub and not officially supported whereas now it is officially supported and won't show up on the package manager it has some more useful components for handling navigation and basically upgrades how navmesh used to work so now there's no more baking process you just assign navmesh service component and it automatically generates an app mesh the new spline package is also now part of the engine there are some improvements to 2D in lights and debugging editor support for sprite Atlas generation which I believe means you can now manually generate a Sprite Atlas without having to make a build then some more miscellaneous script compilation time improvements and also a bunch of upgrades to prefabs specifically they added the ability to replace prefabs as well as a bunch more things to do with overrides so all in all a nice bunch of additions then another pretty important update to the engine is with regards to UI token which is now the official recommended tool for making editor windows and tools all of the regular ENT property drawers are now being drawn using UI tonkit which makes them easier to integrate within your own editors in terms of runtime UI it is possible to use UI toolkit but for that so far the recommendation is still using Unity I believe the plan is for next year UI tonkit to reach parity with dnty so that you finally have just one tool that does every type of UI personally I've already done a bunch of research on UI tonkit although I really haven't made a decade video just yet it's an interesting tool it's definitely great if you're working in teams since it forced you to split things between the logic structure and visuals and being forced to do that leads to some better more organized code I also know that I hated working with I am GUI every time I used it so I'm very happy to replace it with the UI toolkit for editor tools there's also a vector drawing API looks very good if you want to draw some weird shapes in your UI and also some more options for Tree View controls including performance improvements then the section on platform integration Android is having a fast deploy setting making builds faster and easier iteration the X12 is now the recommended API for Windows and Xbox I remember in the unite keynote I mentioned how it was faster in pretty much every scenario it's always great to get some bonus free performance just for taking a checkbox then Ray tracing is Now supported on Xbox x and S and the PS5 and switch now also have incremental builds so some nice improvements mostly helping you iterate faster then the section on mixed reality as usual some more platforms pretty much the day the quest Pro came out UNT already had support psvr2 isn't even out yet and it's already supporting and the XR interaction toolkit is also getting a big update this is a tool set for helping you easily Implement all kinds of common interactions in your XR games things like picking up objects pushing buttons using levers grabbing weapons and so on XR is definitely a topic that I'd love to cover I wish I could find the time to dive deep into all these tools So based on these highlights there's quite a lot of things in this latest tech release both big and small now I went through the entire change log and here's the entries that's account to me first one which is small but extremely useful is on the package manager you can now Bonk install packages so you no longer need to do it one by one select them all and install them all for me this was especially useful because when working on my steam game I recently picked up the asset inventory which is an excellent tool for quickly searching inside all the se1 but for that to work it needs to download the asset at least once doing it one by one would have been a pain since I have hundreds of assets so this tiny little addition really helped me a ton the package manager itself also changed quite a bit there's now some tabs showing all the data nicely organized everything was reorganized both on the official packages as well as in the assets or packages then physics got some nice additions he can now apparently specify contact layers on a per object basis up until now the only controller you had over collisions was on the Collision Matrix which works on a perlier basis but now you can do it on a per object basis so this gives you much more control over all of your physics objects then urp got some decal layers so you can apply some decals kind of like blood spatter but make it affect only the ground and not your character they added foviated rendering support I think this one is related to them adding psvr to support which I believe has 4v8 rendering and I think the quest Pro does as well this one is going to be a great feature especially for VR and AR in the future as usual there are some more performance improvements when entering and exiting point mode the unity web request class got a much needed upgrade previously it only supported sending forms you couldn't send regular Json without using some tricks when I was researching the cloud I need to send some Json and it was quite a headache to figure out how to make it work thankfully now this class is nicely standardized so if you want to send some Json you no longer need to search for it just like I did the VFX graph got some activation Boolean ports I haven't used VFX graph in ages but being able to easily enable our disable blocks sounds really useful Bloom also got some nice options for tweaking performance so you don't need to only either enable or disable if you're making mobile games for low end devices maybe you can leave it on and just lower the quality also many of the tools change to use the new overlay system these are some UI gizmos that give you many more options based on whatever objects you have selected they are very customizable you can place them anywhere scale and rotate them one fun one about physics is you can now run some queries asynchronously in a job so if you have lots of physics queries this can really help performance a nice small one is how they set the minimum Sprite preview size to 64 by 64. so this one should be helpful when trying to see some tiny images and there's a bunch more changes the entire change log is massive so as you can see it's a pretty big release with lots of things both big and small with this being version 0.2 means that this won't be very close in terms of features to the 22 LTS version which is what you will mostly be using over the next 12 to 18 months if you don't like me are also working on a game and for launch in next year then check out this version and of course stay tuned for the dots I can't believe the funnel release is just a few months away alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
