hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made within team launch in December 22. I thought the month of December would be pretty quiet but it's actually not it was tough to only pack 10 games and on top of that this month had several races that are using Unity dots so that's always awesome to see the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test all of these games are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way I'm currently working on my own Sim game called Terminal 1 Liberation it's a game with tons of systems open world survival and crafting automation strategy check out this steam page edit your wish list and follow for that one alright so starting off at number 10 with a game that is using Unity Dots here is ixion this is a SciFi City Builder Survival game with tons and tons of moving pieces there's lots of robots flying around lots of conveyor belts it also has a focus on story so it's not just a Sandbox there is an actual storyline as you make the best decisions you can in order to help your crew survive there are huge summer maps to explore send out probes to reveal what is hidden do some mining to get some resources or some research to unlock new tech it has already managed to get over 6 000 reviews so this one is a huge hit although they are only mostly positive but if you're looking for something with a lot of complexity and a huge scale then this one looks great up next here is another one that is also using Indie dots this is generally car worlds I first saw this game on Twitter a couple of months ago through a really interesting video where the dev basically went through how the game works basically everything that you see here all these shapes they are wrong really just points that's how dots is used every single one of these thousands of points is a single entity then the game itself feels very natural in jelly everything squishes and stretches it's really fun to play around the physics and watch as a car is crushed and then bounce back into existence it even has a really fun feature where you can record your microphone and change any of these sound effects in the game it's a very inventive mechanic that personally fits the silliness of the home game for something a lot more Jolly here is little Gator game if you like fun and Adventure Platformers then this is a game for you you jump around meet some friends interact with animals you have lots of movement abilities to get around in this adorable world so you can climb you can swim Glide and slide all over the place as you meet new and interesting characters in your travel if you're tired of the stresses of every day then this seems like a great way to spend a jolly afternoon it has 1 000 overwhelmingly positive reviews with a 99 score so this one is already one of the best reviewed games of all time next up here we have Knights of Honor Sovereign according to cvdb this game is also using entities although I can't quite figure out how it is a medieval strategy game it has a map layer and a realtime strategy layer so you manage your provinces gather armies try some diplomacy or some Espionage the battles are all pretty massive with tons and tons of units fighting all over the place I guess that's maybe where they're using entities visually the game also looks really good both the expression layer and the realtime combat they also promise that the gameplay is Grand strategy but accessible on Grand strategy so if you have trouble getting into these kinds of games and could be a fun entry point then for some VR here is downtown it's a language learning game it looks like a fun mix where it teaches you the words and phrases but then also asks you to perform the action so it's really nice you can have an old lady telling you she doesn't like rodents and then it's up to you to pick them up and throw them away it even use the microphone to test your actual speaking skills so this one looks like a fun way to learn a new language it features Japanese Chinese Spanish French German and Italian for me I've been casually learning Japanese on Duolingo for about a year now so I'd love to try this out and see how it differs then here's a game that shocked me a bit with how it's doing it's called stewardship it's a really soundlish very unique Shoot Em Up With a Twist which is that it's actually a Dodge Mount you fly a really slick spaceship and there are enemies firing at you you have no attacks yourself so you need to position your ship so that the enemies destroy each other it's a really interesting premise and seems very well produced the game oozes a very awesome art style I really like all the visuals of the effects in this game seems to have lots of upgrades that work really well with the core game mechanic however this game really shocked me because one looks great and unique it's also doing very importantly it only has 33 reviews which means it really hasn't sold very well I thought maybe the issue was like a wish list but it seems in launched with around 7000 which is a pretty decent number the genre is definitely a bit Niche on Steam shoot em ups or both Hound Shooters are somewhat small on seam so maybe that's it the game does look really great so hopefully over time it will find an audience and end up with a really nice long tail up next here we have zombie cure lab I can't believe no one has done this concept before it's a management game with zombies where the goal is not to kill all the zombies rather to cure them it's a really interesting premise it has all the mechanics you expect from a management game there's lots of buildings to do all kinds of things you have human scientists that operate those buildings and can research to unlock all kinds of new technologies there are still aggressive zombies so you do need to defend your base but rather than taking them all out you need to capture a bunch of them and start the process to convert them from a zombie into a human just based on the concept alone I'm already interested and Beyond the unique concept it also means seems very well made with very positive reviews it just came out into Early Access so I'd love to give this one a try when I have some time next up for something very visually striking here is Project downfall it's a bit of a weird name but it looks like a very well made first person shooter with some unique visuals features lots of satisfying destruction the Gunplay feels very weighty very powerful the game has a sound mechanic so you get bonus points for headshots which also enable bullet time for some really awesome moves the description has a surprisingly large amount of lore so while it looks like the main focus is on the gameplay apparently it does have an interesting story it features leaderboards if you're into that sort of thing very Hardcore gameplay with no Health Region at all lots of Combos and a sanity system it just came out of Early Access and reviews are very positive then if you want maximum complexity here is final upgrade it's a very generic name but the game itself looks very compelling just one look at the trailer and you can immediately tell what kind of game it is you have tons of units flying around lots of complex interlock systems you can mine for resources terraform planets and conquer the Galaxy seeing the scale of the game is truly massive I tried to Google to see if this game is also using dots but I couldn't find anything it's really complex with tons and tons of logic and systems so perhaps it's using some kind of custom ECS logic I quite like the uniqueness of the vertical layout at least to me the game looks more vertical rather than an overhead view so basically if you like these kinds of games with tons of moving parts and conflict systems then this looks like an excellent new entry in genre and at number one for my personal pick month here is a huge hit that just came out of Early Access here is potioncraft this was in Early Access for a little over a year in that time it got tons and tons of updates based on feedback from the community the game has some very unique mechanics it's an alchemist Simulator game so you need to gather all kinds of plants and actually use your tools to brew all kinds of potions the entire game has a very manual very satisfying feel it's up to you to invent new recipes and attract new customers the crafting system works really interesting very complex as you include ingredients the potion quote unquote moves on the map which leads to the final result I definitely would like to play this one to explore all of these Unique Mechanics certainly looks like a very unique game it has already gathered over 14 000 very positive reviews in the past year and even though they just launched out of Early Access they still have an active roadmap so if you enjoy the game you will have lots of content to play for a long time alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with DNT and launch in December 22.
