hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out one asset that will greatly increase your odds of success now you're probably already aware of the term game feel or game juice or just nice feedback meaning add tons of screen shake lots of flashy things punchy sound effects and much more there's a bunch of really awesome talks on youtube about this topic i've linked them in the description definitely watch those if you don't know about how to make your game feel awesome so what this s does is exactly that it's a collection of tools and effects to take your game from boring to awesome just by looking at some simple examples you can see the huge difference it makes between the basic boring game and the one with awesome feedback adding a bunch of excellent game feel into your game will massively increase your chance of success and this asset helps you do that so this video is pointed in two parts first let's look at some of the demos to see what the asset can do and how they work then after that i'll do a stepbystep guide on how to start using it and add it to your own games there's timestamps in the video if you want to look ahead check out the entire asset review playlist where i highlight great assets to help you make your games awesome also this video is sponsored by unity which is currently running the new year sale on the unity as a store this sale has tons of assets that have never been discounted previously so if there's something that came out recently then chances are it's discounted for the very first time on this sale there's over 8 000 assets heavily discounted everything from tools to models animations and tons of effects most of the assets i've covered in my asset review series are discounted i also made a video and a list covering some of the best highlights and on top of that this cell also has a special coupon if the total is above 150 however i haven't even bought a coupon you can use the coupon code monkey ny22 instead of five percent off you get a bonus 10 off the sale is running until the 11th of january so check it out to the link description and this asset is also discounted as part of the sale so if you like what you see in this video go ahead and pick it up before the discount ends and if you're watching this after the sale is over then you can instead use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 percent off your order okay so feel this asset really helps you in making your games feel awesome it is very well built everything is very easy to use you have tons of graphs to visually play with tons of options for how to interpolate your values lots of timing options and it's super simple to trigger the effects also i should mention that the effects part is really just one part of this asset this is actually three assets in one so you have the mm feedbacks which is the system to handle all of those effects then you also have nice vibrations this one is a tool for helping you add haptic feedback to your mobile games and finally mm tools this one is a collection of various helpful tools there's one to manage sound create sequences of actions make a simple state machine debug menu visually plot your tweens and more so this asset really is those three in one so here i've got my project and i import the asset now in terms of documentation the asset is great you can see there's a huge amount of separate demos all of them covering all kinds of use cases and the documentation on the website is also excellent the website is very clean with a nice summary of each demo and exactly what they showcase so for example here's a quick video tutorial on how to install a field either in video or a text tutorial then here's the demo page which showcases all of the various demos including the asset so this website really is really awesome another thing is over here you've got a page for recipes so these are some super quick tutorials that teach you how to implement some specific scenario for example how to set up a syn machine camera shake and there you go you've got some very simple instructions so just import feel important machine add the impulse listener extension create a mm feedback object assign a syn machine impulse feedback and so on so lots of mini tutorials on how to do all kinds of things then you've got a getting started a bunch of concepts a list of all the effects and so on so the website is really awesome and some excellent documentation so back in unity let's check out some of the demos also one important thing on the render pipelines now the asset works on all the render pipelines for most of it it really doesn't matter for example making the screen shake that's not really related to any render pipeline so the only time when it matters is when animating the postprocessing effects each render pipeline has its own postprocessing stacks so they require different components but in terms of usability it's really all the same as working with any other property so speaking of that let's start with the urp demo it's a really nice bowling demo so the ball is constantly looking left and right and as soon as i hit space yep there it goes the balls thrown forward hits the pins with all kinds of really nice effects and then a really nice reset there's also some really nice sound effects so as soon as i press and if there you go looks really nice really satisfying however if i pause the game and i'll look into the various feedback components so i go here and i'm just going to disable all these effects so i disable them all and now if we test and if there you go it looks much more boring and the reset also instant so all of it looking much more boring so compare that with the version with all of the effects added and yep look that really awesome so just with this you can see the huge difference that adding all these effects makes without them it really looks like an amateur game there's nothing flashy no hit feedback no sounds the ui is boring and reset happens instantly but with all the effects it looks like a proper polished professional game then here on the left side there's also a menu where you can click to see each effect in action now this one is the urp demo so this one shows specifically the things that are exclusive to urp which are really just the volume post pressing effects so for example you click on it and you see how it increases and decreases bloom so really nice then the channel mixer of it changing really nice and smooth so all of it interpolated instead of being massively insanely and of course you can also inspect how all this is working so on this demo you can go inside the canvas go inside the scroll rect and over here you've got all the various ones so for example on bloom you can see inside there's a mm feedbacks object and then here you can see it has the mm feedbacks component and it's got a bloom urp and then down here you see the curve how it starts from zero increases and decreases so you see how easy it works but we'll see the getting started guide in a bit now this is just one of the demos so let's see some other ones for example here is a very basic snake demo so it's really just a snake game just rotating around trying to grab all these balls all these food so it's really very simple it's really just a bunch of squares a bunch of spheres but with all these effects you can see how it looks really really nice and awesome look at that then over here the bounce demo now this one has a scene without feedbacks so i press on space and there you go the character jumps up and down really very boring and now enable all the effects and now with the jump look at that really awesome much more impactful then here is the card zy demo features lots of satisfying movements some bounces some postprocessing visual effects all of them looking really nice really satisfying this one shows a progress bar so how you can make even just a basic ui make it much more polished much more impactful and this one the mm feedbacks demo this one shows tons of individual effects so as you can see this as it can modify pretty much everything so you can do some animations you can do some destruction enable or disable some behavior instantiate a bunch of objects change the camera feel of the view do a bunch of camera shake then again play around all the post pressing you can use it to animate textures in texture scale you can freeze frame do a time modifier so enable some slow motion move rotate a transform and so on so on there's even tons of them for floating ui text as well as a bunch with text mesh pro there's also some audio as well as even a really nice debug log so here's the console looking really nice and all this everything that you see here everything you can modify you can do it with all kinds of triggers and all kinds of curves to get it triggered exactly as you want it and behave exactly as you intend okay so now that we've seen the official documentation and demos let's go to the second part of this video and learn how to apply it to our game so here is my demo i've got my character and a zombie target so let's pretend this game is sort of like an xcom game so a turnbased tactical game so i'm controlling this character and on my next turn i decide to take the action of shooting the assembly so i do the action and there you go shoot the zombie and the zombie flies so it's a pretty simple demo so i just take my action and i shoot and there you go it falls out so right now it feels very boring so let's use this asset to spice things up essentially i prepared some things like some cameras and some particles and we're going to use feel to trigger all the actions and play around the values here is the script that i'm using on this demo so it's very simple really just on update checking for the spacebar input and if so then we spawn a bullet so we're only just instantiating the prefab and then for the zombie hit we're only just disabling the animator so the ragdoll falls down and adding some explosion solve it pretty simple and like this the demo is pretty boring you really just press a button and the zombies shot instantly so one of the first effects that i want to add is this particle system essentially i want to add some anticipation for this action so i want these particles to build up before the weapon actually fires so let's do that let's begin by making an empty game object let's name it just mm feedbacks and then here first of all reset transform and let's add a component then you can either search or go up here into more mountains then go into feedbacks and let's add the mmf feedbacks okay so now we've got a really nice button here to add any kind of feedback now the first one we want is to have the particles start playing so let's add a feedback let's go down here into particles and let's enable of type particles play just like it says on this note we'll simply play the specified particle system then here we've got the label so we can change the text that appears in there so we can make this a bit more specific so let's say shoot particles play then down here for the mode we want to set the particles to start playing when it reaches this feedback and then just assign the particle system so just drag the reference okay so that's it just like this it's already enough to trigger the particles so we can test this the game is currently playing and now for testing the component has some super useful testing buttons so these buttons down here apply to all feedback so they run through the entire feedback list or each individual feedback also has a player stop button so for example it sets out just as shoot particles hit on play and if there you go the particle system does indeed start playing okay great now this demo i also set up two virtual action cameras so one of them is right behind the player and then there's another one right in front of the zombie so let's say we want to use these along with our actions now there are two ways we can do that we can go into our mm feedbacks going to add a feedback and then here under a camera we can add a send machine transition so we could use this effect this one requires a bit of setup or we can just take the simpler approach and really just enable or disable these game objects so the action camera always has a higher priority so as soon as i enable it's going to switch this one disable and go back into normal okay so here let's add new feedback let's go into our game object and we're going to make it of type set active then let's drag this reference so the action camera one so activate action camera one and now these are the sets and on play is when we actually reach this feedback effect so when we play when we reach this one we want to enable down so let's go straight on play we're going to set it to active okay so let's test and see if this activates the second camera so the game is currently playing and press on this button and there you go it does activate that camera okay great now for the next effect let's add a growing screen shake while the player is charging up the shop so for screen shape let's add a new feedback and this time we're going to go into camera and we're going to add it of types in machine impulse and just like it says here on the note this lets you trigger a syn machine impulse event which also means you need a syn machine impulse listener on the camera so let's go into the virtual camera and down here there's a button to add an extension so here let's add a send machine impulse listener then for the setup we can leave it all in defaults just make sure to attach it to all the cameras that you're using so for me i'm going to add it to these two now back on the feedback let's set this up so for the impulse channel yeah we'll left everything on default okay that's good for the raw signal we can use one of the presets so let's use the 6d shake then you can play around the amplitude and frequency but the most important one is over here playing around with the attack so this is the start portion of the shake and we want to increase in intensity so this area right here this one is an animation curve so if you click on it yep it shows you a really nice animation curve so we want to slowly increase intensity so we can go either with the flat or maybe this one and for the time let's say we want to increase it over three seconds and that's all we need so let's put the sustain and decay both on zero and the last thing that we need is down here on the velocity so this is the intensity so essentially the strength of the screen shake let's not put it by too much so maybe just 0.5 on all of them okay so let's set this feedback so the game is playing and as i hit on play and yep there you go there's a slight shake and slowly increasing so maybe we can increase the intensity by a little bit and yep it does start to shake a bit better okay great so far we have some particles then we activate the action camera then we start shaking now for the next one let's trigger an event to fire the actual bullet but we want to do that after the charge up is completed so for that let's add new feedback and for this one we're going to go into events and then over here you see a bunch of standard yint events so these are triggered at various stages so a play then that's when the feedback reaches this event there's a stop event in case you stop this one the initialization which happens in the beginning so there you go over here you've got the settings and then the reset when the whole thing resets so in this case we want to trigger something when we get to this particular feedback so let's do it on playing and really this one is a normal unit event so just click on pause then we drag the script so let's drag that one then go into the asset review field this is the script that i'm using in this case i want to call the spawnbot function okay so that's pretty much it but we don't want this event to be triggered right on start so on timing we have this nice section here there are tons of options and most important one is over here the initial delay in this case we want to shoot the bullet after three seconds so let's just put a three right here also note how here on the feedback list on the right side you can see how long until these events are activated that's in machine impulse is activated on zero less for three seconds so that's why it goes there and events that one has only three seconds and then it's instant okay so let's just like this okay the game is playing so let's test but let's test all the feedbacks instead of just one by one so over here i've got a second inspector open and i'm going to trigger the play button so let's just move it to the side press the button and there you go the camera goes in the particles start flying and after three seconds yep we've got the bullet all right great so you saw how the camera zoomed in it started shaking the particles start playing then it shakes some more when their weapon is charged and the shot is fired so with what we have here you can already see just how easy it is to set up all these actions and all this timing now let's make some more let's add a more intense shake when we shoot so let's do the same thing we did previously so also another scene machine impulse so let's add another one total difference is this one no attack time let's keep some sustain and then decay and for decay let's do kind of reverse of this curve so it starts off high and goes down slow then also on the velocity we want this one to be quite a bit more intense then we also want to trigger the zombie getting shot so that's another event so let's add a new event and up here on the play events let's drag the script and call the function okay just zombie hit also don't forget the timing so for the scene machine impulse the really nice shake let's put it after three seconds so as soon as the bullet fires it fires that one then for the zombie getting hit let's put a bit more so maybe 3.05 and before that let's also activate the second camera so just do the exact same thing go into game object set active let's drag the action camera to and we're going to set it to active okay so that's a bunch more effects now it would also be really cool to have a slow motion effect so let's do that let's add new feedback let's go down here into time and let's set a time scale modifier and this one just like it says on the note here this one triggers a timescale event but we need an object with a time manager so let's do that just create a new empty game object and then we add a component once again go into more mountains and let's add a time manager another nice effect would be to add some chromatic aberration so let's add new feedback and that one is a postprocessing effect so let's go into this one and now here i'm working in urp so that's what we're going to use let's add a chromatic aberration urp and again make sure to read the note so as you can see the volume component needs to also have this component so on the object where you have the volume component just go ahead and attach this component as well then here in the settings you've got the intensity so once again this is an animation curve so you can play around the shape with the intensity and so on okay so i just added some more effects a bloom one distortion and so on so now i'd like to test all of them at once but so far we've been testing them by clicking on the editor button that's obviously not ideal so now it's time to trigger all this through code which is really easy over here is my script with my very simple logic all we really need is first the using statement so using this one is inside more mountains than inside feedbacks and then let's add a serialized field for the type is of type mm feedbacks there's an s so there are two classes make sure you put the one on the s and just mm feedbacks then down here instead of calling these functions manually these are going to be called by the mm feedbacks so we just go here and we call play feedbacks and that's it very simple so here in the editor we really just need to assign that reference and we can test okay so here i am and now instead of using the debug button i'm going to press on space to take my action so i take my action and there you go the camera changes zooms in starts playing starts shaking and shoots a zombie everything nice slow motion nice lens distortion of that looking really awesome so here it is again with the camera the zoom the shake the particles then the bullet is fired then the zombie the slow motion and all of those really nice effects so compare this one with the version without any of these effects and you can see a huge difference in just a few minutes we turned a boring demo into something pretty awesome also one quick note here in this demo i built all the logic of these effects in a single mm feedbacks component so this is one approach but like you saw in the official demos a possibly better approaches to actually separate them so if this was a real game i would now refactor this logic just to separate the shot feedbacks from the zombie dead feedbacks to do that really you just make another object with the effects for the second part then on the first one you would add an event trigger the second one and so on basically the more separate you keep on logic the easier it is to understand how it all works and you end up with fewer timing dependencies alright so that's feel it's a great asset to very easily add tons of polish to your game polish is really what separates good games from great games so definitely spend some time polishing all of your actions and with this asset it really makes that process very simple you can see how quickly i turned the demo scene going from boring to awesome and like i said this asset is actually three in one i just covered the mm feedbacks part but if you're working on mobile this one also includes the nice vibrations haptics package and it also has tons of useful tools so all that is included in this one asset so based on how much polish effects and level of success that you can find with your games i can highly recommend this asset and don't forget to check out unity's new year sale if you like this asset then this is
