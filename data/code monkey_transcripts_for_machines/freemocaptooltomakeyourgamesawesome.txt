hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey normally doing moap animation is something that requires lots of money and tons of equipment however here let's see a tool called anim motive that lets you record map animations of very high quality although this is also so much more than just a map animation tool you can create fullon Cuts scenes or short films basically you can set up a world then you can play some lights play some cameras and position them exactly where you want them just like you would in a normal film set then you can use some props you can write the script and just act the way you act is you literally embody the characters that you place on the scene and then move and talk and do whatever you want you can have a director control the camera movement or swap between cameras you can also control an invisible character and do some really cool handheld camera movement you can make animations with multiple characters like two people talking to each other or an attacker and Defender animations so for example you record one character then cut move to the other character and record some more this makes the final animation be perfectly sync or you can do all this in collaboration with other people in real time either in a shared VR space where everyone is in VR or just some people in VR like just the actors and have the others on a regular desktop like director then you can either render video from what all the camera see or export this animation onto an fpx file which you can then load inside blender or unity and use in any way you want this is a really awesome tool I definitely enjoyed my time playing with it this video is sponsored by anim motive but I wouldn't do a sponsored video if I didn't think this human was generally awesome so I do think this is great and extremely useful especially for Indie devs while also being being completely free to try out so after watching this video definitely go ahead check the link in the description to go try it out like I said this has a ton of use cases I'll go through a bunch of them in the ways that I think can help you make your own games and then I'll also do a quick getting started tutorial it's actually surprisingly easy to get started now as an in developer the main use case that I thought of right away was just quickly making some very custom animations nowadays the accur is really awesome you can very quickly very easily find tons of animations however they usually come in some really huge pack and not as individual animations so if you need just one very specific thing like just a simple hand wve picking up a giant pack with 100 animation just to get the one you want and hope that it's exactly as you want that can be quite annoying quite timec consuming so instead in just 60 seconds you can pick up your headset and easily record the exact animation you want so this tool is really excellent for helping you speed up iteration time which as a need Dev is definitely one of the most valuable things you have or another use case is for making some super custom animations like for example if you have a character sitting at a desk working on a computer most animation packs are really for things like attacks and movement animations so finding an animation for something very specific like just working on a computer that is actually quite tricky again you can very quickly just put on a headset and record the exact animation you want it can be working on a computer it can be eating a burger doing some fancy ninja moves maybe some bicep curls shooting a spider web from the wrist pulling a simple lever hammering a nail and so on finding animation packs for such unique animations is actually really hard but in 60 seconds you can really just put on the headset and create the exact animation you want very easily then of course you can just export and import it into Unity or blender if you want to tweak something another excellent use case for recording multiple character animations now this one is really especially cool for me I'm a Sol developer I work just by myself so the ability to do Moab to create animations that involve multiple characters and do that just by myself is really awesome for example something super simple just making two characters talk to one another I can just Place both characters in the scene then I can body the first character and record the animation then stop recording embody the second character record again and yep now this records both animations at the exact same time I'm really amazed at how well this workflow works even when it's just a single developer jumping back and forth another example something that is usually pretty tricky is doing attacker and Defender animations basically attacks that involve two characters usually that's really tricky to sync in order to make sure that the attack and Defender act at the exact same time but over here I can just Place both characters exctly what I want I can embody one I can do my attack then I can jump into the other one do the defender animation and Y there it is a perfect attacker Defender animation directly inside of my un game and again it only took me a few minutes to record this completely custom animation one really awesome really cool thing is actually scale for example here I have a scene with an adult and a child if I embody the adult so here is the view everything looks pretty normal now if I go out and I embody the child and yep look at that now I can see everything exactly as the child's eye see importantly no the scale of everything it's all scaled correctly based on the size of the character that I'm embodying I think this is actually really awesome this is a really cool feature it really takes the character size into account when doing anything to see all kinds of perspective that way makes it really perfect to record an animation on a small child or a huge or creature as an actor you don't have to pretend that you're looking at a different place than what you're looking at as you embody the character the entire world gets scaled up or down depending on the size of your character they actually initially started building this tool for making virtual production for kid shows so this also perfect for just making simple cut scenes or short films you can select the scene background then place your characters place your lights and all your cameras and as always remember how you can do all this either completely Solo or together with multiple people online at the same time so for example you can have multiple actors embody each character also by the way you can also enable the headset microphone in order to automatically add lip syncing as the character stalk so you set up the actors and have someone set up the light so really position them set up the color temperature and so on then you can have someone control the camera either a fixed camera from a fixed Viewpoint and control the field of view and all those settings or it can also have a realtime camera you can embody a invisible character inside of VR then hold the camera and literally move it around or alternatively just have a director to manage all of it which by the way those don't need to be in VR you can have some users in VR and some users on a normal desktop another quick mention is how you can also enable physics on the object which can make your scenes feel quite a bit more natural and also a bit strange when seeing for example the fingers over here on this character the way the fingers move around with physics actually quite interesting so anyways you can set up the scene you can start recording and get a ton of takes done super quickly put it all together and you can really record an entire ciz sequence cut scene and do all that at lightning fast speed another cool use case is for making game trailers you can load your own custom assets to use when recording you're not limited to just the builtin assets you can load environments characters props or really anything so for example here is a custom environment with some characters and props that I grab from an asset pack that I own let's say for example these were the exact same assets that I was using to build my game now over here I can just act out some scenario for the game trailer this can be really awesome for making your trailers quite a bit more interesting by having something other than just gameplay footage and again with an motive you can record this footage and iterate upon it super quickly now here's a super quick getting start guy you just download and install and motive then create a brand new project you create a new scene and open it then put on your headset just make sure it's connected to your computer wait for others to join if you want multiplayer otherwise just start in single player so here I am inside the scene now I can just select the character and place it in the world I can point at the character and embody it there's the mirror image showing exactly what I look like now I can do whatever animation I want like for example just a simple wave also by the way you can modify the hand shape to a bunch of different ones or you can customize all these hand shapes then if you want to make a cut scene you can continue adding some cameras and lights but in this case let's say all we want is just a simple animation so I hold the Y button for a while in order to start recording now record my animation and press the button again to stop and now I can go into export and let's export as an fbx and yep here we have the fun fbx is a pre universal format we can open this in blender to do whatever we want or just straight into unity and yep here it is in unity just loads as a normal humanoid animation so here is a standard character and if I the animation yep there it is everything works so I really just made a custom animation in a few seconds this is really awesome now in terms of requirements all you need is just a Windows 10 PC and a VR headset with a Link cable or wireless link in my case I've been using it with the Quest 2 and I have the Oculus Link cable if you have a quest Pro you can also do some full face capture and for really highend use cases this also works with the xense performance capture suit this is a pre serious very expensive suit if you need absolutely perfect motion capture then sure go ahead and use it but chances are you don't need it using a Quest SE like I've been doing Works actually surprisingly great the only obvious limitation is of course you can only control the upper body so you can't really do animations for like doing back flips or kicks although the legs and the elbow ik is actually still very good in all my testing I never really got the characters into strange positions and in terms of pricing you can try it out for free which I think is really awesome if you already have a headset then it's literally free so definitely go ahead and try it out with the link in the description the free tier has the exact same features as all the other tiers the limitation is noncommercial use which really means that you can use this in all the game jams you want and then if you do find it extremely useful and you want to use it in a commercial project you can pick up the Indian license which is actually quite affordable so so this is a really awesome tool I definitely enjoyed my time playing with it the main thing that impressed me is really the ease of use and the iteration speed when making your own games if you need some kind of custom animation instead of spending hours cycling through tons of Animation packs to find the one animation you need instead you just put on the headset and in 60 seconds you have a really awesome complete custom animation so definitely go ahead and try it out check the link in the description and I really do hope that this tool helps you bring your Game Dev dreams to life thanks to Animoto for sponsoring this video thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
