hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this is a quick tip for measuring compound time in the editor this can be useful if you're trying to organize your code into different assemblies and seeing if you're improving the compound time so let's start and create a new C sharp script and name it editor compile time okay so in here we're going to be using unity editor and we're going to apply the attribute execute in edit mode so that this class executes whilst we're in edit mode now on our private void update we're going to use editor application dot is compiling to measure our compile time north to do that we need some variables to store the current time so let's add a private double called compile start time and we also need to test if we are already compiling so a private ball is compiling and let's default that to false okay so on update we're going to test if is compile if we are already compiling we are going to test if the editor is no longer confounded and we're going to trigger a function called compile finish now if we are not compiling and all of a sudden editor application shows that we are compiling we have starts of a bomb start and modify our boolean so is compiling here suddenly became false and here it became true so let's make our functions a private boy compile started and the private boy compile pinch so on compulsory let's do a debug log and say compiled and started and we're going to store the compile starts time based on the editor application dot time since start up and then our compiled finished we are simply going to come in late the time that has passed since compiled start time so double compiled time equals editor application not time since startup our compiled start time so this one returned the number of seconds that we have taken to compile so let's put a debug log and call it compile finish and this way compile time and we're going to do that to string f2 so that we display two values so I don't say like 9.50 two and one second since this is measured in seconds okay so in here let's create an empty game object call it editor compile timer so that we can apply our script into it now our script is going to trigger on the update which won't be called when we modify something so let's modify the code of course compile there you go compile starting it's compiling compound finished so this is a very small project 2.29 seconds and as you can see anytime you make some changes you can test and see the resulting time okay so you can see how this would help you if you were going to go into create and create a bunch of assembly definitions this way you can easily measure if what you're doing is having a positive effect or not if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them alright see you next time you
