hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for july of 2021 my goal with these videos is to highlight what can be done with the engine so you know the only limit is really just your own imagination all of these games are uniquely impressive and they showcase the power of the engine in tons of different scenarios so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month there's links in the description for some of the games those that are affiliate playing so if you use them it's the same price to you and you'll also be supporting the channel alright so starting off at number 10 with death's door this one is getting a lot of attention lately i already mentioned it in the e3 2021 video since it looks so great the visuals are all very nice and clean and the gameplay feels very snappy and responsive reviews are already very positive with over 2 500 of them it's an isometric action rpg you go out to various worlds to reap the songs of the dead tons of upgrades to unlock and where else to explore it's also very charming it's all about crows and they have some really nice pixar unlike animations so if you're a fan of these types of action adventure games then you definitely need to give this one a try then for something very visually striking boomerang x it's a fastpaced first person arena shooter the core mechanic is once you throw your boomerang you can slingshot directly to it so you use it simultaneously for combat as well as for movement it's very stylish and feels like it's great to play once you get familiar with the mechanic and you can pull off some very impressive moves and the visuals themselves are just great to look at very unique reminds me of samurai jack for some reason up next something from a huge franchise warhammer 40k battle sector this is a pretty big franchise you could definitely call this a double a game and it's great to see it made with unity it's a turnbased strategy game set in the 4k universe i must say that's a universe that i'm not very familiar with but i always love the units space marines always look great awesome mags and monsters there's quite a lot of unity variety in this one you play through 20 epic missions in the single player campaign or get into skirmish mode choose your map choose your faction either the bullet angels or the tyranids and make some unique rules by picking your units heroes and their own loadouts looking at this one makes me want to do a turnbased video i did do a turnbased combat system quite a while ago so i'd love to try doing that again but now in 3d who knows maybe soon going from something dark and gritty to something nice and jolly here is mini motorways you can probably tell at a glance that this is a sequel to mini metro this time you're managing roadways with cars going from a to b so just like mini metro it starts off very simple you just have one car going to one place then you just click to place down some roads and watch the car go from a to b then over time more and more cars show up with more different colors and everything becomes quite tricky the controls are extremely intuitive you just click and drag the interface is super clean and extremely easy to understand the special abilities in this one are roundabouts highways and bridges so this game and mini metro are excellent examples of very well made minimalist games so if that's the genre you're interested in you should definitely study both these and this game runs on a grid so who knows i might do a video taking my grid system and making a prototype sort of like this one by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks for something stunningly stylish here is eastern exorcist really gorgeous looking game it's a side scroller action rpg set in a fantasy world tons of really cool moves and many unique monsters to fight it's really a joy to look at and based on the reviews it also feels great to play lots of really awesome particle effects slash effects and tons of animations it just came out of early access so this is always the best time to join the game since it should be a very complete and very stable there's already over 4 thousand very positive reviews if you want to learn how to make a very stylish action game then i would say you should study this game next up for some vr here is sniper elite vr this feels like the perfect series to go in virtual reality really aim with your own hands and try to land the perfect headshots combined with some stealthy missions where you must move unseen and use a sound pistol and just seeing the famous bullet xray effect in vr sounds like great fun if you've ever played a sniper elite game then you can already imagine what this one is like this is also another great example of a pretty big studio going with unity for their vr games instead of trying to add it from scratch onto their own custom engine if you want to be an artist then check out such art genius artist simulator it looks very wacky like the kind of thing that is really just one joke but actually it already has over 500 overwhelmingly positive reviews so there's definitely a proper game behind the wacky concept it's all about drawing everywhere and it really means everywhere so you can draw on your paintings but also on the walls floor ceilings and anywhere you want make your studio really your own and when all the walls are painted just buy another room and paint it all over again you can also make some money by selling your paintings in the marketplace or fulfilling quiet orders set up an art exhibit and see what the creators thing it features some realistic painting mechanics so of the colors mix just like you expect them to the paint has a realistic texture and you have all kinds of instruments to use everything from brushes palette knives stencils or even flame throwers up next another one that just came out of early access clone drone in the danger zone this is a robot voxel slice em up i have to say with that genre i'm already interested play as a robot gladiator and slice and dice your way to victory since the whole thing is based on voxels it features some very good destruction mechanics really accurate slicing voxels is actually one topic that i haven't researched yet but i'd love to there's tons and tons of things you can do with them you play around with a multitude of weapons play through the story mode in an epic tale of human defiance or check out the multiplayer and challenge your friends to a 1v1 duo or play together in coop it's got over 10 000 overwhelmingly positive reviews so if the concept interests you definitely give it a try and actually for another vr game here is furious scenes now normally i only cover one vr game per month in this list but there were quite a lot of interesting ones this month this one is all about being a pirate on the open seas you've got plenty of actions you can take you can steer the ship man the cannons and give orders to your crew face off against other pirates in the singleplayer campaign or try to last as long as possible in survival mode visually it looks pretty great some really nice water and some really nice particle effects i do wonder since this game is on a boat if it causes actual nausea or if it's pretty easy to play according to the description they mentioned they did work very hard on trying to eliminate this issue so i wonder if they were successful anyway if you truly want to feel like a pirate then this is the perfect game for you and finally at number one for my personal pick of the month here is dream engines nomad cities it's a factory automation building game with survival elements so you'll land in a new world gather a bunch of resources and build up your city as you gather more and more resources you get attacked by more and more powerful enemies until you decide to take off so i especially like the concept of risk reward built directly into the design do you decide to stay for a tiny bit longer to try to gather more resources and risk complete destruction or do you leave as soon as you have enough in order to keep it safe that seems like a really fun twist on the usual automation genre and i think it works perfectly to add those survival elements it just came out in early access so i'll probably check this one out in one year after the phone release alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with unity and launched in july of 2021 if you want to be successful in the game developer you definitely need to keep an eye on the current state of your competition i make these videos once a month so i can
