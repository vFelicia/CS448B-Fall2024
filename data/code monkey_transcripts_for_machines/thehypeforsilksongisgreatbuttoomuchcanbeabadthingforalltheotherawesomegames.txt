and for something a little bit less Jolly lately whenever there's some kind of Indie showcase like the tripa initiative or the Nintendo Indie world event when these happen there's always tons and tons of comments asking nothing but silk song it's really awesome for devs of that game to know that people are insanely hungry to play the next title but at the same time it kind of sucks for all developers of all the games that are being showcased in all these showcases it feels like their games get ran out because there's a vocal minority of people that just want one game and nothing else so it's awesome to see the positive hyp for silk song but too much hyp can also be a bad thing although the Great news is that Indie Games continue to be more and more awesome if there's anything you want to play in pretty much any genre you can always find something great
