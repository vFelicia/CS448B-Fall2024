hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and it's been a few years since Unity released urp and egrp these are the two render pipelines urp or the universal render pipeline is focused on running everywhere and it still looks great but it's not focused on the absolute best visuals possible for that you have the hdrp or the high definition render pipeline so since it's been quite some time since it was released I thought it would be nice to do some research to see what games have already been made using agrp now thankfully there's a really easy way to see if a game is using egrp a while ago I was researching games for my top 10 new releases list and I saw a heart space shipbreaker and on cmdb you can see if the game is using Unity which is what I look at and then it also shows you if it's using urp or agrp basically just goes through the phone list and finds the agrp and Library so with that here we have a really nice list of all of the ajrp games there's already quite a lot of them over 700 so let's look at some of them to see just how far developers have pushed into these visuals however before I start this video let me actually make a quick note on agrp so you don't go and suddenly try converting your entire project it's not something that you change to egrp and everything magically looks better some things doing didn't look better the postprocessing the lighting and so on the algorithms that hrp uses are different from the ones that urp uses they are focused on maximum Fidelity instead of Maximum compatibility so those things are indeed kind of automatic however for most things that is not herp simply provides you with more options but as to how good something looks it will highly depend on your assets if you put in low poly asset then swap between urp and hrp you really won't notice much of a difference to see that difference you need to actually use all of the various maps that hdrp shaders let you use so you need an AO map a bump map displacement map reflection map class map metal map and so on without all of those various texture Maps it won't magically look good so I just want to quickly point that out if you're a solo developer like me and you don't have an army of artists working alongside you then hrp won't magically make your game look a lot better so if you're like me definitely stick with the urp oh and by the way I'm currently working on my next steam game called turnover Liberation go ahead and add it to your wish list since I made some of the bumper I'm sticking with urp but I am doing everything I can to make divisions look good I spoke about what access I'm using to achieve that look in another video so even if you're using urp you can definitely still make a good looking game but with that said let's look at some of these games that are built by teams that push egrp to its limits starting off with a game that made me think of the idea for this video heart space shipbreaker this one is a great looking space game you've got plenty of Lights lots of Sparks especially when cutting something they're definitely using the VFX graph quite a lot you've got some gorgeous explosions and lots of particles there's also lots of fancy Shader effects for all of the various inspection modes so putting all that together and this one is definitely a very good looking space game remember to your family and then here's one that's not technically using egrp but it's possibly the best looking realistic game made with yinty it's escape from tarkov as far as I know they use a heavily modified Unity version so it's a custom renderer and not really egrp but whatever they use it definitely pushes Unity to its limits the game is absolutely gorgeous with a realistic art style it looks so good that a lot of people are in disbelief when they hear that it's made with empty but again remember it all looks this good because they have an army of artists building a dozens or so Maps where every single material they need to have regular Albedo maps and occlusion Maps metallic displacement and so on but if you do have the artists to draw with that then this game is an excellent example of what you can achieve and of course on top of that you have excellent High poly meshes some gorgeous lighting and shadows excellent particles and animations you put it all together and escape from tarkov is definitely a sign to build home and up next with some top tier visuals here is made of scur personally I'm not a fan of horror games at all I really can't handle it but if you're looking for the best visuals possible then that's definitely the genre to check the reason is because horror games are usually preclaustrophobic so you have a tiny amount of assets visible at a certain time which means those assets can be insanely high quality that coupled with the fact that it's usually at night it really helps since games always look better in low light environments so this game definitely features some excellent visuals because of all of that you have some really high quality models and textures with lots of maps there's lots of fire particles eliminating the scene the Enlighten the fog is definitely very high quality everything looks really gorgeous and really scary so it seems that for horror games my recommendation would be to use egrp instead of Erp because so many of these games are focused on those excellent visuals for something pretty unique over here we have a briss this one as you can see is all about destruction and in order to make that destruction as satisfying as possible the game uses tons of particles there's lots of flashy visuals to really sell the effect all of those gorgeous effects and the camera also really helps to sell the scale of the game when coupled with the sound it really makes every action look and feel really powerful another genre that benefits a lot from some great Visions are adventure games so here is the gorgeous looking Siberia the world before it's got some really nice models and lighting it really achieves the goal of looking like a very convincing world and being an adventure game means that you interact with objects with a very close camera and because of using egrp those objects all look really excellent when you inspect and rotate them just what I was looking for perfect and up next we have tinted real Conquest this one features some really highend models and textures lots of postprocessing to really make the game Shine the depth of field effect is really very high quality here you can definitely see lots of high quality models with all those maps that I was talking about so the ground has some displacement the characters have certain shiny surfaces and also the game is at night which again usually helps in making games look great you will fall every single time for something flashy here is recompile I remember seeing this one tons of times for quite a long time while on Twitter every day there was a new flashy gif the game definitely looks great it's got plenty of Lights lots of effects and particles despite being yet another 3D Puzzle platform and it really looks quite unique and up next something on the management genre here is Airborne Kingdom again some gorgeous post Crossing really nice of the field it has plenty of gorgeous custom shaders for selecting and placing down the objects features some great lighting quality bouncing off of everything and of course some of the assets look really great foreign so these are seven games out now using Unity hdrp to produce some great visuals it goes to show that if you have some super high quality assets with tons of super high res texture maps with all that Unity can definitely look gorgeous if you want go ahead and give it a try create a new project with the official egrp sample template to see just how good it can look alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
