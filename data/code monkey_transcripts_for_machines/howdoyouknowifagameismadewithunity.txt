hello and welcome i'm your code monkey so one of the videos that i normally do are some lists of unity games i've made a bunch covering some top tier games and i also make a video every month covering that month's best games made with unity and i also made one recently showcasing a bunch of unity games shown at e3 2021 now i do this mainly to highlight just how capable the engine is and also to remind you and myself that the only limits are really your own skills and your own imagination so one question which i sometimes get is how do i know what games are made with unity now before i answer that question right now there's two awesome humble bundles happening one with a massive amount of 2d art characters weapons backgrounds and tons and tons of icons and another bundle with a massive amount of music and sound effects both of them with really deep discounts i bought both of them myself and also the unity summer sale is continuing every week there's new assets being discounted today is the last day of the 3d sale there will be a new one starting tomorrow from this one i picked up this giant rifle animation pack for a future video that i'm working on there's links in the description which are field links so if you use them you get some awesome stuff and you help support the channel so as i was saying one question i sometimes get is how do i know what games are made with unity now to answer that question some people might say that you can't just tell when a game is made with unity but to those people i would say well what does cuphead gentian impact rimworld and escape from tarkov have in common and the answer is yep you guessed that they are all made with unity they all look entirely different they are on completely different genres they give you a completely different experience and yet they are all made with the same engine so no just by looking at it you really can't tell what engine was used to make a game that method really only works for the most amateur games which really don't change the defaults so you can definitely recognize the default skybox you can also recognize the default cubes in default lighting and you might recognize some asset flips but once you go up one level to just some decently well made games at that point you really cannot overtone so since most of the games that i cover in those lists are all excellent games which definitely don't fit in the complete amateurs category the question is how to identify which ones are made with unity now the most common answer is quite simple it's through the project files unity games have a very particular structure you have an executable then a data folder and most important of all a whole bunch of unity dlls so for example over here is one of my games game corp dx and as you can see it has that folder structure so the executable and the datum folder and again more importantly there's the unity engine dll so you know that it's made with unity whereas over here is the folder for dragon ball fighters which is made within rio which you can also tell by the folder structure so it's got this binaries folder and then inside a thirdparty folder so it seems that most games made within real have this specific structure so that's the simplest method just looking through the project files so then that brings the next question which is how do i find those project files now the obvious answer is simply to buy the games install them and inspect the phones that are saved on the hard drive that method definitely works but as you might imagine that would become insanely expensive very quickly i usually check about 30 games and choose only 10 for my monthly lists so i definitely cannot afford to buy all of those games just for one quick interesting video so to solve that there's a really awesome website called steamdb like the name implies it's pretty much a unofficial steam database you can find any game on steam on there so i can for example search for one of my own games gamecore dx then down here i can inspect the depot which is the name for the steam data containers and over here i can try to find the depot that contains the windows files and then just look at it and up here i can see all the files that this game uses without having to buy and install the game i can even use the search bar in order to find all the unity files and confirm that this is indeed a unity game now the only downside of this method is that naturally it only works for steam games that's why my monthly lists are really just taken from the steam new releases simply because it's the easiest way so if something comes out just on the epic game store or just on console or on mobile then this method does not work for those you have to go with the manual method essentially just going on google and trying to find if there is any mention of the engine on the official website now sometimes it's easy like for example for call of duty mobile that's a mobile game but it has been used as an example in various unity talks so you know it's made with unity for others it's maybe a bit tricky like for example against an impact there is no mention of unity on the website but if you google it you won't find the engine on wikipedia also some mentions on reddit and even an official response then maybe some games have a blog like for example here is 12 minutes they have a blog and in there there are some posts that show the unity tool handles as well as the unity editor window another approach that works for some other games is they might have some job openings and in those they might mention experience with unity and csharp as a requirement for example there's the game endless dungeon which is being made by amplitude studios and they have some job openings and specifically looking for programmers and if you go to apply one of the required skills is c sharp and unity so that's another way you can tell another issue that happens even with games that will eventually come on seem is if they're not out yet for example that's door which was announced during e3 it does have a steam page but it's only there for gathering wishlists so if you try to search it on steamdb there is no depot yet so you cannot see any of the project files and in this case i cannot find any mention of the engine anywhere and i cannot find any job openings so the very last approach is finding the twitter account of either the lead designer or a programmer like for example here is a twitter account for mark foster which is the programmer working on that store and here if i scroll down eventually i find a tweet that either mentions unity or use the unity hashtag and yep there it is so as you can see depending on the game you have multiple methods of identifying what engine it's made with and if you just take one thing away from this video then let it be just the fact that you really cannot tell what engine something is using just by looking at it as i mentioned cuphead gentian impact rimworld and escape from tarkov they are all completely different from each other with entirely different art styles and gameplay and yet they are all made with unity so that's how i identify which games are made with yinty so i can continue making these interesting lists to inspire you and to let you know that the only limit to the engine is really just your own imagination okay so this was a very different video from the usual but i hope you found it interesting thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
