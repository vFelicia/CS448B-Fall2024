hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're continuing to create modular spreadsheets as used in battle round tycoon we're going to further increase the randomization of our characters by adding hair collet let's begin okay so here's our dynamically created spreadsheet it is composed of a base price sheet then added on top of that we have a body that on top of that we have our head which itself is composed of a basehead plus some hair and some beard with just these options we already have a lot of variation but now we're going to go one step further and make our hair color also randomizer the game is out no one seems so check it out to see what I'm teaching here apply to a real game so here are all the spreadsheets first there's the base with just the hand and the foot then we've got a beard which is when we're currently using which is already tinted and brown same thing for our hair and then we have the base head spreadsheet so now we're going to do instead of using the hair that is already tinted we're going to use a white texture which is what we're going to use to tend with a certain color we're going to use a multiplication filter so the white parts won't be the exact color of our tent and the great parts won't be interpolated somewhere in between so let's go to the code and let's go to where we're creating our texture in here so first we grab the base pixels and we set them on our texture okay then we are grabbing the head pixels based on our base head which is the same thing we want to do right now then on top of that we're grabbing the hair pixels and then we merge the color array of the hair pixels on top of the head pixels so before we do this merge we want to tend the hair pixels that we grab from the texture so let's go down here to make a function I'm going to make a private void tint color array we're going to receive a color array for our base array and a color for the tent so we're going to cycle through every pixel so do a four and then we apply the tint to each pixel so we set the base array of in X I read to be the red color x the tint right then do the same thing for all the others so we have our function which multiplies the tint towards whatever is on the base around so we can now go all the way up here and before we merge our color arrays let's tint the corner right we want to tend the hair pixels and let's define a hair color to tint it with so in here to find a color for the hair color and here I'm going to go into the u tones class in order to use the get string from color this function is part of the code monkey utilities that you can grab for free from unity code Montcalm and this is very helpful because lets me calculate a color using a hex string alright so I have here a hexadecimal code for our color we take that hair color and we apply that tint into our hair pixels which will now be simply white so after we have tinted then we merge it into the head pixels and do the same thing as previously and for now let's disable the beard so in here set it to false and here set the hair always to true okay so we should now be able to test our code and see the color of our hair and yep there's the sprite sheet using blond hair as you can see the pixels are correctly multiplying the white part is exactly blond and the darker areas of the hair FA darker blond cone okay so now that we have this on our hair we can simply apply to our beard now we could have a different color for the hair and for the beard but normally the colors are the same so let's define our hair color out here okay so here I have an array of a bunch of hair colors I am picking a random one from the array then I tint the hair pixels with the hair color and down here I need to do the same thing for the appeared pixels tentaclear pixels with the same hair color and everything else is exactly the same I'm so only having hair on 70% of time same thing for the beard and some randomizing between 0 and 4 in order to get all the indexes so let's see and yet there's a spreadsheet being created with many different hair colors that are applied both to the hair and also to the beard the 10 that we've made works with any color so if it fits with your game you can feel free to tint it in any color you like like pink or blue the game is out now on Steam so check it out to see what I'm teaching here apply to a real game so there you have it we create our previous spreadsheet and add in more randomization with different hair counts in the next video we're going to tell the base face in order to different skin colors as always he can download the project files in utilities from Endicott monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best incident subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
