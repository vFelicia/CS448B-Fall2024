hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here we have a massive unity mega bundle you can get over 800 worth of assets for 96 off this one is to celebrate the unlinear new year and won't be alive until midfebruary it's a super deep discount so if just one of these assets looks interesting to you then the home bundle is a great deal the bundle is split into three tiers all of them deeply discounted with the biggest deal on the third tier at 96 percent off alright so let's check out some of these assets on the very first year there's already the asset that i'm most interested in this runtime c sharp compiler this is the perfect tool if you want to add some modding support to your games you can expose some namespaces and then your players can write some normal c sharp code that interacts directly with your game you can obviously add lots of safety features to make sure the user code only interacts with exactly what you want and nothing else this opens up lots of really cool ideas that you can do with your games and i've got some things that i'd love to experiment with i find this topic fascinating so i bought the bundle myself as soon as i saw this the normal price for this asset alone is 20 so you can see how the home bundle is worth it even if you only want a single asset next up also on the first year just a massive material bundle almost 500 unique materials for you to play around with i've been doing more and more 3d videos lately so this is going to be quite useful it contains just about anything you can think of so you've got asphalt brick ice fabric leather blood flash wood scifi and tons more all of them with super high quality textures and every material is seamless then if you're looking for some gorgeous fantasy assets here is the topdown fantasy forest really good looking assets perfect if you're trying to make a game sort of like diablo or maybe an rts i've been thinking of doing some survival crafting minigames and this looks perfect for just that features almost 200 prefabs and a whole bunch of effects you've got trees bushes resource nodes mines tents campfires and so on it looks great and supports all of the render pipelines for an interesting tool you've got the acid cleaner pro as your projects become bigger they might start to become quite a bit messy so this tool helps you solve that find unused assets and files and clean them up locate missing references and easily fix them it's super fast and with a nondistracting ui to help you keep your projects on track if you're looking for a complete demo game to

you've got a game with a cartoony visual then this is perfect for adding that extra polish for some animations you've got this everyday motion pack it's perfect if you're working for a game without
