hello and welcome I'm your CMI and we're in November which means Black Friday is here again this is the best time of the year to pick up anything you need since there are some really deep discounts by the way if you think my voice sounds weird that's because I'm recording this on my laptop I'm currently right now in Amsterdam I won't be attending you night tomorrow stay tuned for a video covering all the news let's see what's on sale on the UN assur there's a bunch of stuff at 50% off and some Flash Deals at 70% off and also just for fun I made an extra Black Friday deal on my courses you can pick up my ultimate overview course I'm actually planning another update for this one later this month adding a bunch more lectures the visual scripting course is great if you want to learn how to make games without code my Builder defender course this was my very first one but it's still pretty great it's on the making of an interesting game in TD then the turnbas strategy course this one is made in conjunction with game TV so I can't really easily change the price on that one but even without the extra discount it's still a great course if you're looking for something more advanced and my kitchen chaos courses both of those are completely free here on YouTube but if you can afford it and if you'd like to help me make more free course in the future then check out the optional paid versions and my game is also on a small discount on seam I just put out a really nice update with a bunch of quality of life improvements earlier this week so check it out okay now let's look at the Black Friday sale on un s store there's tons of awesome stuff on sale there's a mountain of stuff at 50% off and there's also Flash Deals which are 70% off for a certain amount of time now before I forget you can use the coupon code monkey bf23 which will give you an extra 10% off if the total is above $100 usually coupons don't sck with other discounts but I've been told this one does work on top of the black Fred discounts so if your total is above 100 definitely make sure to use the coupon code monkey bf23 if you're looking for some quick practical recommendations I can point to the assets that I've used in making my own game dinky Gardens a bunch of these are currently discount and some will be on a flesh deal like for example Qui if you want to make stylized games and this is exactly the kind of share that you need it looks really awesome really cartoony really anime this one has the flash deal staring in one day so stay tuned another Super useful tool is over here umotion Pro this basically lets you edit animations directly inside Unity now for my use case this is super useful in order to be able to easily edit animations I don't normally do animations from scratch but sometimes I get some animation that needs just something that is slightly different so this tool is excellent for that two other great Flash Deals are over here the screen space cavity and the dissolve effects this one is a really great one that as you can see adds this little effect adds all of those nice little shadows and highlights personally I think this looks really awesome especially when combined with the equival Shader since this one is a postprocessing Shader this is another one that I'm also using in my game it won't be on a flash deal in 8 days and this is Sol effects this is the asset that I use in order to make the building animations for my game then for some visuals as you can see there's a bunch of CNAs on sale although if you're looking for CNAs specifically there's also a sale happening on their store they also have a ton of stuff at 50% off and Flash Deals at 70% off so if you don't like their style definitely make sure to check everything that's on sale and the other super awesome ones that I definitely recommend commend are over here field text animator and the quantum console now on the text animator this one lets you easily add all kinds of really satisfying effects to your text so basically if your game has any text of any kind which is pretty much any game if so then I highly recommend this asset this one of those tools that is super easy to use and will make your game feel much much more polished this one is a flash deal starting in two days so in two days you'll get this at 70% off and the other two that I also highly recommend are over here F and the quantum console I actually have dedicated asset review videos on both these as well well as a few more here's my asset review for feel this is a tool that helps your games feel awesome meaning it helps you add all kinds of tiny little polishes tiny little animations that make your game feel excellent and then the quantum console this one is basically a console that you can add to your project which you can then con commands of any kind so these can be builtin Unity commands or it can be commands that you define yourself I use this one extensively for testing on my own game and I also use it quite a bit in my free multiplayer course so if you want to follow that course with this asset then now is the best time to get it then all the other assets that I've covered in asset reviews these are all absolutely excellent if you need pathf finding of any kind then the AAR pathf finding project that is easily the best thing ever I think I've used this one in pretty much every single one of my seam games if you need to animate any Sprites in any kind then the allinone Sprite shade is excellent the curved DS asset is great if you want to make some really interesting effects and of course the Oden inspector this one pretty much everyone already has but if you don't definitely look into it it's a super powerful tool for making tools and if you want to destroy all sorts of things then pick up rayfire this one lets you add all kinds of really satisfying really accurate simulations you can destroy objects and they get destroyed and they fall down perfectly according to ring if you're interested in any of these and check out my asset reviews on them normally I review the asset and I also include a nice quick getting started guide beyond that just browsing the story you can find all kinds of awesome stuff guy is excellent if you're trying to make any kind of open world game and you need to super easily generate a huge World final like he I've heard this one is great if you need some inverse kinematics if you're looking for some realistic visuals and pretty much anything by Infinity PBR always looks it's really nice if you have dwin Pro if you want to make any kind of tweening if you want high quality lighting then look into the bakery for Behavior trees this one I've never use it but I've heard great things about it then the top down engine there's plenty of game engines and this is one of the best ones it lets you super easily make a top down game in many ways for saving easy save this is another one that I still haven't looked at but again I've heard great things about if you're trying to make an RPG then this huge bundle B bling can be super worth it or alternatively for making some faster iteration check out hot reload if you're the kind of person who issues always waiting for your code to recompile then this can definitely save you a ton of time and as you can see there's tons more stuff lots of assets lots of visuals lots of super useful tools everything to help you make better games faster and of course keep in mind all of The Flash Deals so definitely make sure you bookmark this page and you come back to it you can see
