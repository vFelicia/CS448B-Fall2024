hello and welcome I am your code monkey and in this video we're going to create a very simple minimap let's begin all right so here's my scene I have a player character with a sword there are some buildings and some enemies I can attack the enemies and kill them okay we want to display the player the enemies and the building in a minimap in the corner now there are multiple ways to create a minimap but the absolute easiest one is simply making a camera so let's check out the main camera as you can see the camera is just a basic 2d camera and in here we have a culling mask field this contains all the layers that this camera will render which means anything not selected will not be rendered this is what we need to make our minima so let's first go into our player and inside let's create a new empty game object let's name it minimap icon and give it a sprite renderer and drag a circle onto it okay let's scale it up a bit and tint it in green okay so this is the green circle that won't be displayed on our minimap which references the player position and if we run the game you can see that the green circle is on top of the player in the main camera which is not what we want we want to display this on a separate camera okay so let's go back into the editor on our minimap icon in here we're going to select a new layer so click on layer and add a layer in here let's name our layer minimap and back in our mini map icon set it to the layer minimum okay so now let's go back into the main camera and on the culling mask which again this is the layers that are rendered by this camera so in here make sure that minimap is deselected that means that any object that has the minimum layer will not be rendered by this camera okay so let's run the game just for testing and our green dots should no longer appear yet there you go this is our main camera and the game object on the minimap icon no longer appears okay so now let's make our minimap camera so let's go into the main camera and duplicate it let's call this minimap camera first let's remove the main camera so just set this to untagged and now for the culling mask this one will simply display the minima so it's not like nothing and then only the minimum as you can see on the preview we can see our minimap icon let's make it a child of the main camera so they always have the same position and for depth let's put it on zero which is above the main camera so let's test and see what happens you can see the player position displayed on our minimap camera and it's moving around as I move okay great so we now have two cameras displaying two specific scenes now obviously we don't want the minimap to hide our main camera we want it to be displayed in the corner of this screen so for now we're going to use a render texture so let's go into our project files and here let's right click and create a new render texture down here okay let's call it minimap render texture in here let's give it a size of 512 by 512 so the minimum up isn't very pixelated and let's drag it onto our minimap camera so this is the camera in here you have a target texture that we can select a render texture and let's drag it into there okay so now let's run the scene and we should be seeing the same as previously yep exactly and if we pause and check out the render texture yep there you go it is displaying what the minimap camera is seeing okay great now we want to display this very texture on our yuan so let's go to our UI canvas I have it set up in here and let's make an empty game object let's call it minimum render texture and here we're going to add a raw image component we must use the raw image instead of the image component because the image component takes a sprite and what we have here is a texture so using the raw image we can simply drag our texture onto it let's see where that image is being displayed and here's our UI okay let's move it to the side and make it a bit bigger so 200 by 200 and as you can see it is transparent which is probably not what we want so what's going to our minimap and set the background sound color to a dark grey for alpha okay there you go there's a square so let's test and yep there you go here's my player and in there we have a minimap view the player is moving and as you can see it moves exactly the same okay great now before we add icons to the other elements let's make this look a bit better since this is a UI image we can easily apply a mask and make it look quite a bit better so in here let's first make a container game object for our minimap window and let's drag our render texture onto it now let's add another UI image this won't be for our masks so add the mask component and let's add a circle mask and hide the mask graphic okay now our minimap is circular and let's set a border on top of it okay so here we have a circular minimap with a nice border on top of it so let's run the code and see how it looks yep there's our minimap it works and now it is circular and has a nice looking border okay great now let's finally add some icons to our other elements so for the building and I have the buildings placed as a prefab so in here I can simply add another sprite to the object a sprite let's call it mini map icon again give it the layer of mini map and for the buildings let's put a a Blue Square okay check out the icon and make it quite a bit bigger okay so now all the buildings have a square for their mini map icon and for the enemy icon again I have the enemy prefab in here so let's add another sprite for our mini map icon again place a layer on minimap and for the sprite again we don't need to use basic shapes we can use any sprite so let's use the enemy icon sprite and just for fun for the flying dead body let's also add icon all right so let's run the game and see if all of our icons are correctly displayed okay there's the player and if I go there yep there's an enemy right next to me and a building in there and now if I hit the enemy the icon should change yep there you go it shows the other icon now what you might notice that it's not very correct is simply the size of our minimap usually the minimap shows more than what you see in the main camera so we need to deal with that and for that let us simply go into our minimap camera and simply set the orthographic size to be larger so let's say instead of 70 which is what is on the main camera let's put it on 200 okay there you go we can now see a much bigger area using our minimap but as you can see the icons are now very time essentially they have to be scaled relative to the zoom on our minimap camera all right I have resized the icons and now as you can see the minimap is much more visible now we can see all the icons and we can view a larger area so there you have it we create a very simple minimap that displays all the icons that we want to show in the next video we're going to create a few scripts to make the whole minimap system very easy to use as always you can download the project files and utilities from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
