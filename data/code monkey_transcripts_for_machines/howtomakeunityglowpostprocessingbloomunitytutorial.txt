hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here this is a really quick video on how to add glow to your scenes in unity i get this question pretty much at least once whenever i make a video with a glow effect like recently i made the third person shooter where i added a really nice glow effect to make the final one really nicely polished adding that is super simple it just requires a few steps so let's see them in this quick video here's a checklist of everything you need to do so let's go through them one by one now the first thing you need is a shader with some emission and obviously you need an object so let's just create a new sphere okay now just making material for it and now here for the material i'm using urp so i'm using the default urp and lit shader and with this one you've got down here a film for the emission so if you click on this you can enable a mission and then if you want optionally you can use an emission map to only emit from certain areas but if you'll leave it as known then the whole object will be emissive so just click on the color and over here set to something also like for example in orange and then down here you can see you've got the red green blue but then also in intensity so this one is just how intense the color is so you can click on these buttons or just manually modify it so let's put it maybe something like three okay so the sphere has the color with some intensity it's got some emission but over here in the scene view it is still not glowing so the next thing that we need is post processing so make a new game object and here let's add a component and we're going to add a volume component then just make a new post processing profile then add the override and the effect that we need to add is over here the bloom and the two main ones that you need to modify here are the threshold and intensity so make sure the intensity is more than zero so this set but again we still don't see any glow so the next step is on the render pipeline object so if i go up here into edit project settings and on the graphics i'm using this render pipeline object again i'm using urp so on this object down here you've got the pipeline asset and over here under quality we do see a field for hdr where we can enable this so you need to enable this in order for the intensity of that collar to be actually used and as soon as you enable yep you do see some glow here and just in case you don't then up here on the scene window there's this little button so this enables our disables effects so make sure this one is enabled make sure post processing is enabled okay so with that yep we do see the object glowing in the scene view however in the game view nope still no glow so the next step is to go over here on the camera and then under rendering you've got a field for post processing and you just need to enable this so you do that and yep the object is now correctly glowing awesome all right so now you can play around all these parameters so for example on the glow you can set this to any color so pure white maybe a green maybe a blue and so on one quick note here emission does not work with black so keep that in mind you cannot have a black glow and then on the post crossing on the bloom over here you can modify the threshold so this is how intense the column needs to be in order for the bloom effect to be applied so for example i set the intensity of three so if i grow this above three then all of a sudden there's no glow because three is not enough to trigger the one effect so usually you want this one to be on one or if you want maybe even less than one to get the whole thing glowing so for example these stars down here if i put it on one they're not glowing but if i put on something like 0.1 then now pretty much everything on the scene is now glowing and then the intensity pretty much acts like a multiplier on things so without modifying each material you can modify the entire glow of the entire scene and also this works both on 3d shaders as well as sprite shaders so over here for example is my sprite online shader that i made in another tutorial so here is the shader and shadow graph and it simply takes the outline color and simply adds it on top of the other colors and that applies some emission and yep it works just like the other one so here is the glow effect working on a sprite and a 3d mesh alright so that's it as you can see it's super simple here is the checklist again if you have any issues make sure you follow all these steps so make sure you have emission enabled and you're using an emission collar other than black then make sure the intensity is more than zero after that make sure you have volume post processing and make sure the threshold and intensity are set correctly then on the camera make sure post processing is enabled and on the render pipeline make sure hdr is enabled follow those steps and your object won't glow alright hope that's useful check out
