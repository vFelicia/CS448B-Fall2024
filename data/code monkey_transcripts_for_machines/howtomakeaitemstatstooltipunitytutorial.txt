hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're considering to make a tool tip in unity we're going to take our tool tip and create a item stats window with various text fields and images let's begin so over here is the tooltip we have done so far it is great for displaying simple text to the player like the description of what each button does and extra information on each field as you can see it follows the mouse and we can update it in real time now in this video we want to reuse some of the code from distal tip to create a complex tone tip to shostats of these items in here so let's start off by making the complex tooltip in the editor we're going to duplicate our original tooltip comedy tooltip item so the first thing we need is a label for our name then we're also going to have a description of each item now we're going to position it going under the mouse so our tooltip is anchored on the lower left side and now for this one let's anchor it on the upper left side all right so this is the layout we're going with we have an item name then we have an atom description a image for the item and a bunch of stats that won't be different between each item okay so with our total created in the editor now let's take care of our class in order to do it we're going to start off by duplicating the total class that way we can reuse some code okay so we now have this class and now in here the code that we can reuse is the code for following the mouse and to make sure it does not leave the screen the whole difference here is our tool tip was anchored on the lower left side and now we are anchoring on the upper left side so in here instead of anchor position y plus we do a minus so just like that we should have our item stats tooltip correctly following the mouse now in the awake let's grab the reference to the various text fields okay so these are the various fields we have we have the name description and the various stats we no longer need to update in real time so we can remove this and on our show tooltip let's start off by making one where we only show the item name so start off things very simple in here we just set the name text text to be the item name okay we're not going to resize the background and here make the static version of this function which is just like this okay so our tooltip should be working for changing the item name so we can now go into the window in order to test this is the window that I have set up for testing it is a very basic window it just has some buttons which function and examine like these ones and on each button I have a simple component that contains the information out of each item this is the component that contains the information from each item it has a sprite a name description and these stats some script on the window let's first test it by using the tooltip item stats and add a tooltip let's add it to the first button and just say test item name okay so I see if our custom complex tooltip shows up when we pass the mouse over the first button okay here's the scene and there's the own tooltip still working perfectly fine and now when we pass the first button yep there you go there's our new complex tooltip being shown you can see that it has the test item name it has the layout we set and everything is working correctly all right so now obviously let's fill up the rest of the fields so we're going to change our show tooltip function now in here we need let's first receive a sprite for each item sprite then we get the item name then a string for the item description and then in for the stats so in here let's set all of our fields where's the name text and the description text okay so we now have our function receiving all the information that it needs so let's just update our static function and just like that our tooltip is now receiving all the information it needs so now let's go into the window items and again here in the editor just for testing I've had the item info component which contains all these fields so let's grab this for each button okay so we are cycling through our six buttons we grab the item info that is attached as a component to each of them and we add the tooltip onto that button using that items info all right so let's see if all of them are correctly showing their info okay so here we are and again the old tooltip still works perfectly fine and now when I pass over in item yep there you go there's all of these stats of each item being correctly updated it has an item name a description a image and the various stats none of them are dating correctly so as you can see we've reused the code to follow the mouse and keep the window on the screen which allowed this to make this complex relative very quickly and as you can see all the elements of the dynamic tooltip were created very simply so we could easily swap out the stats for bars instead of showing numbers so there you have it we took some code from our normal tooltip and made a complex item tooltips with multiple fields and images as always you can download the project files in utilities from unity code monkey comp if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
