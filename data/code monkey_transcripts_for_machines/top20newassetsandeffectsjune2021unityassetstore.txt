hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset store is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights that were released in may 2021 just watching some assets is enough to fire up my imagination i can instantly picture all the kind of games that i could build with them this one is a list of paid assets and effects i've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and the best tools and systems go watch those if you haven't seen them yet let me know which ones of these you're most interested in i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the assets in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order and by the way check out my own assets on store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your game and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out i'm currently working on converting more videos into pro systems so stay tuned for that alright so starting off with the latest cinti package the polygon street racer cynthia assets are always awesome and this one is a great package for a racing game it's got over a thousand detailed prefabs all of them fully customizable vehicles with openable doors hoods and trunks you've got tons of vehicle attachments which would be perfect for any kind of tuning game then if you're in need of some particles here is stylized projectiles too it's a pack with 10 unique projectiles hit effects and muscle effects they all look really great everything from simple fire projectiles to some really fantastic home race or maybe you need some animations if so here is a huge collection it's got over a thousand animations starting with some basic locomotion some barehanded combat melee weapons or tons of guns like an assault rifle or a minigun you can even check out all the animations in a webgl page they also say they won't be adding more animations over time which is always a great thing if you want a nice lowpoly city here's one it's a prevaried environment it's got city streets some restaurants some coffee shops it's got a basketball court a gas station and tons of vehicles and props all of it in a nice low poly style and all of it made using a single texture for some ui here is a scifi kit really nice clean icons with some weapons ammo resources tools and more it's even got some higher detail icons for some vehicles weapons and gold and obviously tons and tons of ui elements everything from simple buttons and sliders a bunch of health bars and everything you need in order to make a really nice clean interface then this really awesome one it's a human anatomy model so it's a skeleton then muscles and a bunch of skin it is super detailed with 2k or 4k textures and thousands of triangles now one thing that i've wanted to do for a while is research and make a video on how to make the awesome xray effects that you see in games like sniper elite and mortal kombat and an asset like this one is perfect for exactly that so i might pick this one up soon next up the fantasy potions editor really nice and simple asset pack for making an infinite variety of potions so if your game involves potions of any kind you can pretty much make all of them with just this one asset and over here is a low poly racing pack what caught my eye right away are the specific cars in this package if you look at it you might actually recognize and see that tons of them are from the fast and furious movies so you've got brian's gtr you've got the super famous supra hans rx7 dom's charger and so on so if you wanted to make a fast and furious inspired game then maybe look into this pack or maybe you want just one vehicle but insanely detailed if so check out this pickup truck extremely detailed model with almost a hundred thousand polygons it looks insanely detailed using some really high quality 4k textures if you're working on a pixel art game and you need some icons check out this pack it's pretty cheap and contains over 2 000 unique items you've got tons and tons of variety so lots of fish and sea creatures a bunch of potions insects and weapons and all of them in a nice 32 by 32 sprites if your game is a realistic modern military here is a gorgeous looking p90 it's always such a unique looking weapon it comes with a whole bunch of skins and if you like this style then this dev has a ton more unique weapons do you need a bunch of fire effects if so here's a bunch of stylized effects of them great looking and very cartoony you've got some normal fires some explosions a bunch of smoke and a flamethrower all of them simple and look great or maybe you're working on a sea based rts or a trading game here's a ton of ships and a bunch of sea props you've got some tiny ships you've got submarines and some really massive vessels also includes two extra assets from this dev from some other packages you've got an aircraft and a tank maybe you can get them all and make a complete command conquer rts if you're tired of combat check out this warehouse pack sounds like it would be fun for making a sort of logistics game you've got over a hundred prefabs included a bunch of boxes a modular building some vehicles like a forklift and a stacker all in a really nice and inviting low quality art style are you working on a sort of survival game then check out this desolate desert it's in low quality style you've got some nice cacti and a bunch of rocks also some simple bushes and trees and all of it nice and mobile friendly then here's a great moba pack it's the standard moba map so you've got three lanes and a bunch of jungle you've got a couple of towers and tons of minions to fight so if you've got a mobile prototype that you'd like to try out then you can use this to get it very quickly up and running if you need some particles for your mobas then here's a bunch of them almost 200 different effects you've got lots of fantasy particles projectiles explosions fire and so on whatever skills you need to add to your game i'm sure you find the right particles for it maybe you want a bunch of dogs here's a nice pack features 14 breeds of dogs all of them with 74 animations so maybe this is perfect for adding a nice companion into your games they are all pretty realistic but this dev also has another pack with more cartoony art style if that fits your game better for making a side scroller over here is a hand painted village it's really nice and inviting composed of tons of parts so you can easily build endless variations and it also includes sprite shape profiles so you can make some really nice curved shapes and if you're working on a game with some progression here are some nice fantasy game ranks includes 20 premade ranks
