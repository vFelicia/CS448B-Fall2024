hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and for the past few weeks I've been working on a printense project essentially it's a complete full length very high quality course that I will upload as a free video here on YouTube the file name for the massive course script is called multiplayer free course not text that was the original intention to make a quick simple twohour free course on just multiplayer but then I thought people might be confused because even a simple game would require people to learn the code base in order to learn how to convert it into multiplayer and it's also been quite a long time since I made a really detailed video targeted at beginners so I end up with a plan of making a phone course length video on making a game and then a second course line video on making it multiplier it looks like the single player portion won't be about 6 hours long and the multiplayer maybe three or four hours so in total about 10 hours of free learning with the same level of quality as my paid courses the gaming question is something like overcooked so there's a character there's some kitchen counters and there's a bunch of interactions like picking up ingredients preparing them by cooking and cutting them placing them in plates and delivering them now I need your help and the way that you can help me is pretty simple when the video eventually comes out just go ahead and click on video as soon as you see it hit the like button and watch the video that's really it if you do just that you won't be helping me quite a lot basically I'm putting in a ton of work into making this a really awesome tutorial that is useful for both beginners and more advanced users I do think the funnel video will be really awesome like I said it's on the same level of quality as my paid courses it has a heavy focus on writing good clean code some good project structure and good organization I will not be teaching bad practices that you see in so many beginners tutorials instead I will teach you how to write good high quality production ready code just like I use in my own Steam games since I'm making it a free video instead of a paid course I would at least like for it to reach tons of people YouTube's main metrics are clickthrough rate watch time and interactions so if a bunch of you click on the video watch it and like it then YouTube will hopefully promote the video and it will help tons of people that's really it now I'm still working on the course so not exactly sure on timing I'm hoping by somewhere in the middle of January I will make another video asking for your help just before the video goes live remember that on the website on your account if you want you can set it to receive emails you can can get notified for every video once a week or once a month it's up to you so whether you're a beginner or a more advanced user if you've ever wanted to see how I build my own games with some high quality code then definitely stay tuned I even hired an artist to make some 3D models that I can then distribute so you won't be able to download the free ads and follow along thank you to all of you who have ever picked up one of my courses or bought one of my film links it's really only because of you that I can afford to dedicate all this time and effort making a really awesome high quality course that I won't release completely for free I really love the concept of only charging for a few things I do and giving most of it away for free I truly think that education should be free for anyone who wants to learn and thankfully as long as some of you do those things I can afford to do this speaking of affiliate links there's a bunch of interesting deals happening right now so if you need any assets tools or sounds you can get them with a nice discount and I get a nice commission there's four excellent humble bundles and a sale on the NTS store the bundles are extremely deep discounts as usual they're 98 off so if just one thing looks interesting then the entire bundle is more than worth it there's a bundle on a bunch of low poly visuals by Blink really great publisher with some great looking low poly assets there's the tools bundle that is actually repeat so if you missed it back then definitely don't miss it now same thing for the art bundle also repeat also excellent and there's one with a bunch of audio sound and assets these humble bundles actually have a pretty high commission rate by default I get 15 so for example if you get this tools bundle through my link in the description if you do then you pay the normal bundle price 30 bucks and I get to keep 450. then the unts store is also having a New Year sale as usual of the top ads at Half Price oh and also stay tuned for the video coming out this Monday it's a new year so it won't be a really fun summary of 22 covering all the interesting tutorials and videos that I made as well as a bunch from some other entry creators alright so once again thank you all for all of your support and watching the videos I genuinely hope that watching this channel has helped you on your own gamedev Journey stay tuned for that really awesome free course and I'll see you next time
