hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here's your chance to make a game and have it be playable on a real physical lego store the lego team has actually been working with ent for quite a while now i covered the lego micro game when that came out and they have kept updating it and right now they have a contest running which is very interesting the goal is to make a game focused on just one button so that by itself is a pretty interesting limitation that will certainly lead to some very creative designs maybe just a single tap means jump maybe a double tap means a special attack maybe a hold means a special ability or maybe one tab just means doing one thing so a game like flappy bird or some of those block building games so it seems quite limiting but you can still do quite a lot of interesting ideas with that limitation and the winner will actually be playable on real physical lego stores in a really nice arcade cabinet and on top of that there's even more prizes you can win lego sets a unt pro license and two hundred dollars for the asses or the contest ends in november so you have a couple of ways to build something really interesting in total there's three categories you can make a game with the ninjago theme to help you with that there's a free addon with lego ninjago assets the other category is any theme of your choice the only limitation is really no thirdparty ips and the final last category is build something solely with lego behavior breaks and no additional scripting if you haven't tried the lego micro game the behavior breaks are individual bricks where each does just a bit of simple logic like for example one of them moves a platform left and right another one fires bullets another one looks at an object and so on when i checked out the lego micro game quite a while ago that feature was definitely the most interesting part so those are the three categories you can participate in in order to open up the unlike micro game it's very simple you just open up unity hub then you're going to create a new project now for this one make sure you are using 2020.3 lts so if you have multiple versions click on the arrow and select 20.3 then down here just wait for it to unload the list of all of the available templates and when that happens you should be able to see the lego micro game so just select that give it a name and hit on create and up here is in lego micro game now if you want you can go through the micro game tournaments these are pretty nice it's a guided path showing you how unity works and how this specific micro game works so if you are a yinty beginner i would definitely recommend you get started with those tutorials or even if you're a more advanced user it can still be helpful to go through these to learn all the specific things on this micro game like the brick system the behavior breaks and so on and in this project there's also tons and tons of scenes so lots of demos to see how everything works for example here is the sandbox scene so just by itself we can already see quite a lot of behaviors over here so here's a really nice chat box saying a bunch of text then over here you've got a button you can interact with you can press it and do a bunch of things and there you go it spawns a nice little character and over there a vertical platform then something you can touch to trigger some logic then something firing some bullets another elevator you can interact with so as you can see tons of things and all of these they are primarily working based on the behavior bricks so i don't think there's any custom c sharp written in this scene at all as you can see just with those behavior breaks you can already do quite a lot of things then there's a bunch more demo scenes with some interesting minigames so in this one there's a nice little lego panda constantly firing some weapons and the weapons destroy the things and i gotta pick up these fruits there you go lots of interesting interaction so using the behavior bricks essentially the bullets destroy the whole thing then they spawn that so really nice and on this one by touching these platforms you can move over there how the cannon rotates and by going here boom you can fire a bullet and try to hit something so again this whole thing is all running just on these really interesting behavior bricks then there's a bunch more demo scenes and of course the online tutorial which you can follow the guided tutorials alright so just by looking at these you can already see how this micro game is actually quite capable of building tons of unique scenarios the project includes tons of lego bricks for you to use to build anything so if you go inside prefabs lego models and over here some brick collections so there you go tons of them so then using the lego system you can click you can grab one of these then just connect them directly down then grab this one click on that one so as you can see this has a really nice building system so very quickly you can build some legos make something look really interesting but on top of that you can also import some even more custom objects lego has an official program called bricklink studio in there you can create your own objects using official lego bricks so you can really build anything that you could build using real lego bricks and then you can export that model and import it into unity there's a tutorial over here on until learn showing you through the home process okay so that's the lego contest running right now it ends in november so you have a couple of weeks to build something really interesting pick a category build something and who knows maybe you win and your game will be playable on a real lego store that would be pretty exciting to go to your local lego store and play your own game on a real nice arcade it's definitely a very unique reward so if you're interested definitely go ahead and participate alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
