hello and welcome I'm your code monkey min this video we're going to view a summary of the series modular spreadsheets as used for guests in barrel around tycoon let's begin so the goal in this series is to create a modular spreadsheet so we can have near infinite variations this technique is used in banaram Tycoon for making each guest look unique in the end we won't have a very unique guest as well as the ability to save and load the same spreadsheet in the first video we're going to see how the base fried sheet is setup where each body part goes and how they're used we're going to learn how to read a texture in code and copy pixels in doing so we're going to do a simple composition of the final spreadsheet by selecting several personal heads and bodies then with the knowledge of simple copy/paste of pixels we won't compose the head sprite from various hair and beards so we won't have a texture with just an empty head along with a texture containing multiple beards and another one with various hairstyles through code we will pick a random beard and random hair sound and compose all three elements into the final spreadsheet with that we will then look into Harriton individual pixels we will learn how we can get multiple hair colors by using a base white texture and tinting it with a specific color that way we add a lot more variation while still using the same base beard and hair styles then using the same strategy we will modify the skin color so taking a white texture of the face we will apply a tint however we do not want to tend the eye so we will learn how to apply a tint but only went inside a mask texture after that we won't take what we learn to apply a primary and secondary body color we will then set up the base body texture to have some preset colored parts and some white parts that won't be tinted then we will use a mask texture which won't contain the information for where to apply the primary and secondary colors so with all of those parameters we will have pretty much infinite amount of variation for our guest sprites the last thing we'll need is some way to save and load so we won't create a class to hold all the various parameters that make up a specific spreadsheet like the hair index and skin color then we will use Jason as our simple file format to save and load the exact same spreadsheet every time so that's the plan for the modular spreadsheet series you can pick up the game on seam to see the guest variation in action this series will teach you all you need to know to textures with code so you can compose your own spreadsheets in any way you want so go watch the playlist and begin learning right now as always you can download the project files inventories for each video in the series from unity code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time you
