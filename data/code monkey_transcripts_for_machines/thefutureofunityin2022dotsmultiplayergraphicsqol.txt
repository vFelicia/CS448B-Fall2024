hello and welcome i'm your code monkey gdc was a while ago and there were a bunch of interesting talks but they were not live streamed on their twitch channel however right now you can find them all in a playlist on the unity channel i'm watching all the talks right now there's quite a bunch of interesting things going more indepth into various projects they announced recently and of course the talk most people really wanted to see was the roadmap tonk so here's my quick summary of it basically it's exactly what people have been asking for lots of quality of life improvements various performance and stability update and just general incremental updates so nothing too earthshattering but all the things they have in progress are getting better and better honestly watching this talk my biggest takeaway is really just how much stuff unity does there's so many topics so many use cases and so many teams working on tons of different things for me i just make single player 3d games on my pc using urp and the latest lts version but unity also supports 2d multiplayer hdrp it has editor tools vfx graph shadowgraph terrains mobile consoles raytracing dots profiler vr ar and tons tons more things keeping up with all of those tools is actually one of the reasons why i decided to make my ultimate unity overview course in there i go through all of the dozens of unity tools and features to see what they do and how they work there's already over 15 lectures available in that course but unity has even more that i haven't covered yet so i plan to continue free updates for that course for a long time so here let's look at some quick highlights from the road map tonk but before that this video was sponsored by gamedevguild this is an online conference all about unity game development organized by jason wyman the talks are presented by various unity experts on all kinds of topics so you can learn about performance getting a job in the games industry or going fulltime indie learn about vr multiplayer blend shapes game audio and tons more you'll also have a chance to ask questions live and even win some awesome stuff the conference is running from may 24 to 26 and there will be recordings after click the link in the description and register today okay so the road map talks started off once again emphasizing the difference between the lts and the tech versions actually made a video on this topic and it's one of my most watched videos it can definitely be quite confusing if you just started using unity but after a 30 second summary it becomes super clear how the versions work and just as i was recording this version 21 lts has just been published ideally you should be using the lts version in your projects it's the most stable one but if you want to see the cutting edge tools that unity is developing then those are on the 22 version so then they talked about what were their core pillars for the 21 version making sure unity has good workflows for everyone regardless of your area of expertise so making sure both hardcore programmers and designers can work together flawlessly this was primarily by making visual scripting a builtin tool rather than an extra addon this one was a great addition to the engine and speaking of that just another quick plug if you want to learn about visual scripting you can check out my complete course where i make three unique games all entirely using visual scripting there's not a single line of code anywhere in any of those games so that course really showcases just how capable visual scripting is the course was made with bolt which was the original tool that they bought and then renamed into visual scripting which is now built directly into the engine but 99 of it works exactly the same as in unity 2021 there's only been a handful of changes which i also covered in another video so that one was the big focus in 21 better workflows visual scripting and then also improved acid importing and a bunch more quality of life improvements the other core pillar was faster to quality this includes adding feature sets which automatically install a bunch of packages related to what you want to do much faster to get up and running there were also search improvements to quick search in order to make finding things much faster the profiler was also improved as well as testing with the device simulator then urp and agrp continue getting lots of improvements those improvements are present in the 22 and in the 21 version and more and more platform support so by now unity truly runs on anything you can make a build for ps5 a xbox series x and s and even for apple silicon so those were some of the additions and improvements to the 21 version which has just hit lts for me i always stick with lts so i've been using version 2020 lts in all my projects for the past year so it's going to be nice to finally do an upgrade and look at all these new features then was the part about the 22 tech stream quite a lot of things they're working on right now tons of teams working in parallel their main pillars for this release are these ones improved workflows and productivity again just making everything smoother and easier to use with better and better iteration time then also editor customization with the ui toolkit so helping you make better tools to make better games faster visuals that scale on anything so making a gorgeous mail on mobile or pc or webgl also improvements to game performance the plan with version 22 is to get dots to 1.0 by the time the 22lts version is out so if so that should be awesome another great one is the multiplayer foundation their netcode for gameobjects is progressing really nicely so it's hopefully out of preview soon and more and more platform optimizations again making sure that unity games run on any device you want so looking at these pillars i would say they definitely have the right goals in mind if they achieve all of this in this year then version 22 will definitely be epic then they dive a bit deeper into all of these topics i'm just going to briefly go through all of them if you want to watch the full video it's still in the description and in that same playlist you also find dedicated videos to some of these things there's a bunch of talks talking about dots one talking about the enemy cgi another one about the giga project and so on so definitely check out that playlist after watching this video okay so first up there are improvements to the package manager especially for more large teams better compiler performance and net standard 2.1 apis also more search improvements and the ability to use api endpoints to make custom search windows faster acid importing play mode compilation build serialization and more so lots of tiny things to make iteration much faster much better one big area of continued improvement is the ui toolkit making it suitable for building editor tools as well as ingame ui now for this one i'm very interested in having just one tool set for both those use cases will definitely be hugely helpful but at the same time this one is also quite confusing to me i still cannot quite understand what is the state of ui tonkit i thought it was still in preview but upon searching some more apparently the latest package says that it's in preview however the reason why that one is stuck in preview is because it is now built into the engine itself i think that's the case i'm not 100 sure but if that is the case then in the 21 lts ui toolkit is now production ready for editor tools just not for ingame ui so if i'm correct about that and someone from unity is watching this then i would ask to add some sort of note on the ui toolkit package it's the first thing that comes up on google and looking at the change log there's no mention of anything so it makes it seem like it's in a ben package but it's obviously not it's now apparently built directly into the engine so that package is no longer used so i'm still a bit confused with ui tonkit but anyway sorry about that engine i'm looking forward to using just a single tool for building both ui and editor windows i think that's going to be great continuing with the 21 road map there were more improvements to both urp and agrp they also mentioned giga this is the project they're currently working on visually it looks really awesome and it's all made in urp basically they have a team using european production and then giving their feedback back to the dev team so everyone benefits also one nice addition is custom post pressing effects right now that's not really something you can do easily i did do a video on one way that you can do that so i did some research and i found a way on how you can make custom post rusting effects but it's quite a bit of a hack so having some proper support is definitely great then on hrp again some more continued improvements and again they also have a team actively using the tool and giving their feedback to the dev team you've probably seen the enemy's short film it's truly impressive gorgeous graphics and the most impressive of all is exactly this everything that you see there is running on a vanilla version of the engine previous demos like adam and the heretic those were gorgeous but in order to work those had tons of custom code to make it look so good however this time of the improvements they are making to get to this level of quality all of those improvements are available to anyone using agrp so no custom code everyone benefits then some more improvements to shadowgraph and vfx graph i haven't actually used them in quite a while i haven't made any special effects in quite some time but improvements are always great something really awesome in version 22 is the spline tool if you need a spline right now i actually made a video where i built a nice class and went through how all of the math works and there's also a bunch of awesome spline tools free on the acid store but still it's really nice to have a builtin tool then there are a bunch more terrain improvements also a bunch of lighting improvements and of course unity is both a 3d and a 2d engine so lots of continued improvements coming to 2d there's a better faster sprite atlas improvements to the physics also lots of animation improvements specifically for authoring 2d animations directly inside unity and specifically for using 2d bones they highlighted their own dragon crashes demo i looked at this one when it came out it's really awesome it's a great showcase of all the awesome 2d tools that unity has and then something small but really awesome are the new templates right now if you go into unity hub and you sunlight version 22 you can actually see the templates previously you only had an empty one with the builtin renderer and then you had the urp and hdrp samples so if you wanted a empty project with the 2d tools you had to create an empty project using the builtin renderer then manually install urp then manually make the 2d render and so on whereas now you just have all of these various templates so you have the 2d empty template and when do it simply automatically installs all of the packages you need to make 2d then also a really nice 3d empty agrp and urp templates again just some nice simple quality of life improvements to make your life easier and starting projects much faster there were also more profiling improvements especially for analyzing memory really useful considering how garbage is always a problem i haven't used the profiler much since i launched my last steam game which was almost 3 years now but it's always nice to see it continuing to improve when working on demos and quick prototypes the pro tap isn't really necessary but it's definitely an absolute must when working on a proper big project then of course one of the biggest things for version 22 is dots the massive update to 0.5 has just released and the plan is to hit 1.0 during the 22 lts personally i'm really excited about that i can't wait to see all of the new games that this tech will enable in the coming years something that a lot of people are always asking me for tutorials about is multiplayer a while ago unity bought the ml api and they've been working on it under the new name netcode for game objects for me i'm just waiting for it to come out of preview and when it does i'm definitely going to do tons of tutorials on it there's already a sample game for this one so if you're interested definitely go ahead download it and look at how it works and speaking of netcode dotsnetcode is also in development those two are different tools then also a bunch of platform improvements some things from mobile i don't really do much in mobile development so i'm not sure how significant any of these are for desktop and console there's support for apple silicon which is nice there's the linux editor and some webgl improvements also ray tracing for ps5 and apparently xbox coming soon and of course unity also does both ar and vr there's quite a bunch of improvements on there verified support for openxr basic interactions toolkit and more alright and that's the roadmap as you can see tons of improvements in tons of different areas nothing too earth shattering just lots of improvements across the board if you want more detail definitely go watch the whole tank but more than that go check out all the gdc videos in the playlist i'm watching them all right now and there's quite a lot of interesting stuff there you can learn more about kikaya about the enemies demo you can learn about unity gaming services the trends for gaming in the future and so on so lots of interesting info and with this my takeaway for the int roadmap tonk is that unity is currently great in the present and the future looks great too so if they managed to do all these things this year then version 22 lts will definitely be epic and as some of these things start to come out of preview like for example netcode for game objects dui toolkit ui builder and so on as those have their full release you can definitely expect that i'll be doing quite a lot of tutorials on all of those and of course like i previously mentioned i will continue making tons of updates explaining tons of these tools and features for my ultimate unity overview course alright so that's the unity roadmap for 22 lots of exciting things coming up in the future and don't forget to check out game dev guild to learn from unity experts click the link and register
