hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights that were released in july of 2021. this is the list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered the best free new assets so go check that if you haven't seen it yet and in the next video i will be covering the top assets and effects let me know which ones of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order and by the way right now there's a mega bundle happening it's a massive discount at 95 percent off it's pretty nice in terms of variety lots of systems props particles and sounds these bundles are always great value if just one of these assets interests you then the home bundle is worth it check the link in the description to see it and by the way check out my own assets on the store so far i've made the free key door system which is a super simple way to add keys and doors to your games and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create some custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out i'm currently working on converting more videos into pro systems so stay tuned for that alright so starting off with one that is possibly extremely useful the low poly mesh generator so one of the issues with picking up thirdparty assets is making them all look like they fit together that's when the reasons why i like the low poly style it's very consistent but there's also a ton of realistic assets that would possibly work great with your game but they don't fit within low poly style so that's where this acid comes in you take a highend mesh and it generates a lowpoly mesh meaning that you can use all of the highend realistic models that you already have and use them in a low poly game while keeping the look of the game very consistent this really seems like an excellent tool i never thought about this approach as an option so i'm very interested in checking this one out then if you want to highlight some parts of your models here is bone zones easily split your model into various zones so very good for making some weak points on your enemies or maybe you add some dismemberment mechanics kind of like that space based on the video it seems like it works very well you can make as many areas as you need and use them to make some interesting mechanics if you're working on a game with vehicles check out this simple live recreator start with a blank canvas and paint all the details change the base color add a bunch of decals on top really build something nice it comes with two vehicles and over 75 stickers vectors and shapes it works on those vehicles but really it can work on any mesh from what i can tell this is running when you play the game meaning that you can include this tool in your game in order to let the players create their own libraries and in combination with the previous asset here is the mobile drift physics also from the same developer it's a drift physics system uses to quickly get a racing drifting game working naturally it includes all the mobile controls also has a very detailed documentation explaining all the components these types of systems are all about feel so thankfully they have a demo on the page that you can try before you buy if instead you're interested in physics puzzle platformers here's a great starting pack this is very much similar to games like gangbeast or human fall flat it's a fully featured fully working framework so this is perfect for picking it apart and seeing how it all works everything is of course using physics so it leads to some very wacky gameplay lots of boxes and buttons to push you can grab a home to something and rappel down use the elevator or grab some planks if you are interested in this genre definitely study this one then here's a really interesting one for a level design the procedural generation grid it's a very powerful tool for automating level creation you define a whole bunch of rules a whole bunch of assets and then the algorithm designs where to place all the objects looking at the video the results are pretty great i wouldn't say that those levels were procedurally generated don't look very natural you can use it internally without writing any code or if you want you can also use code to create some unique raw notes it works for both generating objects and edit time as well as during play mode so this is one of those things that if you put in the time to learn this tool i can see it being a massive time saver also this one is currently in beta which is actually great because it means that the current price is already 50 off the final price so if you're interested get it quick up next here is lean texture plus this is a tool for doing just about anything to do with textures it features channel packing seamless texture conversion normal map generation edge coloring really tons and tons of actions you can take on just about any texture this looks like a great tool so you can use textures that you get from various asset packs and make them fit into your games and it also has a bunch of effects like tint blur pixelate and more it works both in the editor as well as in game there's also a free version you can try out so it's a really interesting tool i'd love to try this one out then for something very niche and very interesting the face recognition system you give it the image of a face then an image with a lot of faces and it recognizes that one face it works offline so there's no connection required to any external server like i said this is a very niche tool i'm guessing maybe this might be very useful when working on some ar games or perhaps just for building some tool within unity always remember that unity isn't just for making games you can build anything this one also has a free version you can try out and up next here is orvis dot strains in last month's video i highlighted a dots character controller and now here we have a terrain like i said back then it's great that there's a bunch of dots still starting to come out this one is all about terrain which is perfect for that it lets you create some massive insanely detailed terrains since dots is insanely fast you can easily modify terrain during run time it all runs on jobs so it never blocks the main thread vegetation is streamed in and out based on the camera position and it also includes a floating origin system so you can build some insanely massive worlds works on both flat terrain as well as some spherical terrains it's a real impressive asset again just like the other one this one can be a great tool to learn from you can get it and inspect the source code to see how it all works and then we have the leaning animator it does exactly what it says adds some leaning to your animations to add that extra bit of polish it's subtle but it definitely makes a difference worse for leaning to the sides while running in circles but also for making the character appear much more natural when going up or down the rims features a custom inspector to really make it super easy to use if you're in the polished stage of your game definitely look into this one alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unity asset store for july of 2021 there's links to all in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order check the phone playlist to see some more lists with free and paid assets and let me know if you pick up any of these and what you intend to do with them also check out my own free and paid assets on the store alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
