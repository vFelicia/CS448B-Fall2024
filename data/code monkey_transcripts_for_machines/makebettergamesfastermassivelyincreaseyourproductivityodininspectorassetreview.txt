hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this is the odin inspector it's one of the very best tools you can get to enhance your workflow in unity and help you make better games even faster this video is played in two parts first let's look at some of the demos to see what the asset can do and how they work and then after that i'll do a stepbystep guide on how to start using it and add it to your own games check out the entire playlist where i highlight great assets to help you make your games awesome and as always there's a link to the asset in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order so odin inspector it's one of the highest rated assets on the assets or and for a very good reason this is one of those tools that if you use it right it can have a drastic improvement in your productivity and of course the more productive you are the less time it takes you to make your game which lowers your cost which in turn makes it easier to achieve profitability so definitely don't underestimate the power of good tools to help you work better unity is an extremely powerful engine not just for making games but also for building tools for making those games the unity editor is extremely customizable i've already covered how you can create custom editor windows with fancy buttons and so on if you put in the time you can definitely do some amazing things however the issue is that whole process is extremely laborious with tons of boilerplate code that you need to write in order to get just a single custom thing showing for me the most complex custom editor i made was probably the one for the crafting system just some buttons and object references positioned in a specific way and even though it's simple it still took a lot of work to make so writing custom unity editors is extremely powerful but not easy to use at all that's where odin inspector comes in it makes that process extremely painless and super easy to use being able to easily build tools is one of those things that can make or break your productivity which in turn can be the deciding factor between making profitable or unprofitable games one huge difference is how when making custom editors you need to create a separate script put it on an editor folder and write tons of code with odin however you'll literally just add an attribute directly above the field that's it as you may know the more files you have in your codebase the harder it is to maintain so just that change going from two separate files with tons of boilerplate code going to a single file with a single attribute that change alone makes this asset more than worth it by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks so over here i've got my unity project and i've imported the package since this asset is all about making really nice editors naturally they have a really good getting started window just go up here into tools odin inspector getting started and here you see this real nice window and you can access all of the information that you need as you can see it's very very detailed every one of these buttons opens more windows with even more data so you can really learn how it works and to see it in action down here they have a really awesome rpg sample project just click on the open window and out pops out the window so this is a window that was created with odin inspector and it's fully functional so you can move it you can dock it you can resize it and as name implies this is a sample for an rpg game so by selecting any of these objects you can see all the things that you can easily create with odin so for example here you've got a simple image with an object selector you've got text boxes so you can input the name you've got a bunch of sliders over here a bunch of things that you can select then you've got a matrix where you can click and drag various objects you've got the objects themselves showing an icon as well as an amount then you've also got these really nice tabs so it constantly switches between what you want to see over here on the stats you also see a bunch of sliders so this is the display for the characters then down here this way for the armors so again shows a really nice image some text block a drop down menu for the type then some text areas so you can input multiple lines and over here a simple list so you can add various things and of course up here you've got buttons to create a new item or anything all the data behind this is stored in scriptable objects i've covered them in detail in another video and if you've worked with scriptable objects then you know they are excellent for storing data but by default they show their data in the inspector using normal fields so none of these fancy sliders and images and all of this is included in the project files so in this case over here under demos under the rpg editor you can see that so for example here is a character and i can double click and up here is the script and how it all works so you can inspect all these attributes to see how everything is made i'm going to cover how these attributes work in a bit now to see the massive difference that this makes i can for example take this inspector which is showing it a weapon then just swap it out for a debug inspector which makes it look pretty close to the default inspector so here you can see the huge difference so this is just a bunch of fields a bunch of tabs a bunch of things whereas over here we've got some really nice really nicely organized so all the stats modifiers the icon and so on so both of them are displaying the same underlying data but obviously one is much more easy to work with so this demo that they show here is really awesome this really showcases the power of this tool you can imagine if you were working on an rpg just how much more productive you would be setting all the data of your game in this custom window as opposed to setting it in the default inspector as i said the main point of this asset is making all this super easy new building this from scratch using a custom editor would likely take weeks but with odin inspector you might build this in just one or two days the way it works is all based on attributes and thankfully over here on the getting start window you can open the attributes overview and over here you can see all of the attributes used along with the code and what they look like so for example over here on the preview you see acetone you see this nice title so how do you make that it's just very simple it's right down here you just use the title attribute and that's it looks like that so you can browse around all of these to see all these attributes as you can see you've got custom value drawers you got some delayed properties you got an info box you've got tons of colors you can make something searchable you can make all kinds of buttons you can display various dictionaries various lists various things you even have some really awesome ifs so if something then show a different thing so this is very useful then you got all kinds of groups so you can really organize it exactly as you want it then a bunch of numbers a bunch of bars and so on and again the whole point of this is that it's all super simple most of these you just add a single attribute and it's done so for example over here on the button you can see how do you make a button well that's it you just use the attribute button and that's it you've got a button that it fully works and as i said you can inspect these scripts used to make the rpg demo so you can inspect all of this and see how they all work so for example on the items how did they show an item they use the preview field they have the level and so on so back in the getting started window here we see a bunch of examples for editor windows so you can inherit from odin editor window instead of the basic unity editor window so this enables you to use the same attributes without having to write custom editor code then here is a great demo on how to inspect objects so for example you can make a button so that you can click on it and it shows up some more detailed information on a specific object again you can inspect the code to see how all of this works then you can create your own custom menus so this is exactly the same thing that you saw on the rpg demo so you've got all these tabs on the left side and all the data on the right side then over here you've got some more examples on custom drawers so this is an example scene where you got all these objects on them with various scripts so for example just a basic health bar with a visual display then over here a custom drawer showcasing a custom struct then you can also add some options for right clicking so here just set a certain color you can create custom drawers for generic classes very useful you can add some validation to make sure that your films have the correct values and then over here it's showcasing how you can even have a fully working mindsweeper game so here this is all running the inspector and works exactly right so you've got the game of minesweeper so yeah there you go as you can see it fully works and then you've got a final advanced demo so these are more advanced use cases for example one of the things you can do is build custom editors on top of things where you don't have direct access to the code like here for example is a custom editor built to showcase the matrix 4x4 type and finally of course down here you've got all kinds of links so the manual the documentation roadmap issues support as well as the discord channel alright so hopefully by now you already have some ideas for how you could use this to make some awesome tools to massively increase your productivity if you want to learn even more on how to use odin you can check out their official youtube channel they've got tons of tutorial videos that will help you get the most out of this tool so now let's see a practical example of how to use it now a while ago i made my factory automation minigame and in making that game one of the data objects that i had to create were some items so i made them a scriptable object and here is all of my various items so here they are without any custom inspectors so this is the default way that it shows up definitely not very usable so let's spend just a few minutes making this inspector infinitely better all i have to do is just open up my scriptable object so here is the script very simple just a bunch of fields and create acid menu pretty much all basic so first we need to add the using statement so using sirenix sirenix.odinspector and once you do now we have access to the various attributes so let's begin by making the sprite have a proper preview so we can see it so over here just before the sprite film we're going to add the attribute preview field and then inside we can add the height so let's put a height of 16 and yep there it is much better so it's a sprite over here i can even click to select it so i can select and select the different sprites and there you go it selects now we don't really need the label so just having the preview is more than enough and here you can add multiple attributes by simply adding a comma so in this case let's hide the label so just put hide and label and if there it is just a nice preview no label everything looks great okay so now it wouldn't look better if we position the item icon on the left side and all these films on the right side so for that let's create a horizontal group with the same size as the preview so use the attribute horizontal group let's give it a name let's call it split just to split between the left and right side and for the size let's put a size of 6 in okay so that one is now on the left side now we want to place the other ones on the right side and we're going to want those to be grouped vertically so for that let's go down into the next field and in here we're going to add a vertical group but we do want these to be inside the horizontal group so the way we do that is over here in the name we give it the same name so we are also on the split then use a forward slash kind of like a folder name and then let's say just right and if there it is now the item name shows up on the right side to the right of the actual sprite okay now the label is a bit too big so there's a lot of wasted space here so we can also set the size for that one so for example put the label on width and let's put it say 120 and yep now that's a much better size and now for the others let's just put them on the same vertical group as the item name so they show up beneath it so in here let's just copy paste this one onto this one and this one and yep there it is now here we can also still use just the basic default unity custom editor code so for example over here for the mining timer let's add a range let's put a minimum of 0 and a maximum of let's say 10. and yeah there you go now the mining timer does have a sliding variable then for example here i added some buttons to set the stack amount to certain values so i can still use the checkbox in order to set to a fixed value or use these buttons to easily set it so for these ones i wanted to put them organized horizontally so for that i create another horizontal group to hold the stack amount and then just put the buttons on the same horizontal group so they show up left right here and then for the buttons it's very simple just use the button give it some text if you want and then underneath it put the actual function that you want to call so in this case then the function simply just changes the field so here are some buttons a slider a checkbox and some really nice icon selector alright so with this very simple example you can already see just how far you can push this if you're going to work on a project for a decent amount of time then it definitely makes sense to spend some time just making some good tools so you can greatly increase your productivity so that's the odin inspector an extremely powerful
