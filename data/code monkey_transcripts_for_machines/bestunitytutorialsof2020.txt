hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and now that we're in 2021 let's take a look at some of the best unity videos of 2020. there were a total of 115 videos published covering all sorts of topics everything from simple tutorials to machine learning effects game analysis complete courses and much much more i made a really nice page with the more interesting videos grouped into a bunch of categories check that out if you want to browse these videos in your own time there's too many awesome ones for me to mention in just this video the year actually started off quite well back in january the channel hit 100 000 subscribers so thank you all for that and i really hope you've learned a ton from all of these videos then a video that took a massive amount of work to make my game dev journey in there i talk about how i started programming 20 years ago making irc scripts then i moved on to flash and finally to unity i'm really happy with that video it's a really nice summary of all the projects that i've done in all that time it was a total of over 40 games and it should also serve as an inspiration to you to take your own time on your own journey and just focus on getting better day by day then when the whole thing of 2020 started i made a video on my tips from working from home i've been working from home for many many years now so if you're just starting hopefully my tips can help you then for a really interesting complete game named wash your hands this was obviously very topical at the time and it was also the very first time that i experimented making a 3d video i mainly stick with 2d since making textures is easier than 3d meshes but i had some asset packs laying around so that's what i used it's an interesting minigame you go around clearing up all the nasty particles while telling people to wash their hands and visually i'm quite pleased with the end result some really good looking 3d world with some flat sprites and lots and lots of effects i made a bunch more complete games one of them was i made doom in unity it was great to remake one of the old time classics and make it work exactly like the original another one was a simple match 3 game i needed this for a video that i was planning so i made it from scratch in just under 6 hours and recorded the whole thing and i also participated in the mixing game jam where i made a really interesting racing rts in just 48 hours as the name implies it's a mix of racing and rts where you drive around the car and also control a bunch of other car units it's a very unique design speaking of complete games this year was also when i launched the code monkey steam app i've been thinking about doing something like this for ages and finally i managed to do it i wanted something to group all the videos and all the games that i've made into one nice complete package and that's exactly what it is it's completely free so we'll go ahead pick it up on steam it includes all of the various games that i've made on the channel like the wash your hands game that i just mentioned so you can easily get the app and play through all those games it also has some really interesting interactive tutorials it's a nice minigame that teaches you c sharp and unity as well as game design also looks really good with some nice assets and on the app there's also a section for my own steam games and more importantly they have a list of the various tutorial videos that i've made where i remade some of those elements so for example you can go and play my steam games and then go watch those videos to see how those systems were made really interesting stuff as for unit tools and features i also covered a bunch of them i made a simple video on unt analytics definitely something you should use when making your own games another one on game simulation which is a very interesting tool that lets you run your game tons and tons of times on the cloud in parallel it's very useful for testing your game thousands of times and coming up with the perfect balance levels i also made a video on the visual effect graph this is how you can exploit the power of the gpu to render millions and millions of particles i did a general overview and then a nice scatter effect and finally near the end of the year i got into machine learning using unity ml agents this is a fascinating toolkit that is actually very easy to use and gives you the full power of machine learning i cover the basics of machine learning then how to use imitation learning and how to teach in ai how to play flappy bird and drive a car machine learning has a massive amount of potential so definitely and look forward to some more videos on how you can use this tool to help you make better games back in march i made a ton of dots videos covering physics lists prefabs events and subscenes i implemented pathfinding in dots and i even made an awesome video on how you can combine super fast dots pathfinding with normal game objects that was really awesome and insanely fast so back then i covered lots of topics and i even made a complete game internally using dots just to showcase how it was already very capable at the time i haven't been back to using dots since then but based on how good it was already a year ago i can't wait to try it again i also experimented with a different type of video watching some popular aaa games and analyzing their trailers to see how all of those mechanics are made start off with the very first video analyzing the watch dogs trailer looking at all the mechanics shown in the trailer and teaching you how you could build them in your own games then i analyzed the spiderman trailer which is full of solid mechanics to learn from and then ghost of tsushima which really has some interesting sound mechanics visual effects and a hook shot this is an interesting format that i definitely want to keep doing the only issue with this is that it requires me to find some good gameplay trailer that showcases a bunch of things usually those trailers come out at e3 and since there was no e3 last year that kind of limits things but there's lots of awesome ones from previous years so i'll probably be looking at those game design is really a timeless discipline so you can learn just as much from older titles as well as from new ones and in december when cyberpunk launched i did another similar experiment except instead of watching the trailer i played through the game and selected a bunch of mechanics to then go remake in unity this format has the benefit that i don't need to find the perfect official gameplay trailer i can just play the game myself the goal with this was to show you how these aaa games look impossibly complex but many of the things they do you can definitely do them for yourself in unity and remaking those mechanics was a lot of fun so this is also a format that i intend to keep doing as for tutorials there were obviously tons of them one of the main reasons why i started this channel was to share my knowledge with all of you and also because i wanted to explore tons of different topics and continue on my own learning journey so with that one really awesome miniseries was on a crafting system back in 2019 i made an inventory system and then in 2020 i made a minecraft like crafting system built on top of it it works exactly as you expect drag the recipe in the correct position and drag the output item later i made a video on scriptable objects this is how you can define a data structure to create individual objects to hold some data i also made a video on custom inspectors with custom fields images buttons and so on and finally i combined everything and made the crafting system with scriptable objects and a custom editor it's super easy and very visual to create a completely brand new item and define a brand new recipe for how to make it i'm really happy with the final result on this one definitely need to use it more often in some more videos i made a shadowgraph overview video just teaching the basics for how it works and then some tutorial videos on interesting effects one of them on a simple grassland shader it makes the sprite deform in such a way that it looks like wind and another one for a really awesome building construction effect i really need an effect like this for my course and this is what i came up with i really like how it looks it seems as if the building is being printed line by line really cool also related to shadowgraph i made a video on how to use the shadow graph to make custom pose processing effects so every effect that i've already covered like for example the solve can be applied to tone on screen one really interesting video was on converting 2d into 3d and vice versa i've made a lot of videos using 2ds demo because it's simply easier for me to draw sprites than make meshes but for the most part all of my videos work both in 2d and 3d but i do see that comment a lot going into something like the inventory system video and asking if it works in 3d so i made this video to showcase how easy it is to convert systems between 2d and 3d it's usually very very easy there were a bunch of videos regarding enemies starting off with a simple ai just teaching how to use a basic state machine to make some sort of basic enemy logic then a battle system for spawning enemies when the player gets near or triggers some sort of condition i made a really awesome boss fight again using a state machine to define an interesting boss battle with various stages also made a melee combat system that features smart targeting so it knows which target it should prioritize and the video covering several methods for how to find targets pick the one that best suits your needs also related was the video on various methods for shooting projectiles all of them with pros and cons it all depends on what projectile you're trying to simulate then i made two player controllers one of them very standard just a normal topdown player controller you can move around that has physics and collisions and so on it even features an instant dash and nice nodule this is the standard controller that i use in most of my topdown videos and another really interesting one based on a modular design so the whole thing is based on building several modules that then work on top of each other you can use a module that just has some dumb movement or easily swap it out for one that uses pathfinding use one for player control or swap it out for one with enemy ai it's a really interesting design and by going through it you will learn a ton of things like using csharp interface for some more ai i also made a simple tower defense ai place down towers and have them target enemies then a video on a simple rts control system i definitely would like to make some more rts videos as soon as i have the time and if you're a fan of games like xcom i made an awesome grid combat system its turn base features two different teams and it's based on a grid it's a great starting point for any strategy game i made a video on using several methods of interacting with objects using a button position item and so on i show it being used on a door but really they can be used for any object then for some more general videos i made one on the math behind splines and how you can make some really awesome smooth shapes you can then use them to move a car around or make some roads or really just any smooth curve somewhat related to that is the video on animation curves and how you can use them for so much more than just animation one video on a simple chat bubble this is the example like i used in my game battleground tycoon a really great video on animated cursors so this one is exactly what i use in my survivor squad games and i also made a tone tip that works perfectly always is on screen and follows the mouse then a video on how to make unity as a transparent window this was a lot of fun to research you can essentially do anything you can with unity and use it as an overlay on top of your desktop one example was i made a simple assistant like the ones that existed back in the 90s this is also how i made the annotation program that i then used in the game dev reacts videos and another interesting one was in making a launcher you make a unity program that then launches other programs so this one is pretty much exactly how my cmap works it's a hub for all the other projects that i've made there were a bunch of c sharp focused videos first of all very quick video showcasing c sharp basics in just 10 minutes it gives you a great overview of the language then some videos going indepth on various csharp topics one on the basics of loops the various types you have and how each differ from each other a video on events and how they help you keep your code clean and nicely decoupled also a video on delegates which lets you store a function inside a field very useful one covering interfaces which lets you define certain behavior on your types like for example having an interface for every object that can be damaged and one on generics which are insanely useful then let you write code that works with any class so this is extensively used in my grid class and finally i made a super useful video on my process for solving the very common error of null reference exceptions in there i mentioned my stepbystep process for how i always solve that error if you go through all those videos you will certainly learn a ton about csharp and program and as i've already mentioned i made tons of dots videos and machine learning tutorials so yep in 2020 there were tons of topics covered this year everything from simple to complex some based on programming others based on rendering others on game design and various unity tools i'd definitely love to hear from you which ones you found most useful this year was also when i finally decided to try making some complete courses i've wanted for a long time to do some complete courses essentially they allow me to cover a lot more and speak about a lot more things that i just can't fit in a 20 minute video so with that in mind i first made the bundler defender course i'm really happy with the final result you can definitely learn a ton which is applicable to a lot of genres like city builders tower defense survival games and so on the course starts completely from scratch the very first video is on creating a brand new empty project and it goes step by step until the final completed game it's around 20 hours so i can definitely go into a lot more depth than in my normal videos all of the lectures have their own project files as downloadable resources so you can start from the beginning or pick up from anywhere you want this was my first course essentially showcasing making a game exactly the way that i make my own games using code but then i also made another massive course this one all about making games internally using visual scripting i specifically designed the course to include not one but three games in order to cover lots of different genres this was an interesting challenge and it definitely showed me how it is absolutely possible to build anything you want using solely visual scripting the action rpg and the fps are some pretty complex games and they all work perfectly without a single line of code and just like the builder defender course this one also starts completely from scratch and contains all the downloadable project files for all the unlectures so all in all i'm really happy with those two courses and based on the reviews it seems that people like them as well i definitely want to do some more although they do take a massive amount of time so it won't be a while before the next one speaking of courses i also made an interesting video comparing the pros and cons of free tutorials versus paid courses in there i talk about the various differences and how courses are better for learning all the tiny things that no one mentions in a normal tutorial and i also talk about how tutorials are excellent if you already know what you're looking for it's a really great video and i'd encourage you to check it out if you haven't already there's tons of benefits to both types if you know how to use them alright so that was the year 2020. tons of awesome stuff with 115 videos in total check the page on the website which contains links to all of these videos and a bunch more there might be some there that you may not have seen and you might find quite useful i'd love to hear from you which ones you found the most useful thank you all for continuing to watch the videos i really hope you've learned a ton from them and i hope to continue making content that you find educational and entertaining this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone so again thank you all so much for watching and i'll see you next time
