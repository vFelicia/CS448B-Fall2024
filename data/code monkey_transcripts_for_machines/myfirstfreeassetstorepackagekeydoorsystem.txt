hello and welcome i'm your code monkey in this video we're going to look at my very first asset store package which is camoly free the key door system this is a very easy to use system for quickly placing doors and keys in your levels you can create more keys and more doors by using simple scriptable objects i'm also going to talk about the process on how to publish your own assets on the asset store which is something that i've always wanted to try doing the asset store is a really interesting platform and i'm fascinated by the fact that you can make a living as a tools developer just creating tools to help other developers so as a test i wanted to start with something simple so i made the key door system it's completely free so check out the store page in the description and just go ahead and download it as you can see by the name this asset is also officially proved to work with the fps micro microgame so if you're making some quick fps prototypes then this system will be really easy to add and you can use it in any game it's not limited to just the fps micro game it features a bunch of 3d keys and doors so go to the webpage click on the button to add to your assets and then open in unity once you click that button it will automatically open the package manager in unity and scroll down to the key door system if it doesn't then just manually open it by going into window package manager and then click on load more until you find the key door system then go ahead just download and hit on import just go ahead select everything and import okay so all the files get added to the project files and right away you can see a really nice readme so here you see just some basic instructions on how to get started and the readme file itself also looks really nice with some images and links so this is actually really simple to make in reality this file in here is just a scriptable object then there's a custom inspector in order to display all the films in this nice custom manner i figured if i had to make a readme file then i might as well spend some time making it look good and i'm quite happy with the result i covered both custom inspectors and scriptable objects in previous videos so go check those out if you want to learn more so in here let's follow our readme instructions now the first thing we need is to drag the key prefab onto the level so over here let's open up the objects folder and inside over here let's drag the key prefab red so just drag it straight onto the level by the way this level that i'm using here is the fps micro game project i'm using this to demo the system signal because it already has a very nice fps character controller okay so we added the key onto our level now next let's go to the readme okay so secondly drag the door prefab onto the level make sure it's the same color so in here we have the prefab red and just drag that one let's rotate to face the right direction and just place on this nice little door hole all right so there's the door let's check out the next step so in here place the key okay place door okay now select the player game object and we add the dorky holder script so over here we select the player it already has a bunch of scripts but these don't matter the key door system works separate from anything else so in here let's simply add a component and search for the door key holder yep this one and there you go so this script essentially holds some keys it also detects four collisions in order to add the keys to the key holder and just like this everything is done so if you look in the readme yep these are the three essential steps and then we have an optional step which is to add a ui element so we go into our ui canvas which in this project is located over here under the game manager we have the game hud and we're going to drag the dorky ui prefab all right so there it is a very nice key indicator in our ui now this one is optional because everything works without it but you might as well edit so you have a nice ui indicator showing you what keys you're holding so the indicator as you can see has a field for the door key holder so in here we select this and the key holder is on the player so just drag the player object straight into that field alright okay so back in the readme following the instructions and next one is just to play the game okay so let's try okay here we are in our game and we have a nice door in front of us and if i try to go through it nope the door is closed does not open and if i pick up the key yep i touch the key and gets added to my ui and now if i approach the door there you go it consumes the key it opens the door and now i can move through it alright awesome so here is a very simple system that you can very quickly and very easily add to your games the whole package comes complete with everything so you can just inspect this old folder there's only a handful of files so if you want to check how it works you can view all the source code so over here under the scripts folder you can see all the various scripts now longtime viewers of the channel might actually realize that this system looks quite familiar that's because the origin for this system was made quite a while ago in a dedicated video in that video i created the whole system from scratch so if you want to learn how all these scripts were made then check that out i originally made in 2d but as you can see it works perfectly well in 3d as well this system works on scriptable objects which i've already covered in another video essentially each key is a scriptable object so that's why it's so easy to make another type of key so let's try making that now in here under the keys we have all of our various keys so these are scriptable objects as you can see all they have is pretty much just a color so we can right click in order to go into create go into addons code monkey key door system and create a key let's make this the key purple and for the column let's select a purple all right there's our purple key script object so this is just the data for the key now down here we have the base key prefab along with the variants for red green and blue and now we can right click in order to create and we're going to create a new prefab variant and let's call this the key prefab purple and let's open the prefab and here we have our basic key mesh the key itself holds this script which itself holds a reference to the scriptable object so instead of the key red for this one let's use the key purple scriptable object and on the mesh we can also modify the material in order to make it visual so in here let's make another material for the key purple okay we have our purple key now let's do the same thing for the door so select door prefab in order to create a new prefab variant for the door prefab purple and open the prefab and here do the same thing so it has the door lock script which again has a reference to the scriptable object that opens this door so in this case let's go with the purple and here you can also see a nice tunnel in case you want to consume the key on open or not so by default it uses up the key but you could make it so you have reusable keys okay so that's a key and then over here on the unlock we can modify the material all right there it is so just like this we created the brand new key type so we first made the scriptable object then we made a key prefab variant to use that scriptable object and the same thing with the door now if we go back into our scene here and let's replace these so instead of having this key prefab and this door let's drag our purple key prefab and then also our purple door okay so let's test okay there it is the purple door as well as the purple key so move in yep there you go grab the purple key move in and if there you go the purple key opens the purple door alright so everything works and we have very easily created a brand new type of key indoor awesome then here in the project files it also comes with a really nice demo scene so this scene is already all set up here it is with all the standard doors and the standard keys so if i move in nope i cannot open now let's grab this key and grab this key and also this key and just open that one that one and that one and they all open so if you have trouble following the instructions just check out the demo scene so as you can see this whole system is very simple and very easy to use now let's just quickly look at the code here is the scripts folder and inside for example we have the key script so this as you can see is a scriptable object and all it really has is just the color of the key and over here a very nice menu so everything is nice and organized then we have the door key which is the script that is added to the key object and all it really has is a reference to the key then there is the door lock which is on the door object so this is just a basic model behavior it has a reference to the key that opens this door and then just some functions in order to play the animations then we also have the ui element which is optional so the whole system works without this and all it really takes is just the key ui prefab which is already set by default and then it takes a reference to the door key holder so in this case we're placing the door key holder on the player but really anything can hold some keys so for example you could have the enemies hold keys using this system and then here just listening to some events and refreshing all the visuals so it destroys all the old visuals and then resets and adds all of them so this can display as many keys as your dorky holding script is holding and finally we have the door key holder script which in this case it's attached to the player so this is what actually holds the keys it just has a list of all the keys that this one is holding and it simply does the ontrigger enter so it listens for collisions and if it collides with a dorky then destroys that dorky object and adds that key onto this list so that's it as you can see all these scripts are very simple and it's a very nice and easy to use system so here is my very first asset store package which is the completely free key door system this is my first asset so please give it a download and also make sure you leave a review with your thoughts so i know what you liked and what i can do to improve in the future now going through the asset store publisher process was actually pretty standard you need to first create a publisher account then you create a package you give it a title description add a couple of images and videos you can also set a price or make it free and then you upload the actual package contents from inside unity and finally you set it up for review after a while it gets reviewed and you can launch it on the asset or so it's a pretty simple and easy process if you have an idea for some tool or just some assets you want to share definitely give it a shot i have some ideas for some complex assets that i'd love to make so stay tuned and hit the bell icon if you found this video helpful consider liking and subscribing this video is made
