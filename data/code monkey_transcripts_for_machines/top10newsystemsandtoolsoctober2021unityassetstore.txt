hello and welcome i'm your code monkey the asset source full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some of the highlights that were released in september 2021. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video i already covered all the best free new assets so go watch that if you haven't seen it and in the next video i will be covering the top assets and effects let me know which one of these you're most interested in and i might do a detailed review on it as always there's links to the assets in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order by the way there's a mega bundle happening right now on the unity asset store as usual it's a super deep discount up to 95 off it contains lots of interesting tools so there's one to help you manage an inventory database another one for placing some decals and a terrain system there's a digging system you can slice meshes volumetric vfx and tons more as usual with such a deep discount it's worth it if just one of these assets looks interesting check it out with the link in the description alright so starting off with a really interesting interactive effects engine it helps you bring your scenes to life by having your effects interact with other objects for example you can make some fire that spreads to nearby objects make a plan to grow around an object or freeze everything in sight or electrified you can modify everything since all the effects are done with unity's vfx graph it includes six effects for use with both urp and agrp and then three variations only for hdrp with some excellent visuals if your game features elemental magic then this asset would be a great thing to base all of your spells on next up if your game involves some sort of furry creatures check out this first studio this is a fur rendering system it was designed for extreme performance quality and ease of use it is your gpu to the max while also working on mobile the effect looks pretty great all of the fur reacts to the animated character exactly as a tune so as it moves the fur also moves with it you can get just the urp edition or pick up the ultimate edition if you also need to work on the builtin or the high definition render pipeline and next up is an anticheat toolkit now my opinion on what to do about cheating in your own games is simply don't bother if you're working on a single player game then don't really waste your time trying to stop players from cheating on their own games you're better off spending that time just making the game better but if you do want to try and stop cheating then you might as well use a proper asset instead of trying to handle security on your own and of course if you are working on a multiplayer game then of course you do need to deal with cheating this one obscures position in memory so things like cheat engine cannot find it it also detects dll injection it protects binary files detects speed hacks wall hacks and so on so like i said in most cases don't worry about it but if you do then use a proper acid like this one and then here is a universal vehicle controller it's got quite a lot of features obviously you can drive it but you also have drifting you've got some lights you've got nitrous and so on and it even includes some pretty nice destruction all the panels come off and the whole car gets totally destroyed on top of that it also includes ai so you can easily create the ii path and play against the computer it's a great starting point for your next racing game if you're working on a game with some crafting maybe look into this crafting system create your items define the icons select the prefab the finance text size and a bunch more properties you create a recipe and drag drop to define how it works you can pick up items and add them to your inventory open the recipe and craft the item seems pretty easy to use it's got tutorial videos as well as detailed documentation up next here's a unique one it's a streaming engine you can stream your unity window to an html page you can stream from your pc onto mobile so it allows you to add live streaming into your game with ease you can use it for video chat remote assist teaching and learning and so on so it's a pretty specific thing but based on reviews it works very well then a tool that might be very useful to you world clusters you can split your world into multiple clusters and easily toggle them either on or off this can be great for performance you can split your massive world into many pieces and only load the nearest ones or it can also be great for vertical games with many forwards you make each floor into a cluster and only load the second floor when the player goes up there by unloading unused objects you can really massively improve the performance of your game i'm always a fan of tools that do just one thing very well and this is exactly it then if you have water in your game here's a great looking water system it looks very realistic you've got some water and waves you've got underwater rendering with some gorgeous looking light rays you can even manually paint the currents in the ocean in order to make the scene feel much more natural and of course play around the visuals to get any visual you want so you can make a gorgeous bright blue lake or a really dark and scary ocean whatever settings you choose it always looks great if you're into ar games and especially something like pokemon go then check out this template it lets you throw objects in ar use two throwing modes and customize all the parameters personally i haven't used ar in unity so no idea how good this is but if you're trying to build your own pokemon go then this could be a good starting point and at last also a very interesting tool a ui and layout customizer this one is especially useful for mobile games where a lot of players like to customize the controls instead of forcing one layout on your players let them place the buttons in joysticks wherever they prefer you can change the size and opacity and really customize any element you want based on the description it's super easy to use just attach your script onto any object you want to move and it just works alright so those are my top 10 new tools and systems on the unity asset store for september 2021 there's links to all in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order check out
