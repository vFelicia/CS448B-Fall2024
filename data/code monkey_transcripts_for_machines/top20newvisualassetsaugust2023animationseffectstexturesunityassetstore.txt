hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for August 23. even if you don't pick up any of these it's so great to unlock them to see if they inspire you to build something just watching some of these asses enough to fire up my imagination I can immediately picture all the kinds of games that I could build this one is only selfpaid ass and effects I've already made two videos covering the best three new assets and best tunes and systems as always there's links to the apps in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and there's four days left on decimal bundle lots of strange monster is a bunch of spells some fire and smoke even a horse controller and a bunch more interesting stuff it also has a 10 off coupon so just in case you want to buy something on the store that is 10 times the bundle price and essentially the bundle comes out free alright so starting off with a gorgeous sunlight Farm pack this one looks really great if you want something nice and Charming but not low poly then this style is perfect this one is a huge pack features over 2 and prefabs everything from Modular Buildings animals characters and tons of plants this would be the perfect pack if you'd like to make a quick farming minigame or maybe you're working on something a bit more hardcore if so here's a really nice Katana animation pack great animations they are sandwich but not too outlandish features some simple slashes and some really impressive moves it's also even got air attacks so you could use this for something more grounded like ghosts of tsushima or maybe something inspired by Devil May Cry and if you have Katana animations you need some Samurai visual here's a great looking one super high resolution extremely high quality character this one could really be taken straight from Ghost of tsushima the character also has 80 blend shapes on the face so you can make some expressions or even use it in some realtime AR apps next here's a pack with a ton of gorgeous skyboxes with environments this is a great way to make your game look so much better with very little effort just add a gorgeous Skybox and these also come with some environment images so just with this one and your world will immediately look great or maybe you need some hyper realistic explosions if so check out this one these are Olympic explosions which makes them look really extremely smooth the smoke looks a little bit too thick but the Fireballs do look perfect this is all based on vertex colors so it uses no textures these also react on lighting although they will not interact with physics objects then here's a fun one a ton of cartoony emoticons this can be used in either 2D or 3D this town looks really nice nice depth effect in some of those there are some cartoony explosions lots of emotions thought Bubbles and various icons then for something more serious here is a Fantasy Castle environment it's got a very very realistic style these are some really highend meshes and props I have no idea what you'd call the style is this Gothic or something either way it looks taken straight from some like dark souls or Elden ring if instead you need some TD here is an isometric pixel art character it looks really nice every angle is included the Sprites are very clearly 3D meshes that were processed with a pixel Shader so that makes for an interesting look this pack has 5 characters each with some nice variations and animations then here's a fun one it's a stunt car racing pack definitely a very unique asset this would be perfect if you're making a car game inspired by something like trackmania or Hot Wheels It's Got Some Loops some jumps and sidebands really a very unique pack then for some tune animations check out this one it's amazing how animations can also have a tune sound but yep that is correct they do look clearly very very toony honestly looking at this one makes me want to replace the red similar animations that I'm using in my upcoming steam game link Guardians these will look a lot more cartoony which would fit the game perfectly looking at the animations applied to tune characters doesn't look really nice then if you need a stylized modular character here's one it features a male and female body types it's a regular humanoid ring so works with any animations it's got multiple eye shapes multiple hairstyles phone outfits shirts and pants so I could see this one being perfect for making something like a Sims game if you want something more near futuristic here is a ton of props and a cyberpunk character it looks very flashy very stylized it's futuristic but not too far in the future it includes a nice character on a really interesting hoverboard then for something more in the past here is a wild west modular pack it's a realistic sound looks really nice looking at this one makes me want to build something inspired by Red Dead it's got lots of modular building Parts signs and props so you can really make your own really nice Western Village then for something scary and cute here is in Little Ghost it's a really nice style spooky but casual perfect for a game inspired by Casper or something like that it includes lots of colors for some very nice variation and even some fun hats also comes with 12 animations so really nice pack next for something realistic and hardcore here is a fantasy medieval arena in dungeon right away it obviously makes me want to do some kind of gladiator management game something where you build the dungeon with various buildings to train your Gladiators then send them out to fight in the arena against all kinds of foes it features tons of props and prefabs lots of structures doors traps and puzzles also apparently this one includes multiple environments including a steampunk one then here's a really fun one it's a Mario style environment it definitely fits that description looking at it for half a second you can only tell this was inspired by Mario so if you'd like to make something that is indeed inspired by the same style as Mario then this would fit perfectly great for making any kind of 3D platformer this one includes tons of objects and props and even includes a demo with working gameplay or maybe your game has some junkyard here's a nice pack it's a low poly sound with lots of cars being crushed so right away this reminds me of gun in 60 seconds really great movie you've got tons of assets over 200 of them lots of items cars buildings and props then for something a lot more scifi here is an alien planet it looks really excellent very alienlike it's got lots of weird vegetation some weird trees and a great looking scifi sky it even includes some particles for water and rain next here is a nice pack with a ton of Tavern assets looking at this the obvious thing to do would be some kind of Tavern management game or if you're making something like Skyrim then this could be a great environment to talk to some NPCs and pickup quests and if you're working in VR here is a UI pack it includes all sorts of toggles buttons and Sliders it's not just visuals but the logic as well so this could be useful to quickly get the VR Pro type up and running quickly alright so those are my top 20 new visual ads on the unts server for August 23. there's the links are in the description and as a bonus you can easily coupon code monkey 10
