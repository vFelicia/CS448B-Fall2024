let's check out some of the highlights that were released in september 2021. this one is a list of paid assets and effects i've already made two videos covering the best free new assets and the best

simple way to add keys and doors to your game and the mouse cursor system pro which is a very easy to use tool to help you create some custom animated cursors to really make your game stand out check them out to the link in description alright so starting off with a shader pack to make your game look really cartoony you've got some flat colors a painted look a very stylized shader but this one is also more than just a shader it's a collection of tools to get this really nice look it even includes an electric wire mesh generator it's got a bunch of demo scenes and shadow graphs so you can really edit anything up next if you want some animations here's a wrestling animation pack it's got quite a lot of moves so this one is obviously great for a wrestling specific game but also pretty much any melee game you've got lots of punches kicks grabs and throws this developer has tons and tons of animation packs and all of them look great for some interesting ui elements here is a motion tunnels pack this one is the kind of thing that you see in lots of video editing software like premiere and here you can use it in your game so this could be great for a location card when your player enters a new area or maybe when they encounter a new character it also contains editor tools in order to easily set it up to get it exactly as you want it so it's an interesting asset i've never seen anything like it then if you want a very peaceful village check out this pack you've got a stylized cartooning look everything looks really inviting it's got both interiors and xseries so you've got tons of props houses and then lots of trees and rocks to populate your outside and on top of that it also includes sounds and music so it really is a fully featured scene for some pixel monsters look at this pack over 30 units zombies and skeletons all of them with seven animations so you've got idle run attack and so on if you like this style then this developer has quite a lot more packs then if you're working on a scifi game and you want to make some nice looking interiors check out this one i always like this kind of presentation sort of dioramas showing all the props in place it's actually got quite a lot of objects for the price it's sort of low poly but not too much lots of modular pieces so you can easily build your own houses if you're looking for particle effects here's a good one it's a collection of 80 particle effects works on all the render pipelines and you also have multiple variations with different colors in order to apply them to many scenarios and then if you have some crystals or shiny things in your game then check out this shader the diamond especially looks really really good you've got some coins gold bars rubies jades and pearls so this could be great as items or resources in your game then if you're working on a racing game here's a nice cartoony pack feature some small cars with quite a lot of shapes there's 10 unique models and multiple colors between them up next some nice movement animations looks like a pretty great starter pack you've got some idle run turn jump vault and all of them in all directions so if you don't yet have a pack with some basic animations and this one looks great for something really highend here is a chris vector model it's got all kinds of attachments so you can really customize it you can add a silencer grip or torch pretty much anything you can change the camo or paint it with a solid color it's a very highend model it's in tripoli quality and with 4k textures then here's an interesting one a bunch of hand models lots of unique ones you've got some standard hands in all these skin colors or maybe you want some robot hands some medical gloves or even punching gloves so if you're working on a vr game and you want something more than the default transparent hands and this one looks great next up if you need some realistic interiors check out this pack pretty nice visuals and textures it's set up to work with the builtin render pipeline so you can easily upgrade it to either urp or agrp then for something pretty unique a italian bar animation pack i guess this would be great if you're working on some sort of bar tycoon game you've got some very unique animations so one of them on making a pizza dropping some plates drinking and talking while sitting down and so on it's quite a unique pack or maybe you're working on some sort of game kind of like tomb raider so here's some nice modular ruins you've got tons and tons of parts for you to mix and match it's a pretty nice style some hand painted textures so if you need some ruins then check it out or maybe you want some cute astronauts then look into this pack i quite like the sound on this one definitely very cute they are set up with a humanoid rig so you can use any humanoid animations and the pack itself also includes a bunch of preset animations you've got collarbone shaders in order to change the body helmet and backpack colors in order to make all of your astronauts really unique then if you need to make something look like glass here's a really nice shader it's pretty nice it distorts everything behind it visually it does indeed look like glass great visual so if you need something to look like last and this is it or maybe you're working on a farming game here's a crops pack all of the plants have five growing stages including spoiled you can harvest fruits and vegetables it includes planter boxes with two height variations and all the plants also have a wind animation pretty nice then here's a pretty niche one a tonight show studio definitely an interesting unique asset i guess maybe if you need this type of backdrop or something like a cutscene or something like that so it's pretty unique and it looks exactly like you expected and finally here's some nice modular tiny characters it's got quite a lot of modular pieces you can definitely create endless variety of characters just with
