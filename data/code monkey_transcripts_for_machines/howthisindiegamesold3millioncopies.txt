hello and welcome I'm your code monkey so last month one really interesting game came out it's called battle bit remastered this is an indie game that was actually made by a team of just three people over many years and right now it's one of the biggest hits of the Year big not just in terms of indie games but big in just games in general it has already sold over 3 million copies that's an insane amount especially for a threeperson team and the story for this game actually is quite interesting first of all it seems like it came out of nowhere at least for me personally I hadn't heard about this game at all I'm someone who follows the video game industry pretty closely and yet I had no idea about this game I've never heard this name so to me this looked like an overnight success but usually any stories about overnight success are usually myth it's usually never really an overnight success if you really look into it there is an excellent GDC tunnelcon exactly that topic it's on the game antichamber and it's settled an overnight success seven years in the making basically how this game antichamber this was indeed a huge hit as soon as it came out its own millions of copies however it definitely did not came out of nowhere you use being developed and Gathering feedback for over seven years attending all kinds of conventions and things so I highly recommend you watch this GDC talk it's really interesting and for this game for battle build it seems like this one is actually a similar story like I said it's just a threeperson team so really small and they've been working on this game for over seven years one of the developers started off by making mods for unturned over eight years ago and the other developer also at that time eight years ago was playing around inside Unity dealing with all kinds of shooting mechanics so this has been worked on for quite a long time the development of this specific game the specific iteration the sexually started in 2017 that's when they opened the actual official Discord for quite a long time they were actually being supported on patreon they were developing the game alongside a small community this is definitely an interesting way to make games it's really difficult it's really difficult to find an audience to support you on patreon as you do game development but it is technically an option if you have something really special and you manage to find a really dedicated community and over here it seems like that's exactly what they've got with that they essentially just grew their Community a bit by bit year by year month by month to put into perspective just how long this game has been development they actually have a green light trailer which was published six years ago green light that's the thing that existed before seem direct I went through green light myself a few times many many years ago so yeah this one has definitely been in development for a very long time at some point they finally put the game on scene and we can actually go into cmdb and check however seem to be actually only goes back all the way back to 2019 but still at this point in 2019 they already had 7 000 followers now the general rule is that wishing lists are about 10 times smaller so back in 2019 they already had about 70 000 wishlists now that is a massive amount I'm actually currently working on my upcoming steam game think Guardians and I'm currently at about 2700 wishlists and hoping to get to 5000 before release so having 70 000 wish list this is a massive amount for any indie game so here on this graph you can see how they grew very slowly but very consistently over time over many many years to the point where when they did a play test all the way back in March of 22 back then they already had 700 000 playtesters so even though to me it seemed like this game came out of nowhere it definitely did not we can see in the graph how the game really started to gain Traction in 22 and really blow up like crazy by the time they launched they had 70 000 followers which really means 700 000 wish lists again that is a massive amount I think that probably puts you on the top 10 most wishlist games of all time so with all that by the time that the game launched the game was a huge hit there were tons there were hundreds of thousands or millions of people waiting to pick up the game so as soon as it came out even though it's actually only still in Early Access even with that just by now in about one month they've already got 58 000 reviews so by now they have sold about 3 million copies which is a massive amount and actually for a fun fact there's actually a downside to selling that many copies when it comes to making a multiplayer game which is of course you have to pay for Server costs and servers can actually be quite expensive the developers actually recently did an AMA and they pointed out how they actually had to get a loan in order to keep paying for the server cost because once they did sell a ton of copies over here on Sim in case you don't know seem only pays you on a necessary basis meaning you wait for the month to end in order for Sim to calculate the final total and three days after that they actually send you the money so that means that even though they have sold millions of copies and they have millions and millions of dollars coming their way they're actually only going to receive them by August so they had to get online in the meantime so that's kind of funny the game has a price point of 15 we can do some quick math and say the game has sold three million copies however the devs were also very generous in terms of regional pricing they wanted to make sure that everyone could experience the game even though in lowincome countries so instead of the average being about 15 let's say it's only about 12 so that means around 36 million dollars now this is obviously the gross amount this is not net I've covered in a previous video the rough math for how to get the net from the gross that is going to depend on what country developers are from and what is the tax rate for their income but in general it's usually about 50 percent however in this case like I said they actually got some serious server costs on a game of this scale those server costs are definitely going to be massive so perhaps the net result is maybe just about 10 million dollars which again for a three person team that is a huge amount even taking into account the seven years of development so this is without a doubt a huge make get any hit playing the game myself I can definitely see the appeal it really is like a hyper polished Battlefield game and it's also refreshing to have a game just like this where you just pay once and that's it so on the progression it's all based on kills and action leveling up there are no micro transactions nothing like that so it definitely helps the game stand out from the other releases that have disappointed people the gameplay is really solid it has all of the class that you expect it also has very robust voice tool excellent netcode and anticheat protection so it is an extremely well made game that definitely targets its audience perfectly and funnily enough it also has the unity free splash screen logo usually people associate the smash screen with low quality games so I wonder if this game will actually help unity's reputation within mind of Gamers to answer the question in the title so how did this game actually end up selling 3 million copies well the first part of that answer is an obvious one which is they had a great game in order to find this level of success you really need a great game coupled with great marketing and they definitely did both those perfectly they built a game where they focus on the gameplay they focus on making sure the game actually plays where right and it's actually something that a lot of people have been waiting for the latest battlefield was a very disappointing release from a lot of people so something like this with excellent gameplay that really brings back to the battlefield routes there was definitely a huge audience waiting for exactly a game just like this with a huge focus on excellent gameplay so they had an excellent game and there was a huge audience that really won that game then of course they actually gathered that audience over a long period of time like we saw they've been developing this game alongside a community for over seven years and even on Steam they've been slowly Gathering wishlists and followers for many many years again the importance of wishlist cannot be under Satan nowadays it is an extremely important thing Gathering all of those wish lists really ensure that they would get a massively successful launch which again when coupled with an excellent game that's how it really blows up and and of course as with anything luck is always somewhat of a factor I've made a video dedicated on that topic there are some people who will look at this game and say they just got lucky they were on the right place at right time and some of that is partly true but more importantly is really all the effort that they put in for over seven years developing this game Gathering that Audience by doing all that work they made sure to essentially eliminate as much luck as possible thanks to Gathering those 700 000 wishlists they ensured that the game was going to be successful no matter what so like I said in that unlock video like it's always a factor but as developer you do have quite a bit of control over it when you put all those together that's how this game found massive success now of course my advice to you is don't try to aim for something like this this is a mega huge Indie hit if you're just trying to be a successful Indie Games developer you don't need to sell millions of copies so it's always great to look at stores like this one in order to inspire you and remember how it is possible to find Monumental success but still you don't need something on this scale so with your own games definitely try to make a great game definitely make sure you focus on marketing and Gathering some kind of community that desperately wants to play your game do all of that and hopefully you won't find quite a bit of success alright so that's the story of battle metering mastered one of the biggest Indie hits of not just this year but many many years it seemingly came out of nowhere but in reality was being developed for over seven years so congrats to the developers on making an excellent game and finding huge success thank you for watching and I'll see you next time thank you
