hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity for march 22. there were lots of great releases this month really nice variety when quite a bunch of interesting vr games it was tough to pick just one and by the way before we actually start this month's list just a quick honorable mention to willy snail this one is not actually made with unity it was made in game maker if you follow game dev on youtube you probably know about it it's made by jonas tyrone and it's finally out after four years of development it's receiving tons of super positive reviews so if you like some punishing platformers then give it a look now onto the list of games made with unity all these games are uniquely impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also there's a film links in description for some of the games also do you want to get hired for your unity or game dev skills check out

employers check it out with the link to get hired or to find talent alright so starting off at number 10 with one that's been very highly anticipated for a long time here is tunic it's a zeldalike action exploration game i love the visuals on this one very inviting creates a really nice sense of wonder you explore this massive world with tons of variation there's lots of enemies to fight items to collect and puzzles to solve it was in development for seven years and it's already had almost 2 000 very positive reviews there was also a session during unity's gdc where the developer came out and showed a bunch of interesting tricks that the game uses definitely go watch that on unity's twitch channel if you want to see some behind the scenes on this game personally i really loved watching the trick for how they used by making meshes as a path and then using some scrolling textures for their awesome particle effects up next one that i've been watching on twitter for quite a long time instruments of destruction this one is pretty much the definition of a very giftable game every clip from this looks excellent it's got very satisfying destruction with tons of debris lots of effects including some nice tilt shift effect the game itself is a vehicle sandbox game it's all about building your vehicle to destroy all kinds of buildings everything with some really awesome physics you have tons of parts to choose from you set up what input activates what so the vehicle construction system is really complex you build out your vehicle and then load the map and take everything down the scale infidelity of the destruction is really impressive i tried to find out if this one is using dots in any way but i couldn't find anything either way the trailer looks really awesome so if you like some vcon construction and destruction then check this out up next a game that is selling a massive amount of copies its core keeper already over 6 000 very positive reviews that is an insane amount the game is an adventure crafting mining game there's a large world to explore with tons of resources together and lots of items to craft it's got a really nice art sound looks very old school some awesome pixel art the game is multiplayer so that's certainly a reason for its massive success build your home with friends then go out and explore together fighting all kinds of enemies from some simple slimes to some huge boss fights looks like a game that is fun solo and excellent with friends and then here's a really fun one wobble dogs it's a very descriptive name you control some doglike animals that are certainly very wobbly the game is all about breeding growing and mutating your weapon dogs each weapon dog has their own unique personality some just want to sleep while some are hyperactive you build out their house give them things to do and keep them nice and healthy this one is actually fully out now graduating from early access it has 1500 overwhelmingly positive reviews so if you're looking for a nice fun stressfree pet simulator then definitely give it a try if instead you want a home building game but for humans then look at no place like home basically humanity trashed the earth and left for mars you're one of the few that remain behind and it's up to you to explore the world clean the mountains of trash and rebuild a thriving village with a healthy environment for me i love cleaning mechanics so starting with a really messed up planet and cleaning it all up is immediately appealing to me also features the usual crafting mechanics you expect so you can create buildings you can farm for food do some cooking you can recycle a bunch of old materials and unlock upgrades in a tech tree and so on combining worm cleaning with worm building seems like a great combo and lots of people agree this one has also just launched out of early access with already over 2 000 very positive reviews and despite being at 1.0 they're continuing to work on the game with several content updates planned then let's check out some vr with ifetch rocks on the one hand it's also a very descriptive name it's a game about harvesting resources however i feel the name also does a the service of the game what caught my eye right away were the interesting machines that you can build you have all kinds of components and tons of cables to connect them it's extremely customizable you can place the controls wherever you want and if you change your mind just grab them again and place them elsewhere you have red cables for power and green cables for data connect them all to make sure the components have the power and react to your input and then of course after setting up your ship it's time to find gather some resources the concept looks really interesting and has just landed in early access i'm curious to check it out a year from now to see just how much they expend upon this base idea up next a pretty unique one airborne kingdom it's half city welder half exploration game you build a floating metropolis aid the people down below and fly off on a quest build your own ship from scratch with tons of tools at your disposal features lots of customization to really make your airborne kingdom exactly your own also features a creative mode if all you want to do is just build and relax it's got lots of positive press missions and tons of awards definitely a unique take on the tycoon genre then a game that combines two really great games this means warp it has the chaotic coop tasks from overcooked coupled with some nice strategy gameplay like fdl that sounds like a great combo coop is either on local or online however you can also play solo there's tons of randomization so every run is unique and their roadmap is also pretty nicely detailed however one really interesting thing about this one is when compared to the other multiplayer game that i mentioned a while ago compared to core keeper both of them look great both have a heavy emphasis on multiplayer and yet one has over six thousand reviews while the other one has just under a hundred it really goes to show how when you focus on multiplayer either you hit it massively or not at all but this game doesn't look interesting and looks well made it's only now launching in early access so i hope they managed to grow an audience and have a successful phone launch and up next if you're looking for a really stylish action platformer here is have a nice death visually it looks excellent i really like the style it's a 2d action roguelike lots of moves jumps and attacks the game has a fun story you play as a overworked death and all your employees are basically slacking off so it's up to you to get them back to work all the art is hand drawn and really gives it an excellent look very flowing very satisfying animations as with many roguelikes you also have tons of weapons and upgrades at your disposal and every upgrade for you also makes your enemies become stronger in some way looks pretty fun and already has tons of positive reviews and over here at number one for my personal pick of the month is planet crafter i remember seeing the free prologue for this one quite a while ago and it seems to be doing very well at launch it's only been out for five days by the time that i'm writing this and already has 1500 reviews at 95 positive the game is an open world survival crafting game with a nice emphasis on terraforming at a planetary scale so you arrive at this planet it's all very desolate and inhospitable your goal is pretty much to make it livable for humans so start gathering some resources start by building some machines create some oxygen then create the conditions to build an atmosphere and watch as the planet changes due to your actions if you do things well then by the end you will have a vibrant lush healthy world to call home looking at the trailer i really love the contrast between the unhealthy red starring planet and the gorgeous lush green planet at the end it's really a great way of demonstrating player progression in a very visual way alright so that's 10 awesome new games made with dmt and watching march
