in this video we're going to look at the newly released lego micro game this is now the fourth micro game that unity has made and this one as the name implies it's all in partnership with lego it's a 3d third person platformer with some really interesting behavior breaks and brick building system let's begin hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing alright so let's check out the lego micro game like i said including this one there's already 4 micro games available the micro games are great starting points especially for beginners or anyone who wants to quickly prototype something first was the 2d platformer then the cart micro game and then the fps microgame i covered the fps microgame and even made an awesome game using it as a base so go check it out to see what you can easily build when you take the micro game as a base this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com unitycodemonkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone now here let's check out the latest one which is in lego microgreen now first up we need to install it in order to do that you need to be using unity hub 2.4 so if you're on an older version make sure you update it then on the installs make sure you have a unity 2019.4 version and so on so this is the lts version in my case i have it installed already and then this version of the unity hub comes with an update to the new project window so go into the projects tab and here click on new now here make sure that it's showing the lts version so 2019.4 and now the updated part is over here the templates section so you've got the default ones and then downloads and update on the list and when it's done you can scroll down to see all the various templates so down here one of the ones that you see is indeed the lego microgrid so when you see it just click on the download button and when that's done just select it alright so then here give it a name let's make it the lego micro game and just hit on create all right so here we are right away inside the micro game now here we see two options for getting started you can go ahead and explore on your own or you can start with the guided tutorials which is kind of the main point of the micro games they provide you with a guided path to learn and modify it teaches you about the various windows like the hierarchy inspector scene view and so on and also guides you to make some changes in the game and play them so you should definitely go through the tutorials especially if you are a beginner now in my case i won't go to explore since i've already done the tutorials and i want to showcase the game in action alright so we have the game let's hit play and try it out so here it is it's a third person action platformer so you've got basic movement along with jumping as well as a double jump and the whole world as you can see is made up of lego bricks over here we've got a platform made up of lego some pickups made of lego then over there we have a random creature and the world is all made up using lego so we've got a whole bunch of pickups we've got our double jump and then we even have a win condition so we touch this and there you go we won our nice micro game all right so that's the basics of the micro game now this particular micro game has some really interesting systems with behavior breaks and the brake building system essentially you can select tons of basic bricks just like real life lego and snap them into position again just like real life lego and then some breaks have some custom behavior that you can mix and match to make some really interesting complex behaviors so let's look at both of those systems first up over here on the scene view on the top left corner you can see these two buttons so the left one enables the brick building connections and the right one defines the brick selection so these two make up the brick building system so let's see what this does now in the project files you have tons of stuff to make pretty much anything you can think of and since it's lego everything is built up from a handful of basic bricks now over here on the island if you go into this right one you can see down here we have some basic bricks already placed so you can see we have a normal 2x4 brick then we also have some ram brakes some plants and this one with the different connector so you have these but you also have more basic brick types if you click on this and you'll look in the inspector over here you can see they're all inside a game object named star bricks so this one was originally prefab so you can go over here into the prefabs folder go under lego models and in here you have the brick collections so you've got the starter brick which is all these then you also have another one named cool bricks so let's go up here to a different island let's go into this one and just drag the coil breaks on there just like that so here you can see we have a ton more of brick types so you've got some random circles you've got some extenders you've got different shapes of basic bricks so you've got pretty much anything that you can use to build just about anything so if you're familiar with lego in real life this should all be quite familiar now if you select a single brick like let's say this 2x4 one over here in the inspector you can see the attached components so you have a brick script and a lego acid script now in working with this micro game you really don't need to touch the scripts at all everything works simply with drag and drop now we do see a warning here it's saying we cannot recolor the brick because it is inside a prefab instance and that's because we are editing the bricks over here inside our actual cool bricks prefab so we don't want to directly modify these ones so we want to use these as a base and copy them and use them elsewhere so we want to duplicate it but before we do that let's go up here and make sure we have the brick building disabled okay so the connection is not enabled now over here click ctrl d so this duplicates our object so there you go we have our copy right here and now we can move it let's say move it just in there and in the hierarchy just drag the object outside of the prefab so just drag it up here yep it's no longer part of the prefab alright so here we have our normal brick and over here we can now see and we can access the tilting cone so for example let's go with different one so over here you can pick a yellow you can pick pink blue green and so on you even have slightly transparent so yup just like that looks really interesting looks exactly just like lego alright we have our brick now let's do the same thing to copy a standard 2x2 brick so there's this one right here now again be careful that you see these other ones but these are behavior bricks so as you can see they have a bunch more scripts attached to them we're going to look at those in a bit but for now we want the basic brick shape so it's this one right here that doesn't have any more scripts so again let's just duplicate it drag it outside of the hierarchy and just move it near that one okay so we have our two nice bricks and now that we have these two let's use the brick building system so for that let's click on this button in order to enable the connections and now we click and drag on this brick and as soon as we start dragging it starts following the mouse so now we can let go of the mouse and now the brick is still following the mouse and the way it works is it automatically attaches to whatever is under the mouse so as i place the mouse over this yep there you go you can see that it snaps into the various valid positions so i can put it in there put it in there and so on so this will automatically snap into valid positions so you can connect these two breaks very simply so just click and if there you go it gets placed exactly on top on the perfect position now if i want i can leave the brick building system enabled and just hit ctrl d and now i'm holding another one of the example the same type and let's put it on this corner alright so there it is we have a basic brick shape so this is the brick building system it automatically snaps into the perfect positions now by the way before we go further let's just make one quick note here which is we drag the cool bricks prefab so here it is we have this one and as we saw in order to play around we should really take them away from the prefabs first so we can do the way that we did or another approach is over here right click on this one and then select unpack prefab completely so if you click on it and yep there you go now we have normal separate objects inside of a home prefab so that's just a quick tip for unpacking prefabs alright so we use the brake building system to make our very basic brick shape and now the other button next to it is for selecting a single brick or all of the connected bricks so in this case with this mode i can click and select just that one just down or just that one and if i click to select the other mode and i click it selects all three of them so it selects all the connected bricks now the other awesome system are the behavior bricks you can find them down here on the project files all inside this folder lego behavior bricks so this is a really awesome system essentially each one of these bricks has a specific behavior and then you can combine them and place them on top of objects to really define some complex behavior so it's sort of like visual scripting except instead of connecting dots in a virtual graph you place behavior objects physically in the world right now to play around with it let's use our nice shape so selecting the whole object and with the connection system enabled let's click and drag all right now let's go to where the player spawns so right here and let's drop it right in there all right so here it is our nice shape and by the way another thing you can rotate without these so just click and hold this and press alt d and there you go it rotates on the various directions all right so we have our nice basic shape and then down here we have our behavior bricks now let's try out the hover behavior so it's right here we have the hover behavior brick so make sure that brick building is enabled and now let's click and drag this anywhere on the scene and there you go now it's following the mouse and i would just go here and click to place it exactly on top of our object and if there we go that's it we've now added a nice hover behavior onto our shape so let's try hitting play and if right away we see our object and it is indeed hovering up and down so that's how the system works it's really simple you just place down behavior bricks and they do a certain action now like i said they can be combined in order to make some really awesome behaviors so our object has a hover behavior brick now let's also go here in order to add the rotate so again just drag it in there now it's following the mouse now i click and i place it right in there and now if we hit play and yep there you go now it's hovering and rotating so as you can see it's a really intuitive system you just connect the bricks and everything works and even though it is very simple to use it's also very powerful so for example let's go here on this area and let's look into our lego models let's go down here into environment and we have a nice mountain so just click and drag and place it right in there and now for example let's go into the behavior bricks and over here we have the explode brick so just click and drag and let's place it right on top of our mountain and then here on the script for the behavior breaks you can also play around the parameters so for example over here we have the power so we've got a power of 10 let's make it quite a bit more intense let's put it something like 30. all right so this brick will explode and destroy the mountain and now like i said you can combine multiple things so over here on our special object let's add a nice touch trigger so down here we have a touch trigger which like name implies it won't trigger an action when the player touches it so just click and drag it onto the scene let's connect onto our object now over here you see the touch trigger script and here for the things you see the scope where you can select to affect all the connected bricks or just this brick and then you see the target which can be the connected actions or can be specific actions so connected will essentially activate all of these and specific actions you can then give it a specific action so in this case we want to touch this and explore the mountain all right so here let's put it with a size of one and now we need to assign the section so over here we have our exfoliate object so just click and drag and drop it right in there and down here on the sense this is what is going to sense war so you can be the player for all breaks or any specific bricks in our case we want it to be the player so when the player touches this it's going to explode the mountain and do a really nice explosion alright let's test alright so here we are we have our nice rotating object and over there we have the mountain with the explosion and now as i approach and as i touch this object boom yeah there you go the mountain explodes and everything goes out flying alright so you can see the complex behavior you can make by combining simple actions so we added a touch node then we connected to an explosion as soon as we touched it exploded now like you see this one takes actions so for example you could connect this to the rotate and for example rotate the door only when you touch a button you could make it touch to enable an elevator or so on so down here you can see all the various behavior bricks available so you've got the alive which makes something seem like it's alive so it jumps up and down then you can play some audio you can have an elevator moving a platform up and down you can have the explode you can have the hazard which does damage to the player you can have the hover which moves up and down you can have them look at which won't look at a specific point like for example the player then you have to lose which won't cause the player to lose the game you have the move moving in a certain direction you have nearby trigger which triggers when the player or anything that it's sensing is within a certain distance then the pickup trigger which gets triggered whenever you touch a pickup then the pickup which is like this one you can pick it up then the platform which is the same as the elevator but goes horizontally inside of vertically then a random trigger which triggers a random action at some point between these two values then the rotate which rotates an object the shoot which fires projectiles then the timer trigger which triggers an action after a certain amount of time the touch trigger which as we saw happens when something touches the object and the wind which makes you win the level so you see how you have some basic simple actions that you can then combine them into really interesting ways so for example you could make an enemy so over here let's go into characters and let's drag let's say this part right here then let's go into the behavior bricks and let's drag the lookout brick so this will make sure that the burden looks at the player and again here make sure that this object is rotated correctly so this one we want it to face forward so let's pick it up but to do that let's select just one to just pick up just the object so pick it up now press alt d to rotate and okay now the eye is facing forward so policing like that okay then let's also add a shooting brick again make sure that it's facing forward and selecting look at and down here let's make a pause of zero so it always looks at the player let's test and yep there we have a bird and wherever i go it's looking at the player and it's constantly firing projectiles and if it hits me yep there you go i'm dead alright so you can see how this system is so powerful you can combine all these behaviors in order to make some really interesting scenarios and then just like all of the other micro games you have a bunch of mods on the official unity learn website so these are all guided stepbystep tutorials to modify the micro game even further so at the time of this recording there are three mods available so one of them is on swapping the main camera with a different one included in the project another one is on including a locked area and last one is on building a custom enemy check them out on the official until earned website alright so that's the brand new lego micro game made by unity now these micro games are all really interesting and a great starting point for beginners to learn from if you haven't seen it yet then go watch the video on my awesome game based on the fps micro game it shows you what you can build by taking these micro games as base alright now go ahead open up unity and play with some legos this video is made possible thanks to these awesome
