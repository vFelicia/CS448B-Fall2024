so here's how the pickup mechanic Works in my game here I'm controlling the player I approach this building capsule press a button and the player picks it up but then I can also approach this completely different object here is a dinky and yep I can also pick it up then on the other hand here is an automated moving vehicle and look at that it can also carry capsules and it can also carry denkis the way all this works is thanks to the power of interfaces I have an I carry object and an I carry object parent interface by implementing both these interface I can make anything carry any object if you don't know about interfaces definitely go ahead and learn about them I cover them in detail in another video and I also use them extensively in my free course and as you can see I'm using it right here in my own game
