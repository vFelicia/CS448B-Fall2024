hello and welcome I'm your code monkey min this video we're going to take our previous UI arrow pointer and customize it with different colors and sprites let's get started so here's the pointers from the previous videos I have several them pointing to different locations when the pointer is on screen it shows a arrow and when it gets on screen it shows a cross and right now when I get near it gets destroyed all right so let's modify the color of our sprites so in here on our create pointer function let's add two parameters one for the arrow color and one for the cross color let's send those two parameters into our quest pointer constructor all right so we are now receiving both colors in our constructor for our quest pointer object and here on our update if it is off screened and we're showing the arrow sprite so let's modify the pointer image color to be our arrow color and in here on our cross right let's use E cross so on our game hello let's give different colors to our different pointers so in here I'm going to go into the utens class which is part of the code mock utilities which you can grab from ent code monkey comm I'm going to use the get color from string function which essentially allows me to use a hex string and it won't return a color object so let's make this one red so ff0000 and for this one down here let's make it in green and finally down here let's make it in blue and give the exact same color to our process all right so let's test and see if our arrows show different colors yeah there you go that one is blue red and green and as I move the crosses also have the exact same color okay great alright so now let's test giving it a different color to our cross to make sure that one is correct so you have this one a white collar so on the first pointer it should be in red and when I get near the cross should display in white and when I get near and the crosses white yep great so we are correctly giving different colors to each of our pointers now another thing we can easily do since we can modify the colors is to make it Tran Spearin so let's test that now in here get come from strings supports sending a alpha value so with nuf of 0 it should be component ly transparent so there's the arrow and when I get near and poof there you the cross is in there but it is transparent this can be useful if all you want to do is direct the player to an area and not necessarily a very specific position alright so now that we got colors working let's customize our sprites so right now our code is actually already using dynamic sprites we're storing a member variable here and applying it in here but when we are creating we are sending our default sprites let's have the sprites as parameters so let's make a sprite for the arrow sprite and a sprite for the cross sprite let's make them optional so we have the font functionality so by default these won't be no so here it won't be no and here let's simply test if the parameter is no then we're going to set to our window arrow sprite and do the same thing for the across sprite so this way if we feed a normal in here we simply get the default our own sprite so it should be probably good when we don't want something extremely custom ok let's see if everything is still working using the default sprites and there you go the default arrow sprite so let's make a difference right alright so in here I have some different sprites I have a different arrow a different cross type and a exclamation point as if in an MMO so let's first go into our game Handler and add these sprites as serialized field so we can set them in the editor so a custom arrow sprites a custom cross sprite and a exclamation point sprite alright so for the first one let's leave it as is for the second one let's give it the custom arrow sprite and the custom cross sprite and for the third one let's give it the custom arrow sprite and the exclamation point sprite and let's make the exclamation point in yellow so young is red green and zero all right so now in our editor and let's drag our sprites in here okay so let's test and see if one of our customs rights are being correctly used all right as you can see these two sprites are the custom arrows which are different from that one and when I get near yep as you can see that one is using the custom cross sprite that one is using the default when I get close everything still works the same they still vanish and in this one when I get near yep there you go it's using the custom sprite which is a exclamation point and instant in yellow so there you have it we have a customization to our quest pointer to be able to have sprites more applicable to each pointer as always you can download the project files in utilities from indie code monkey comm if you have any questions post them in the comments and I'll do my best answer them subscribe for more videos and I'll see you next time
