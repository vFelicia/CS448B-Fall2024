foreign foreign foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign hey everyone how's it going is everything okay all right thank you for joining me that's nice okay it seems good all right all right so hey everyone thank you for being here on this random Wednesday that's the day yeah that's nice say what's ugc that's user uh user generated content which is unity's latest tool which I've been researching so over here the plan for this live stream is basically add a bunch of modding see how the tone works so it should be interesting basically I was going to research this by my own but then I figured well if I'm going to do it why not doing touring in live stream so let's see it all right okay so basically I want to do a bit of work so hopefully this will be interesting entertaining educational I'm not sure but hopefully you'll enjoy it okay all right so and feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to answer whilst trying to work at the same time that's always the big challenge but okay Chad monkey yeah sure thank you I take that as a compliment so yeah uh all right okay how does it work the modding well that's what I'm going to build right now so basically over here I've got my game kitchen chaos so that's a game that I built during the free course and basically with this I'm going to be working on how to add uh user generated recipes and things like that so it should be interesting would be user generated code uh for this one I'm just going to make it assets so just database so no code but technically the tool I think does support code and actually one interesting thing that I've been wanting to research for quite some time but so I haven't done it is Lua so that is supposedly a really nice scripting language that a lot of mods use so that is that's one of those things that I've had on my deal list to research for quite a while but still haven't been able to find it but yeah that should be interesting all right okay so let me get started trying to build it okay so first thing that I want to do is the game has a bunch of fixed uh yellow moon Roblox yeah Roblox use logo quite a lot yeah uh yeah so the first thing that I want to do is to be able to create some Dynamic kitchen object because right now all of these these are all fixed so these are all over here on edit time so I want to be able to edit one in runtime so that essentially means that I've got to instantiate one of these script mode objects in runtime then assign all these films and something like that okay all right so that sounds like a good start so let's begin let's create an easy sharp script for the kitchen game ugc something like this like Enough Five Nights at Freddy's for me horror is one of those things that I just can't handle so for me uh that actually kind of sucks seeing so many people praise things like Resident Evil and something like that but for me horror I really can't handle it so yeah I wish I could enjoy the things that those people enjoy but yeah I really I really can't hard is way too much for me where'd you learn all this coding Thing One by writing tons and tons of code over the past it's almost been 25 years so yeah if you write tons and tons of tons and tons of code over time you will learn and everything becomes much much easier so yeah experience strongly is the most important thing all right okay so on this one first thing that I want to do is I need to instantiate the new kitchen object uh and for that I think it's through scribble object create an instance okay let's create an instance of type kitchen objective so all right so this is going to give me a new kitchen object as so okay so then I just need to assign everything so I need to assign a name let's say test then I'm going to need to assign yeah that's the thing I need the prefab so this is the part that is going to be quite tricky and then I need a Sprite but for now let's just find something up here so gestationalize field for a uh debug prefab and then one for the Sprite just a Sprites okay stream Avatar is hotbound well if you want you can actually customize your own avatar so if you want to if you want you can draw and you can come up with your own thing just if you do it just let me know there's a nice guide over here on the website so you can customize you can do some basic customization or you can actually draw on top and do a bunch of things and draw just about anything so that should be fun and if you're curious as to how this whole thing works I've actually got links to various tutorials that I covered over here so if you want to see that yep how do you duplicate the lights fast what is the hotkey for it's literally just Ctrl C Ctrl V just select the line just like this so instead of selecting something just sound like this Ctrl C Ctrl V and just duplicate the line and then another one that is super useful is Ctrl X to cut an entire line so just those two shortcuts are super useful uh all right so over here I'm going to be using a debug prefab and a Sprite okay so now let's go back into Unity and over here I'm going to need to assign so the debug prefab now for that I'm going to need to something so you've been coding for 25 years can't even confirm that yep I mean I started when I was 10 years old by making RC scripts and now I'm almost 35 so yeah it's been 25 years quite a long time uh all right so first thing I need is a prefab so let me just drag this random cue make it into a prefab okay all right so there's no yeah that's that's all I need so just drag the cube prefab and the Sprite and let me choose something random let's say the warning Sprite okay so that pretty much creates a kitchen object dynamically uh then for yeah for testing for picking it up let me just make a nice container so let me select certain years old yeah I mean I started making super basic things so don't be confused on you know when I was 10 years old I wasn't doing the things that I'm doing nowadays so yeah I did start that age but definitely with a completely different skill set everything starts off much easier but yeah for the cgc that's user generated content okay so I need the container and basically on this container I need to assign my generated kitchen object the cell so that I can pick it up so that should be fun so up here let me just add a reference for the oh not caps container counter let's add this one then over here let me just drag the reference yes code instead of Visual Studio yeah I did use it when I made the turnbased strategy course I was indeed using vs code instead of visual studio and I don't know I prefer visual studio just seems honestly for no specific reason they are like 99 the same given the kind of things that I do with them so either one works but yeah I'm so used to visual studio there's really no need to do something different it works works perfectly fine does everything that I want it looks is only the same so yeah pretty much just stick with it but about starting a game company now really I mean my skill set is more learning things by myself and working by myself so the idea of managing a company managing a bunch of people that really does not does not appeal to me so so yeah for me it's uh I'm very happy making games pretty much just by myself just doing a car crap that's not it so yeah for me I really just prefer working by myself doing my things yeah I'm not opposed to working with others just I'm definitely not good at managing people so yeah that is something that would not suit me okay so set the kitchen object to so when we receive a kitchen object that so and then over here just set it so then on this one it's not set kitchen object but the kitchen object is so okay so I just need to set it and now the player should actually be able to interact with this generated kitchen object or so should be nice a game like TFT is that in fightatics yeah that should be fun that would be that was an interesting genre the uh what is called Auto Battlers yeah those were that was a fun genre it came in it suddenly exploded but then didn't really build into too much that is when I'm sure that I've wanted to explore for quite a bit uh okay so let me just test what do you mean by modding I mean adding things after the game is done so pretty much over here I'm trying to add some recipes and nope got an error okay what is the error what is no uh oh right it doesn't have it needs to have a kitchen object okay so once I do this yeah it's on the debug prefab so let me get a transform for the prefab and I'm going to instantiate just so that I make a copy of this one so I instantiate that one I use this one as the bug prefab and then on this prefab I need to that's not the one on this Prefab game object add component of type kitchen object and on the kitchen object I need to set the kitchen object as so I think that's all it takes so let's see right I need to implement this so let's see ugc is this gonna be a video yep I'm pretty much just doing researching right now but yep that is the goal to make it a video the tool is currently in open Alpha so uh let me just write this just this is second uh just Unity ugc because they've already announced the tool um yep there you go if you want another tool it is currently in open now for open Beta open Beta there it is so yeah if you want to start looking into it yeah that's pretty much the tone that I'm trying to research right now I'll try making your own custom game engine no that is making a game engine it sounds fun it is one thing that I would love to be able to do at some point but yeah making a game engine is really just a it's an extremely complex thing building everything from scratch so yeah usually the advice is either you want to make a game or you want to make a game engine you can't really do both so you gotta pick one or the other so I'd love to research it at one point just learn how to work with opengl or DirectX learning how to work it really close to the metal that should be would be a fun thing so if I could find time I would love to research that but yeah pretty much if you want to make aim then just use a game engine whatever game engine takes yeah uh okay so set kitchen object over here I'm going to set it and set it to you this kitchen object or so okay so like this the player should be able to pick up that one so let's see if it does work any reason why the reason why you didn't use a capsule Collider doing physical cast seems a bit hard uh there's always many many ways to solve any problem and for that that is actually a very common question I've got that question plenty of time so over here on the course website there's some kind of FAQ so that one's on the character controller so over here yep the question so why move a transform to a capsule cast instead of rigid body in the calendar and the answer is there are many many options so you could definitely use that if you wanted that is one found option and in this case I just did it just to avoid using rigid bodies because the entire goal for this course was to prepare for the second course which is on making in multiplayer and multiplayer you should really avoid using rigid bodies whenever possible so that's the main reason why why I chose to go with a capsule cast pretty much is handling it manually instead of using a rigid body but yeah using a ridge body in the calendar that works just fine so if you want definitely do that any new channel members hey thank you right thanks for becoming a member that's nice thank you okay uh what was I doing um uh oh right I was trying to see if this works and if they're going with that I've got a custom kitchen object it's just a cube but technically it is a kitchen object can I even deliver this or well I guess not because it's not on a plate can I add it onto a plate that's a good question can I go nope all right so I need to add it onto all right great so but just like this I am indeed uh creating some Dynamic objects in runtime okay so that's great all right boy so many questions sorry I'm trying to keep up trying to work and answer questions at the same time yeah make time increase with delivery yep that would be if you wanted to make this game a bit more challenging a bit more score based then yep that would be one excellent uh Improvement internship being a character Bill using one shapes oh that's interesting one shape is actually something that I haven't used too much there's not that many uh asset packs that have it uh yeah they are really interesting it's a really great way of adding customization although yeah my question is how do you actually do that as a 3D modeler do you have to yeah I assume you have to position all the bones and then say modifying this slider modifies this bone this Direction that's a it's an interesting topic definitely something that I would love to research okay so yeah do you think it's best to start as a beginner well I mean this is a Unity channel so I'm going to say Unity but I'm also going to say any engine is great nowadays really as game developers we are supporting for choice if you choose Unity or unreal organelle there's pretty much no wrong answer so whatever you do just pick something and yeah pick something and start learning that's much more important than actually trying to pick the perfect thing and being stuck forever so just pick something and start learning bones and lender first and rigged up in unity oh that's interesting yeah I wonder how that process works because yeah blend shapes they are indeed quite interesting but not many asset packs seem to have them so well actually usually I stick with low poly acid so maybe that's why I think more realistic hard selling benefits quite a bit more from blend shape so maybe those do tend to have them uh okay just over here just a quick one on the game object let me set active and do false except officially a good question how do I spawn a prefab but then can I disable it from the scene because I think this is actually going to so remember try creating a prefab for something hmm if I go in there pick it up yeah there you go he did pick it up but it is invisible all right so this is a bit annoying spawning the prefab but well I guess I can just set the prefab dot position equals new Vector three let's put it on a thousand zero zero just so that it doesn't show up over there in the middle with your YouTube video that's nice thank you who is not using dark mode yeah for me dark mode really destroys my eyes so yeah that is definitely not something that I can use all right awesome so here I am moving around a random ingredient which is just a cube but yep that does work okay all right great considered to be the most successful in the dev on YouTube I mean that really depends on what you what Niche you're talking about I mean in terms of uh devlogs there are so many channels so much bigger than me the obvious question is Danny so yeah but yeah honestly the main thing is there's there's so much content so many awesome things so if you go to ah corrupt this is the the issue so search for example tardev has a great Channel a bunch of tutorials all of them really nice this one runs sine waves this one is really cool then samyam also has some great ones I was looking at a bunch of our unit uh input System videos so yeah tons of awesome stuff yeah so yeah if you want to learn uh uh Game Dev on YouTube then yeah thankfully nowadays there are tons and tons of options basically when I got started there was no such thing so yeah if I was starting today things would be quite a bit easier which would be fun so yeah it's always right uh okay great so let me just think notification remember yeah it's not broken just manual so once again thanks so much Eliana thank you for becoming a channel member that's nice um okay let me think what do I want to do I would want to make uh some kind of recipe and then I'll worry about uploading it to ugc and downloading and so on uh okay so for now let me make a custom Dynamic recipe so in order to be able to do that first I need to actually be able to add it to the plate and in order to be able to add ingredients onto the plate I need to uh what do I do that's a good question is it on the plate prefound on the plate prefab yep it does have a valid kitchen object and some list uh okay so let me uh where's the oh do I need a reference to the prefab itself right because this is spawning oh that's actually a good question I'm trying to think that's the prefab update well I guess it doesn't matter because it happens in the beginning anyways uh right so I need a plate kitchen object prefab so let me go into my ugc script and over here let me add a Plate Kitchen object for the play kitchen object prefab so I'm going to take that one and pretty much on the valid yeah right I need to access it so let me go into this one this one has a valent kitchen object list okay so totally void add kitchen object so to the list and going to receive a kitchen object as soon and on the Valley Kitchen I'll do this on the list let's add this one so then on this one let me add kitchen object and so this kitchen object so and just with this hopefully I should be able to add my Dynamic object onto that one so that should be fun would you start making games with well at first Army game just with textbased things so just modding Merck and doing a bunch of IRC scripts and I forgot the reference of course uh but then afterwards I spent quite a bunch of time making Flash games so that was really awesome flash really was an amazing thing it's such a shame that it died but yeah for me flash really helped me in the about five years that I was working on flash I managed to create about 40 games on all kinds of genres and that really helped me on my own learning process so that was really great for me learning how to do this thing hey there you go it works oh crap that's the issue the visual yeah it does show up the icon but it doesn't oh okay hmm and be tricky but you make chat able to interact with the live stream that is using the uni uh the Youtube API so actually we've got a bunch of tutorials on the where here it is this is where you can customize your live stream character and down here at the bottom it is talking about how I use this so first the main thing is really the HTTP request in order to interact with the YouTube API and with that yep you can do all kinds of things uh okay so here right that's actually one issue that I wasn't thinking about yeah because the way that I handled the plate that one hmm okay I guess I need to add the visual onto the all right yeah that's gonna be tricky but anyways for now let me just try to get the liver down that one failed okay so let me but anyways now I can add it on to that one and now let's go into that one teach about game marketing well I made a phone video on that so if you want I highly encourage well there's a bunch of videos but the main one is the uh it's actually not here it's important most important thing yeah if you want to learn about marketing which is extremely important definitely go ahead and dot yeah uh uh right okay so let me just okay so like this I can I can generate a a new kitchen object and runtime so that's great then I can add to a kitchen counter and I can do all kinds of things okay so that's good I can add them to a plate so the next thing is really just creating a recipe and being able to generate that recipe okay multiplayer game with reconnect feature uh that's depends on what you mean by that I'm guessing you mean actually changing hose which is quite difficult whereas reconnect that is actually quite simple you just literally connect again and everything will connect if you show the C sharp essential for splitting up code things uh learning how to use interfaces generics but yeah there's no there's no one single csharp thing it's more about how you use all the tools at your disposal that is the main thing you know uh uh okay so let me do that let me create a new recipe so let me remember which one was my thing so the recipe so okay so I need to create the recipe so and I need to add it onto the list and just with that it should spawn so let me add a reference for the recipe and listen Okay for the recipe list so if you need a reference to that and then I'm going to need to create so let me just go into scriptable object create an instance of type recipe so okay so this is my new recipe so recipe so and on this recipe I said what do I have it's just a list of kitchen objects so for the recipe name my recipe and for the recipe so for the kitchen object list let me just oh excellent that's a good question is this going to throw in there I'm actually not sure do I need to initialize it we shall see I guess okay so that it's a recipe so then the recipient list so let me just add uh yeah that one doesn't have it it has a recipe as simple list let me add this recipe okay great so that should actually do it uh all right that should be fun made your website yep I made it myself which isn't yeah it's uh that is why it doesn't look perfect because I'm definitely not a great web developer but it is functional so so yeah police status functions so that's good uh but yeah uh okay got an error because obviously I forgot to drag a reference it's always the same thing let's see all right PHP yep it is in PHP that is I'm not familiar with all the various JavaScript libraries so for me I just stick with basic PhD okay so this is the error so apparently I do need to initialize it so and you list and inside let me put the kitchen object as so okay hello all right time is at 11 50. hmm uh okay all right so nowhere so far uh the main thing is waiting for is it going to spawn my recipe let's see no mega burger no come on spawn my own actually let me check the oh crap I'm actually sort of messing up something oh it did spawn type mismatch really I guess because it's Dynamic oh that's interesting I've never seen that happen before yeah why does this one say type mismatch because apparently it is correct so there it is my recipe so if I pick up one of these pick up a cube for some reason people want to eat cubes I don't know why uh okay so I add the cube on there now if I deliver it if there you go works all right awesome okay so that is great need to be a course suit no it's going to be a standalone tutorial on using uh use generate content pretty much adding more uh mods and things your voice sounds sick yep I'm physically fine but yeah my nose is all clogged up it's been like this for one week I actually wanted to make this live stream last week but I was all messed up and today I don't know I'm pretty much tired of waiting for my voice to come back to normal so that is why I decided to do it right away um okay so this did work I was able to generate a brand new kitchen object at runtime I was able to add it onto a plate and I was able to deliver the recipe so that was extremely pretty good and now if I leave yeah this is actually the problem hmm how am I going to handle a cleanup that's an interesting question maybe I add another list oh that is tricky that is actually interesting uh hmm I mean it's not a problem I can just manually delete it but on the recipe only says so let me see how many references do I have to this uh it's actually just one yeah so it could actually try and think could I emerge two recipes together okay basically it's the issue is that I'm modifying it's actually interesting because this is kind of like what I covered in the script ball objects video which is how in the editor this is actually modifying the sort of object whereas if this was running on build this would actually not be a problem because the script object would never be modified hmm okay I think right now I'll just leave it like this do it manually and then I won't see okay did the course made me want to learn code again think for the great course Ah that's awesome hey that's really great they invest in like in your own Learning Journey that's cool makes it on the list yeah that's what I was thinking about but then over here it would merge both lists so that would be a bit annoying but yeah I do think that is probably the best course of action so I do ugc recipes on list and then the only references over here on this one so this one I would do a public list of recipe so get full recipe so list and over here just return a new let me make a new list a list of recipe so so recipe so list let me actually call it the full recipe assemble list then on this one let's add range add the basic recipient so and the ugc recipe so just return the full recipe or so so yeah like this does work it's a bit annoying how it's pretty much wasting memory but really that's not quite an issue so unless the recipe so so the rest of BSN list just go into the recipe list so in order to get the phone rescue us on the list and then I just access this one and this one and like this yep it's going to do both of them and then on the other side on the kitchen game ugc what sport modding are you adding right now I'm just adding uh mod support for the game in order to be able to dynamically generate some recipes and some things and afterwards yep it will be implementing unity's ugc which is their user generated content tool which they've just launched into open Beta so this is what I am researching uh okay so where was I well this will add except I uh instead of that let me yeah all I got to do is basically just initialize it and then add it and this way it doesn't quite matter right yeah visualization can be so fun yeah I know I know okay all right uh okay so let me stone has zero but now as I spawn it should have one entry okay and there's actually an error why is there an error it only cannot be known what value UI elements okay that's odd because I'm not using UI elements all right anyways so now I close and that one still has a missing recipe that's fine because now if I select it against our new one it should destroy that one and spawn a brand new one and yep there you go type mismatch although this is very strange apparently the unity is having some weird bug parameter yunty self okay that's range apparently enty has some weird bug what if I don't select the object ugc was not a thing back when I added it yeah this is a recent tool but yeah it is similar to cmore shop of course the the obvious benefit is that Sim Workshop only works on Steam whereas this works anywhere so you can use this for like game Jam games that you publish on itch you could definitely use this to add some modding for that so that should be fun uh okay so that worked it just didn't spawn the recipe that I want let me actually uh modify this one let me put this one just one and then mine that way increase the odds that that one is going to work yeah 22. there's some weird bugs yeah I can't wait for 22 to actually go into LTS which should be hopefully soon somewhere on 22.2.17 and we're in the middle of that so yeah if your life has a Game Dev I'm definitely not good at making kind of Vlog content so I don't know I enjoy watching those videos but I don't think I'd be able to make an interesting one so yeah that would be interesting but yeah I need to learn how to work with cameras to do all kinds of real life footage and so on that of his own nope I've never seen it I've seen the movie though that was fun your vision moving that was has some interesting sounds so that was that was interesting um all right so basically with this I have successfully added some uh Dynamic recipe all right okay on the website using custom code yep it is I wrote I wrote it all using PHP from scratch so yeah no website builder no WordPress all of it like that uh all right okay so let me think Hmm okay so like this it is already working I can already generate a new kitchen object I can spawn the visual which is actually going to be quite tricky but anyways I can add it to the list I can create the recipe and do that all right so okay so now actually the next tricky thing is how on Earth am I going to okay let me think uh because basically uh all right so like this it is working now I need to somehow serialize all this data put it in some kind of binary something uh except Sprites that is gonna be a tricky thing okay so let me try to convert the kitchen object the so into a into a save file yeah I think the prefab is going to be the tricky thing how do I synchronize the mesh how do I make that into a marble thing uh okay so uh let's start by doing a public class for uh I don't know modded kitchen object or so something like this so now inside of it uh instead I'm going to need a string for the name so that's pretty basic actually this one shouldn't be the name should it yeah it should be the object name so I've been using this wrong doesn't really matter but anyways uh okay so I got the object name then I'm going to need the Sprite but for the Sprites actually not going to be the Sprite it's going to be some kind of PNG right yes oh so many messages I like working with cameras and modding and vlogging they're about in your life video with a cut scene cutscene made with Cynthia that would be a fun idea uh I don't know that could be that could be fun that could be interesting uh does modding Works online well yeah I mean modding is really just being able to dynamically load more data onto your game so yep what is ugc that's user generated content which is unity's recent tune which I'm currently researching in order to be able to make a video in the future okay so basically for the modded kitchen objects so I'm going to need an object name that I'm going to need actually yeah I'm thinking about this a bit wrong uh Hey new channel member thank you actually 3105 what does the numbers mean uh thank you so much hey thank you for becoming a channel member I don't like making topdown games I don't know I just do I like an overhead camera I like strategy games I like being being able to see things so yeah uh okay so basically like this at its own all working now the next step is instead of using prefabs and Sprites I need to be able to dynamically load based on just my birthday wow so you're from the future that's fun uh uh I need to be able to so okay okay let me grab some texture actually I had some things that I was trying out yeah I've got a a nice uh Gamepad over here and actually yeah I was already researching this a while ago and I got a bunch of things I was unloading it um I was doing a file open shh I always feel that I'm writing code the wrong way I mean not to code itself but the game mechanics Pharaoh if it works it works yeah sure that's the main thing if it works then great it works and then over time obviously it's uh being able to do it not just that it works but that it works and importantly that it continues working in the future so yeah that's uh kind of thing in the beginning yep just working that's that's when enough but if it just works but it's really dirty then as the game development continues and becomes hard and harder to implement things add more things so that is why that is why clean code is so important it is not necessarily because it makes it better as you write it right away but rather when you come back to it after a week after a month you can still understand the code whereas if you write it quick and dirty you won't probably not understand it after quite some time hey new new memory thank you so much all right the Crux that's a nice name nice icon all right thank you so much for becoming a member it's nice thank you uh okay so let me think so basically I'm going to need the okay let me think let me think actually on the docs they had how to on the ugc docs they had it to convert into a Sprite yeah so I'm pretty much going to use this function okay so let me all right Focus sorry I'm a bit distracted trying to do a billion things at once so let me try to dynamically a little bit of sprite instead of doing it like this so let me grab it from a file so uh from a file do I do found that open because I'm trying to think of how would the mods be stored there would be as an array of bytes but I guess you know what's the difference between open and open read I assume those are the same actually so let me just so pick up the Gamepad okay this gives me a thumbnail stream can I just read it's always confusing how to read do I read them as bytes or not that's a good question uh no yeah I did have the the things so read it onto the byte array so by the array I read it I'm going to read this one onto the byte array and I'm going to yep okay so that reads it but then for the the code this one takes oh the load image I don't remember what is what is this one like the uh texture 2D this one dot load image does this one take it takes an array of bytes all right huh so will it actually work like this that's a good question so maybe this one did work where was I right here so pretty much just need to create a Sprite animation on change from script in my clone enemies what sorry I don't understand uh okay so creating a Sprite the double texture width and height yeah I think like this okay so let's see if this is loading that Gamepad Sprite dynamically because certainly if it does then actually this is going to be perhaps easier than I thought uh right I just forgot how do I okay so let me grab something now let me go into the player and the player is holding something players holding this hey thank you so much for becoming Channel member thank you uh so he's holding something which has a kitchen object so which in turn has a Sprite and if there you go there's a Sprite okay so that seemed like it worked all right different courses while I'm doing a fulltime job the answer is learning a tiny tiny bit every single day that's pretty much it rather than doing sprints where you learn nonstop for 12 hours a day no instead of just focus on doing 30 minutes in the night every single day whenever you have time that's pretty much How We Do It all right okay all right so this actually worked I actually loaded a thumbnail and loaded a bunch of bytes and that did work and I did get that certainly with this I could download the bytes from unity's ugc and everything would work so that would be nice uh then the tricky part is actually the mesh so that is actually going to be the Super tricky one and for the mesh from what I see it's actually quite tricky to Unity dynamically flowed a DOT fbx from what I see this actually quite true yeah this is what I saw that apparently obj is easier yeah does fbx belong to 3ds Max or Autodesk that's a question I don't know if fbx is shh but yeah basically yeah I remember researching this a while ago and basically loading fbx in runtime it's really difficult basically need to use asset bundles and things so maybe I could create the fbx's yeah fbx is used everywhere but apparently it seems to be some kind of close format so that is why it becomes a bit trickier and I think I saw that download instead of an fbx8. obj and I think that one should be easier foreign mods too uh I remember that I saw a question uh they asked the question on the uh GDC panel and the answer was that it depends on the platform basically there are some platforms where you can indeed definitely load code so I believe on Windows you can do it but for example on consoles I don't think you can do it and on iOS I don't think you can do it so that depends on the platforms but that really just refers to compound code things like csharp uh that is why for most part mods use something like Lewis so some kind of scripting language so if you're going to go into Mods yeah using Lewis seems like it would be the better approach as opposed to actually using uh actually using uh what am I saying C sharp yeah okay so I think obj would be better what is this obj importer oh great Unity week is now oh no uh for new BJ at runtime in unity the question is does unity have a builtin imported or not that's the thing I wanted to use something that was built in the title BJ is this a assets or two only a oh it appears to be free but yeah I want to uh yeah that's what's going to be okay anyways but yeah I do think that obj does work so the first thing is actually confirm or maybe just hmm yeah the obj important yeah because I think this is the but the other one did have so Unity the obj important is this a thing no that one's just the acid store ah crap uh the sr2 something on GitHub there's a model importer well import settings from editor scripts no I don't want editor Scripts on it in runtime I mean I guess technically I could import the mesh no that would be annoying I mean technically it would work but yeah yeah pretty much everyone is pointing to that too I mean I guess if need be maybe I won't use that one since it appears to be free so yeah hey look at that nice car and that's fun what do you want obj I'm trying to do modding and I want the players to be able to mod also the visual for the recipe and yeah that would be the tricky thing because apparently um during runtime apparently in unity yeah Dynamic mesh loader yeah Dynamic loading of the mesh data that would work maybe I might look into that one anyways uh okay so I think I'll check that out later and for now try to get this one yobj over fvx because apparently fbx is proprietary and it's really difficult to import in runtime that's pretty much the only reason because from what I saw that one is really tricky and obj seems to be easier at runtime so for making mods that one appears to be better okay all right okay so I guess for now let me worry about that in a little bit and for now maybe let's try working with the actual ugc thing in order to try to upload and download the mods but for that okay let me think because ugc does have a slight limitation which is that it only supports one file so basically I need to open everything onto just one file so I need to go into the kitchen game EGC and I need to make some kind of file format you have an obj important it does but apparently it's only on the editor so that's the issue it works in the editor but not in runtime so yeah that is going to be a little bit tricky uh okay so for static data I'm going to have someone like the object name okay okay let me start writing and think at the same time uh yeah actually input imagine uh that crap my brain isn't working uh all right so I want to file and basically on a file I went to public a byte array for the icon by the ray then I'm eventually going to have also for the other one and for the object name so this is also going to be a byte array for the for the what do I call it uh Json data maybe something like this uh because if I call it name uh nah nah because yeah it just has a name so name byte array then I need a public I'm trying to think trying to think it's learning optimization important as a beginner mini Depends for the most part if your game runs and that's great then afterwards focus on optimization so I wouldn't worry about it from the very beginning but yeah steam doesn't have an API or some handlebots yep seem does have Steam Workshop so Unity is trying to sort of compete with that with this new tool with the user generated content tool so should be interesting it does have a bunch of Pros so a bunch of things since uh steam hasn't really had much uh Improvement since Steam Workshop was announced which was like 10 years ago so yeah they're trying to push it forward so if you just join recently this is what I'm talking about their latest fuel on user generate content uh can load an animation oh really I didn't know that but yeah right now animation is not something that I'm thinking about for this type of modding but yeah it's a good to know that limitation okay uh this Roadshow reminded me that I wasn't surprised all right thank you uh okay so let me think all right so I need the icon by Terrain okay so I need that I need the name but then I need the offset right try and think how did I handle this ah crap I don't let me go back and rewatch one of my videos because I don't remember how that I implement it my brain is drawing a blank right now yeah right so I've got uh get a Json converted into that no where's the header because I was seeing the header where did I put the header right so for the header I just put the Json byte size and then on the Json bite size over there I hold the rest yeah of course and look at my own videos to remember how I did things that's pretty much it uh yeah so essentially I need the header I need the header to contain the byte size and then yeah I had just the the header bytes as just a u short right yeah exactly exactly and then I have because I'm trying to think the reason is working with bytes is always so tricky uh but yeah I have some kind of header class and on the header I've got a public uh yeah for the Json bite size that's really all I need Json byte size uh so probably class for the found data and then on the found data I'm going to have a public hand for the icon byte array and another one for the name byte array size so this is size for both of these just trying to think how do I convert this into a file and without it so okay let me do a public void and I'm going to pull some save and over here let me receive a do I take a yeah so a string for the what are you called for the uh icon path then we have a string for the name or the object name something like that okay so for the icon path can you do a repab basically I'm doing research in order to be able to do the easier to generate content but actually right now on this live stream I've already managed to get quite a bit working so thing that I got right now is already working quite well so I've got the game and I dynamically generated a kitchen object to sell so here are the regular kitchen objects so some tomato I can slice it and so on and then over here I've got a a kitchen object which is just a basic Cube so this was generated in runtime rather than being built into the game itself so this would be the example of a mod I can add it onto a plate and there you go it has a nice icon and then I can deliver it my recipe and there you go success so yeah If you experience a crash uh sometimes not much but yeah sometimes my Super Chat just did not show up Super Chat I didn't see anything that's odd um okay so I got the icon path and I need to basically yeah basically loaded into bytes go into the icon path so unload it downloaded into the byte race that is going to be the icon byte array and then the bytes red so let me go found data found data equals a new found data then on the found data dot icon byte array size it's going to be this guy okay it's your favorite asset I mean that is really difficult because there are so many assets that do so many things so it really depends on the context if you want to make talk about visuals analog City Studios talking about tools I love things like Ray fire or something actually Unity has a spring sale starting later today so stay tuned for my video doing an overview of my favorite tests on the sale but yeah there are so many awesome tools that can really help speed up the process so yeah of course learning how to make an FPS game uh I've got my visual uh visual scripting course does have an FPS game but yeah in terms of regular code no I haven't done one of those that would be interesting okay why isn't real struggling with mobile ports but they can rent Millions on PC because those are completely different architectures so rendering a game on a PC isn't really the same as rendering it on a mobile chip those are completely different things and for them they spend most of their engineering resources on targeting highend machines so that's pretty much it SMD YouTuber ah thank you that's nice uh okay so let me let me think uh okay so I'm basically setting the icon by terrain the name and I've got that one okay great so then eventually I'm going to need to convert the file data I'm going to convert Json utility dot to Json convert this found data into Json so the strings will file data Json I found that read on by Tia good question yeah good point because I was yeah because I was using it like this just because this is what the the documentation for ugc was using just using file.open because the uh uh where it is over here yeah because then for uploading content they require a file stream so that is why I'm using this method but yeah over here for for my own method when all I want is just some byte array then yeah I found out read on bytes would indeed be quite a bit easier um okay so foundat.json then a header header equals a new header and on the header I need to put the Json byte size uh all right now I don't remember uh how do I convert this into yeah I really should probably yeah the uh encoding Dot I never know should I use unique code or should I use etf8 I never know which one is supposedly the best but get bytes isn't it get bites yeah let's get bytes facing the found that Json so that Returns the byte array for the file data bytes byte array uh okay so this is actually something that I need to store as well okay perform both because they spend tons of their engineering effort on supporting all the platforms that's really it there's no magic within the engine itself it just depends on what your focus is that same reason why unreal usually has better visuals than Unity because that is their main focus so yeah hmm I don't know after finishing the multiplayer courses beginner maybe don't look into my turnbased strategy course which I'm also working on a free expansion for that one so if you want to learn about good clean code then yeah that course would be very nice if you go to that one if you value good clean code then that course will really help you all right uh okay so for the Json byte size I'm going to be this one dot length so then I need the end for the header size X except it's not an INF it's a u short so I can see the expansion yeah it's going surprisingly well I thought it was going to be really tricky to handle multiple levels but it was actually surprisingly easy so that was that was good uh yeah for the header size I just take the link converted it into that one oh yeah so that's what I was that's what I was doing so I convert the header size at a u short so wait do I need the um oh I converted a header into Json as well right yeah it makes sense so Json utility.2 Json for the header so that's the string for the header Json so there is this one done on this one I convert it into a byte array so the same thing encoding Dot unicode.getbytes get bytes for the header Json this returns a byte array for the header byte array and then for the harder sizes on that link and just need to convert it into a u short so basically the header size needs to be of a certain thing and then I've got the byte array for the header size byte array which is going to be the header size uh as a battery how do I do it apparently I use bit converter in order to get the bytes get the bytes of this Setter size okay right so basically with that I've got okay hey thank you for being here thanks for watching the videos I hope the videos have been helpful for your Learning Journey that's pretty much what I do and thank you all for being here watching on this random unplanned live stream yeah Okay so crap I really I should probably just open up that thumb that would probably be easier Works easy just watching you on stream does it because on stream I'm definitely uh struggling quite a bit more than on a final published video because that's just how game development Works what you see on the final video is really the the the final polish video so that doesn't include all the time that I spent just trial and error just trying to figure out how do I do all this how do I store all the bytes in a single file that is always super difficult so it's interesting all right so right on bytes and this one takes a path and then just a byte array some list of bytes so the complete by the list I think there's going to seeing this wrong yeah definitely I mean it can definitely give a misleading picture if all you watch is just fine on polished videos it seems that everything is way too easy but yeah you feel a lot behind it for every single tutorial that you watch there's tons and tons of work that goes before uh behind the actual published video so yeah how do I know when the live streams are happening I mean I don't really have a fixed schedule I just do them when I when when I have some kind of work to do that also fits well on a live stream so yeah the the way I just use the the uh the Bell icon on YouTube or maybe on the website sign up to receive emails and yeah that's pretty much it I usually send an email and set it live about 10 minutes before I go live so yeah I wish there was maybe one day I won't have a fixed schedule we're at a certain time per week I will always be but yeah for the most part the live streams are very much uh improvised so yeah it's kind of hard to say ahead of time okay so this one is two array and let me put this on application.crap dot data path plus uh byte save dot bytes something like this okay so for the complete button list I'm going to add actually add range now add so add range I first add the Heather bite size okay so that tells me the size of the header which in turn is going to tell me right yeah yeah I think that's trying to remember how I how I did this but yeah pretty much it just runs one of your last videos you are 100 not perfect just awesome that's nice thank you yeah I'm definitely not perfect I definitely I try my best to do things but yep just because I do something that does not mean it's the only way there are only so many ways to solve every problem so yeah uh okay so I had the header size all right with that I can then read the header bytes by reading the Heather bytes I can then read uh yeah the Heather byte array does include that right I'm trying to think actually let me do a quick test just make sure that all of this is indeed working so hey only going load actually why am I putting these inside the yeah yeah there's no need to put this inside so I have no idea why I'm putting them inside this font anyways it doesn't doesn't matter I'll clean it up after a little bit uh okay so front load from the read yeah over here let me use the readout bytes let me use the exact same path just read that so this is the byte array for the complete byte array and yeah so let me do a debug download this one dot length so bytes let's see this and over here before I save it let's go to this one the account let's see this okay so let me just do a quick test because I haven't tested anything in ages so let's just make sure this is working so let me just create this object and then on this guy let me call Save and this guy let me call load except for Save I need to pass in something even though I'm not really using this right now but okay let's just do it like this and the object name my object is a real map uh uh all right so let's test and see if this does work okay someone can add their own recipe to the game yep that's that's the only that's what I'm trying to do trying to make it so that you can mod new recipes new objects and new things so let's run and see if there's any error and after a while and hope it did work all right so it saved 40 bytes and it loaded 40 bytes okay so that's good so now these 40 bytes I want to get them back so how do I get the array can I slice it away I don't think I can no so let me make a list of bite that list of bite uh complete by the list equals a new list of byte let me convert the array onto a list then onto this list I can call can I slice okay now I'm confused doesn't the list have a slice function pretty sure oh no it's copy two yeah that's exactly especially does the battery also have a copy two yeah it also does copy to an array with an index but wasn't there a way to grab something that's actually interesting I thought it did but it's an extension oh that's interesting and on the list yeah you got add range would be nice to have a slice I thought it had but apparently not oh get range okay so maybe this is what I want okay so this is what I want all right I knew there was something all right so get range so on zero and now I need to remember how big is a ushort I think it's two bites right yeah I think it's two bites yeah I think so so this is going to be a list of bite so the Heather bite list it's going to be this and then it's nice and easy sharp version so really they're improving list that's fun uh okay so yeah I think it's on the bit convert I should really just go and grab down so you short you see you short a and 16 uh good question is it oh yeah it is it returns to you short it's always confusing how there are so many names but yeah so this one into a white list does not work do you need do you not work with the list it takes a span or a byte Valley so to array and then start index is on zero so it's going to return you short for the header uh break on header size to get your animations and sound effects I mean mostly from the accessor the SSR or humble bubbles or any kind of sales that's pretty much it I mean the SSR has tons and tons of stuff and if you want to find them for free there was a good sound or was it free sound is that the name yeah that's the one so if you want sound effects and this one has a bunch of free ones which are fun definitely take a look at the uh licenses but yeah if you're looking for free sounds that is a good one the UI section where the first icon recipe is showing when the second one is added it sounds like you probably forgot to answer the uh you forgot to disable the template that is usually the issue it is basically showing the template and then whatever is on there um why don't you use the VAR keyword personally I don't like it I find that it makes the code hard to read I want to be very explicit about what type I'm working with so personally I do not like VAR but if you do then definitely use it for example on the for example over here on the docs Unity themselves like to use Varn personally I don't like it but yeah if you don't like it then definitely uh look into it save it but seems the same problem well you can download the project files for that lecture and compare with your own so maybe you set up something different in the prefab something like that CNT asset spring sale starting exactly starting today in about uh I think it's at 4 P.M so there will be in about four or five hours so yeah all right uh let me just um debug that log the Heather size the other size let me just see if this one yeah so just up here let me just see what you debug.log saving and then down here the Volvo Vlog just saying loading all right okay so let's see if this is working so far text mesh Pro specifically with a countdown uh I don't know what specific issue you have with a countdown but I do have a countdown on the kitchen chaos game so you can definitely look into how I did that one so that is I was on the you can watch the course it's on the Polish stage over here I added the countdown so if you go and watch the Polish stage lecture you should be able to see how implemented the countdown code this light screen my eyes are burning already well that's what happens to me on the opposite which is on the uh on dark mode the misborne um Heather size 38 oh right it's not yeah it's not using 38 bytes it's just exactly the header size itself is 30 okay so that did work okay great yes okay so invite offset equals the username on that one or let's go inside offset equals zero then byte offset plus equals two then on the complete byte list once again let me call get range and I'm going to get range on the byte offset and for the count so what is the one that I want so basically I've got the exactly using the Heather size I want to get that range and that is going to give me the header size by the array or actually it has a size byte list equals out so a list of byte yeah you have to go to the bathroom during the live stream no I I never do live streams that are that long so yeah so far that has not been an issue but yeah other size okay so this is the how to size byte list that gets me that so now I just need to reverse this one place I think that I'm doing this right so get string and I'll take the byte list can you take it by the list nope oh these only work with the Rays that's a bit annoying but okay so for the Heather Json then Heather Heather equals Json utility Dot from Json of type header for the Heather Json uh yep so the other size that one did work and the bug don't log going to the Heather and let me grab the Json bite size yeah exactly then on the header I hold the Json byte size and then also the image byte size then I put both them okay externalization for save mode yeah but over here I'm not uh working just with serializable types that is what I need to work with byte arrays okay because on the file I'm going to need to store the image icon so that is why I need to work with bytes instead of doing basal serialization um okay so the other Json bite size is it an inspiration Ah that's awesome I'm glad the videos have humped you on your Learning Journey let's go with them so thank you uh okay so let's see if this one is loading the Json bite size well let's print the exact same thing up here okay let's see if that one is working what time is it midday 40 yeah my voice already quite a bit messed up I think Newton's South Json is more powerful it kind of is but it also has issues like that one has a very very annoying bug which is regarding the um how it has issues with serializing Vector is it Vector three yeah it's Vector threes because the vector 3 has a forward which in turn is a vector 3 so it causes a a Loop cycle thing so yeah every time that I've used it it is always super tricky so that is why for the most part when working with the entity I tend to use Json utility yeah uh okay so anyway so with this I've got the I've got the header so then I just need my final data so this is the one that I converted into Json right actually I could put it on the header anyways right now I just want to make sure that I get working so that one the Heather has the Json bite size which is going to be the founder array okay so let me continue doing pretty much the exact same thing so instead of the header what did I call it because I called it yeah front data found that fight list uh starting off on that one going into this bite size and then for the byte offset was equals by this one I mean videos before starting a big project in terms of must and mustins uh I don't know what tips is take good control of how you ride here hey Jason sorry hey nice thanks for being here right custom converter that replace the converting process not only serializes the properties yeah if you have questions about serialization then Json is definitely the person you shouldn't listen to yeah uh fine it's really 33 or three valleys oh that's nice yeah working with compression that is definitely an interesting thing I remember that I used a some kind of compressional Library I don't remember the name but I remember that for my first theme game I did have that issue where my my um where my save files were super huge they weren't like megabytes long because I was just serializing tons and tons of data now remember that I used some compression and converted into like 50 kilobytes so that was that was fun that was interesting I didn't do it myself I just used some kind of library but yeah that was uh interesting um right so let me just now pretty much I got that one so let's go into Unicode get string and let me grab the file data so this is going to be a string for the found that in Json and then found data file data equal Json Italy uh from Json a type file data and let me pick up the found.json and of course this doesn't work with lists so need to do it with arrays so that grabs me the foundation and now with this one I finally have those two okay so almost getting there it's definitely yeah if you're watching this might seem way too convoluted but hopefully it will make sense in the final tutorial video um okay so the icon byte array size inside to save the map oh nice to a bit shifted compressed texture oh wow wow five megabytes into 50 kilobytes that's awesome wow that's insane that sounds really cool yeah bit shifted into a compressed section wow that's that sounds really hardcore right yeah nice uh thank you I'm glad you enjoyed the course it's awesome uh okay so the all right so yeah let me just up here let me put in log on that one see if that one is working and let's see if that one is loading the same bytes oh yeah and I didn't even notice that I'm spawning pen spinning yeah it's a it's a fun thing when you're busy oh boy look at that I think Unity wow look at that it happened yinty randomly crashes on me and now apparently the okay so did I mess up something working with bytes I don't know but yeah that was unexpected uh uh this one yeah all right so there you go classic yeah because this was I don't know did I yeah I don't think I did yeah just working with bytes but apparently something went wrong it's gonna crash again didn't Crush now but also the links were bounds okay so apparently I'm the offset and pounds were they hmm because so far it was part of said increased by the header size let me see the uh because I didn't actually see yeah the byte save is over here yeah 40 kilobytes so got on the bytes there okay yeah because the header size was correct wasn't it so why is this one it's kind of the issue when working with bytes that when things go wrong they go really wrong a tutorial about optimization on mobile that is a very broad topic so that has the best thing when it comes to optimization is really just learn how to use the profiler so window analysis profiler so learn how to use this in order to figure out what exactly is taking time because optimization is a giant topic with so many possible examples reasons so yeah there's no it's when those topics that is really important important impossible to make a general tutorial because every game is going to be different so yeah just focus on reducing draw calls reduce how often you run code all kinds of things so yeah basically learning how to use the profiler is the best thing you can do um okay so this one was actually all right oh never mind because I didn't add it yeah I'm not I'm not very smart no I'm not uh right so the founder byte array yeah I kind of need to add it if I don't add it then obviously it's actually not going to read it that's kind of obvious step three UI draw calls yeah UI can definitely be a big performance killer yeah especially for me I mean usually I make games on on PC so I don't have to worry about it too much but I really enjoy using uh World space canvases and yeah those generate tons of draw calls so yeah and Atlas is yeah I remember that I was one of my Steam games yeah I was before adding the the uh generating the Sprite Atlas and afterwards the difference was really massive so yeah definitely look into those those are great tips all right and now it worked nowhere okay awesome all right uh so the phone yeah because that's really all that I need then I add the icon in the name yeah right now I don't even care about the name so let me just add the icon byte array then finally over here I've got that one okay so then I can go into my complete by list in order to get the range and let me get the range on this byte offset and then for the size that is going to be the found data dot the icon by the right size so that is going to be a list of bytes and that is going to be the icon byte list and with that one I'm going to have a byte list and then I can finally do exactly this I basically read the bytes and unload them into the texture yeah the byte array uh okay so yeah so I don't think I can actually test this out yeah crap to Ray cast mode helps performance you oh does it oh that's something that I never tried out hey Margie hey Jack you're here hey nice how's it going all right I hope it was productive I hope you had fun back in Australia I hope that you weren't attacked by any giant spiders oh why Australia is an interesting country but the the uh existence of giant maneating spiders that really puts me off so yeah um are you Portuguese yep I am yeah uh right so you can do a debug download on the on this Sprite just see if it does work let's see if it does work not only that the final is 136 bytes is that it that doesn't seem right it says one 136 bytes but oh because I didn't add it right yeah that was before I had the thing so yeah speds are not that bad really because I've seen some pictures and they seem pretty bad uh right I didn't look at that these Sprites all right so technically this did work so let me do unload out Sprite Sprite and onto this Sprite let me output this Sprite use the black Unity editor because I like uh the light theme basically dark mode burns my eyes and light theme that's the thing for me and okay so on the load let me do out ah crap out Sprite Sprite so let me just do this right on the start and now instead of doing all this now I just go straight into that file and let me actually just load and not save okay so with this he should be able to get the Sprite and the Sprite should be added on to that one even though right now technically it's not going it's on based on that one file which is how big is it now yeah now it's three kilobytes all right so this is the entire mod file just has exactly that okay isn't there a builtin meth download Sprites yeah this is the only builtin method it's basically down you have to create a new texture 2D then you can't load the image in order to load bytes onto that texture 2D so that loads the image and then you create the Sprites that's pretty much the only thing okay so anyway so like this basically this is going to be loading this mod with that icon and let's see if it does work okay uh and now okay so so far so good no errors all right advice okay that's all good and I go and there you go and let's see if the icon didn't load if I pick it up and there you go got my icon all right awesome okay that worked that was cool I'm sure it was a bit anticlimactic for those of you who just aren't exactly sure what happened but let me tell you that was cool uh it's going to be a tutorial series or your next game this is going to be a tutorial on how to use unity's ugc which is their user generated content tool which is currently on open Beta recently researching this how is dinky Dev going oh it's going well I was doing some refactoring last week and now this week I'm focusing on making regular videos and then next week I'll be back to development on that and hopefully making a nice devot something like that so it should be fun um all right so basically with this I can use the save in order to save a thing okay let me just load the name as well even though the name doesn't actually show up anywhere but anyways uh so that's the name byte array I just really need to make this one she's actually super simple so how do I do it in coding dot unicode.getbytes get bytes of the object name that is the name byte array and then down here just need to add this one onto that one and finally down here so the icon byte list let me just increase the offset by this one uh the founder not the header uh okay so that gets the Sprites and then finally for the uh object name byte list get range by offset for the objects what record name byte array size that one gives me that one offset by down and then on this one I go into encoding dot Unicode get a string from this one dot to array so this Returns the string or let's just say object name and over here on the load let me do an outstring object name like this okay so now on this one a string that's running out out string object name so then when I create this one I give it this name okay now obviously I need to save it again let's go with my object passing Gamepad and so on okay let's see it's officially scaring where you are wanting like the same challenge in my game soon uh so far I think it has about uh a thousand wishlists which is a good enough start so as I do more and more Dev walks I hope that one to be increasing by quite a bit so the goal is to hit about 5000 by the launch date which should be at the end of July so essentially got two and a half months to get four thousand wishlist which should hopefully be useful for my custom avatar all right okay let me just uh try it out okay uh okay so uh what am I doing uh it's over here if I pick it up okay so let me exit Okay so this one is saving and loading now let's just load so just loading that one file and okay it's almost 1pm so almost time for me to go but I really wanna finish this part get this working okay so pick it up let me go into the player and inside the player is holding a kitchen object here it is the dynamic hello the kitchen object which has no name okay that's a bit annoying that's a bit annoying uh did I not fasten the other person name so why did it not okay did this load it or not that's a question so object name let me see this one uh right so there oh wow there are a bunch of custom textures well because these are manual so if you upload them you have to tell me but yeah I've validated them now let me just tell my tool to do it okay so it should now be updating oh there you go custom texture hey that looks nice that's a very nice suit all right nice thank you for drawing your own it's always fun when when people do that and get custom textures because some characters it's always fun so that's nice all right it's only 8 A.M is it so where are you living if it's 8 am over there I'm guessing you're on the east coast of the US I assume because over here it's 1 p.m so yeah uh right so let me see the object name is being loaded or not internally sure custom avatar is fun yeah yeah it's awesome when people use that feature it's a really nice tool I really enjoyed making it uh all right so pick it up that one go into that one but that one that one has no name that one also has no name okay so why don't you have a name that's my question yeah because that one did oh never mind well I mean obviously if I don't add it then it's kind of important so yeah sometimes I'm really a big idiot I guess uh yeah so anyways like this the name byte array.length so I have to put it otherwise obviously it won't actually save so let me go up here and now it should actually be saving the custom one all right hey another custom avatar hey that's nice here did you draw your own logo because that looks really cool nice gear icon with the angle brackets that is fun uh right so there you go my object and now if I look in the player and I inspect the kitchen object anyway I got my object all right awesome okay so that's cool all right he's important to put a game out there create the company talk to a lawyer I mean it's uh something is good to talk to an accountant to see how you do it but you can for me my Steam games I start off by doing a uh impression so that was the legal thing so you can uh foreign yeah you can basically start the business in your own name or maybe make a company both options are valid but I'm pretty much selling to an accountant always helps and there you go another Custom Care today and that's nice is that supposed to be the uh I always confuse them is it only alien or Predator no that's Predator okay a pixel art Predator that's fun um okay what was I doing okay so all these logs I don't really need them all of this is not working so that's awesome uh got all the bytes on the bytes the header size all the things okay so with this basically over here I am converting a I'm creating just one file which is very important which has an entire icon and all of the object data so that's good so um okay let me think um yeah I guess I could uh all right uh okay so that's good so now I would like to work with the actual ugc thing okay so let me basically use that one in order to create the mod then going to this one in order to actually load it right right so let me let me try it out like that so over here let me go uh test create contents uh kitchen object the cell so let me go into the test create content and over here let me try creating another one so okay all right so basically I'm going to open and for the content live stream not live stream my brain isn't working too well uh the byte save okay so so this is my mod file so that is what I'm going to want to upload it warning that appears on start host after updating doesn't stop the game what is the warning prefiles was not empty at initialization time made before initialization will be replaced I've never seen that warning does the code does the game Run are you seeing that on the end of the course that's a bit of a a strange one it seems like the network prefab list is not being is not being I don't know set correctly or it's being modified that's odd but nope I've never seen that error so that is strange I mean it's a warning so maybe it's just something with how the backend works I don't know so basically if you don't see any issues then I would say just ignore it but yeah just make sure you are not modifying the network prefab list at runtime because that would be the the tricky thing uh someone asked can you do a video on the live chat I've made several tutorials so you can go on to this page and over here at the bottom I've got all kinds of links so if you want to know how this works basically this is a Unity window so that's a transparent DNT window then the characters is their own mesh base so these are mesh based animations then for interacting with the YouTube API that's just an HTTP request and the characters how I made them these are the same characters that I used in my game battle round Tycoon so you can watch all these links in order to see how I built all this uh okay so let me just I just want to get this working and then I'll then I guess that won't be it because my voice already messed up okay so I go into that one and I'm going to upload it with whatever tags something so actually just like this it should be uploading so let me just go into my testing scene actually let me just save it just one last time because I don't think I'm not sure that I say this one I just run this just in order to save the file okay it did and the file is over here there you go 3.2 kilobytes okay so that's good so let me go into ah crap I can see the test scene all right let me just go into this one and now here there you go create content okay so that's good and now I think for a course Midway through that's nice all right pricing improving Effectiveness and selftaught programming the best advice is we're only just consistency so just focus on doing it even if it's just a tiny bit just do a tiny bit every single day that's really how you learn so that is much more important than trying to do some giant Sprints so yeah just focus on doing a tiny bit every single day and over time that will really add up so as some thought program it can be kind of hard to to uh decide how you're going to learn but if you're going through the course and that's awesome definitely just make sure you're actually learning and then keep at it if you get to the end you understand everything then you will have made a huge jump in your own skill set so definitely stick with it and hey Tempo another custom character hey thanks for being here nice yeah this was a bit of a random live stream on a random uh time so yeah bits range uh okay what was I doing okay so I created this one now if I go into my dashboard and I go into content and if there you go I do see my own okay so that one is public so that is fun all right oh I use this one okay I should have used the other one but okay that works anyways uh see you next time alright thank you for being here and see you next time um and if I actually download it and if I open it which is a bit odd but yep I can indeed see the file so it does have three kilobytes all right so that's good so basically this one created this so let me just store the the thing so a private string for the uh what do I call Test Kitchen chaos mod content ID let me just save this before I'll lose this uh okay so I got this one and now you can see Test download the subscribed content actually I don't really care about the Subscribe content do I no I just since I've got the content ID yeah I just need this one the download content data async so let me actually go on this one and instead of loading from a local file let us not do this which is obviously going to lead to all kinds of Errors so that's fine so I'm going to go into GCE service what's more this one is async uh I'm going to download the oh I need the content so that is oh I guess not I guess I just need this so I just need the content ID so let me actually pick this one up so by the way if you're used to watching my regular video so now you're watching this live stream then this code might seem quite dirty of these comments on these things and yeah that's just that's the perfectly normal part of the research process just writing things trying to get it working and then I focus on making it pretty that's pretty much it uh okay so this is going to download download just the content and I don't need the thumbnail okay so that's good and for downloading I think that's really the only thing yeah then I've got the downloaded content which does have a byte array okay so that's cool so wait that's on where that's the content dot downloaded content so that is a byte array so I just need to modify this guy which for some reason I need to create a class but that's okay so this one unloading instead of read all bytes let me receive a byte array so byte array and you're going to load that from down instead of on down so let me just do it by the way equals byte array instead of reading it you get it from down okay so this should be working let me just put the content.downloaded content like this all right no errors so let's see if this works that should be fun all right we wrote perfect you see usually travel lots of things until something clicks yeah that's pretty much what I'm doing here I mean if you rewatch this live stream which I've been for almost two hours yeah it took quite some time to figure out how to do all this saving all the data that I need and reloading it and then how to dynamically create a script more object so yeah this is pretty much how I research things I tried doing something little by little then I clean it up and then I work on writing the final published video so that's pretty much my process uh okay so with that one I did upload it onto there so now if I go where's my scenes scenes if I go into the game scene and now it should actually have that one except except it doesn't uh oh right I forgot to initialize the the empty services that would be tricking recommendations to make the game look pretty uh use good assets and definitely make sure you add some postprocessing post processing can really make a huge difference between making your game look a bit middling to looking really awesome so yeah definitely good assets plus post processing that will really take your game visuals to the next level uh okay so I just need to empty auth and on let me just do this yeah might this user yeah that works fine plug in async that should be fun okay so you're starting to learn Unity that's nice how to find how to do things the right way I would say don't focus on Perfection just focus on getting things working learning the right way that comes over time so as long as it works right now that's good then oh that's loading uh but yeah for now focus on learning to the point where it actually works and then over time you will be able to figure out what exactly is the right way and look at that it does work so basically the thing over there and I can pick it up and there you go it does have the icon so this cube right here this is actually a custom modded kitchen object that is actually being downloaded from the internet as opposed to being over here I mean I've got all the assets over here but this one is actually it is going over here to the internet into the user generated content and on the overview yep I can see that I've got a download so in the content Yep this guy right here this one has been done all right all right awesome so that actually worked quite well if I inspect that one if I inspect the player the player the uh oh the player isn't holding it let me pick it up where's the player the player the hold point is holding a q which is holding a kitchen object which is downloading the Sprite from the internet and the my object name all right why not use the dresser bones uh because for this time I want player modding not just a developer made modding so that's the big difference between addressables and the the um uh empty user generate content which is a really interesting tool all right okay so basically I wanted to get this working and most of it is working I just need to still work on the how do I actually synchronize the fbx file or the obj the mesh that is going to be a bit tricky so you know swish your multiplayer course with Steam not the industry Services I mean most of it you can uh the the core of it net code for game object that one is independent of whatever platform you choose so easily four seem the only thing you need to change is use the same relay instead of the empty relay beyond that everything is exactly the same so yeah thanks for everything you've done in your channel oh that's awesome see I really appreciate it oh thank you thank you for being here thanks for watching the videos the videos only exist because I make them and because all of you watch them so yeah thank you all for for being here how to make games safe from hacking uh for the most part you can't I mean just look at popular games like Call of Duty they've got billions and billions of dollars and they cannot defeat hacking so for you as an indie Dev I would say don't worry about it just people are going to crack your game they're going to do something so unless you are working on multiplayer game if you're making something single player then I would say don't bother about it it's very good is it because I'm actually presick so I'm a bit messed up but okay all right uh okay so I think that's gonna be it it's been two hours it's 1 pm so my dogs are already wanting some food so yeah okay between what's the difference between Steam and empty really uh there's really no difference they both do the exact same thing so yeah just using different tools but yeah uh okay all right so I think that's gonna be it thankfully this was a productive thing so I was able to dynamically generate a new kitchen object generate a new recipe deliver that recipe I was able to convert that into a single file and upload that file onto user generated content and I was able to download it and load it in here so yeah that was a good research stream so yeah right all right so yeah my voice messed up so that's gonna be it so let me just set everything up put up the background and all right okay so live stream so late I mean there's a a VOD so it's going to be saved so if you want to rewatch it and see how I work in real time then go ahead and watch it all right so let me just set everything up and like that all right so yep that's gonna be it for me I really gotta go eat gotta go do something so yeah thank you all so much for joining me on this random live stream hopefully there will be more in the future so yeah all right so thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you next time thank you foreign foreign
