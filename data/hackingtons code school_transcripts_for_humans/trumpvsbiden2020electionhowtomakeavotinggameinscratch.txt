00:00 - tomorrow's the election and it's super
00:02 - exciting you want to make your own
00:03 - voting system in scratch
00:05 - it's super easy and i'll show you how
00:08 - [Music]
00:12 - who are you gonna vote for this is gonna
00:14 - be pretty cool okay i've grabbed this
00:15 - picture i know i'm not supposed to but
00:17 - come on this is so exciting
00:18 - then i put it as a backdrop in my game
00:21 - and i've added one sprite which is the
00:23 - check mark because it's gonna be vote
00:25 - for biden or vote for trump
00:27 - pretty cool so now this check mark is
00:29 - where i'm going to throw
00:30 - my code or put my code i'm not going to
00:31 - put any code on the stage the backdrop
00:34 - i'm putting it right on the check mark
00:36 - and i'm going to say if you're voting
00:37 - for trump
00:38 - put the check mark over trump i'm going
00:40 - to use the glide too because i like the
00:42 - animation so i'll say if you're voting
00:44 - for trump
00:44 - glide to this position if you're voting
00:47 - for biden let's watch this i'll drag it
00:49 - over here
00:51 - then you'll glide to that position here
00:54 - it is right here so this is a vote for
00:56 - biden this is a vote for trump
00:58 - how do i decide let's use an if else
01:00 - statement
01:01 - so go in the control and you're going to
01:03 - grab this
01:04 - if else there now we said this one's for
01:07 - biden
01:08 - and then the other one's for trump can't
01:10 - remember just click on them you'll see
01:11 - you click on this one it goes to trump
01:13 - if you click on this one
01:14 - it goes to biden so let's put it in like
01:17 - this
01:17 - and we'll go to sensing this is the
01:20 - secret to using the mouse
01:21 - positioning you have a code block called
01:24 - mouse x which holds the value of mouse
01:28 - x let me just show you a little secret
01:31 - here
01:31 - let's make a variable well we already
01:33 - have a variable called
01:34 - my variable and let's see what the value
01:37 - of mouse
01:38 - x is we'll say forever set my value to
01:41 - mouse x and we'll wrap that in a forever
01:44 - loop
01:46 - put a start flag on there now when we
01:48 - start the game you'll see
01:49 - okay wherever the mouse wherever the
01:53 - pointer goes
01:55 - that changes the mouse x well this is
01:58 - nice because right in the middle you'll
01:59 - see
02:00 - it is zero and then when it goes towards
02:02 - trump it goes positive when it goes
02:05 - away from trump it goes negative so we
02:08 - can
02:08 - say if we
02:12 - we can so we can say if mouse x
02:15 - is greater than zero we're voting for
02:19 - trump let's just check this whoops fire
02:21 - this code yep
02:22 - this works correctly so if mouse x is
02:25 - greater than zero
02:26 - move for trump otherwise go to biden
02:29 - now we'll want this to follow our mouse
02:32 - pointer so let's go ahead and wrap this
02:34 - in a forever loop because we want it to
02:36 - forever
02:38 - be following our mouse pointer and i'll
02:40 - put a starting flag on it
02:41 - and here we go pretty cool there's a
02:44 - little bit of a delay that one second so
02:46 - let's adjust that down to 0.25
02:49 - we want it to be smooth but not clunky
02:52 - like that there we go
02:53 - oh i like that now when is the voting
02:57 - actually going to happen
02:58 - it's when you either click what if
03:00 - you're on the wrong
03:01 - candidate and you click and you're like
03:04 - oh
03:04 - no you really want to wait
03:08 - until the person stops clicking and then
03:11 - submit the vote let's move this code
03:14 - over
03:15 - and do something very similar now let's
03:18 - say
03:19 - when the game starts let's
03:22 - wait a second before anything happen
03:24 - just in case the person clicks like
03:26 - immediately
03:27 - and it votes for somebody that they
03:29 - don't want to vote for then let's use
03:30 - the wait until here it is we're going to
03:33 - wait
03:34 - until the mouse is down so
03:37 - go to sensing and you'll see mouse is
03:40 - down
03:41 - that way when we click it will vote
03:44 - but what if you're hovering on the wrong
03:47 - candidate you're like oh
03:48 - i meant to vote for trump but it already
03:51 - voted
03:52 - let's wait till the mouse is clicked
03:54 - down and then
03:55 - released this is a pretty cool trick
03:58 - we're going to duplicate this we're
03:59 - going to wait until the mouse gets down
04:01 - and then once it's down we're going to
04:03 - wait till it's not
04:05 - down right here grab the knot
04:08 - i know this is getting so confusing but
04:10 - it works beautifully okay
04:12 - wait till it's not down and then we're
04:14 - going to grab this
04:15 - mouse x block right here we're just
04:18 - going to duplicate it well i didn't need
04:19 - to
04:20 - pull it i just needed that and i'm going
04:22 - to say if
04:23 - watch this control we're going to grab
04:25 - that if else statement one more time
04:27 - we're going to say
04:28 - if mousex is greater than zero which
04:30 - means it's on the trump side
04:32 - that we're going to vote for trump so
04:34 - let's go ahead and
04:35 - make an event that says broadcast and
04:38 - wait
04:39 - and we're going to make a new message
04:40 - called vote trump
04:42 - there we go and obviously if it's not
04:45 - for trump this is the nice part about
04:47 - this code
04:47 - if the mouse isn't greater than zero
04:49 - then it must be less than
04:51 - and therefore it's going to biden
04:54 - vote biden okay boom
04:58 - so jump into variables over here and
05:00 - we're going to make a new
05:02 - variable so we're going to say trump
05:05 - votes
05:06 - and we're going to click on cloud
05:08 - variable if you don't have cloud
05:09 - variables it's because you haven't been
05:11 - using scratch for very long
05:13 - just keep using scratch and pretty soon
05:15 - you'll be a scratcher and have access to
05:17 - cloud variables
05:18 - okay i'm going to click ok and now we're
05:21 - going to make another variable
05:23 - called biden votes whoops caption
05:26 - dividend boats
05:28 - and we'll say okay let's go ahead and
05:32 - put these in the correct spot there we
05:35 - go
05:36 - trump votes and i'm going to move this
05:39 - down here we don't actually
05:40 - need that and biden votes there we go
05:46 - all right they're in the right spot so
05:48 - now broadcast
05:50 - biden vote okay they're in the right
05:52 - spots it's looking pretty good
05:54 - so what's gonna happen when you
05:55 - broadcast a biden vote
05:57 - let's go ahead and go to
06:00 - let's go to events and we'll say when i
06:03 - receive
06:06 - vo biden and when i receive vote trump
06:11 - that these things actions are going to
06:13 - happen so
06:14 - let's have it go to variables and let's
06:16 - have it change
06:18 - biden votes by one and change trump
06:21 - votes
06:22 - by one now now you can add a lot of
06:26 - other things that this function is going
06:29 - to do
06:29 - or this message is going to do but for
06:31 - right now i'm just going to stick to
06:33 - that
06:34 - now once the voting has happened we want
06:35 - to stop everything so they can't
06:37 - immediately vote again
06:39 - so let's go ahead and attach this stop
06:41 - all
06:42 - right here let's put a stop all here all
06:45 - right
06:46 - let's put as many stop alls as we can
06:48 - now there's much
06:49 - better systems for doing this because
06:51 - they could just hit the green flag again
06:54 - but for now it should work okay so um
06:57 - i'm selecting i'm gonna vote for biden
07:00 - okay can i vote for trump
07:02 - no pretty much froze up let's try it
07:04 - again and this time let's vote for trump
07:07 - it worked hey good luck building your
07:09 - own voting system and good luck to the
07:11 - candidates tomorrow
07:12 - don't forget to check out my scratch
07:13 - show on youtube i'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

tomorrow's the election and it's super exciting you want to make your own voting system in scratch it's super easy and i'll show you how who are you gonna vote for this is gonna be pretty cool okay i've grabbed this picture i know i'm not supposed to but come on this is so exciting then i put it as a backdrop in my game and i've added one sprite which is the check mark because it's gonna be vote for biden or vote for trump pretty cool so now this check mark is where i'm going to throw my code or put my code i'm not going to put any code on the stage the backdrop i'm putting it right on the check mark and i'm going to say if you're voting for trump put the check mark over trump i'm going to use the glide too because i like the animation so i'll say if you're voting for trump glide to this position if you're voting for biden let's watch this i'll drag it over here then you'll glide to that position here it is right here so this is a vote for biden this is a vote for trump how do i decide let's use an if else statement so go in the control and you're going to grab this if else there now we said this one's for biden and then the other one's for trump can't remember just click on them you'll see you click on this one it goes to trump if you click on this one it goes to biden so let's put it in like this and we'll go to sensing this is the secret to using the mouse positioning you have a code block called mouse x which holds the value of mouse x let me just show you a little secret here let's make a variable well we already have a variable called my variable and let's see

to biden vote biden okay boom so jump into variables over here and we're going to make a new variable so we're going to say trump votes and we're going to click on cloud variable if you don't have cloud variables it's because you haven't been using scratch for very long just keep using scratch and pretty soon you'll be a scratcher and have access to cloud variables okay i'm going to click ok and now we're going to make another variable called biden votes whoops caption dividend boats and we'll say okay let's go ahead and put these in the correct spot there we go trump votes and i'm going to move this down here we don't actually need that and biden votes there we go all right they're in the right spot so now broadcast biden vote okay they're in the right spots it's looking pretty good so what's gonna happen when you broadcast a biden vote let's go ahead and go to let's go to events and we'll say when i receive vo biden and when i receive vote trump that these things actions are
