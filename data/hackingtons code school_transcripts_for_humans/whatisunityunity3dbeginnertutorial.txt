00:04 - welcome to unity unity is a professional
00:08 - level video game engine it's used to
00:10 - make games like rust which is a
00:11 - massively multiplayer game with
00:13 - thousands of people on the servers at
00:15 - any given time and in such an expansive
00:17 - world that you might not see the same
00:19 - player twice other games like Assassin's
00:21 - Creed unity were built using the Unity
00:24 - engine the same engine you're going to
00:26 - be learning today
00:27 - now Assassin's Creed unity took hundreds
00:30 - of developers thousands of hours with
00:32 - hundreds of thousands of assets but it
00:35 - also made millions of dollars using the
00:38 - Unity engine games like super hot run on
00:40 - the oculus rift and other VR systems
00:43 - that's right unity can be used to build
00:45 - VR games it can also be used to build
00:48 - iPhone games android games ps4 games
00:51 - Xbox one games you name the platform and
00:53 - unity probably supports it now the
00:56 - Nintendo switch that's a different
00:57 - ballgame Nintendo has always been weird
01:00 - but what is a video game engine and why
01:02 - did we pick unity as the one we're going
01:04 - to use well a video game engine is a
01:07 - platform to build your game on say you
01:09 - want to build a game like Call of Duty
01:10 - there are a ton of things going on in
01:13 - that game now you can code all of those
01:15 - from scratch and it might take you 10 to
01:17 - 15 years to make a single map with a
01:19 - single player that shoots a single
01:21 - object
01:23 - we don't have to do that we can use
01:24 - unity and its built-in functionality to
01:27 - build a game on top of it we just have
01:29 - to tell unity what to do we don't have
01:31 - to build the things it does but why did
01:35 - we choose unity there are other video
01:37 - game engines out there engines like
01:39 - Unreal Engine and game maker studio and
01:42 - technically even scratch
01:43 - well unity is a good middle-of-the-road
01:45 - it's not so difficult that it's hard to
01:48 - understand and hard to learn to use like
01:50 - Unreal Engine but of course Unreal
01:52 - Engine because it's so sophisticated it
01:54 - can do a ton of stuff I don't think
01:56 - we're really going to get into hundreds
01:58 - of thousands of particles moving on the
02:00 - screen might be a little bit too complex
02:02 - but once you know unity making the
02:04 - transition to something like unreal or
02:06 - frostbite isn't very difficult we also
02:09 - don't want to use something as simple as
02:10 - scratch or game maker studio or roblox
02:12 - studio because it's going to hamstring
02:15 - us it's gonna hold us back it's not
02:16 - going to let us do everything we want to
02:18 - do
02:18 - unity allows a perfect balance between
02:22 - sophistication and ease of use
02:24 - let's stop talking abstractly about
02:27 - unity it's time to actually take a look
02:29 - at it now the very first time you open
02:31 - up unity it's okay to be intimidating
02:33 - there is a lot going on on the screen
02:35 - but we'll walk you through each piece
02:36 - will tell you what each piece does and
02:38 - once you start building a couple of
02:39 - games with it you quickly settle into a
02:41 - rhythm and unity isn't so bad so let's
02:44 - actually open up and take a look at what
02:45 - this amazing video game engine actually
02:47 - looks like
