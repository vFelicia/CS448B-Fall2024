00:00 - winner winner chicken dinner who doesn't
00:02 - like a good card game you versus the
00:05 - dealer one-on-one and in our game you
00:08 - deal and whoever has the higher card
00:11 - wins like me winner I'm starting with a
00:15 - blank scratch project now I'm gonna add
00:18 - 52 card images but I'm not gonna add
00:22 - them one by one I'm just gonna take one
00:24 - sprite go to the costumes and I'm going
00:28 - to upload 52 images of cards right here
00:32 - the upload costumes here I've downloaded
00:35 - 52 images of cards and I'll give you a
00:38 - link to upload these or I'll give you a
00:40 - scratch starter template okay
00:43 - I'll click open Wow it's downloading all
00:46 - of these costumes and check to make sure
00:50 - that we have all 52 cards oh wait a
00:53 - minute I forgot the scratch cat was the
00:56 - first two costumes so I'll need to
00:57 - delete him and then I'll just scroll
01:00 - down make sure that we have 52 cards yes
01:03 - so the 52nd card is the King of Spades
01:06 - this joker we're not going to use we're
01:09 - only gonna use up to 52 so you can
01:11 - delete these other cards but I'm gonna
01:13 - actually use them as images in the game
01:16 - so I'm not going to delete them but it's
01:19 - up to you now I'll need two sets of
01:21 - cards in my game one for player 1 and
01:23 - 1/4 player2 so I'll go ahead and
01:25 - duplicate it right here now these are
01:28 - gonna be player ones cards so player 1
01:31 - and these are going to be the dealer's
01:34 - cards and I'll need to separate these on
01:37 - either side they're a little bit big so
01:39 - I'm going to change the size to 50% and
01:42 - on this one 50% there that looks better
01:46 - that is a good time to add the other
01:49 - sprites
01:50 - I'll need as well I'm going to add a
01:52 - button that's going to be called deal so
01:56 - here is a blank button there we go I'm
01:59 - gonna put that where I want it to be and
02:01 - I'll just write the word deal on it
02:03 - right now deal there does that look
02:07 - great yes it does and then I'll want to
02:10 - add a backdrop because it's just white
02:13 - so
02:13 - waring let's just use a stock backdrop
02:16 - here we go this one looks good there and
02:19 - then we'll need to have a winner like it
02:22 - says you won that's gonna be a sprite
02:24 - that we're going to paint and we'll
02:27 - write the words winner and we'll make
02:30 - them big by selecting it dragging it so
02:33 - that it's a little larger change the
02:35 - color what do we want the color to be I
02:38 - think green is like a winner's color
02:40 - there we go and now we're gonna either
02:42 - want to position it over the player one
02:45 - wins or the dealer wins so let's get
02:49 - that positioning correct first let's go
02:51 - in the backdrop and add those words
02:54 - convert it to vector cuz it's much nicer
02:56 - to write so we're gonna say this is
02:59 - player 1 player or just player and we
03:03 - want this to be bigger we'll have that
03:06 - right there and over here we'll need to
03:09 - have select it and then unselected
03:12 - that'll allow me to write dealer and
03:15 - then I need to make that bigger there
03:18 - okay and they'll just line up these
03:20 - cards so they they fit where I want them
03:23 - to be now we want the words winner to go
03:27 - above either the player or the dealer
03:30 - and you notice I did the wrong color in
03:32 - my opinion so I'm gonna change this to
03:34 - is in vector mode nice you can just
03:37 - click on things and change their colors
03:39 - player what color don't want player
03:41 - player will be purple that's good
03:43 - now the positioning for the winner is
03:46 - going to either be right here or right
03:48 - here and we'll use the go-to code so
03:51 - let's go ahead and say that when the
03:53 - game starts that we're going to hide it
03:58 - where would we find that in the looks
04:00 - menu here are the looks here it is game
04:03 - starts we hide you goodbye you are
04:06 - hidden okay but before we hide him I'm
04:09 - going to position it where I want it to
04:12 - be so if player one wins it's gonna go
04:16 - right there so grab the motion block and
04:18 - say go to that position we'll use an
04:21 - event and the events called when I when
04:24 - player one wins right so we'll make it
04:27 - player wins or just keep seeing playing
04:31 - one but there's only one player here
04:33 - player wins it goes right there and it
04:36 - will need to show itself so come in here
04:39 - and click show let's see if this works
04:42 - we start the game it's hidden the player
04:44 - one wins it shows up right there
04:47 - now if player 2 wins it's going to show
04:49 - or the dealer I keep saying that it's
04:51 - gonna go right there now when I moved it
04:54 - it automatically updated the motion
04:57 - position so the go-to has been updated
05:00 - so I just need to duplicate this whoops
05:03 - whoops whoops and then replace this with
05:06 - this positioning and make a new message
05:09 - that says dealer wins dealer dealer wins
05:14 - now anytime dealer wins it will go there
05:18 - player wins there we go and then you can
05:22 - make it hide when you reset the game ok
05:26 - at this point in the game we haven't
05:28 - coded the cards to flip and change and
05:31 - to keep score we haven't done any of
05:33 - that it just looks like the game is done
05:35 - I'll show you something also a big
05:38 - mistake that I've made when I click on
05:39 - player one you'll see that it's in the
05:42 - wrong position I need to flip these so
05:45 - click on your sprites and make sure they
05:47 - are where they should be
05:49 - now we're gonna be coding player 1 first
05:52 - so select the player 1 card click on
05:55 - costumes and figure out what the
05:57 - starting costume is going to be for
05:59 - player 1
06:00 - let's make player 1 red yes so 56 we're
06:04 - gonna be referencing the costume number
06:06 - like 56 rather than the card name it's
06:10 - much easier to use the costume number so
06:13 - we'll jump in here and we'll say when
06:15 - the game starts we'll switch to costume
06:18 - number switch to costume boy is down
06:23 - here it's actually doesn't have costume
06:26 - numbers on this so I'll have to just try
06:29 - it let's see is that the that's the
06:31 - black one and then the other one is the
06:34 - red one there we go and I'll come over
06:36 - and now what just share the code if you
06:38 - drag over
06:40 - another sprite it will share that code
06:42 - and will make this one the the zero one
06:47 - okay there we are
06:49 - we had a good starting position I'll
06:51 - switch back to player one and I'll say
06:53 - when I received the message deal like
06:55 - when you press the deal button then I'll
06:57 - kind of randomize which costume I'm
06:59 - showing so I will need an event when I
07:02 - receive not dealer wins but deal or deal
07:07 - cards new message we're just gonna call
07:10 - it deal when I receive deal change
07:13 - costume so how are we gonna change it
07:16 - probably kind of in a repeat loop let's
07:19 - go look in control let's grab that
07:21 - repeat 10 which we're gonna change the
07:23 - 10 but for right now we'll just leave it
07:25 - and then we'll go to looks and we'll say
07:28 - switch costume to and we're not gonna
07:33 - we're gonna use like a randomized number
07:36 - so we'll need to go into operators and
07:38 - grab pick random okay let's see if
07:41 - there's enough room on here now which
07:44 - number okay we have 52 decks in the
07:47 - cards so between 1 and 52 that will
07:52 - switch the costume now it's only gonna
07:54 - repeat 10 times so when you kind of like
07:58 - when you shuffle and deal and all that
08:01 - stuff it needs to be real random feeling
08:03 - if you repeat 10 times every time it's
08:06 - not gonna feel very random
08:08 - so let's actually repeat this a random
08:12 - amount of time
08:13 - okay let's where is that it's in the
08:16 - operators pick random will pick lets go
08:20 - between 20 and 50 times that's a lot
08:25 - let's let's test it click on the code
08:27 - oh those click there so it's gonna flip
08:31 - the cards between 20 and 50 times ending
08:34 - on a random card that seems to work
08:38 - let's go ahead and drag this piece of
08:40 - code on to the dealer card as well so
08:43 - both of them work now when we click the
08:45 - deal button we want this to deal so
08:48 - we'll jump over to the deal buttons code
08:50 - and we'll say when the game starts to
08:54 - show itself looks and we'll say show and
08:58 - we'll use a little event called when
09:01 - this button is clicked or when this
09:04 - sprite is clicked so in the events will
09:06 - say win sprite is clicked to fire that
09:10 - code so what is that code that is an
09:13 - event and will go in the advance will
09:16 - say broadcast deal and wait why are we
09:20 - using the wait because we want the cards
09:22 - to finish changing their costumes before
09:25 - the next part of this code happens let's
09:29 - try it it works now our game looks like
09:34 - it's done but it isn't because we
09:36 - haven't actually coded any functionality
09:39 - the computer doesn't know that this
09:42 - costume has a value of Jack what is the
09:45 - value of Jack I would say 11 right and
09:47 - this costume is number 7 so Jack versus
09:51 - 7 the Jack should win how are we going
09:54 - to tell the computer what the value of
09:58 - the jack is first let's create a
10:01 - variable well a couple variables so I'll
10:04 - be in the variable menu for player 1
10:06 - I'll click make a variable and I will
10:09 - say player 1 value now on making sure
10:15 - that I'm coding player 1 right here
10:17 - after it's done flipping through all
10:20 - those costumes we're going to have it
10:22 - set the value of that variable set
10:27 - player 1 value to which ever costume
10:31 - number it's on remember these costumes
10:34 - they all have a number and we'll call
10:36 - those the value you can see that the
10:39 - number 7 well the card 7 actually is the
10:42 - value 7 so that works well it works for
10:45 - a little while let me just show you how
10:47 - we're gonna fix that problem first set
10:49 - player 1 value to the costume number
10:52 - that's in looks down here at the bottom
10:55 - cost you member this should work pretty
10:58 - well let's just test it player 1 there
11:01 - wait a minute does this card the two
11:05 - spades have a
11:07 - you of 41 no but it's the costume is 41
11:12 - the problem here is is the two of spades
11:16 - more valuable than the two of clubs no
11:19 - it should be the same so we're gonna
11:22 - have to use some pretty complex
11:24 - mathematics but don't worry it's super
11:27 - easy let's take a quick jump back to
11:30 - think about what a deck of cards is
11:33 - let's actually look in the costumes for
11:36 - player 1 are there 52 values no there's
11:41 - actually only 13 values see the king is
11:45 - the most powerful card well in our game
11:48 - we're gonna make a slow so ace is valued
11:51 - at 0 right here or we could just say 1
11:54 - ace is one and then King has the value
11:57 - of 13 now does this card number you know
12:00 - the costume number 14 is it have a
12:02 - greater value than card 13 no in fact it
12:07 - just repeats itself after 13 so of the
12:10 - 52 cards in a deck it's really just 13
12:14 - cards and then 13 and then 13 and then
12:17 - 13 so that number 13 is really important
12:20 - let me show you how to use the computers
12:23 - incredible brain to do complex
12:26 - mathematics go ahead and jump into the
12:29 - code area for player 1 go to the
12:32 - operators and look for something called
12:34 - mod mod is kind of like division it
12:39 - takes a number like say 52 and we divide
12:44 - it by another number let's say the
12:46 - number 13 mod says is there a remainder
12:51 - left over 52 divided by 13 nope no
12:55 - remainder now why is that special
12:58 - because the cards are repeating every 13
13:01 - times you can actually figure out the
13:04 - value of a card just by using this mod
13:08 - 13 well what's what we're not using card
13:12 - number 52 always well yeah replace that
13:15 - with the costume number this is a thing
13:18 - of beauty watch this
13:19 - put that in
13:20 - here so we're setting the player ones
13:23 - value to the mod of whatever costume
13:26 - number is of 13 mod 13 so that what the
13:30 - remainder gonna be that's gonna be the
13:32 - value let's see if it works there's the
13:35 - jack it has a value of 11 yes let's try
13:38 - it again 5 is fine yes it works now we
13:41 - can compare cards without having to
13:44 - worry about if it's what suit it is if
13:47 - it's spades or diamonds the only problem
13:51 - is is you'll notice that card number 13
13:54 - is a king and 13 month 13 is actually 0
13:59 - so there is a problem with our code but
14:03 - let's deal with that later
14:05 - now that we are capturing player ones
14:07 - value let's jump into the dealer card
14:10 - and set up a variable for the dealer
14:13 - we're gonna say the dealer card value
14:17 - and then we're going to do the exact
14:20 - same thing we're gonna say variable set
14:23 - dealers Valley card value to the mod
14:28 - where's mod I lost it I can't find mod
14:32 - it's way down here there it is to mod 13
14:35 - of the cards I mean them the cards
14:40 - costume number where is the costume here
14:42 - it is it's in the looks menu right here
14:44 - costume number there so now they both
14:47 - should be working let's go ahead and put
14:50 - them right there so you can see it and
14:52 - make sure they are working correctly
14:54 - there now that we have both of these
14:57 - values working we can compare them to
14:59 - determine who won or who lost now we're
15:03 - on the final stretch because we know the
15:05 - value player ones card in comparison to
15:08 - the dealer's card so let's jump back
15:10 - into the deal button
15:12 - remember that button we actually used an
15:15 - event called when the sprite is clicked
15:18 - to broadcast the message deal but I use
15:21 - the deal and wait and what that will do
15:24 - is it will wait until all the code
15:27 - that's running this broadcast deal until
15:30 - it runs before it comes back
15:32 - and does anything right here so we we
15:35 - said deal so player one is like okay I'm
15:38 - dealing and then the dealer's like I'm
15:41 - dealing so everybody's dealing they're
15:43 - setting their the card value to this
15:46 - this costume mod 13 then we come back to
15:51 - the deal button and we could just set up
15:53 - a comparison let's compare player one to
15:55 - the dealer so let's do that
15:58 - let's go in the operators and let's say
16:01 - let's use the less-than and greater-than
16:03 - and well which one
16:07 - we're probably gonna want all three of
16:08 - these aren't we we're going to go into
16:11 - variables and say if the dealer card is
16:14 - less than the player card something's
16:18 - going to happen well let's just start
16:20 - with that cuz I don't need to show you
16:21 - all of these scenarios
16:23 - let's grab an if statement if dealer
16:27 - card is less than looks it's hard with
16:32 - scratch three to kind of organize where
16:34 - all the code is if the dealer card is
16:36 - less than the player card then who wins
16:39 - let's come over here and say player 1
16:41 - wins or dealer wins good so player 1
16:44 - will win
16:45 - let's go to events and let's broadcast
16:49 - player 1 wins you can actually use an
16:54 - if-else statement we don't have to code
16:56 - so much so let's say I go into control
16:58 - and use if-else and then we'll just say
17:01 - this if the dealer has less player 1
17:05 - wins otherwise the dealer wins let's get
17:11 - rid of this attach it right here that's
17:14 - a nice little if-else statement let's
17:17 - see if it works
17:19 - yes now fast-forward a bit I want to
17:23 - show you a situation where there's a bug
17:25 - in the game look at this I got a Ching I
17:29 - should be the winner but the value is 0
17:33 - and this for beat me okay that's just
17:36 - incorrect using the mod function creates
17:41 - a little bit of a problem right here so
17:43 - how are we going to fix this
17:45 - let's go back to the source of the
17:47 - problem and fix it there jump back to
17:49 - player 1 and right here it says set
17:52 - player value 1 to costume number mod 13
17:56 - okay so this is where it's setting that
17:58 - value to zero we don't want that so
18:02 - let's say if in the control if the
18:06 - player 1 value this is actually pretty
18:09 - cool go into variables say if player
18:13 - ones value is equal to zero then we're
18:22 - going to set player 1 value to 13 it's
18:29 - like manual override there we go so now
18:33 - if if it just happens that you get a
18:36 - king then it will convert it to a 13
18:40 - instead of a 0 let's go ahead and see if
18:43 - it works there we go
18:46 - on the first try now I know this lesson
18:50 - was a beast it was huge
18:52 - we've learned so much but basically you
18:55 - can create any card game by using this
18:58 - mod 13 trick blackjack poker the world
19:04 - is your oyster people still say that
19:06 - anyways
19:07 - I can't wait to see what you build with
19:10 - these new skills

Cleaned transcript:

winner winner chicken dinner who doesn't like a good card game you versus the dealer oneonone and in our game you deal and whoever has the higher card wins like me winner I'm starting with a blank scratch project now I'm gonna add 52 card images but I'm not gonna add them one by one I'm just gonna take one sprite go to the costumes and I'm going to upload 52 images of cards right here the upload costumes here I've downloaded 52 images of cards and I'll give you a link to upload these or I'll give you a scratch starter template okay I'll click open Wow it's downloading all of these costumes and check to make sure that we have all 52 cards oh wait a minute I forgot the scratch cat was the first two costumes so I'll need to delete him and then I'll just scroll down make sure that we have 52 cards yes so the 52nd card is the King of Spades this joker we're not going to use we're only gonna use up to 52 so you can delete these other cards but I'm gonna actually use them as images in the game so I'm not going to delete them but it's up to you now I'll need two sets of cards in my game one for player 1 and 1/4 player2 so I'll go ahead and duplicate it right here now these are gonna be player ones cards so player 1 and these are going to be the dealer's cards and I'll need to separate these on either side they're a little bit big so I'm going to change the size to 50% and on this one 50% there that looks better that is a good time to add the other sprites I'll need as well I'm going to add a button that's going to be called deal so here is a blank button there we go I'm gonna put that where I want it to be and I'll just write the word deal on it right now deal there does that look great yes it does and then I'll want to add a backdrop because it's just white so waring let's just use a stock backdrop here we go this one looks good there and then we'll need to have a winner like it says you won that's gonna be a sprite that we're going to paint and we'll write the words winner and we'll make them big by selecting it dragging it so that it's a little larger change the color what do we want the color to be I think green is like a winner's color there we go and now we're gonna either want to position it over the player one wins or the dealer wins so let's get that positioning correct first let's go in the backdrop and add those words convert it to vector cuz it's much nicer to write so we're gonna say this is player 1 player or just player and we want this to be bigger we'll have that right there and over here we'll need to have select it and then unselected that'll allow me to write dealer and then I need to make that bigger there okay and they'll just line up these cards so they they fit where I want them to be now we want the words winner to go above either the player or the dealer and you notice I did the wrong color in my opinion so I'm gonna change this to is in vector mode nice you can just click on things and change their colors player what color don't want player player will be purple that's good now the positioning for the winner is going to either be right here or right here and we'll use the goto code so let's go ahead and say that when the game starts that we're going to hide it where would we find that in the looks menu here are the looks here it is game starts we hide you goodbye you are hidden okay but before we hide him I'm going to position it where I want it to be so if player one wins it's gonna go right there so grab the motion block and say go to that position we'll use an event and the events called when I when player one wins right so we'll make it player wins or just keep seeing playing one but there's only one player here player wins it goes right there and it will need to show itself so come in here and click show let's see if this works we start the game it's hidden the player one wins it shows up right there now if player 2 wins it's going to show or the dealer I keep saying that it's gonna go right there now when I moved it it automatically updated the motion position so the goto has been updated so I just need to duplicate this whoops whoops whoops and then replace this with this positioning and make a new message that says dealer wins dealer dealer wins now anytime dealer wins it will go there player wins there we go and then you can make it hide when you reset the game ok at this point in the game we haven't coded the cards to flip and change and to keep score we haven't done any of that it just looks like the game is done I'll show you something also a big mistake that I've made when I click on player one you'll see that it's in the wrong position I need to flip these so click on your sprites and make sure they are where they should be now we're gonna be coding player 1 first so select the player 1 card click on costumes and figure out what the starting costume is going to be for player 1 let's make player 1 red yes so 56 we're gonna be referencing the costume number like 56 rather than the card name it's much easier to use the costume number so we'll jump in here and we'll say when the game starts we'll switch to costume number switch to costume boy is down here it's actually doesn't have costume numbers on this so I'll have to just try it let's see is that the that's the black one and then the other one is the red one there we go and I'll come over and now what just share the code if you drag over another sprite it will share that code and will make this one the the zero one okay there we are we had a good starting position I'll switch back to player one and I'll say when I received the message deal like when you press the deal button then I'll kind of randomize which costume I'm showing so I will need an event when I receive not dealer wins but deal or deal cards new message we're just gonna call it deal when I receive deal change costume so how are we gonna change it probably kind of in a repeat loop let's go look in control let's grab that repeat 10 which we're gonna change the 10 but for right now we'll just leave it and then we'll go to looks and we'll say switch costume to and we're not gonna we're gonna use like a randomized number so we'll need to go into operators and grab pick random okay let's see if there's enough room on here now which number okay we have 52 decks in the cards so between 1 and 52 that will switch the costume now it's only gonna repeat 10 times so when you kind of like when you shuffle and deal and all that stuff it needs to be real random feeling if you repeat 10 times every time it's not gonna feel very random so let's actually repeat this a random amount of time okay let's where is that it's in the operators pick random will pick lets go between 20 and 50 times that's a lot let's let's test it click on the code oh those click there so it's gonna flip the cards between 20 and 50 times ending on a random card that seems to work let's go ahead and drag this piece of code on to the dealer card as well so both of them work now when we click the deal button we want this to deal so we'll jump over to the deal buttons code and we'll say when the game starts to show itself looks and we'll say show and we'll use a little event called when this button is clicked or when this sprite is clicked so in the events will say win sprite is clicked to fire that code so what is that code that is an event and will go in the advance will say broadcast deal and wait why are we using the wait because we want the cards to finish changing their costumes before the next part of this code happens let's try it it works now our game looks like it's done but it isn't because we haven't actually coded any functionality the computer doesn't know that this costume has a value of Jack what is the value of Jack I would say 11 right and this costume is number 7 so Jack versus 7 the Jack should win how are we going to tell the computer what the value of the jack is first let's create a variable well a couple variables so I'll be in the variable menu for player 1 I'll click make a variable and I will say player 1 value now on making sure that I'm coding player 1 right here after it's done flipping through all those costumes we're going to have it set the value of that variable set player 1 value to which ever costume number it's on remember these costumes they all have a number and we'll call those the value you can see that the number 7 well the card 7 actually is the value 7 so that works well it works for a little while let me just show you how we're gonna fix that problem first set player 1 value to the costume number that's in looks down here at the bottom cost you member this should work pretty well let's just test it player 1 there wait a minute does this card the two spades have a you of 41 no but it's the costume is 41 the problem here is is the two of spades more valuable than the two of clubs no it should be the same so we're gonna have to use some pretty complex mathematics but don't worry it's super easy let's take a quick jump back to think about what a deck of cards is let's actually look in the costumes for player 1 are there 52 values no there's actually only 13 values see the king is the most powerful card well in our game we're gonna make a slow so ace is valued at 0 right here or we could just say 1 ace is one and then King has the value of 13 now does this card number you know the costume number 14 is it have a greater value than card 13 no in fact it just repeats itself after 13 so of the 52 cards in a deck it's really just 13 cards and then 13 and then 13 and then 13 so that number 13 is really important let me show you how to use the computers incredible brain to do complex mathematics go ahead and jump into the code area for player 1 go to the operators and look for something called mod mod is kind of like division it takes a number like say 52 and we divide it by another number let's say the number 13 mod says is there a remainder left over 52 divided by 13 nope no remainder now why is that special because the cards are repeating every 13 times you can actually figure out the value of a card just by using this mod 13 well what's what we're not using card number 52 always well yeah replace that with the costume number this is a thing of beauty watch this put that in here so we're setting the player ones value to the mod of whatever costume number is of 13 mod 13 so that what the remainder gonna be that's gonna be the value let's see if it works there's the jack it has a value of 11 yes let's try it again 5 is fine yes it works now we can compare cards without having to worry about if it's what suit it is if it's spades or diamonds the only problem is is you'll notice that card number 13 is a king and 13 month 13 is actually 0 so there is a problem with our code but let's deal with that later now that we are capturing player ones value let's jump into the dealer card and set up a variable for the dealer we're gonna say the dealer card value and then we're going to do the exact same thing we're gonna say variable set dealers Valley card value to the mod where's mod I lost it I can't find mod it's way down here there it is to mod 13 of the cards I mean them the cards costume number where is the costume here it is it's in the looks menu right here costume number there so now they both should be working let's go ahead and put them right there so you can see it and make sure they are working correctly there now that we have both of these values working we can compare them to determine who won or who lost now we're on the final stretch because we know the value player ones card in comparison to the dealer's card so let's jump back into the deal button remember that button we actually used an event called when the sprite is clicked to broadcast the message deal but I use the deal and wait and what that will do is it will wait until all the code that's running this broadcast deal until it runs before it comes back and does anything right here so we we said deal so player one is like okay I'm dealing and then the dealer's like I'm dealing so everybody's dealing they're setting their the card value to this this costume mod 13 then we come back to the deal button and we could just set up a comparison let's compare player one to the dealer so let's do that let's go in the operators and let's say let's use the lessthan and greaterthan and well which one we're probably gonna want all three of these aren't we we're going to go into variables and say if the dealer card is less than the player card something's going to happen well let's just start with that cuz I don't need to show you all of these scenarios let's grab an if statement if dealer card is less than looks it's hard with scratch three to kind of organize where all the code is if the dealer card is less than the player card then who wins let's come over here and say player 1 wins or dealer wins good so player 1 will win let's go to events and let's broadcast player 1 wins you can actually use an ifelse statement we don't have to code so much so let's say I go into control and use ifelse and then we'll just say this if the dealer has less player 1 wins otherwise the dealer wins let's get rid of this attach it right here that's a nice little ifelse statement let's see if it works yes now fastforward a bit I want to show you a situation where there's a bug in the game look at this I got a Ching I should be the winner but the value is 0 and this for beat me okay that's just incorrect using the mod function creates a little bit of a problem right here so how are we going to fix this let's go back to the source of the problem and fix it there jump back to player 1 and right here it says set player value 1 to costume number mod 13 okay so this is where it's setting that value to zero we don't want that so let's say if in the control if the player 1 value this is actually pretty cool go into variables say if player ones value is equal to zero then we're going to set player 1 value to 13 it's like manual override there we go so now if if it just happens that you get a king then it will convert it to a 13 instead of a 0 let's go ahead and see if it works there we go on the first try now I know this lesson was a beast it was huge we've learned so much but basically you can create any card game by using this mod 13 trick blackjack poker the world is your oyster people still say that anyways I can't wait to see what you build with these new skills
