00:00 - the difference between a good scratch
00:02 - game and a fantastic scratch game is the
00:05 - ghost effect huh
00:06 - what's the ghost effect well check this
00:08 - out in my game when I start the game the
00:11 - turtle is there why well because I'm
00:13 - showing them and you still need show and
00:16 - hide even if you're using the ghost
00:18 - effect it just has to do with the
00:20 - visibility of your character hence a
00:23 - ghost is see-through so let's go and
00:26 - look in the looks menu look in the
00:28 - Luke's menu and find set color effect
00:31 - now ghost effect is a drop-down choice
00:34 - in the color menu right here ghost now
00:38 - if I set it at 100 and I click on this
00:41 - code block the sprite disappears if I
00:44 - set it at 0 it appears
00:47 - okay so ghost effects a little different
00:50 - because you get more ghosty by adding
00:53 - ghost effect now 100 is the most it
00:56 - means completely disappeared so we have
00:58 - to kind of work within that range so
01:00 - typically at the beginning of the game
01:01 - you either want something showing or not
01:04 - showing and in this case I don't want
01:07 - the turtle to be showing so I will set
01:09 - the ghost effect to 100 or basically 100
01:13 - percent then gradually I want this
01:16 - bright to appear so what I'll do is go
01:19 - in the control menu and I'll use a
01:21 - repeat block that way I can fade him in
01:24 - by using the ghost effect now we're not
01:26 - gonna set the ghost effect again we're
01:28 - gonna change its go look back in the
01:30 - looks menu I like that
01:32 - look back in the looks menu here it is
01:34 - so change color effect will change ghost
01:39 - effect by well if we do negative 100 it
01:44 - will instantly be there so I want to
01:47 - change it gradually gradually so I'll do
01:50 - negative 10
01:51 - why because 10 times 10 is a hundred
01:55 - pretty smart huh so let's see what this
01:58 - looks like start the game and there he
02:00 - is he kind of shaded in pretty quickly
02:02 - how can you slow down that fade in well
02:05 - instead of 10 times 10 do 10 times 1
02:09 - don't forget to use that negative symbol
02:11 - because we want it to be Nega
02:13 - of 100 there it is a nice gradual faded
02:17 - now you can have a lot of fun and make
02:19 - your games look really professional
02:20 - using the ghost effect good luck
02:30 - you
