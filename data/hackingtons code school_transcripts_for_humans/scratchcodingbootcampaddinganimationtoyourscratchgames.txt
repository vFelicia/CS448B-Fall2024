00:00 - don't combine movement with animation
00:03 - you want to make two scripts for that so
00:06 - here's my one script that's for the
00:08 - movement the spinning script and if I
00:10 - put animation like next costume and of
00:13 - course the weight point three seconds to
00:15 - animate it it ruins the movement you
00:18 - want to separate those so I'll take the
00:20 - animation right here I'll grab a forever
00:23 - Loop and I'll grab its own starting
00:25 - event right there and now you'll see
00:27 - it's animating and moving and there's no
00:31 - jerkiness
