00:00 - what separates the beginners and the
00:01 - professionals in scratch video game
00:03 - making is the movement whether or not
00:06 - the movement of the character is smooth
00:08 - well what do you mean smooth
00:11 - well beginners always do this they go in
00:13 - the motion blocks and they say ok I want
00:15 - the cat to move when I press the
00:17 - spacebar so they lose something like
00:19 - this and this is really clunky and the
00:23 - cat only moves in the direction it's
00:26 - already facing so unless you want to
00:28 - adjust the way with like arrow keys with
00:31 - the direction it's facing it's just
00:32 - always gonna move in that direction so
00:35 - let me show you a more professional way
00:37 - to do this so separate this we're gonna
00:39 - still use the move ten steps but we're
00:42 - gonna wrap it in both a forever loop and
00:45 - an if statement so we're gonna say
00:47 - forever check if you're pressing the
00:50 - spacebar so we'll need to go into
00:52 - sensing will grab not the touching mouse
00:55 - pointer we're looking for key space
00:58 - pressed right there then we'll do the
01:01 - move ten steps we'll need to put a start
01:04 - flag on that there we go so this is a
01:08 - much smoother version of the code
01:10 - because it's checking to see if the
01:12 - space key is pressed then moving but you
01:15 - still can't control the direction that's
01:17 - where that's where x and y become very
01:21 - valuable
01:21 - instead of using move 10 steps the
01:24 - professional scratch coder will not use
01:27 - that block they'll actually go into the
01:29 - motion and they'll use change X not set
01:32 - X because be careful set X and change X
01:36 - are dangerously close to together and
01:38 - they're very different in what they do
01:40 - so now instead of pressing the spacebar
01:42 - I'll press the right arrow let's go
01:45 - ahead and put the cat there now when I
01:47 - press the right arrow he mows out so
01:49 - smoothly and we'll need to repeat this
01:51 - code block let's go ahead and throw this
01:53 - away we'll need to repaint it do or
01:56 - duplicate it for the left arrow left
02:00 - arrow and then this will be the negative
02:02 - so minus 10 steps there we go so the X
02:06 - changes the position going horizontally
02:09 - as it goes positive it moves to the
02:11 - right negative goes to the
02:12 - laughs so let's go ahead and do that for
02:14 - the Y position as well so we'll
02:17 - duplicate this twice okay this this code
02:22 - block is getting pretty large I'll show
02:24 - you how to save this in just a second so
02:26 - now we want to do the up arrow and we
02:28 - won't be changing the X we'll be
02:29 - changing the Y by a positive value and
02:32 - we'll be changing the Y by a negative
02:35 - value to make the cat go down there we
02:38 - go this is negative 10 and this is a
02:42 - hold on we need the up and the down
02:45 - arrow there we go so this looks correct
02:47 - I think we have all of the code and
02:50 - check that out now how do you make it so
02:53 - the cat faces the direction that you're
02:55 - pointing well that has to do with motion
02:58 - as well and point in direction so let's
03:01 - go look
03:02 - point in direction we'll just go ahead
03:03 - and add this in here so direction when
03:06 - you click on it Direction 90 is to the
03:08 - right we'll need another one of those
03:10 - point in direction so the left will be
03:15 - this direction which is negative 90 I
03:19 - know it's a little strange that they use
03:21 - negative 90 okay so what will this will
03:24 - do is the cat will flip upside down
03:26 - that's okay you actually can set the
03:28 - rotation style right here you can do it
03:31 - in where my image actually is you can
03:34 - change the directions style over there
03:36 - but I like to hard-code it into the code
03:39 - by setting row state tation style right
03:42 - here to don't rotate left to right I
03:45 - think left right will actually work
03:49 - correctly there it goes so that looks
03:51 - pretty good we can add these point in
03:53 - directions to the up arrow well not
03:55 - really unless you want him to point up
03:57 - which you can but then the left right
04:00 - rotation won't work that's another story
04:02 - you're just gonna have to play around
04:04 - with these variables now I told you you
04:06 - can save this code cuz you're probably
04:07 - going to use this in all of your games
04:10 - both many of your games how do you do
04:12 - that just go down to the bottom the
04:14 - backpack click on the backpack and then
04:17 - drag your code in there there now when
04:21 - you're working on your next game you can
04:23 - just go in the backpack drag it out and
04:25 - you have
04:26 - code well you don't want two versions of
04:28 - it but that way you don't have to recode
04:30 - this many many times
04:32 - anyways that is a professional way to
04:35 - move your sprite in scratch

what separates the beginners and the professionals in scratch video game making is the movement whether or not the movement of the character is smooth well what do you mean smooth well beginners always do this they go in the motion blocks and they say ok I want the cat to move when I press the spacebar so they lose something like this and this is really clunky and the cat only moves in the direction it's already facing so unless you want to adjust the way with like arrow keys with the direction it's facing it's just always gonna move in that direction so let me show you a more professional way to do this so separate this we're gonna still use the move ten steps but we're gonna wrap it in both a forever loop and an if statement so we're gonna say forever check if you're pressing the spacebar so we'll need to go into sensing will grab not the touching mouse pointer we're looking for key space pressed right there then we'll do the move ten steps we'll need to put a start flag on that there we go so this is a much smoother version of the code because it's checking to see if the space key is pressed then moving but you still can't control the direction that's where that's where x and y become very valuable instead of using move 10 steps the professional scratch coder will not use that block they'll actually go into the motion and they'll use change X not set X because be careful set X and change X are dangerously close to together and they're very different in what they do so now instead of pressing the spacebar I'll press the right arrow let's go ahead and put the cat there now when I press the right arrow he mows out so smoothly and we'll need to repeat this code block let's go ahead and throw this away we'll need to repaint it do or duplicate it for the left arrow left arrow and then this will be the negative so minus 10 steps there we go so the X changes the position going horizontally as it goes positive it moves to the right negative goes to the laughs so let's go ahead and do that for the Y position as well so we'll duplicate this twice okay this this code block is getting pretty large I'll show you how to save this in just a second so now we want to do the up arrow and we won't be changing the X we'll be changing the Y by a positive value and we'll be changing the Y by a negative value to make the cat go down there we go this is negative 10 and this is a hold on we need the up and the down arrow there we go so this looks correct I think we have all of the code and check that out now how do you make it so the cat faces the direction that you're pointing well that has to do with motion as well and point in direction so let's go look point in direction we'll just go ahead and add this in here so direction when you click on it Direction 90 is to the right we'll need another one of those point in direction so the left will be this direction which is negative 90 I know it's a little strange that they use negative 90 okay so what will this will do is the cat will flip upside down that's okay you actually can set the rotation style right here you can do it in where my image actually is you can change the directions style over there but I like to hardcode it into the code by setting row state tation style right here to don't rotate left to right I think left right will actually work correctly there it goes so that looks pretty good we can add these point in directions to the up arrow well not really unless you want him to point up which you can but then the left right rotation won't work that's another story you're just gonna have to play around with these variables now I told you you can save this code cuz you're probably going to use this in all of your games both many of your games how do you do that just go down to the bottom the backpack click on the backpack and then drag your code in there there now when you're working on your next game you can just go in the backpack drag it out and you have code well you don't want two versions of it but that way you don't have to recode this many many times anyways that is a professional way to move your sprite in scratch
