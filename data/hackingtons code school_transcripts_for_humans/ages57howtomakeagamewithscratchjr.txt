00:00 - look at that throw them through
00:03 - did i just flick a booger at everybody
00:06 - i don't know if i'm an appropriate
00:09 - teacher for
00:10 - scratch jr
00:18 - hey kids welcome to the scratch junior
00:20 - show i'm your host
00:21 - mr matt and you'll need scratch junior
00:24 - downloaded on your ipad or
00:26 - android tablet no it doesn't work on
00:28 - computers or
00:29 - phones so if you don't have it
00:31 - downloaded on your tablet
00:32 - just ask your mom like this mom can i
00:35 - download an
00:36 - educational app that will make me
00:39 - smarter
00:40 - okay that's a bit of much but your mom
00:41 - will probably say yeah sure that
00:44 - sounds great what's cool about scratch
00:45 - junior is you can use your finger
00:48 - for other things like building video
00:52 - games
00:52 - probably should wipe that out
00:58 - this show is for kids kids
01:01 - kids all right so if you've never used
01:05 - scratch
01:05 - junior before then you're probably when
01:07 - you open it up you're going to land on
01:09 - this page
01:10 - and you'll be like where do i push the
01:12 - question mark or well the question mark
01:13 - has a whole bunch of
01:14 - information to answer your questions but
01:16 - i'm going to answer those for you
01:18 - right now right now hold on to your seat
01:22 - so first thing let's do let's hit the
01:24 - home button though you can't see what my
01:26 - finger's doing can you
01:30 - i have too much fun on this show i know
01:33 - okay so
01:33 - here are my projects and it'll probably
01:35 - have an example project if you've never
01:37 - made one
01:38 - but i'm going to go ahead and make my
01:39 - own first project by clicking the plus
01:42 - sign there's so many buttons
01:45 - everywhere what do i do okay calm down
01:49 - breathe everybody first on the left side
01:52 - wait a minute i have to make sure my
01:54 - hand goes the correct way
01:56 - let me point at the right place right
01:58 - there
01:59 - up there at the top you see a scratch
02:02 - cat with a plus sign underneath if you
02:05 - click that plus you can
02:06 - actually add more characters we call
02:10 - them
02:10 - sprites but you can call them characters
02:12 - sprites characters
02:13 - they're the same thing oh there's a
02:17 - rainbow-haired
02:18 - octopus i'm gonna click on that one
02:22 - nothing happened you have to hit the
02:24 - check box
02:25 - in the top corner there once you hit the
02:28 - check box
02:28 - then it adds that sprite or character to
02:31 - your game
02:32 - now i have two characters and i can kind
02:34 - of drag them around that's so cool but
02:36 - they're standing on a white
02:38 - backdrop that's so boring how do i
02:41 - change that
02:42 - well right at the top there's a picture
02:44 - a beautiful picture
02:46 - of a mountain with a blue sky it's very
02:49 - small do you see it
02:50 - click on that right in the top of the
02:52 - middle and then you can change the
02:54 - backdrop
02:54 - what do i want to change this to uh well
02:57 - it's hot right now outside it's
02:59 - summertime so maybe i want to change it
03:01 - to winter
03:02 - i'm going to click the winter theme and
03:04 - then i'll click that
03:05 - check mark there poor scratch cat
03:09 - he's freezing we need to give him some
03:11 - clothes
03:12 - and the octopus is that an octopus i
03:16 - i don't know what do you think what do
03:17 - you think that one is anyways let's
03:19 - start coding first we need to decide
03:22 - which character sprite are we going to
03:24 - code first
03:25 - let's code the scratch cat first so
03:28 - we'll click
03:28 - on the cat so it's selected now look at
03:31 - the bottom there's all these
03:33 - coding we call them blocks these are
03:35 - kind of instructions you give to the
03:37 - game like what's it going to do
03:39 - the first instruction you usually give
03:41 - are the yellow ones so on the far left
03:43 - click the yellow start block and then
03:46 - you'll see on the right side you'll see
03:48 - a green flag i'll just kind of
03:50 - click on it and then drag it you just
03:53 - kind of drag it down look i'll drag them
03:55 - all down so you can see them all
03:57 - and we'll talk about each one no we
03:59 - won't let's just talk about
04:01 - one of them let's talk about the wind
04:03 - clicked there we go
04:04 - wait a minute how do i get rid of them
04:06 - okay so to get rid of the ones you don't
04:08 - want just
04:08 - throw them back into the pile look at
04:11 - that throw them
04:12 - through did i just flick a booger at
04:15 - everybody
04:17 - i don't know if i'm an appropriate
04:20 - teacher for
04:21 - scratch junior perhaps we can hire
04:24 - somebody else in the future
04:25 - anyways what about you do you think you
04:27 - could teach it maybe
04:29 - so i have this starting block here that
04:32 - says
04:32 - when the character is touched or we
04:36 - we'd like to say in programming when
04:38 - clicked or on click
04:39 - okay so when it's clicked what is it
04:42 - going to do
04:42 - let's go to the motion blocks the motion
04:45 - blocks are blue
04:46 - so click on the left to the blue motion
04:48 - blocks and let's let's try a couple
04:50 - here is a move to the right here is a
04:54 - move
04:55 - up oops you have to click on it and then
04:57 - drag it down
04:59 - sometimes there's a delay and then i add
05:01 - too many so i just throw them away
05:02 - let's click these together and see what
05:04 - happens ah there we go
05:06 - now to run the game we just click on
05:09 - well we click on the character huh
05:11 - that's how we programmed it so i'll
05:12 - click the character
05:14 - and he went over one and up one
05:18 - but how far is one one
05:21 - one what one mile
05:24 - did he move one mile did he move one
05:26 - inch units in scratch
05:28 - are actually determined by how far on
05:31 - the screen the character has moved
05:33 - there's a great helper at the top if you
05:35 - go to the very top in the center
05:37 - there's some graph paper click on that
05:39 - graph paper
05:41 - and you'll notice that suddenly the
05:42 - screen has these
05:44 - lines going across it well each one of
05:47 - those squares
05:48 - is one unit of distance so if the cat is
05:51 - going to go
05:52 - over 1 and up 1 watch this when i click
05:55 - them
05:56 - it's the exact same distance on the
05:58 - graph paper we can change this distance
06:01 - by clicking
06:01 - on the number underneath the code block
06:04 - and then choosing a different number
06:06 - i'm going to choose 10. so now he'll go
06:08 - 10
06:09 - over and then instead of going up let's
06:12 - change that so that he goes
06:14 - down and he goes down 5. now let's click
06:17 - him
06:18 - and he goes over and then down
06:22 - pretty cool now the scratch cat has code
06:25 - but the octopus doesn't actually do
06:27 - anything yet so let's fix that
06:29 - first click on the octopus it's name is
06:32 - tac
06:33 - what a strange name okay so
06:36 - this tac the octopus doesn't have any
06:39 - code in the bottom
06:40 - isn't that funny shouldn't it have code
06:42 - no each
06:43 - sprite or character needs to be coded
06:46 - independently
06:47 - or separately so let's have this sprite
06:50 - do something when the cat touches it
06:52 - isn't that cool
06:53 - so click on the yellow starting blocks
06:56 - and then
06:56 - look for the block that looks like two
06:59 - people are
07:00 - holding hands there we go and let's drag
07:04 - that in there it is
07:05 - it looks like they're arm wrestling it
07:06 - actually means when one sprite touches
07:08 - another
07:09 - so when they're colliding is what we say
07:12 - in programming
07:13 - when they're colliding it sounds funny
07:14 - though oh no the cat collided with the
07:17 - octopus and there was an
07:18 - explosion of ink
07:22 - should we do that that would be funny
07:24 - all right so let's just make it real
07:26 - simple what's gonna happen
07:27 - when they run into each other uh let's
07:30 - have him say something and this
07:32 - to say something is in the purple menu
07:35 - and
07:35 - you'll see it says hi there that's
07:38 - pretty simple
07:39 - hi that's so boring can't we just say
07:41 - something else
07:42 - well click on where it says hi and we
07:44 - can say
07:47 - please don't touch me
07:52 - there we go so i'll click go and then
07:55 - now that code block will run
07:56 - if they're touching so let's put the
07:58 - well we have to put
07:59 - the cat in a position we'll actually
08:02 - touch
08:03 - the of the octopus and it worked it said
08:05 - please don't touch me
08:06 - but just saying it isn't as cool as like
08:09 - hearing it so
08:10 - let's see if we can find a recording
08:12 - block and that's in the sounds right
08:14 - here
08:15 - and well it says there's a pop and then
08:18 - there's a record button let's click the
08:19 - record one
08:20 - ah we can record i'll click the record
08:22 - button
08:24 - please don't touch me and stop
08:28 - all right i'll click the check mark and
08:30 - now we have that recording
08:32 - so instead of having the words i'm going
08:33 - to throw that away i'm going to add that
08:35 - recording
08:36 - right there now let's get them far away
08:39 - and let's reset the game by
08:40 - pressing the green flag and touch the
08:43 - cat
08:45 - please don't touch me
08:49 - please don't touch me it's still going
08:53 - don't touch me please
08:56 - don't that that's funny
08:59 - so after after they
09:03 - collide or touch each other let's have
09:06 - the uh
09:07 - let's have the octopus move to a
09:09 - different location
09:11 - so we'll go and go to the move blocks
09:14 - and we'll let's let him go to the left
09:18 - and then we'll go up let's change this
09:21 - number
09:22 - to eight there we go so this should work
09:25 - pretty well let's start the game again
09:26 - i'll push the cat
09:28 - whoop push the cat once please don't
09:30 - touch me
09:34 - and there he goes he moves away now what
09:37 - i'd like it to do is to go to a
09:39 - different
09:40 - scene now remember we have these
09:42 - backdrops on the right hand side
09:43 - and you'll see a plus symbol you can
09:46 - actually add
09:47 - a new scene to the game oh i want to get
09:50 - rid of that graph paper too so let's
09:52 - click
09:52 - on the the not graph paper there it oop
09:54 - i made it full screen
09:58 - i pushed the wrong one so click on the
09:59 - the graph paper again it will remove it
10:02 - and let's choose a different backdrop
10:04 - and this time
10:05 - let's choose the night scene and i'll
10:08 - push
10:09 - check mark there it is ah now it's in
10:11 - the dark
10:12 - but my characters have all disappeared
10:15 - what happened well the characters
10:19 - all have or the sprites all have their
10:21 - own code
10:22 - and they all live on one backdrop
10:26 - so if you switch the backdrop watch this
10:28 - or the scene
10:30 - those characters may or may not exist
10:32 - depending on whether or not you put them
10:34 - in the game
10:35 - so in scene one there is an octopus
10:39 - and there is a cat but in scene two
10:42 - there's nothing but a cat
10:43 - because they always give you a cat in
10:45 - fact if you want to get rid of the cat
10:47 - just put your mouse over hold down and
10:49 - then click
10:50 - the x button and it's gone now there's
10:52 - nothing
10:53 - it's so boring so let's add something to
10:55 - this scene
10:57 - let's add a pig there we go
11:00 - and then there's a pig in the middle and
11:03 - it doesn't have any code so let's say
11:06 - when the game starts on here
11:09 - when the game starts this piggy will
11:12 - jump up and down this is my one of my
11:15 - favorite code blocks it's called the hop
11:17 - block
11:18 - and you determine how far he hops up
11:21 - by changing the number at the bottom so
11:23 - i'm going to have him go up four
11:25 - there he is and now i want him to keep
11:27 - hopping
11:28 - so what do you do if you want it to keep
11:30 - going over and over again
11:32 - you go to the control blocks which are
11:34 - orange
11:36 - there it is and there's a repeat block
11:38 - so we have
11:39 - a repeat right here and you can wrap it
11:42 - around your block
11:43 - so now he's going to jump up and down
11:47 - four times why because the repeat block
11:49 - says
11:50 - four let's see how that works let's
11:52 - start the game
11:54 - there he's just jumping four times what
11:58 - if i want to make him jump forever
12:00 - that's impossible how can you do that
12:03 - well there's a cool block
12:04 - in the end blocks you see these red ones
12:08 - there's actually a forever loop right
12:10 - there so let me show you how you this
12:12 - does i'm gonna
12:12 - undo all these blocks i'm gonna have
12:15 - them jump and then
12:16 - this block will make that repeat
12:20 - isn't that cool so let's just see what
12:21 - that looks like i'll throw this away
12:23 - there it is now we'll start it and now
12:26 - he jumps
12:27 - forever but how do you make the
12:30 - different
12:31 - scenes or backdrops change during a game
12:34 - well we're actually in the right menu do
12:36 - you see this block right
12:38 - here this is the scene changing block
12:41 - so how do we use it well let's go to the
12:44 - first scene in the game
12:45 - so scene 1 which is in the snow after
12:48 - our code blocks run
12:50 - we want to change the scene or more
12:53 - specifically
12:54 - when after the character the octopus
12:58 - moves away
12:59 - that's when we want to change the scene
13:01 - so we'll put the change
13:02 - scene block right there and so the only
13:05 - scene available
13:06 - is the the night one you can add up to
13:08 - four scenes to your game
13:11 - there this should work perfectly so to
13:13 - play this game when we want to show it
13:14 - to our friends we don't want to show
13:16 - them the code
13:17 - we want to show them the final game so
13:19 - up at the top
13:20 - next to the grid paper you see the full
13:23 - screen button
13:24 - you hand the game to them i think for me
13:27 - thank you so much let me play your game
13:29 - so you click the start flag to start
13:31 - everything
13:32 - and then in this game you have to press
13:34 - the cat
13:37 - please don't touch me
13:41 - and now it changes
13:46 - that's what i look like in the morning
13:48 - where's my breakfast
13:50 - anyways i really hope you enjoyed this
13:53 - bouncing pig tutorial go ask your
13:56 - parents to download scratch junior
13:58 - build something awesome i can't wait to
14:01 - see what you make

Cleaned transcript:

look at that throw them through did i just flick a booger at everybody i don't know if i'm an appropriate teacher for scratch jr hey kids welcome to the scratch junior show i'm your host mr matt and you'll need scratch junior downloaded on your ipad or android tablet no it doesn't work on computers or phones so if you don't have it downloaded on your tablet just ask your mom like this mom can i download an educational app that will make me smarter okay that's a bit of much but your mom will probably say yeah sure that sounds great what's cool about scratch junior is you can use your finger for other things like building video games probably should wipe that out this show is for kids kids kids all right so if you've never used scratch junior before then you're probably when you open it up you're going to land on this page and you'll be like where do i push the question mark or well the question mark has a whole bunch of information to answer your questions but i'm going to answer those for you right now right now hold on to your seat so first thing let's do let's hit the home button though you can't see what my finger's doing can you i have too much fun on this show i know okay so here are my projects and it'll probably have an example project if you've never made one but i'm going to go ahead and make my own first project by clicking the plus sign there's so many buttons everywhere what do i do okay calm down breathe everybody first on the left side wait a minute i have to make sure my hand goes the correct way let me point at the right place right there up there at the top you see a scratch cat with a plus sign underneath if you click that plus you can actually add more characters we call them sprites but you can call them characters sprites characters they're the same thing oh there's a rainbowhaired octopus i'm gonna click on that one nothing happened you have to hit the check box in the top corner there once you hit the check box then it adds that sprite or character to your game now i have two characters and i can kind of drag them around that's so cool but they're standing on a white backdrop that's so boring how do i change that well right at the top there's a picture a beautiful picture of a mountain with a blue sky it's very small do you see it click on that right in the top of the middle and then you can change the backdrop what do i want to change this to uh well it's hot right now outside it's summertime so maybe i want to change it to winter i'm going to click the winter theme and then i'll click that check mark there poor scratch cat he's freezing we need to give him some clothes and the octopus is that an octopus i i don't know what do you think what do you think that one is anyways let's start coding first we need to decide which character sprite are we going to code first let's code the scratch cat first so we'll click on the cat so it's selected now look at the bottom there's all these coding we call them blocks these are kind of instructions you give to the game like what's it going to do the first instruction you usually give are the yellow ones so on the far left click the yellow start block and then you'll see on the right side you'll see a green flag i'll just kind of click on it and then drag it you just kind of drag it down look i'll drag them all down so you can see them all and we'll talk about each one no we won't let's just talk about one of them let's talk about the wind clicked there we go wait a minute how do i get rid of them okay so to get rid of the ones you don't want just throw them back into the pile look at that throw them through did i just flick a booger at everybody i don't know if i'm an appropriate teacher for scratch junior perhaps we can hire somebody else in the future anyways what about you do you think you could teach it maybe so i have this starting block here that says when the character is touched or we we'd like to say in programming when clicked or on click okay so when it's clicked what is it going to do let's go to the motion blocks the motion blocks are blue so click on the left to the blue motion blocks and let's let's try a couple here is a move to the right here is a move up oops you have to click on it and then drag it down sometimes there's a delay and then i add too many so i just throw them away let's click these together and see what happens ah there we go now to run the game we just click on well we click on the character huh that's how we programmed it so i'll click the character and he went over one and up one but how far is one one one what one mile did he move one mile did he move one inch units in scratch are actually determined by how far on the screen the character has moved there's a great helper at the top if you go to the very top in the center there's some graph paper click on that graph paper and you'll notice that suddenly the screen has these lines going across it well each one of those squares is one unit of distance so if the cat is going to go over 1 and up 1 watch this when i click them it's the exact same distance on the graph paper we can change this distance by clicking on the number underneath the code block and then choosing a different number i'm going to choose 10. so now he'll go 10 over and then instead of going up let's change that so that he goes down and he goes down 5. now let's click him and he goes over and then down pretty cool now the scratch cat has code but the octopus doesn't actually do anything yet so let's fix that first click on the octopus it's name is tac what a strange name okay so this tac the octopus doesn't have any code in the bottom isn't that funny shouldn't it have code no each sprite or character needs to be coded independently or separately so let's have this sprite do something when the cat touches it isn't that cool so click on the yellow starting blocks and then look for the block that looks like two people are holding hands there we go and let's drag that in there it is it looks like they're arm wrestling it actually means when one sprite touches another so when they're colliding is what we say in programming when they're colliding it sounds funny though oh no the cat collided with the octopus and there was an explosion of ink should we do that that would be funny all right so let's just make it real simple what's gonna happen when they run into each other uh let's have him say something and this to say something is in the purple menu and you'll see it says hi there that's pretty simple hi that's so boring can't we just say something else well click on where it says hi and we can say please don't touch me there we go so i'll click go and then now that code block will run if they're touching so let's put the well we have to put the cat in a position we'll actually touch the of the octopus and it worked it said please don't touch me but just saying it isn't as cool as like hearing it so let's see if we can find a recording block and that's in the sounds right here and well it says there's a pop and then there's a record button let's click the record one ah we can record i'll click the record button please don't touch me and stop all right i'll click the check mark and now we have that recording so instead of having the words i'm going to throw that away i'm going to add that recording right there now let's get them far away and let's reset the game by pressing the green flag and touch the cat please don't touch me please don't touch me it's still going don't touch me please don't that that's funny so after after they collide or touch each other let's have the uh let's have the octopus move to a different location so we'll go and go to the move blocks and we'll let's let him go to the left and then we'll go up let's change this number to eight there we go so this should work pretty well let's start the game again i'll push the cat whoop push the cat once please don't touch me and there he goes he moves away now what i'd like it to do is to go to a different scene now remember we have these backdrops on the right hand side and you'll see a plus symbol you can actually add a new scene to the game oh i want to get rid of that graph paper too so let's click on the the not graph paper there it oop i made it full screen i pushed the wrong one so click on the the graph paper again it will remove it and let's choose a different backdrop and this time let's choose the night scene and i'll push check mark there it is ah now it's in the dark but my characters have all disappeared what happened well the characters all have or the sprites all have their own code and they all live on one backdrop so if you switch the backdrop watch this or the scene those characters may or may not exist depending on whether or not you put them in the game so in scene one there is an octopus and there is a cat but in scene two there's nothing but a cat because they always give you a cat in fact if you want to get rid of the cat just put your mouse over hold down and then click the x button and it's gone now there's nothing it's so boring so let's add something to this scene let's add a pig there we go and then there's a pig in the middle and it doesn't have any code so let's say when the game starts on here when the game starts this piggy will jump up and down this is my one of my favorite code blocks it's called the hop block and you determine how far he hops up by changing the number at the bottom so i'm going to have him go up four there he is and now i want him to keep hopping so what do you do if you want it to keep going over and over again you go to the control blocks which are orange there it is and there's a repeat block so we have a repeat right here and you can wrap it around your block so now he's going to jump up and down four times why because the repeat block says four let's see how that works let's start the game there he's just jumping four times what if i want to make him jump forever that's impossible how can you do that well there's a cool block in the end blocks you see these red ones there's actually a forever loop right there so let me show you how you this does i'm gonna undo all these blocks i'm gonna have them jump and then this block will make that repeat isn't that cool so let's just see what that looks like i'll throw this away there it is now we'll start it and now he jumps forever but how do you make the different scenes or backdrops change during a game well we're actually in the right menu do you see this block right here this is the scene changing block so how do we use it well let's go to the first scene in the game so scene 1 which is in the snow after our code blocks run we want to change the scene or more specifically when after the character the octopus moves away that's when we want to change the scene so we'll put the change scene block right there and so the only scene available is the the night one you can add up to four scenes to your game there this should work perfectly so to play this game when we want to show it to our friends we don't want to show them the code we want to show them the final game so up at the top next to the grid paper you see the full screen button you hand the game to them i think for me thank you so much let me play your game so you click the start flag to start everything and then in this game you have to press the cat please don't touch me and now it changes that's what i look like in the morning where's my breakfast anyways i really hope you enjoyed this bouncing pig tutorial go ask your parents to download scratch junior build something awesome i can't wait to see what you make
