00:00 - okay so see if you guys can figure this
00:02 - out so I'm going to lay the challenge in
00:03 - front of you as well the the challenges
00:06 - don't use Google but I have a list of
00:08 - numbers here how would I find the
00:10 - largest value that is in this list how
00:14 - would you do that
00:17 - [Music]
00:22 - you
00:27 - all right so this was a challenge that I
00:30 - placed in front of my Python Club
00:33 - students and they almost got that they
00:35 - almost figured it out without using
00:37 - Google or anything there's two different
00:39 - ways actually there's a lots of
00:40 - different ways to do it but there's two
00:42 - main ways if you can figure it out
00:45 - include a link to your code down in the
00:47 - comments don't cheat and watch the rest
00:49 - of the video but let's see if you guys
00:50 - can figure it out
00:51 - alright you give up alright so there's
00:53 - two ways we can create a for loop that
00:55 - loops through the entire list and
00:57 - compares the number it's on to the
01:00 - highest number it has encountered so far
01:02 - so we create a variable called largest
01:04 - and we're just going to set that equal
01:05 - to zero zero is right now the largest
01:08 - number that we have then what we can do
01:14 - is we can create a for loop that for I
01:16 - in numbers so for a variable inside of
01:20 - our list of numbers we will compare if I
01:25 - is larger than largest so basically is
01:29 - the number we're on bigger than the
01:32 - number we've already encountered if so
01:34 - set this new number that we're currently
01:35 - on to be the largest number so largest
01:40 - equals I and then we can go ahead and
01:44 - then just print out largest cool so if
01:49 - we run this we can see in our console it
01:51 - started at six thousand nine hundred
01:53 - seven went through these numbers until
01:55 - it hit eight thousand six hundred thirty
01:56 - nine switch that to be the largest
01:58 - number until it hit this number here
02:00 - switched that to be largest and then
02:02 - went through the rest of the list until
02:04 - it hit the last number this last number
02:06 - is actually the largest number but
02:09 - pythons clever there's actually a
02:12 - built-in method that you can use so what
02:14 - we can do is we can let's just print out
02:16 - the max value that's in this numbers
02:19 - list run it and we print out the largest
02:22 - value it's that easy
02:24 - Python thought ahead Python is used to
02:26 - dealing with large sets of data so it
02:29 - created a built-in function that allows
02:31 - us to find the largest number in this
02:33 - list now why would we use this function
02:36 - instead of the for loop why do they even
02:39 - create this well the for loop
02:41 - take some time to run a for loop has a
02:44 - time cost to it so you can imagine a
02:48 - hundred numbers not a big deal
02:50 - a thousand numbers probably not a big
02:51 - deal two hundred and fifty billion
02:54 - numbers that's a big deal
02:57 - creating a four loop that will loop
02:59 - through every single number and check
03:01 - every single number against a value that
03:03 - you have stored that's gonna take a lot
03:05 - longer than a built-in function so
03:10 - Python is used to be using we're dealing
03:12 - with large values so they created a
03:14 - function to handle large values at least
03:16 - when it comes to finding the largest
03:17 - value in a list all right hopefully you
03:20 - guys accomplished that challenge if not
03:23 - it's okay that's why we have these
03:25 - tutorials and if you want to check out
03:27 - the Python club head over to hacking is
03:29 - calm and sign up for a free trial so you
03:31 - can come join us and compete in these
03:33 - crazy challenges learn cool stuff that's
03:36 - not part of YouTube or part of hacking
03:38 - Tain's it's just part of the club the
03:40 - super fun I take a look at your code and
03:42 - answer questions it's a blast come check
03:45 - it out alright go build some Python
03:47 - stuff

okay so see if you guys can figure this out so I'm going to lay the challenge in front of you as well the the challenges don't use Google but I have a list of numbers here how would I find the largest value that is in this list how would you do that you all right so this was a challenge that I placed in front of my Python Club students and they almost got that they almost figured it out without using Google or anything there's two different ways actually there's a lots of different ways to do it but there's two main ways if you can figure it out include a link to your code down in the comments don't cheat and watch the rest of the video but let's see if you guys can figure it out alright you give up alright so there's two ways we can create a for loop that loops through the entire list and compares the number it's on to the highest number it has encountered so far so we create a variable called largest and we're just going to set that equal to zero zero is right now the largest number that we have then what we can do is we can create a for loop that for I in numbers so for a variable inside of our list of numbers we will compare if I is larger than largest so basically is the number we're on bigger than the number we've already encountered if so set this new number that we're currently on to be the largest number so largest equals I and then we can go ahead and then just print out largest cool so if we run this we can see in our console it started at six thousand nine hundred seven went through these numbers until it hit eight thousand six hundred thirty nine switch that to be the largest number until it hit this number here switched that to be largest and then went through the rest of the list until it hit the last number this last number is actually the largest number but pythons clever there's actually a builtin method that you can use so what we can do is we can let's just print out the max value that's in this numbers list run it and we print out the largest value it's that easy Python thought ahead Python is used to dealing with large sets of data so it created a builtin function that allows us to find the largest number in this list now why would we use this function instead of the for loop why do they even create this well the for loop take some time to run a for loop has a time cost to it so you can imagine a hundred numbers not a big deal a thousand numbers probably not a big deal two hundred and fifty billion numbers that's a big deal creating a four loop that will loop through every single number and check every single number against a value that you have stored that's gonna take a lot longer than a builtin function so Python is used to be using we're dealing with large values so they created a function to handle large values at least when it comes to finding the largest value in a list all right hopefully you guys accomplished that challenge if not it's okay that's why we have these tutorials and if you want to check out the Python club head over to hacking is calm and sign up for a free trial so you can come join us and compete in these crazy challenges learn cool stuff that's not part of YouTube or part of hacking Tain's it's just part of the club the super fun I take a look at your code and answer questions it's a blast come check it out alright go build some Python stuff
