00:00 - all right so today we're gonna be taking
00:01 - a look at a distance joint 2d which is
00:04 - something that you would use to make a
00:06 - pendulum so think of a clock the
00:08 - pendulum that swings to keep track of
00:10 - the seconds think of a Chain Chomp from
00:13 - Mario think of a bicycle with the two
00:16 - wheels that's actually a pendulum that's
00:18 - between those two but it's set to be
00:20 - fixed anything like that you're going to
00:22 - use a distance joint to D to make
00:34 - so in my game here I have a couple of
00:36 - things set up already so we can hit play
00:38 - and I just have a player that follows my
00:41 - mouse and then an enemy that if I
00:43 - collide with it it sends me back to
00:45 - start basically just refreshes the scene
00:47 - this stuff you guys can build on your
00:49 - own you don't have to watch me do it
00:50 - it's part of the color bump tutorial if
00:53 - you're enrolled in hacking Tain's
00:54 - alright so we're going to take our enemy
00:56 - here and we're gonna add a distance
00:58 - joint 2d component to it so I just add
01:01 - component I type in distance joint and I
01:04 - choose 2d now this will default to
01:07 - connecting it to the closest game object
01:10 - but what we can do is that circle we can
01:12 - actually move it and this is the top
01:15 - part of the pendulum so you think of
01:17 - this is the thing this is the pole that
01:20 - the chain is tied to and this is the top
01:22 - of the clock that's gonna pendulum the
01:26 - whatever the thing at the bottom is
01:27 - called maybe it's just called a pendulum
01:29 - and now if I hit play we can see that
01:32 - because gravity acts on it and the
01:34 - pendulum is offset it will swing back
01:37 - and forth once we see that it works
01:39 - we'll take a look at the settings and
01:42 - play with it a little bit oh I need
01:44 - gravity reactivated for that so go back
01:47 - into my enemy and we will turn back on
01:50 - dynamic so that gravity will act on my
01:53 - enemy which will pull it down and a
01:56 - distance 2d how its configured right now
01:59 - it will keep the distance from the point
02:03 - to the object the same it will always be
02:06 - equal so it's like a like a rod instead
02:09 - of a string where it can only go in one
02:12 - direction now if we go back and we take
02:15 - a look at a distance joint 2d we have
02:18 - this enabled collision checkbox we can
02:21 - check that and then it will actually
02:22 - collide with whatever game object that
02:24 - it's glued to we have the connected
02:29 - rigidbody so if I wanted this to be
02:31 - let's say connect it to the player at
02:34 - all times I could take the player drag
02:37 - it into this box and now that pendulum
02:41 - is connected to the player and just for
02:43 - good measure we move that over and we
02:45 - can see
02:46 - we can see that when I move the enemy
02:50 - moves with me so it's kind of like you
02:54 - could do you could use that to create
02:55 - some sort of force field you could do
02:57 - that to create a spinning like if you
02:59 - were creating a car game and you had
03:01 - this weapon that swung around to injure
03:03 - other other cars you could do that if we
03:06 - set it to none then it's just wherever
03:08 - this anchor point is we also have an
03:13 - actual numbering like X and y coordinate
03:16 - for that anchor if you wanted to
03:17 - hard-code it or pass in variables that
03:19 - allowed it to move we also have the auto
03:22 - configure distance if we do that then we
03:24 - can ignore this distance here where
03:26 - wherever this is that distance number
03:29 - will adjust we can do max distance only
03:32 - so that it can go closer to the anchor
03:35 - point but not further away and then
03:37 - brake force we have it set to infinity
03:39 - so that no matter how much force is
03:42 - applied to this object that distance
03:44 - joint will never break but if you want
03:46 - it to be like a tether ball where if you
03:48 - hard enough and broke and flew into the
03:50 - distance you could do change this break
03:53 - force to a smaller number and then
03:55 - eventually that thing would break and it
03:57 - would fly off so that's distance joint
03:59 - 2d build something really cool with this
04:02 - add it to your color bump add it to I
04:04 - don't know you guys are way more
04:06 - creative than I am add it to something
04:08 - cool and I want to shout out Maurice W
04:10 - from the Roseville location for showing
04:12 - me this
04:12 - really cool all right any questions guys
