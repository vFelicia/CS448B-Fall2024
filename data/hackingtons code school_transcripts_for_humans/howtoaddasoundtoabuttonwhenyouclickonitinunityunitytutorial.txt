00:00 - hello everyone today we're going to be
00:02 - adding sounds to our unity game
00:06 - here i have a main menu and i want to
00:09 - add a very simple sound i want to put a
00:11 - clicking sound on my button because
00:13 - right now when i play the game
00:18 - there's no sound you can't hear anything
00:20 - we want to make our game look polished
00:22 - even a sound as simple as a click helps
00:25 - so before we do anything unity we need
00:27 - to find a sound
00:29 - there are a lot of places to find sounds
00:32 - but there's actually one place that you
00:33 - might have used before if you're
00:35 - familiar with websites pixabay is a
00:37 - great place to find royalty free stock
00:39 - photos and also sound effects as it
00:42 - turns out so i'm going to search for a
00:44 - click sound
00:46 - and we got a lot of sounds here we've
00:49 - got mouse clicks
00:52 - we've also got
00:54 - more mouse clicks i only want one click
00:57 - though let's see if i can find here we
00:59 - go
01:00 - this is perfect
01:01 - okay this is exactly the sound i want so
01:04 - now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go
01:06 - over here and i'm gonna click download
01:09 - it downloads it over here it's always
01:11 - important to credit where you get your
01:13 - sounds from even if it's as simple as a
01:16 - click sound so here pixabay is making it
01:18 - really easy
01:20 - not really music but i would say click
01:21 - sound by
01:23 - this person from pixabay i would copy
01:25 - that and then i'd put it into a credits
01:27 - panel page something in my game so
01:30 - people can see where the sounds came
01:32 - from now that i have the sound
01:33 - downloaded let's get it into unity we
01:35 - can get this into our project a bunch of
01:37 - different ways the easiest way is to
01:39 - open up your file explorer go to
01:41 - downloads it's right there i'm going to
01:43 - drag it in
01:45 - to unity
01:46 - and there it is i'm going to go over to
01:48 - the button and add a component i want to
01:50 - add an audio source
01:53 - there it is
01:55 - and then
01:56 - i'm going to drag my click sound
01:58 - into
01:59 - the audio clip section here
02:02 - it's going to play as soon as the game
02:04 - starts so i'm going to uncheck that but
02:06 - now when i run the game we still don't
02:08 - hear the sound we actually have to write
02:10 - a script to tell the game when to use
02:13 - the sound so to do that all i'm going to
02:15 - do is go to the canvas i'm going to add
02:17 - a component i'm going to make a main
02:20 - menu
02:21 - script this is something you'll want to
02:22 - do anyways if you're making a menu this
02:24 - can be where we control what the button
02:26 - does as well but for now we're just
02:28 - going to be telling it to make a sound
02:30 - so in my main menu script i'm going to
02:32 - go ahead and make a variable at the top
02:35 - that is public
02:38 - audio source audio now i have a variable
02:41 - that will hold our audio source i can
02:43 - delete all these for now it is a public
02:45 - function that can be used outside of the
02:47 - script it has a void return type so it
02:49 - doesn't return any information
02:52 - and it's going to be called play button
02:56 - and the only thing this function is
02:58 - going to do
02:59 - is audio dot play
03:03 - there we go let's save this and set it
03:05 - up back in unity we have our main
03:07 - manuscript and it needs an audio source
03:10 - so i'm going to go to the button
03:12 - check to make sure i have our audio
03:13 - source here which we do
03:15 - i'm going to go back to the canvas and
03:16 - drag the button
03:18 - into this slot there
03:21 - now on the button we have to tell it to
03:23 - use the function that we just wrote so
03:25 - i'm going to go to the button
03:28 - section here and there's a box down here
03:30 - that says on click this is what controls
03:32 - what happens when you click the button
03:34 - i'm going to press the
03:35 - plus button
03:37 - here and then i'm going to drag the
03:39 - canvas
03:40 - into this box
03:42 - the canvas has our main menu script on
03:44 - it
03:45 - i'm going to go to the function menu and
03:48 - find main menu and then finder play
03:50 - button and now if i run the game i can
03:52 - click the button as much as i want these
03:54 - small details add so much to your
03:56 - projects all you need to do is import
03:59 - the sound add an audio source to one of
04:02 - your game objects and then trigger the
04:04 - sound effect somehow usually using a
04:07 - script let's see what you can build in
04:09 - unity
04:13 - [Music]
