00:00 - what is happening everybody christian

00:07 - ah excuse me one second oh what's up
00:10 - admin
00:12 - oh yeah we can we can do that too for
00:14 - unity it's not just for scratch
00:17 - sweet when now well i got just the
00:20 - project
00:20 - okay cool yeah all right
00:24 - i just got word from admin that we get
00:26 - to authorize 100
00:27 - for the first completed unity game jam
00:30 - project
00:31 - so this is going out to yash a
00:34 - congratulations josh a let me show you
00:36 - what he did
00:39 - this is galatia a lunar landing game
00:42 - it's got eight levels eight planets but
00:43 - no pluto
00:45 - starting off on mercury pretty
00:47 - straightforward gets the player a chance
00:48 - to actually learn the controls and try a
00:50 - little bit
00:51 - and then on venus you start seeing some
00:53 - cool effects new
00:55 - fire awesome land
00:59 - dodge and here's where it starts to get
01:00 - a little bit interesting
01:02 - now you can't touch the trees but there
01:04 - are certain parts where you can
01:05 - pass through so you gotta squeak through
01:08 - to get to the next level
01:09 - and on mars it's hard to tell where the
01:11 - bad guys are and where the landing pad
01:13 - is this is where it starts to get really
01:15 - challenging here on jupiter because
01:17 - you're coming down with such a high
01:18 - velocity you've got to really tap it
01:20 - i spent a lot of time on saturn
01:23 - ultimately this is probably the 30
01:25 - 40 50th attempt but the long and short
01:27 - of it finally made it
01:29 - uranus also took me a long long time to
01:31 - complete
01:32 - so just be careful when you're coming
01:34 - down there's a little thing you can
01:35 - touch on the end so just avoid that
01:38 - neptune awesome love the crystal design
01:40 - it's really unique
01:42 - you win great work yash
01:45 - and for everybody else following along
01:46 - this is a perfect example of what we
01:48 - mean by a completed game
01:50 - the idea is it has a title screen an end
01:53 - screen
01:54 - levels in between and design that makes
01:56 - it different
01:57 - alright guys good luck we'll see in
01:59 - hackington's
