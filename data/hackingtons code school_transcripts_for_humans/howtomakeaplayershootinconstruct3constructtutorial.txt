00:00 - let's give the player the ability to
00:02 - shoot it's going to be pretty simple if
00:04 - you've done projectiles before this
00:05 - would be no problem all right so the
00:07 - first thing that we need to do is we
00:08 - need to actually create the Sprite
00:10 - that's going to be like a throwing star
00:12 - or some sort of projectile that the user
00:14 - the player will actually instantiate in
00:16 - and then fire so I'm going to come up
00:20 - here right click insert new object it is
00:22 - going to be a Sprite and I'm going to
00:25 - choose sprite from the menu and then I'm
00:27 - going to click somewhere up here it
00:28 - doesn't really matter where we click
00:30 - because we're going to move this off the
00:31 - screen and I'll explain why now we need
00:34 - to grab in the artwork for this throwing
00:36 - star so I'm inside the RPG assets I'm
00:39 - going to go to items and then go to
00:41 - weapons and my sure can or my throwing
00:44 - star is down here at the bottom and this
00:46 - is the Sprite that I'm going to add in
00:48 - this is the artwork uh import from files
00:50 - all right I'm going to go ahead and
00:51 - delete that first frame of the animation
00:53 - and it's just a single throwing star I'm
00:55 - going to crop around it so that all of
00:57 - the colliders and everything are right
00:58 - up against it and we are are good we
01:00 - don't need to name this animation or
01:02 - anything like that because it's just a
01:03 - single object that flies through space
01:05 - so now we have it here now construct is
01:09 - a little bit funny you can't instantiate
01:11 - objects that are just part of your
01:13 - project they actually have to be in the
01:15 - scene to be used so what I'm going to do
01:18 - is I'm going to zoom out a little bit
01:19 - here and I'm going to take this throwing
01:22 - star the shuriken and I'm going to move
01:23 - it off of the screen someplace where the
01:26 - player can't get to it and the camera
01:28 - will never see it it's going to be up
01:30 - off the left hand corner or bottom right
01:33 - or somewhere off of the regular screen
01:35 - but it's still there because I'm going
01:37 - to need to actually instantiate a copy
01:38 - of it I'm going to need some of these
01:40 - traits to stay all of the time one of
01:43 - those traits is the size I'm going to
01:44 - change the size from 18 by 18 to 8 by 8.
01:49 - that is about half the size of one of
01:51 - these squares which is a perfect size to
01:53 - be a throwable object that looks awesome
01:57 - then I'm going to go ahead and select it
01:59 - from my project pane here this grabs the
02:02 - parent the actual like cut prefab of
02:06 - this object and I'm going to go ahead
02:07 - and add a behavior to it and it's going
02:10 - to be a bullet Behavior because this is
02:13 - going to act like a bullet double click
02:15 - to add that in that looks awesome now a
02:18 - couple of things that you might want to
02:19 - change about this bullet Behavior now
02:21 - these are up to you whether or not you
02:23 - want to change this here's the speed
02:25 - that is how fast this gets thrown so
02:28 - play your game see how it works and then
02:30 - you might want to just change the speed
02:32 - right off the bat
02:34 - this right here is bounce off solids so
02:38 - anytime it hits an edge or it hits a
02:40 - wall or hits something like that it'll
02:42 - actually bounce off this can actually be
02:44 - turned on and off in your event sheet to
02:47 - give your bullets kind of power ups same
02:51 - with the speed you could actually make
02:52 - them fire faster and move faster
02:54 - depending on certain things they collect
02:55 - in the scene so for me I'm going to
02:57 - leave this off because I don't want it
02:59 - to bounce off yet but later down the
03:00 - road I might give the player the ability
03:02 - to unlock the ability for this to to
03:04 - bounce off all right so we have
03:06 - everything in our scene let's go ahead
03:08 - and go to the event sheet and add in all
03:10 - of the events
03:12 - I'm going to add a new event and when
03:13 - the mouse left button is clicked so I
03:18 - want to find the left button clicked so
03:21 - on click and then which Mouse button
03:24 - we're going to choose the left Mouse
03:25 - button which click type it's clicked we
03:27 - could also do double click so they
03:29 - actually have to double click to shoot
03:30 - but clicked feels better in a game if
03:33 - you're playing any professional game you
03:34 - click to shoot and that's what we're
03:35 - going to do here we're going to go ahead
03:37 - and hit done so now when the mouse is
03:39 - left button is clicked we're going to
03:41 - fire something so just in case you guys
03:43 - don't know there are two or more buttons
03:45 - on your map on your mouse there's the
03:47 - left click which is where your index
03:48 - finger rests and the right click which
03:50 - is where your middle finger rests we
03:52 - want left click that's where your
03:54 - pointer finger rests and so that's what
03:55 - we're going to use now we're going to go
03:57 - ahead and add in some actions the first
03:59 - thing that we're going to add in is the
04:01 - player is going to spawn an object
04:06 - and that object is going to be that sure
04:09 - kit I named mine Sprite let's go ahead
04:11 - and rename that once we add in this
04:12 - event it's going to be on layer 0 which
04:14 - is the same layer as the player is on
04:16 - and all of that looks good let's go
04:19 - ahead and click done now I'm just going
04:21 - to rename this sprite from Sprite to be
04:24 - um uh star
04:27 - for for like a throwing star awesome I
04:31 - love how you change it here and it
04:32 - changes it everywhere in your code you
04:34 - don't have to go back through and
04:35 - refactor or anything so now that we've
04:37 - spawned one in we need to set its
04:39 - position to be the same position as the
04:41 - player so it spawns in and then like
04:42 - goes to the player so that when we set
04:46 - the bullet angle and we actually fire
04:47 - the bullet
04:49 - we do that from the player not from some
04:51 - random spot on the screen so let's add
04:53 - an action and we're going to change
04:55 - something about the star we're going to
04:57 - set its position so let's go ahead and
05:00 - find set position
05:03 - so I can type set
05:04 - and we want set
05:10 - position we're going to set the position
05:12 - now the X position is going to be the
05:16 - same as the player so we can grab the
05:17 - player and their X component of their
05:20 - position and we're gonna do the same
05:22 - thing for the Y we're going to grab the
05:23 - player and grab the Y component of its
05:26 - transform of its position and then hit
05:29 - done so this line of code will actually
05:31 - set the position of the star to be the
05:34 - position of the player zoom in a little
05:36 - bit so you can see that a bit better
05:38 - now when we hit left button we also want
05:42 - to set the angle that the bullet is
05:45 - facing
05:47 - set the angle the bullet is facing to
05:50 - face the mouse because the mouse is how
05:53 - we Aim so we're going to go ahead and
05:55 - add an action it's going to be on the
05:57 - throwing star the throwing star is doing
05:59 - something and we are setting the bullet
06:02 - angle we're not setting the angle of the
06:04 - throwing star we're setting the bullet
06:06 - angle this is very different so we want
06:08 - to set the angle of motion
06:12 - on the bullet now this takes in
06:16 - um a little bit of code so the angle is
06:19 - going to be an a certain angle the angle
06:22 - takes in some parameters it takes a
06:24 - first X and Y and then a second X and Y
06:27 - so the first X and Y is going to be the
06:31 - throwing stars or the Stars X and Y star
06:35 - dot X comma star dot y now the second
06:39 - one is the mouse's position so Mouse dot
06:42 - X
06:43 - and mouse
06:45 - dot y now this creates two points in
06:48 - space and then measures the angle
06:50 - between those two points and sets the
06:53 - throwing stars angle to be that same
06:55 - angle which just basically says
06:57 - find these two points make a right
06:59 - triangle find that angle rotate the
07:01 - bullet to that angle awesome this is
07:06 - super hard to do in unity Unity we'd
07:08 - have to use our quaternion and Euler
07:10 - angles in construct we just right angle
07:13 - and then pass in the two things that
07:14 - we're measuring the angle between so so
07:16 - cool all right done we have this in
07:20 - degrees this is perfect now what I want
07:22 - to do is I want to wait a few seconds
07:24 - before it gets to straight so we've
07:26 - created the bullet we've fired it now we
07:28 - need to eventually destroy it so that we
07:30 - don't overload the ram in the game so
07:32 - system I'm going to go ahead and grab a
07:34 - weight
07:35 - and that weight is going to be two
07:37 - seconds if you want your bullets to
07:39 - disappear faster you can make this a
07:41 - smaller number I encourage you to change
07:44 - this number based on the game that you
07:46 - have in the size of your map maybe two
07:48 - seconds allows it to go across the
07:49 - entire map and kill every enemy maybe
07:51 - you need it to be 0.2 seconds because
07:53 - your map is really small and you don't
07:55 - want somebody like Superman to throw the
07:58 - star you want it to be like a regular
07:59 - ninja so I'm going to go ahead and do
08:01 - two seconds and then I'm going to
08:03 - destroy the star let's see if this works
08:08 - so I'm going to play my game
08:10 - I click and I shoot throwing stars in
08:14 - the angle that I collect now I can spam
08:16 - and shoot a ton of them before I kind of
08:20 - run out of ram but
08:22 - we can add a cooldown if you wanted
08:24 - maybe that's a pro video if you'd like
08:26 - to see how to add a cooldown so you
08:27 - can't just Spam and shoot a million
08:29 - times we can absolutely do that but for
08:31 - now shooting is working and it's looking
08:33 - awesome I'm super excited this game is
08:35 - really taking shape it's starting to
08:37 - become a real game

bounce off solids so anytime it hits an edge or it hits a wall or hits something like that it'll actually bounce off this can actually be turned on and off in your event sheet to give your bullets kind of power ups same with the speed you could actually make them fire faster and move faster depending on certain things they collect in the scene so for me I'm going to leave this off because I don't want it to bounce off yet but later down the road I might give the player the ability to unlock the ability for this to to bounce off all right so we have everything in our scene let's go ahead
