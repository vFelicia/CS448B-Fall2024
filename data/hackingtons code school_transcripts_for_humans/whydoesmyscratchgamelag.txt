00:00 - why does my game lag what is my frame
00:02 - rate
00:03 - how fast does scratch run why is my game
00:05 - so laggy
00:06 - first off we need to figure out how fast
00:08 - scratch actually
00:10 - runs what do you mean well depending on
00:12 - your computer and how powerful and new
00:14 - and fancy it is
00:16 - it might run faster than another
00:18 - person's computer
00:19 - so i'm going to test that by setting up
00:21 - a tick rate
00:22 - meter first you need to understand that
00:24 - scratch has a block
00:26 - called timer and it's kind of like a
00:28 - pre-made variable it just keeps track of
00:30 - the time
00:30 - since the game started from when you
00:32 - clicked the green flag
00:34 - and you don't actually have to use the
00:36 - reset timer because
00:38 - the timer will always reset when you
00:40 - click the green flag
00:41 - this is a great way to use to see how
00:43 - many processes or
00:44 - ticks the computer is actually doing in
00:47 - one second so i'll set it up so that
00:49 - there's a variable called tick rate and
00:50 - i'll set it to zero
00:52 - then forever as long as the timer
00:55 - is less than one and that's one second
00:58 - we'll
00:58 - increase the tick rate by one so we'll
01:01 - see
01:01 - how fast the computer will will
01:05 - increase that tick rate in less than a
01:07 - second here we go i've clicked the green
01:08 - flag
01:09 - and even though the timer keeps going
01:11 - the tick rate stops and this time it
01:13 - stopped at
01:14 - 101 296
01:17 - that's how many times it increased this
01:20 - variable
01:21 - wow that's pretty fast can you believe
01:23 - that now i'm running it again and it's a
01:25 - little
01:26 - bit different why because the computer
01:28 - cpu is
01:29 - always doing something and who knows
01:31 - what it's doing in the background right
01:33 - now
01:33 - maybe it's playing a youtube video and i
01:36 - didn't realize i left it on
01:37 - so it's going to be interesting for all
01:39 - of you out there in the world
01:40 - so you could try out my tick rate meter
01:42 - and see how fast your computer is
01:44 - does this mean my computer is running a
01:46 - hundred thousand frames per second
01:48 - no typically your browser is running
01:50 - either 30 frames per second or
01:52 - 60 frames now i know when you're running
01:54 - gaming computers sometimes you have 120
01:56 - frames per second
01:57 - but that's not on a web browser like we
02:00 - are right now on chrome so i went ahead
02:02 - and followed a tutorial
02:04 - on youtube on how to check your frame
02:06 - rates
02:07 - on scratch and it came up with this and
02:09 - it when i run it it says
02:11 - that i'm getting around 125 frames per
02:15 - second
02:16 - well how is that possible it's probably
02:18 - not very accurate because
02:20 - nothing else is happening in this game
02:22 - watch what happens
02:23 - when i actually add some code to the cat
02:27 - something simple like a forever loop
02:29 - that makes him
02:30 - spin there when i add this and i press
02:34 - the start flag
02:35 - suddenly the frame rates drop to 30
02:38 - and my tick rate is 30 as well
02:41 - what just happened i lost 900 000 ticks
02:45 - per second
02:46 - no okay this is what's happening
02:50 - the scratch team actually made the
02:52 - decision
02:53 - to slow down coding blocks like the turn
02:56 - or the move blocks
02:58 - in order to allow your eyes to actually
03:01 - see the action what do you mean well if
03:04 - this cat was
03:05 - spinning a hundred thousand times per
03:09 - second
03:10 - that would be a big problem you wouldn't
03:13 - be able to see it
03:14 - your game would feel awful so why did
03:16 - they choose
03:17 - 30 frames per second i'm guessing that
03:20 - that's
03:20 - the standard by which most computers can
03:24 - handle it
03:24 - now i don't know all the answers about
03:26 - why your game lags
03:27 - and some of you who build these
03:29 - incredible games
03:30 - with hundreds of forever loops are
03:33 - experiencing
03:34 - lag lag lag perhaps you can refactor
03:38 - your code
03:39 - and use things like custom blocks where
03:41 - you can make a block
03:43 - and allow it to run without a screen
03:45 - refresh
03:46 - so tell me in the comments have you ever
03:47 - experienced lag in your games
03:50 - go ahead and post those games and don't

why does my game lag what is my frame rate how fast does scratch run why is my game so laggy first off we need to figure out how fast scratch actually runs what do you mean well depending on your computer and how powerful and new and fancy it is it might run faster than another person's computer so i'm going to test that by setting up a tick rate meter first you need to understand that scratch has a block called timer and it's kind of like a premade variable it just keeps track of the time since the game started from when you clicked the green flag and you don't actually have to use the reset timer because the timer will always reset when you click the green flag this is a great way to use to see how many processes or ticks the computer is actually doing in one second so i'll set it up so that there's a variable called tick rate and i'll set it to zero then forever as long as the timer is less than one and that's one second we'll increase the tick rate by one so we'll see how fast the computer will will increase that tick rate in less than a second here we go i've clicked the green flag and even though the timer keeps going the tick rate stops and this time it stopped at 101 296 that's how many times it increased this variable wow that's pretty fast can you believe that now i'm running it again and it's a little bit different why because the computer cpu is always doing something and who knows what it's doing in the background right now maybe it's playing a youtube video and i didn't realize i left it on so it's going to be interesting for all of you out there in the world so you could try out my tick rate meter and see how fast your computer is does this mean my computer is running a hundred thousand frames per second no typically your browser is running either 30 frames per second or 60 frames now i know when you're running gaming computers sometimes you have 120 frames per second but that's not on a web browser like we are right now on chrome so i went ahead and followed a tutorial on youtube on how to check your frame rates on scratch and it came up with this and it when i run it it says that i'm getting around 125 frames per second well how is that possible it's probably not very accurate because nothing else is happening in this game watch what happens when i actually add some code to the cat something simple like a forever loop that makes him spin there when i add this and i press the start flag suddenly the frame rates drop to 30 and my tick rate is 30 as well what just happened i lost 900 000 ticks per second no okay this is what's happening the scratch team actually made the decision to slow down coding blocks like the turn or the move blocks in order to allow your eyes to actually see the action what do you mean well if this cat was spinning a hundred thousand times per second that would be a big problem you wouldn't be able to see it your game would feel awful so why did they choose 30 frames per second i'm guessing that that's the standard by which most computers can handle it now i don't know all the answers about why your game lags and some of you who build these incredible games with hundreds of forever loops are experiencing lag lag lag perhaps you can refactor your code and use things like custom blocks where you can make a block and allow it to run without a screen refresh so tell me in the comments have you ever experienced lag in your games go ahead and post those games and don't forget to hit subscribe and like the video
