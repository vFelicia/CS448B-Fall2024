00:00 - hey scratchers let's build flappy bird
00:02 - but don't call a flappy bird we might
00:03 - get sued let's say flappy bat cool we're
00:06 - cool with that so get rid of the scratch
00:08 - cat yes boom gone was there an explosion
00:11 - no now what we want to do is create a
00:13 - sprite and we're gonna be drawing that
00:16 - sprite that's gonna be those tubes that
00:18 - move across the screen which they're
00:20 - probably sued by Mario Brothers for or
00:22 - Nintendo okay and we're drawing the
00:24 - sprite grab the the square I don't know
00:26 - is it a square and we're gonna draw it
00:29 - it's a tube yeah is it dark enough
00:32 - probably like an outline would look good
00:34 - I don't know dark outline something
00:37 - there there's a tube let's draw the
00:40 - bottom of the tube now it doesn't look
00:42 - real fancy that's because you haven't
00:45 - shadowed it with a gradient or gradient
00:48 - with the I can't speak today go
00:50 - ahead and grab that bucket click on fill
00:52 - click on gradient then come over here
00:54 - and then you can adjust the gradient so
00:56 - it looks really cool oh but there's only
00:58 - one top tube why okay watch this copy
01:02 - copy and paste yes paste it and now you
01:06 - have two of them two of them that are
01:07 - exactly the same just flip it upside
01:09 - down I knew I'm doing a lot of stuff
01:11 - really quickly but I'm sure it's not
01:13 - that hard there's no room for that bird
01:15 - to get between there or bat or whatever
01:17 - it is so just go ahead and control how
01:20 - tall it is by changing that now it's
01:24 - pretty cool when you make multiple
01:25 - costumes so it's kind of one is hard one
01:28 - is easy
01:29 - whatever just right-click on it
01:31 - duplicate it duplicate it and each one
01:33 - of these go ahead and just adjust it a
01:35 - little bit more like this one's gonna be
01:37 - all the way at the top there you go and
01:40 - then this one's gonna be weight this
01:42 - one's here this one's here and this one
01:45 - is there looks pretty good to me let's
01:46 - go ahead and add the code and the first
01:49 - piece of code is going to be an event
01:50 - like you'll always do with a green flag
01:53 - there goes when the game starts we want
01:55 - this sprite to go to well right here
01:58 - right in the far right corner so let's
02:00 - put that sprite there that will save us
02:02 - some time when we go to the motions menu
02:04 - because then it will all be set up for
02:08 - us look at the go to position is already
02:09 - there exactly where we want it to be
02:12 - and now all we need to do is have it
02:14 - glide to the other side but let's
02:17 - manually move it to the other side put
02:19 - it where we want it to finish we want it
02:21 - to finish right there so now this glide
02:25 - is already set up with the correct
02:27 - numbers push the green flag
02:30 - oh it's impossibly fast so let's slow it
02:33 - down to what three seconds that looks
02:35 - good
02:35 - ah looks like flappy bird now each time
02:39 - it goes past we want it to switch
02:41 - costumes so go ahead and go looks and
02:43 - then do next costume and then wrap it
02:47 - all up with a bow and a forever loop
02:49 - because we want this pattern to repeat
02:51 - here it goes oh you got harder that was
02:57 - a little awkward looking hey works
02:59 - pretty well okay so now let's add our
03:02 - little fluffy bat it's going to be a
03:05 - sprite right so let's click on sprite
03:08 - Mitch you want to draw your own I'm not
03:09 - very good at drawing bats there's a bat
03:11 - woof let's just search for bats and
03:13 - let's see what our options are there's a
03:16 - that's that's a batter okay so here's
03:20 - the flappy bat and he's probably the
03:22 - wrong size so come on down into size and
03:24 - let's go for let's go for six hundred
03:27 - percent that's not gonna work
03:29 - still a little bit big let's go with
03:31 - fifty percent now we need to add the
03:34 - flapping motion of the bat and first of
03:38 - all we need to talk about what exactly
03:40 - will the bat be doing he will be falling
03:43 - and then you'll press the spacebar and
03:45 - he will flap flapping and falling just
03:49 - like a real bat does so let's go ahead
03:51 - and we'll start with a start flag and
03:54 - say okay where does he start let's have
03:56 - him start right here that way he'll have
03:59 - a chance to fall okay so we use the
04:00 - go-to and then we will go in the control
04:03 - menu and give will add some gravity to
04:07 - the game we'll say forever fall now the
04:09 - the Y position controls the up and down
04:13 - axis so if we say the Y is decreasing
04:16 - he'll go down and the Y increases he'll
04:18 - go up and I'll show you that right now
04:21 - inside the motion look for change
04:25 - here it is so if we change wife forever
04:27 - up he goes up if we change it forever
04:30 - negative ten
04:31 - he goes down let's see how fast that
04:34 - fall is that's a pretty fast fall I
04:37 - think for flappy bat my game it's gonna
04:39 - be a negative five fall that's pretty
04:42 - good point those tubes are really moving
04:45 - now
04:46 - to kind of counteract that gravity
04:48 - that's pulling him down I'm needing him
04:50 - to flap and flap hi he will so let's go
04:53 - ahead and add an event and let's say
04:56 - when the spacebar is pressed that he
04:59 - won't move up now I'll show you kind of
05:02 - the bad way and the good way to do this
05:04 - why am i showing you the bad way because
05:05 - it's easy watch this change Y by 10 this
05:08 - should just kind of counteract what I
05:11 - have right here not very well though
05:13 - because this is this forever loop is
05:15 - just fighting me it's too much to fight
05:18 - so let's go ahead and go inside of here
05:20 - and let's use a repeat block
05:23 - I love repeat blocks for jumping because
05:25 - it's gonna repeat ten times change by
05:28 - ten repeat blocks create a really smooth
05:31 - movement because instead of just doing
05:33 - the whole movement at once it's kind of
05:34 - repeat ten repeat ten repeat ten okay
05:38 - here we go let's see what it looks like
05:39 - now oh that looks a lot better we just
05:42 - it doesn't have the flappy motion we
05:44 - need the flappy motion so let's go look
05:47 - in the looks menu for the costumes and
05:50 - let's talk about what costume well what
05:53 - costumes do you have that you have you
05:55 - have a couple different ones oh I like
05:58 - that so I want it I want him when I
06:01 - press the spacebar to him to do bat a
06:04 - and then bat B that's pretty cool I like
06:08 - that okay so press the space bar switch
06:11 - costume to bat a and then after he let's
06:19 - see if this works
06:19 - to bat B let's check dot o it's reverse
06:24 - of what I wanted oh my goodness so let's
06:28 - say I want bat a and then there goes bat
06:32 - be there that's pretty nice I don't know
06:38 - why he's flying
06:39 - sideways but I love it now if he touches
06:41 - the the pipes which why are they there I
06:45 - don't know if he touches those pipes we
06:47 - want it to be kind of a game over
06:49 - situation so let's use a wait until
06:52 - block go into control and there is a
06:55 - wait until block so we're gonna say wait
06:57 - until touching those green blocks where
07:00 - pipes I keep saying blocks but they're
07:03 - pipes so let's go into sensing and
07:07 - touching now do I have to worry about
07:11 - what color let's just shrink the screen
07:12 - real quick what color these pipes are
07:15 - yes but actually they're a sprite
07:18 - they're called sprite one so I can
07:21 - actually sense those sprites here he
07:24 - goes
07:24 - so wait until touching sprite one and
07:27 - then and the game let's let's end the
07:31 - game the really super cheesy fast way
07:33 - because I'm trying to make this video
07:33 - fast let's just go into control and at
07:36 - the bottom just do stop all that's so
07:39 - cheesy I know so when are we going to
07:42 - actually use this code I don't like this
07:45 - type of code just sitting somewhere
07:47 - waiting to be discovered I want it to be
07:50 - at the top where I can see it easy and
07:52 - I'm gonna connect it to a starting flag
07:54 - there it is this game should work now
07:56 - let's play it alright everybody
07:58 - I'm oh is he
08:02 - we have a problem this tube is touching
08:06 - the bat and therefore it is not starting
08:08 - the game so let's go back to these tubes
08:10 - and make sure that they move to the
08:13 - starts to the starting position so let's
08:16 - move them all the way over here once
08:18 - again and go to motion and say go to
08:22 - this position when we start there no we
08:26 - can play this game ah it's so hard
08:29 - who made this get I'm gonna like rage
08:33 - quit right now yes yes

hey scratchers let's build flappy bird but don't call a flappy bird we might get sued let's say flappy bat cool we're cool with that so get rid of the scratch cat yes boom gone was there an explosion no now what we want to do is create a sprite and we're gonna be drawing that sprite that's gonna be those tubes that move across the screen which they're probably sued by Mario Brothers for or Nintendo okay and we're drawing the sprite grab the the square I don't know is it a square and we're gonna draw it it's a tube yeah is it dark enough probably like an outline would look good I don't know dark outline something there there's a tube let's draw the bottom of the tube now it doesn't look real fancy that's because you haven't shadowed it with a gradient or gradient with the I can't speak today go ahead and grab that bucket click on fill click on gradient then come over here and then you can adjust the gradient so it looks really cool oh but there's only one top tube why okay watch this copy copy and paste yes paste it and now you have two of them two of them that are exactly the same just flip it upside down I knew I'm doing a lot of stuff really quickly but I'm sure it's not that hard there's no room for that bird to get between there or bat or whatever it is so just go ahead and control how tall it is by changing that now it's pretty cool when you make multiple costumes so it's kind of one is hard one is easy whatever just rightclick on it duplicate it duplicate it and each one of these go ahead and just adjust it a little bit more like this one's gonna be all the way at the top there you go and then this one's gonna be weight this one's here this one's here and this one is there looks pretty good to me let's go ahead and add the code and the first piece of code is going to be an event like you'll always do with a green flag there goes when the game starts we want this sprite to go to well right here right in the far right corner so let's put

to switch costumes so go ahead and go looks and then do next costume and then wrap it all up with a bow and a forever loop because we want this pattern to repeat here it goes oh you got harder that was a little awkward looking hey works pretty well okay so now let's add our little fluffy bat it's going to be a sprite right so let's click on sprite Mitch you want to draw your own I'm not very good at drawing bats there's a bat woof let's just search for bats and let's see what our options are there's a that's that's a batter okay so here's the flappy bat and he's probably the wrong size so come on down into size and let's go for let's go for six hundred percent that's not gonna work still a little bit big let's go with fifty percent now we need to add the flapping motion of the bat and

menu and give will add some gravity to the game we'll say forever fall now the the Y position controls the up and down axis so if we say the Y is decreasing he'll go down and the Y increases he'll go up and I'll show you that right now inside the motion look for change here it is so if we change wife forever up he goes up if we change it forever negative ten he goes down let's see how fast that fall is that's a pretty fast fall I think for flappy bat my game it's gonna be a negative five fall that's pretty good point those tubes are really moving now to kind of counteract that gravity that's pulling him down I'm needing him to flap and flap hi he will so let's go ahead and add an event and let's say when the spacebar is pressed that he won't move up now I'll show you kind of the bad way and the good way to do this why am i showing you the bad way because it's easy watch this change Y by 10 this should just kind of counteract what I have right here not very well though because this is this forever loop is just fighting me it's too much to fight so let's go ahead and go inside of here and let's use a repeat block I love repeat blocks for jumping because it's gonna repeat ten times change by ten repeat blocks create a really smooth movement because instead of just doing the whole movement at once it's kind of repeat ten repeat ten repeat ten okay here we go let's see what it looks like now oh that looks a lot better we just it doesn't have the flappy motion we need the flappy motion so let's go look in the looks menu for the costumes and let's talk about what costume well what costumes do you have that you have you have a couple different ones oh I like that so I want it I want him when I press the spacebar to him to do bat a and then bat B that's pretty cool I like that okay so press the space bar switch costume to bat a and then after he let's see if this works to bat B let's check dot o it's reverse of what I wanted oh my goodness so let's say I want bat a and then there goes bat be there that's pretty nice I don't know why he's flying sideways but I love it now if he touches the the pipes which why are they there I don't know if he touches those pipes we want it to be kind of a game over situation so let's use a wait until block go into control and there is a wait until block so we're gonna say wait until touching those green blocks where pipes I keep
