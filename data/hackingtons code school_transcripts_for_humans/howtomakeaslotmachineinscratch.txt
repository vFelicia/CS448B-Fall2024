00:00 - hey everyone I'm teacher Matt and I'm so
00:02 - excited to be teaching you how to build
00:04 - a slot machine using scratch hold on
00:07 - hold on letter from teacher Michael
00:10 - dear teacher Matt you need to stop right
00:12 - now teaching kids to build Vegas style
00:15 - slot machines is unethical immoral and
00:18 - possibly illegal if you don't stop I
00:21 - will quit love teacher Michael
00:24 - P.S I'm in a little trouble at the horse
00:26 - races can I have an advance on my salary
00:29 - all right let's build our slot machine I
00:32 - already deleted the scratch cat I went
00:34 - to the stage and I went ahead and Drew
00:37 - three different boxes and I just used
00:40 - the copy and paste feature to make them
00:42 - look exactly correct next I'm going to
00:45 - add a Sprite and I'll choose from the
00:47 - Sprite collection I'm going to have a
00:49 - theme of fruit you can choose a
00:52 - different theme if you'd like there
00:53 - that's a banana it's going to go right
00:55 - there in position one now I'm going to
00:57 - add some costumes because sometimes it
00:59 - will show banana sometimes maybe it will
01:01 - show an apple and then other times maybe
01:05 - it will show I don't know we need some
01:07 - more fruit here oh there you go
01:08 - watermelon all right you have to have at
01:11 - least three different items otherwise
01:13 - it's not very fun okay so everything is
01:15 - looking pretty good let's only code one
01:18 - Sprite at a time and then we'll
01:19 - duplicate it for the other slots now
01:22 - let's call this first window while well
01:24 - it's kind of a window let's call it one
01:26 - window two and window three so for this
01:29 - Sprite let's rename it to window one
01:32 - they're not actually windows but they
01:34 - kind of look like them and let's go and
01:36 - code this and the first thing I want you
01:38 - to focus on is the looks and actually
01:41 - changing the costume so you want to see
01:43 - switch costume and you'll notice that
01:45 - the costumes have names but also sprach
01:49 - thinks about costumes as numbers so you
01:52 - can see these little numbers right here
01:53 - one two and three so if you use
01:55 - something like a random number maker
01:57 - right here pick random number you can
02:00 - actually slot it in there and since
02:01 - there's three costumes you could do one
02:05 - to three and as I click on this it will
02:07 - randomly
02:08 - switch between costumes that's going to
02:11 - be really helpful for building our game
02:13 - now let's add the functionality that
02:15 - makes the costumes change a random
02:17 - amount of times because in this case we
02:19 - click on it every time we want it to do
02:21 - it many times so let's use a repeat
02:23 - block so go into control grab the repeat
02:26 - 10 that will make it obviously repeat 10
02:29 - times which will be a little bit
02:31 - predictable so what we can do is go to
02:33 - the operators and yes you guessed it do
02:36 - a pick random there we go so our first
02:38 - window is now totally randomized it's a
02:41 - little bit I don't know it's kind of
02:43 - flickering so let's grab a control block
02:45 - called the weight block and maybe add
02:48 - just a little bit of wait time in there
02:51 - so that it doesn't feel so rushed there
02:54 - that sounds good can you imagine that
02:56 - the sound of that machine ding ding ding
02:58 - ding ding ding I'm gonna win I'm gonna
03:00 - win now we have a game Loop here this
03:02 - repeat block that's repeating it and now
03:04 - we know okay the final costume is an
03:07 - apple we need to remember that
03:10 - information because we want the game to
03:12 - win if you get an apple and apple and an
03:14 - apple so we'll hold that Apple costume
03:17 - that information in a variable so create
03:21 - a variable and it'll be for all Sprites
03:23 - and we'll call this one window one
03:26 - costume or final costume or some way to
03:29 - remember what it's going to be and that
03:32 - after this Loop is done we'll set the
03:35 - window one costume to a number well wait
03:39 - a minute well what number do we set it
03:41 - to well there's actually a handy
03:43 - pre-made variable in the looks menu just
03:45 - scroll down to the bottom and you'll see
03:48 - costume number wow a variable already
03:51 - made so if we just put it there then go
03:53 - ahead and run that code or actually have
03:55 - to click on this code to run it and
03:57 - you'll see that the final costume number
04:00 - will equal well apple and that's number
04:02 - two let's check to make sure it's
04:03 - correct yep costume number two now
04:06 - before we duplicate this Sprite let's go
04:08 - and clean up the code a little bit well
04:10 - first of all we don't have any events
04:12 - you always need to have a starting event
04:14 - we don't want this to happen as soon as
04:16 - you start the game that's not fun we
04:18 - actually want to have our own little
04:20 - message so when I receive message one no
04:24 - how about like start game or play a game
04:26 - or some way let's make a new message I'm
04:28 - going to say play a game there now I
04:32 - know that this won't start till I send
04:33 - that message and what are we going to do
04:36 - in the beginning are we going to show
04:37 - this Sprite you know all the stuff that
04:39 - you do when you're building a game do I
04:41 - want it to show do I want it to be in
04:43 - that position yeah I don't want anybody
04:45 - to move that so let's force it to go to
04:48 - that position there and now let's see if
04:50 - that works and now if I receive play
04:52 - game it will run I think I'm ready to
04:55 - duplicate the Sprite so I'll just hover
04:57 - over it right click duplicate and I'll
05:00 - do it three times hey look at that it
05:03 - actually changed the names for me window
05:06 - one window two window three how handy is
05:09 - that now we do need to do a little bit
05:11 - of cleanup for example window 2 right
05:14 - here will need to change its position so
05:17 - let's go ahead and switch this code
05:19 - block for where it is right now let's
05:21 - see if that works yep that works and
05:24 - let's go do it for this one as well so
05:26 - this is just a little bit of cleanup
05:28 - because you were duplicating something
05:30 - that needed changed now the other thing
05:33 - you'll notice is right here we only have
05:36 - one variable called window one costume
05:39 - so we'll need to make two more variables
05:41 - and there'll be window 2 costume costume
05:48 - and this one will set window to costume
05:51 - to costume number and then this one will
05:54 - be called window three
05:57 - obviously costume and that's the final
06:00 - costume and let's set this
06:03 - all right there so now we have three
06:06 - variables that you see up here at the
06:08 - top and they will when you broadcast
06:10 - let's go ahead and broadcast that
06:12 - message just manually so come in here
06:14 - and let's broadcast play game so I click
06:18 - on that and that should reset all of
06:20 - these numbers now all we have to do is
06:23 - compare the window one window to window
06:25 - three to see if they're the same number
06:27 - if they are you win now we were just
06:29 - using this broadcast button right here
06:31 - just for an example I'm going to throw
06:33 - it away and I'm going to paint a new
06:35 - Sprite or actually I'm going to go grab
06:37 - one of these buttons right here they
06:39 - look really nice and that's going to be
06:41 - used to start this game so let's go
06:44 - ahead and go to the costumes and let's
06:47 - say something like play or whatever you
06:49 - want to call it mine's the play button
06:52 - there now this play button even though
06:54 - it just looks like a simple little
06:56 - button it's gonna have a lot of code on
06:58 - it because it's going to determine the
07:00 - winner so let's go to the code and
07:02 - remember we need to broadcast this
07:04 - message Play game but there's a problem
07:08 - this message play game is actually going
07:12 - to trigger the code right here and the
07:15 - code right here and the code right here
07:16 - that's a lot of code and we actually
07:18 - have to wait until these variables are
07:21 - set before we can determine a winner so
07:25 - if this play button right here happens
07:27 - really fast uh you won't know the winner
07:31 - we need to wait did you hear that wait
07:33 - yes so anytime you want to wait until
07:36 - everything is done use the broadcast
07:38 - play game and wait this is the preferred
07:41 - method so let's see oh I just clicked on
07:43 - it and it and it I just won wow that's
07:47 - pretty cool so the basic idea is this
07:50 - button when it's clicked so go to events
07:53 - when the Sprite is clicked it will
07:55 - broadcast play game and it will wait
07:58 - now since we want to wait until that
08:01 - play game message is done running we
08:04 - probably want to hide this button so
08:06 - someone can't spam click it so I'll just
08:09 - go to looks I'll go to hide and so as
08:12 - soon as you click that button it will
08:14 - hide it and then it will show it after
08:18 - this play game and weight code has run
08:20 - so let's see if that works it disappears
08:23 - and then it reappears after all of the
08:26 - variables have been set now is the fun
08:28 - part we need to figure out if you won or
08:30 - lost well what did we win or lose what
08:34 - do you well what are you betting are you
08:36 - betting money let's create a new
08:38 - variable called money or cash or points
08:42 - or health or whatever you want to call
08:44 - it now we have that variable so you know
08:46 - how much money you have so when you win
08:50 - the money will go up when you lose the
08:52 - money will go down and if you're in
08:55 - Vegas obviously the money tends to go
08:57 - down well in my case we're going to use
09:00 - a new type of block to determine how
09:02 - much money you have that's called a my
09:05 - block here it is we'll have to create
09:07 - this block so make a block and then
09:09 - let's call this one calculate money or
09:12 - determine money or add money or whatever
09:14 - you want to call it I'm just going to
09:15 - call it the money block and I'm going to
09:18 - run this without screen refresh the
09:20 - reason why is I want this code to run as
09:22 - fast as possible because it's just
09:25 - calculating money I'll click OK there
09:28 - now it says Define money and then you'll
09:31 - notice I have this block over here what
09:34 - this block right here will do is it will
09:37 - fire or run this code right here it's
09:40 - kind of like a message block but a
09:42 - little fancier so I'm going to put the
09:44 - money right here
09:45 - there so this money block is going to do
09:48 - whatever is defined as money and I'm
09:50 - going to do a whole bunch of comparisons
09:52 - so I'll go to The Operators and I'm
09:55 - going to use these greater than equal
09:57 - then yeah actually I want to use the
09:59 - equal to and I'll need a couple of those
10:02 - because what I want to know is if these
10:05 - variables these window one costumes are
10:08 - equal so I want to say is window one
10:11 - equal to window two
10:14 - and then I want another one of these oh
10:16 - how do I do that okay hold on I have to
10:18 - look at that I'm kind of combining them
10:20 - there we go is equal to window three
10:24 - it's getting crazy isn't it all right in
10:27 - order for this to be true when I click
10:30 - on it see it says false right now in
10:32 - order for it to be true each one of
10:34 - these has to be exactly the same costume
10:37 - if all this happens instead of it saying
10:40 - false right there it will say true and
10:43 - then you want your money to go up so we
10:47 - can say change money
10:49 - by one wow that's all you win is one I
10:52 - feel like you should win more money if
10:55 - all of these are true so I'm gonna need
10:56 - an if statement to put this in here so
10:59 - let's go to control and we'll say if and
11:02 - then put this giant conditional in there
11:05 - and let's say Define money but here we
11:08 - go
11:09 - now do I need to put a forever loop
11:12 - around this no why not because I only
11:16 - want this money function what I'm going
11:19 - to call it a function when when you ever
11:21 - you have a whole bunch of code that's
11:23 - defined and this will all run together
11:25 - we call that a function so this money
11:27 - function
11:29 - is going to run and I don't need a
11:31 - forever Loop because I only want it to
11:32 - run one time there and it will change my
11:36 - money by 100 if they are all the same
11:38 - now this is kind of the jackpot
11:41 - situation right if all of them are the
11:43 - same thing then you win the big money
11:46 - also this is a great place right here to
11:48 - put a message like you know play some
11:50 - music a flash a big message and I'm not
11:53 - gonna do that because you should have
11:55 - the skills to do that right now but we
11:57 - can put that broadcast right here like
12:00 - let's make a new message and that one's
12:02 - called big winner
12:05 - and obviously you can code that yourself
12:08 - but what happens if two of these are the
12:12 - same or actually what happens if they're
12:15 - all different you know you want to keep
12:17 - there you go two of them are the same
12:18 - don't you want to give them a prize for
12:20 - that as well wouldn't that make them
12:22 - feel good well you can instead of using
12:25 - this if block we're going to use an if
12:28 - else well why do you need an if else
12:30 - can't you just use two if blocks well
12:33 - yeah let me show you what happens if we
12:35 - did this let me just duplicate this code
12:37 - here and we said something like uh let's
12:41 - do something a little more easier I'm
12:43 - just watch this can you watch follow
12:46 - along as I move things around here if
12:49 - costume one and costume two are equal
12:53 - then you could change the money I'm just
12:56 - gonna move this around here you could
12:59 - change the money by 10. let's say you
13:01 - get like a little prize
13:03 - well what's gonna happen here is all of
13:06 - this code is going to run so if they're
13:08 - all the same you win plus you also get
13:12 - an extra ten dollars because the first
13:15 - one and the second one
13:16 - do you see what I mean so instead of
13:18 - winning a hundred dollars in this case
13:20 - you would win 110 and that's messed up
13:22 - we don't want to make bugs in our code
13:25 - like that so instead of putting this if
13:27 - by itself we're going to use an if else
13:32 - block
13:33 - all right so let me show you how we're
13:34 - going to do that first of all we're
13:37 - going to I'm going to have to just move
13:38 - things around here we're going to
13:41 - transfer this information into the if
13:44 - else block right here just like that and
13:47 - I'm going to throw away this if block
13:50 - there we go so now if you have a big
13:54 - winner great it's going to change your
13:57 - money whatever but if it's not a big
14:01 - winner you have kind of this else block
14:03 - this second chance and in that second
14:06 - chance you can actually pile up a whole
14:09 - bunch of if statements we can say well
14:13 - if one is equal to that or if 2 is equal
14:15 - to well two equals two that's silly 2
14:18 - equals three you can kind of keep adding
14:21 - different options that will give you
14:24 - different amounts of money
14:26 - and you can add your own little
14:28 - broadcast for each one of those so let's
14:30 - go into events and let's say like this
14:33 - one isn't going to be a big winner this
14:35 - is going to be like a little winner or
14:38 - uh I'm gonna call this one match two
14:40 - because you match two of them and this
14:42 - will be the exact same wait a minute
14:45 - I actually did I repeated myself did
14:49 - they ever teach you that in code school
14:50 - never repeat yourself this window one
14:54 - equals window two
14:56 - that's exactly the same code I'm
14:58 - building right here I don't need all of
15:00 - this code let's just shrink this down
15:03 - for a second and let's use an or block
15:05 - so go to operators and let's say or so
15:09 - we can say if window one equals window
15:12 - two
15:13 - or duplicate that or window 2 equals
15:18 - window three boy I just saved myself a
15:22 - lot of time by doing these or statements
15:25 - a couple questions here how much does
15:27 - this game cost to play because right now
15:31 - it's basically free let's go ahead and
15:34 - on this button because oh I just deleted
15:37 - oh no I just deleted go to edit restore
15:40 - Sprite thank goodness it has that
15:42 - feature we forgot to set up the game
15:45 - what do you mean setup well when the
15:47 - game starts we need to give them some
15:49 - money otherwise you have no money to
15:52 - play with right so let's say when the
15:53 - game starts we'll set our money I don't
15:56 - know let's give them 100 to start with
15:57 - now that you have some money how much is
16:00 - it gonna cost each time you play you'll
16:02 - want to reduce that money so we'll
16:05 - change money by how much is it going to
16:08 - cost one dollar to play five dollars to
16:10 - play I don't know mine's gonna cost one
16:12 - dollar mine's pretty pretty pretty cheap
16:13 - game so we'll say when I click this
16:16 - Sprite we'll change the money by one
16:18 - there it is now I'm down I'm losing okay
16:22 - we have so many variables in here let's
16:24 - clean it up a little bit just so that
16:26 - the users don't see that information so
16:28 - I'm just going to go to the variable
16:29 - menu and hide this now this money one is
16:32 - sort of important I could put it right
16:34 - there I could also do a large readout
16:37 - and then just add a Sprite that explains
16:40 - that this is your money that would be
16:42 - pretty cool for right now I'll just
16:44 - leave it like this and this is the time
16:46 - where your creativity is really going to
16:48 - help this game it's sort of boring
16:51 - looking and that doesn't make people
16:52 - want to spend money you want to make it
16:54 - exciting the other thing or pet peeve I
16:57 - have is well when you play this game
16:59 - they all kind of randomly flash we
17:01 - really want the first one to be
17:05 - determined before the second and the
17:07 - third one so I'm going to go into the
17:08 - code for the first one see where it says
17:10 - pick random one to ten that's good for
17:14 - the second one let's do pick random 10
17:17 - to 20.
17:20 - and then for the third one let's do 30
17:24 - to 40. now this little adjustment should
17:27 - make it so that the first one ends first
17:31 - and then the second one and then the
17:33 - third and that feels a lot more
17:35 - professional oh this one it's still
17:38 - going and if you've ever seen Vegas or
17:42 - walked by a casino all those noises that
17:44 - you hear that music The Sounds those are
17:47 - all designed to get you excited about
17:49 - playing so don't forget to add those
17:51 - sounds and one thing I really like to
17:54 - add is when the button is clicked
17:56 - there'll be some sort of you know
17:59 - excitement music so let's go to sounds
18:01 - and let's choose something that like an
18:03 - effect or a loop or okay dance energy
18:07 - that one's kind of interesting let's see
18:09 - how that one sounds so let's go to sound
18:12 - and then let's play sound when this
18:17 - button is clicked let's see how that
18:19 - feels
18:21 - and in this case that sound is too long
18:24 - I don't want it to keep going even after
18:26 - I've lost so there's this cool stop all
18:30 - sounds and we'll put it right here right
18:32 - after we've broadcasted play game and
18:35 - wait we'll stop it right there
18:37 - and now the fun starts I need to really
18:40 - entice players to click that play button
18:43 - so I'm going to do some of my own coding
18:45 - you can do your own and let's see how
18:47 - exciting we can make this okay so I've
18:49 - added some final touches check this out
18:51 - when I click the play button it has a
18:53 - little one-arm Bandit handle that comes
18:56 - down good luck flashes and then if I win
18:59 - it will flash a U1 message right here
19:03 - you won so let me show you how I did
19:05 - that first of all the little handle here
19:07 - these games used to be called one arm
19:09 - Bandits because you'd actually pull the
19:10 - handle what I did is I just drew a
19:13 - little animation here and then I set it
19:16 - up so that when the game starts
19:18 - obviously it's costume one right there
19:20 - and then when I receive play game I just
19:23 - switch through the costumes so it looks
19:25 - like you're pulling the handle I don't
19:27 - know it's just kind of nostalgic for me
19:29 - and then for the messages like the you
19:32 - win so the big winner one this one is
19:36 - actually pretty I don't need the sound
19:37 - pop here this one's actually pretty cool
19:40 - I repeated the sounds of coin with a
19:44 - weight zero seconds that way it makes
19:46 - this sound
19:48 - doesn't that sound satisfying like oh
19:51 - you won and then for the match two which
19:54 - is kind of like the big winner but it's
19:56 - not as much money I just repeated five
19:59 - times
20:00 - so it sounds like ah you still win but
20:02 - not as much so I hope that code kind of
20:05 - inspires you to make this game more
20:08 - appealing because that's really the goal
20:09 - is you want to entice everyone to play
20:12 - your game
20:18 - oh hey Michael oh you like the lesson oh
20:21 - you're not gonna quit
20:22 - no at horse races you bet on the horse
20:25 - that you think is gonna win
20:26 - no you're not buying horses no you can't
20:30 - take the horse home no

hey everyone I'm teacher Matt and I'm so excited to be teaching you how to build a slot machine using scratch hold on hold on letter from teacher Michael dear teacher Matt you need to stop right now teaching kids to build Vegas style slot machines is unethical immoral and possibly illegal if you don't stop I will quit love teacher Michael P.S I'm in a little trouble at the horse races can I have an advance on my salary all right let's build our slot machine I already deleted the scratch cat I went to the stage and I went ahead and Drew three different boxes and I just used the copy and paste feature to make them look exactly correct next I'm going to add a Sprite and I'll choose from the Sprite collection I'm going to have a theme of fruit you can choose a different theme if you'd like there that's a banana it's going to go right there in position one now I'm going to add some costumes because sometimes it will show banana sometimes maybe it will show an apple and then other times maybe it will show I don't know we need some more fruit here oh there you go watermelon all right you have to have at least three different items otherwise it's not very fun okay so everything is looking pretty good let's only code one Sprite at a time and then we'll duplicate it for the other slots now let's call this first window while well it's kind of a window let's call it one window two and window three so for this Sprite let's rename it to window one they're not actually windows but they kind of look like them and let's go and code this and the first thing I want you to focus on is the looks and actually changing the costume so you want to see switch costume and you'll notice that the costumes have names but also sprach thinks about costumes as numbers so you can see these little numbers right here one two and three so if you use something like a random number maker right here pick random number you can actually slot it in there and since there's three costumes you could do one to three and as I click on this it will randomly switch between costumes that's going to be really helpful for building our game now let's add the functionality that makes the costumes change a random amount of times because in this case we click on it every time we want it to do it many times so let's use a repeat block so go into control grab the repeat 10 that will make it obviously repeat 10 times which will be a little bit predictable so what we can do is go to the operators and yes you guessed it do a pick random there we go so our first window is now totally randomized it's a little bit I don't know it's kind of flickering so let's grab a control block called the weight block and maybe add just a little bit of wait time in there so that it doesn't feel so rushed there that sounds good can you imagine that the sound of that machine ding ding ding ding ding ding I'm gonna win I'm gonna win now we have a game Loop here this repeat block that's repeating it and now we know okay the final costume is an apple we need to remember that information because we want the game to win if you get an apple and apple and an apple so we'll hold that Apple costume that information in a variable so create a variable and it'll be for all Sprites and we'll call this one window one costume or final costume or some way to remember what it's going to be and that after this Loop is done we'll set the window one costume to a number well wait a minute well what number do we set it to well there's actually a handy premade variable in the looks menu just scroll down to the bottom and you'll see costume number wow a variable already made so if we just put it there then go ahead and run that code or actually have to click on this code to run it and you'll see that the final costume number will equal well apple and that's number two let's check to make sure it's correct yep costume number two now before we duplicate this Sprite let's go and clean up the code a little bit well first of all we don't have any events you always need to have a starting event we don't want this to happen as soon as you start the game that's not fun we actually want to have our own little message so when I receive message one no how about like start game or play a game or some way let's make a new message I'm going to say play a game there now I know that this won't start till I send that message and what are we going to do in the beginning are we going to show this Sprite you know all the stuff that you do when you're building a game do I want it to show do I want it to be in that position yeah I don't want anybody to move that so let's force it to go to that position there and now let's see if that works and now if I receive play game it will run I think I'm ready to duplicate the Sprite so I'll just hover over it right click duplicate and I'll do it three times hey look at that it actually changed the names for me window one window two window three how handy is that now we do need to do a little bit of cleanup for example window 2 right here will need to change its position so let's go ahead and switch this code block for where it is right now let's see if that works yep that works and let's go do it for this one as well so this is just a little bit of cleanup because you were duplicating something that needed changed now the other thing you'll notice is right here we only have one variable called window one costume so we'll need to make two more variables and there'll be window 2 costume costume and this one will set window to costume to costume number and then this one will be called window three obviously costume and that's the final costume and let's set this all right there so now we have three variables that you see up here at the top and they will when you broadcast let's go ahead and broadcast that message just manually so come in here and let's broadcast play game so I click on that and that should reset all of these numbers now all we have to do is compare the window one window to window three to see if they're the same number if they are you win now we were just using this broadcast button right here just for an example I'm going to throw it away and I'm going to paint a new Sprite or actually I'm going to go grab one of these buttons right here they look really nice and that's going to be used to start this game so let's go ahead and go to the costumes and let's say something like play or whatever you want to call it mine's the play button there now this play button even though it just looks like a simple little button it's gonna have a lot of code on it because it's going to determine the winner so let's go to the code and remember we need to broadcast this message Play game but there's a problem this message play game is actually going to trigger the code right here and the code right here and the code right here that's a lot of code and we actually have to wait until these variables are set before we can determine a winner so if this play button right here happens really fast uh you won't know the winner we need to wait did you hear that wait yes so anytime you want to wait until everything is done use the broadcast play game and wait this is the preferred method so let's see oh I just clicked on it and it and it I just won wow that's pretty cool so the basic idea is this button when it's clicked so go to events when the Sprite is clicked it will broadcast play game and it will wait now since we want to wait until that play game message is done running we probably want to hide this button so someone can't spam click it so I'll just go to looks I'll go to hide and so as soon as you click that button it will hide it and then it will show it after this play game and weight code has run so let's see if that works it disappears and then it reappears after all of the variables have been set now is the fun part we need to figure out if you won or lost well what did we win or lose what do you well what are you betting are you betting money let's create a new variable called money or cash or points or health or whatever you want to call it now we have that variable so you know how much money you have so when you win the money will go up when you lose the money will go down and if you're in Vegas obviously the money tends to go down well in my case we're going to use a new type of block to determine how much money you have that's called a my block here it is we'll have to create this block so make a block and then let's call this one calculate money or determine money or add money or whatever you want to call it I'm just going to call it the money block and I'm going to run this without screen refresh the reason why is I want this code to run as fast as possible because it's just calculating money I'll click OK there now it says Define money and then you'll notice I have this block over here what this block right here will do is it will fire or run this code right here it's kind of like a message block but a little fancier so I'm going to put the money right here there so this money block is going to do whatever is defined as money and I'm going to do a whole bunch of comparisons so I'll go to The Operators and I'm going to use these greater than equal then yeah actually I want to use the equal to and I'll need a couple of those because what I want to know is if these variables these window one costumes are equal so I want to say is window one equal to window two and then I want another one of these oh how do I do that okay hold on I have to look at that I'm kind of combining them there we go is equal to window three it's getting crazy isn't it all right in order for this to be true when I click on it see it says false right now in order for it to be true each one of these has to be exactly the same costume if all this happens instead of it saying false right there it will say true and then you want your money to go up so we can say change money by one wow that's all you win is one I feel like you should win more money if all of these are true so I'm gonna need an if statement to put this in here so let's go to control and we'll say if and then put this giant conditional in there and let's say Define money but here we go now do I need to put a forever loop around this no why not because I only want this money function what I'm going to call it a function when when you ever you have a whole bunch of code that's defined and this will all run together we call that a function so this money function is going to run and I don't need a forever Loop because I only want it to run one time there and it will change my money by 100 if they are all the same now this is kind of the jackpot situation right if all of them are the same thing then you win the big money also this is a great place right here to put a message like you know play some music a flash a big message and I'm not gonna do that because you should have the skills to do that right now but we can put that broadcast right here like let's make a new message and that one's called big winner and obviously you can code that yourself but what happens if two of these are the same or actually what happens if they're all different you know you want to keep there you go two of them are the same don't you want to give them a prize for that as well wouldn't that make them feel good well you can instead of using this if block we're going to use an if else well why do you need an if else can't you just use two if blocks well yeah let me show you what happens if we did this let me just duplicate this code here and we said something like uh let's do something a little more easier I'm just watch this can you watch follow along as I move things around here if costume one and costume two are equal then you could change the money I'm just gonna move this around here you could change the money by 10. let's say you get like a little prize well what's gonna happen here is all of this code is going to run so if they're all the same you win plus you also get an extra ten dollars because the first one and the second one do you see what I mean so instead of winning a hundred dollars in this case you would win 110 and that's messed up we don't want to make bugs in our code like that so instead of putting this if by itself we're going to use an if else block all right so let me show you how we're going to do that first of all we're going to I'm going to have to just move things around here we're going to transfer this information into the if else block right here just like that and I'm going to throw away this if block there we go so now if you have a big winner great it's going to change your money whatever but if it's not a big winner you have kind of this else block this second chance and in that second chance you can actually pile up a whole bunch of if statements we can say well if one is equal to that or if 2 is equal to well two equals two that's silly 2 equals three you can kind of keep adding different options that will give you different amounts of money and you can add your own little broadcast for each one of those so let's go into events and let's say like this one isn't going to be a big winner this is going to be like a little winner or uh I'm gonna call this one match two because you match two of them and this will be the exact same wait a minute I actually did I repeated myself did they ever teach you that in code school never repeat yourself this window one equals window two that's exactly the same code I'm building right here I don't need all of this code let's just shrink this down for a second and let's use an or block so go to operators and let's say or so we can say if window one equals window two or duplicate that or window 2 equals window three boy I just saved myself a lot of time by doing these or statements a couple questions here how much does this game cost to play because right now it's basically free let's go ahead and on this button because oh I just deleted oh no I just deleted go to edit restore Sprite thank goodness it has that feature we forgot to set up the game what do you mean setup well when the game starts we need to give them some money otherwise you have no money to play with right so let's say when the game starts we'll set our money I don't know let's give them 100 to start with now that you have some money how much is it gonna cost each time you play you'll want to reduce that money so we'll change money by how much is it going to cost one dollar to play five dollars to play I don't know mine's gonna cost one dollar mine's pretty pretty pretty cheap game so we'll say when I click this Sprite we'll change the money by one there it is now I'm down I'm losing okay we have so many variables in here let's clean it up a little bit just so that the users don't see that information so I'm just going to go to the variable menu and hide this now this money one is sort of important I could put it right there I could also do a large readout and then just add a Sprite that explains that this is your money that would be pretty cool for right now I'll just leave it like this and this is the time where your creativity is really going to help this game it's sort of boring looking and that doesn't make people want to spend money you want to make it exciting the other thing or pet peeve I have is well when you play this game they all kind of randomly flash we really want the first one to be determined before the second and the third one so I'm going to go into the code for the first one see where it says pick random one to ten that's good for the second one let's do pick random 10 to 20. and then for the third one let's do 30 to 40. now this little adjustment should make it so that the first one ends first and then the second one and then the third and that feels a lot more professional oh this one it's still going and if you've ever seen Vegas or walked by a casino all those noises that you hear that music The Sounds those are all designed to get you excited about playing so don't forget to add those sounds and one thing I really like to add is when the button is clicked there'll be some sort of you know excitement music so let's go to sounds and let's choose something that like an effect or a loop or okay dance energy that one's kind of interesting let's see how that one sounds so let's go to sound and then let's play sound when this button is clicked let's see how that feels and in this case that sound is too long I don't want it to keep going even after I've lost so there's this cool stop all sounds and we'll put it right here right after we've broadcasted play game and wait we'll stop it right there and now the fun starts I need to really entice players to click that play button so I'm going to do some of my own coding you can do your own and let's see how exciting we can make this okay so I've added some final touches check this out when I click the play button it has a little onearm Bandit handle that comes down good luck flashes and then if I win it will flash a U1 message right here you won so let me show you how I did that first of all the little handle here these games used to be called one arm Bandits because you'd actually pull the handle what I did is I just drew a little animation here and then I set it up so that when the game starts obviously it's costume one right there and then when I receive play game I just switch through the costumes so it looks like you're pulling the handle I don't know it's just kind of nostalgic for me and then for the messages like the you win so the big winner one this one is actually pretty I don't need the sound pop here this one's actually pretty cool I repeated the sounds of coin with a weight zero seconds that way it makes this sound doesn't that sound satisfying like oh you won and then for the match two which is kind of like the big winner but it's not as much money I just repeated five times so it sounds like ah you still win but not as much so I hope that code kind of inspires you to make this game more appealing because that's really the goal is you want to entice everyone to play your game oh hey Michael oh you like the lesson oh you're not gonna quit no at horse races you bet on the horse that you think is gonna win no you're not buying horses no you can't take the horse home no
