00:00 - what's up scratchers I'm Matt from
00:02 - hacking tents I'm gonna be showing off
00:04 - some of our student projects so check
00:06 - this out
00:08 - [Music]
00:19 - first up it's Mikhail's game where
00:22 - you're like a cat would have guessed it
00:24 - a cat a scratch cat and you're being
00:26 - chased by this oddly go get get the key
00:31 - get the key go go go go to the door yes
00:35 - okay this is one of the coolest
00:38 - adventure games I've seen okay we've got
00:40 - Ryan m3 with the scratch cat arcade
00:43 - let's go ahead and make it fullscreen
00:44 - and let's check it out now I don't get
00:47 - into gambling at all so I'm gonna go for
00:50 - the 1 to 9 odds totally cool with
00:53 - whether I win or lose come on Christian
00:59 - be one from Vacaville submitted this
01:02 - game guitar destroyer and I'll tell you
01:07 - this I am cool with destroying guitars
01:10 - I'm a guitar player so I know on the
01:13 - stage you got to smash them so let's get
01:16 - to Smashing okay my hands going up this
01:25 - isn't smashing this is beautiful
01:29 - I want to smash them Zack are made this
01:33 - next game and it says this is really
01:37 - hard
01:39 - okay well let's play it and let's see if
01:42 - it really is that hard it looks like the
01:45 - best score is 3.2 I have no idea what it
01:49 - is using the arrow keys oh yeah oh wow
01:59 - I'm pretty good at it but yeah it's too
02:03 - hard and for our final game where I'm
02:06 - gonna help you make it a little bit
02:07 - better
02:08 - it's Daniella D who made this flying
02:10 - dragon flappy bird I'm pressing the
02:12 - spacebar I'm flapping it was game over
02:16 - why let me show you a common little
02:18 - error is in the costume tab for the
02:22 - pipes you can see how they're changing
02:25 - what happened was is the
02:27 - changed before it had moved to the other
02:30 - side of the screen so simple fix go in
02:33 - the code for the pipes click right here
02:36 - it says next costume put that above it
02:40 - so it changes the costume on the far
02:42 - right rather than on the far left
02:45 - pretty easy simple fix right there next
02:47 - the dragon isn't really flapping is he
02:50 - the dragon is just kind of staying still
02:53 - so let's make them flap actually in the
02:55 - real flappy bird flappybird doesn't flap
02:57 - either but let me show you you get three
02:59 - costumes for the dragon but none of them
03:01 - are really animations so let's just
03:03 - choose one I'm gonna choose this one I'm
03:05 - going to delete the other two then I'm
03:08 - going to right click and duplicate this
03:11 - dragon 20 with two of them are three of
03:13 - them I'm just gonna do two of them now
03:15 - dragon B it's in vector mode right now
03:17 - so when I click on it it will actually
03:19 - like show all these points on it and I
03:22 - can move or move it around as a whole
03:25 - there we go
03:25 - but what I want to do is actually just
03:27 - rotate it a little bit so I can create
03:29 - that flapping motion I'll click the
03:31 - other wing I'll rotate it kind of back
03:35 - like that like here actually let's keep
03:38 - rotating it and I'm gonna send it to
03:41 - back send it backwards so let's click on
03:45 - this go backwards did it work
03:48 - there now I have kind of a flappy
03:52 - animation I don't like the best I don't
03:55 - know so let's go and into the code and
03:58 - when we press the spacebar it's
04:01 - repeating doing this and let's have it
04:04 - change the the flap the flap it's in the
04:09 - looks I know it's in the looks it's in
04:11 - the costume so switch costume when you
04:13 - press the space bar switch costume to be
04:16 - and then when it's done flapping switch
04:19 - costume to a well there's no a and B
04:23 - it's just B and B to let's see how this
04:26 - looks
04:28 - did I improve it
04:31 - I don't know thanks so far on the left
04:33 - side let's go ahead and fix the the
04:36 - starting position right
04:37 - here let's make it start at negative 100
04:39 - see how that looks
04:40 - I don't know the flapping motion it
04:47 - looks kind of circular let's get let's
04:49 - try to fix that I hate to not improve
04:52 - something it's this swing right there
04:54 - that just doesn't look right now it's
04:56 - flat flat flapping ah let's see I wonder
05:02 - I want to rotate it down there we go how
05:07 - about rotate it like this there flap
05:13 - flap flap your wing
05:15 - [Music]
05:17 - anyways I really like the project I will
05:19 - see you next time on the scratch
05:22 - showcase
