00:00 - I have a variable called score when the
00:02 - game starts it sets the score 2:0 when I
00:05 - press the spacebar it changes by one
00:07 - watch the score I want to make a high
00:12 - score so we'll make a new variable
00:13 - called high score I don't want to set
00:20 - high score to anything at the beginning
00:22 - I want it to be set to the score but
00:25 - only if the score gets higher than the
00:27 - high score so how do I do that the first
00:30 - thing I'm going to do is get an if
00:33 - statement because I'm going to be
00:34 - checking to see if the high score is
00:37 - less than the score and I'm going to
00:40 - wrap that in a forever loop because I
00:42 - want to always be checking there I'll
00:46 - need an operator to check we'll use the
00:49 - greater than operator will say this data
00:53 - if score is greater than high score set
00:59 - high score to score watch this you'll
01:05 - see them both be at zero because high
01:07 - score has never been used before but
01:10 - when I start clicking you'll notice that
01:12 - high score is going up with the score
01:15 - that's because it's the first time but
01:17 - now when I restart the game score is
01:20 - zero but high score remains at 13 and it
01:24 - will stay there until I get a score that
01:26 - is greater than the high score there now
01:30 - it is
