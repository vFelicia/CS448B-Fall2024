00:00 - hey scratchers today I'm gonna show you
00:02 - how to build a scrolling backdrop which
00:04 - you can use for games that go left to
00:06 - right or top to bottom however you want
00:09 - to build the game these are the basic
00:11 - skills you need to build a scrolling
00:13 - backdrop I'm starting with a blank
00:15 - scratch project I know who would have
00:18 - thought now we're gonna make a backdrop
00:21 - that Scrolls across the screen but
00:24 - backdrops can't move and let me prove
00:27 - that to you let's go and select our
00:29 - backdrop and you're gonna look for a
00:32 - backdrop that has a scroll ability
00:36 - factor meaning both sides of it can be
00:38 - connected together to create a really
00:41 - long scrolling effect so the knight City
00:44 - is the perfect backdrop now let me prove
00:48 - to you that you can't move a backdrop
00:50 - click on the stage so that the code is
00:52 - selected right here stage selected no
00:56 - motion blocks so what we'll do is we'll
01:00 - actually move the image from the
01:02 - backdrop costume onto a sprite so go to
01:06 - the backdrop menu take this and drop it
01:09 - right on top of scratch cat then when
01:12 - you click on scratch cat you'll see that
01:14 - that backdrop is actually there now
01:16 - we'll get rid of the scratch cat because
01:19 - all I want to focus on on this video is
01:21 - the backdrop which is now a sprite
01:23 - backdrops right back just right I know
01:25 - it's confusing
01:26 - ok so let's zoom out so I can see this
01:29 - now a little hidden secret is although
01:33 - it looks like this backdrop fills the
01:36 - whole screen it may or may not so I'm
01:39 - gonna convert it to vector then I'm
01:42 - going to select the whole thing and I'm
01:45 - gonna make sure by dragging it to the
01:47 - corner that oh look at that there's a
01:49 - little space down there and let's see if
01:52 - we can up how to make it a little wider
01:54 - ok once you have it maximized then
01:59 - you're ready to scroll because let's
02:02 - explain a couple things first of all how
02:04 - wide is an image a sprite is 480 pixels
02:10 - or you scratch units I don't know if
02:12 - they're pixels or units
02:13 - if it's 480 but wait a minute I thought
02:16 - it was 240 well 240 on one side then
02:22 - there's the zero and then 240 on the
02:24 - other side is 480 so we want that width
02:30 - to be exactly 480 so that when it
02:33 - Scrolls across the screen it will it
02:36 - will finish and then the next the next
02:39 - image will scroll you'll have to make
02:41 - something really clear this lesson is
02:43 - about backdrops but they're not actually
02:47 - backdrops so go in the backdrop stage
02:51 - menu and select blank we don't want to
02:55 - have a backdrop behind the sprites
02:58 - because this is really confusing we're
03:01 - gonna be making two sprites that look
03:05 - like backdrops that travel across the
03:08 - screen and the reason I'm moving my
03:11 - hands are because when the sprite
03:13 - reaches the edge it automatically moves
03:16 - to the beginning so it creates kind of
03:20 - this slideshow and because there's two
03:22 - of them
03:23 - you can actually trick your eyes into
03:26 - thinking that it's an endless scrolling
03:29 - backdrop so make sure that there is no
03:32 - backdrop behind your sprite and that
03:35 - here's your sprite you selected the
03:37 - sprite and we're gonna add some code the
03:39 - first thing you're going to do is make
03:41 - two variables - how come - we'll check
03:46 - this out make a variable we're gonna
03:49 - call it X position or X pause for a
03:53 - short and this is going to be the first
03:55 - backdrop so we'll call it X position 1
03:58 - then make another one called Y position
04:03 - 1 there these are going to refer to the
04:07 - the X&Y position of this back I said
04:12 - backdrop it's actually a sprite but it
04:14 - looks like a backdrop yes so in the very
04:17 - beginning we're going to be setting both
04:19 - of these variables first let's set the x
04:22 - position then we'll set the Y position
04:25 - now we name these variables
04:27 - exposition and y-position but they
04:29 - actually don't have a value let's look
04:32 - in the motion block menu at the bottom
04:35 - there there are these reporter blocks
04:37 - that actually hold the x-position
04:39 - y-position
04:40 - of a sprite but they report back the
04:43 - actual position we're going to be
04:46 - creating our own positioning that's why
04:49 - we made our own variables instead of
04:52 - using these we want to actually set them
04:55 - to a position so X position is going to
04:57 - be 0 Y position is going to be 0 that
04:59 - puts it right in the middle so we'll go
05:02 - to motion and we'll use the go to block
05:05 - and instead of going to this X Y
05:08 - position we will use the variable X
05:12 - position and Y position now all we have
05:16 - to do is put a event block on the top to
05:19 - start the game and it will position the
05:21 - sprite right where we want it this
05:24 - sprite will start in the middle and then
05:26 - it will glide to the left like this the
05:29 - way we'll do that is by using a forever
05:32 - loop to make it constantly move so go in
05:35 - control menu grab a forever loop what
05:38 - we'll do is we'll change this value
05:41 - right here this variable X position so
05:44 - go to vet variables and grab change X
05:49 - position by negative 10 and then we want
05:54 - to Reese to put another go-to in there
05:57 - so go to motion and we'll say go to and
06:02 - well actually just copy these variables
06:06 - right here there let's let's see if this
06:09 - works okay look do you see how the Y
06:12 - position stays at 0 because we didn't
06:14 - actually want to change it but perhaps
06:15 - you will in the future so I used that
06:17 - variable the X position is changing and
06:19 - look it's going really really negative
06:22 - right now so we want to say when the x
06:24 - position reaches a certain point to
06:27 - reposition the sprite we'll use an if
06:31 - statement to do that go into control
06:32 - grab the if block now we need an
06:36 - operator that's gonna be the less than
06:38 - operator because we're gonna say
06:41 - if the exposition goes less than
06:45 - negative 480 whoops there we go
06:49 - so that means negative 480 is as far as
06:52 - you can they take the whole sprite the
06:55 - whole backdrop sprite move it completely
06:58 - off the screen that would be negative
07:00 - 480 so we'll put that right in here so
07:04 - that it's inside the forever loop and if
07:08 - if it does go to negative 40 80 we're
07:11 - going to reset the exposition so we'll
07:13 - say set X position to not zero to 480 so
07:21 - that will basically shift it all the way
07:23 - back to the beginning what we should see
07:26 - now is a loop there is the loop we are
07:29 - looking for now we're gonna make the
07:32 - second backdrop by duplicating the first
07:34 - one so just right click on the sprite
07:37 - click duplicate now these are going to
07:39 - be exactly the same so if you click the
07:42 - green flag they should be right on top
07:43 - of each other the problem is still there
07:46 - that giant white space so we'll stop it
07:49 - well go into sprite two and we'll create
07:52 - new variables so click make a variable
07:55 - and we'll call it x position two we'll
07:58 - make another variable called Y position
08:00 - two and the number two represents sprite
08:04 - 2 then come into the code for sprite 2
08:07 - and change these so they so that you
08:10 - have the correct variable so this would
08:12 - be Y position in X position - we're not
08:15 - going to use this one anymore we're
08:17 - going to replace it with X position and
08:19 - then Y position 2 down here this one
08:22 - will be X position 2 this will be boy if
08:26 - you do this too quickly you're going to
08:28 - make a mistake so concentrate and this
08:31 - one is X position 2 and then finally
08:35 - it's going to be setting x position 2 if
08:38 - you did everything correctly it still
08:41 - should look exactly the same there
08:43 - should be a big gap because all we did
08:45 - is replace the variables with different
08:49 - named variables but they're doing
08:51 - exactly the same thing you'd actually
08:53 - monitor
08:54 - the numbers right here so how do we make
08:57 - it look like it's an endless screen we
09:00 - add 480 to the start position on one so
09:04 - that one is always 480 behind the other
09:08 - isn't that brilliant all you have to do
09:11 - is come up here where it says set X
09:13 - position you just set it to 480 to start
09:16 - there now it has a perfect lead oh
09:19 - there's a line in there if you find that
09:23 - there's a white line or the sprites just
09:26 - don't connect quite right you can kind
09:30 - of determine which sprite that has the
09:33 - problem by clicking on the sprite and
09:35 - seeing it glow you'll actually see that
09:37 - this white line is included on this
09:39 - sprite but not on this one so this is
09:42 - the one I need to work on I'll go into
09:44 - the costumes I'll make sure I'm in
09:46 - vector mode click on the selector and
09:49 - see if I can't drag this sprite a little
09:53 - bit wider you drag that right there
10:00 - there's a little bit it's a little bit
10:02 - off but pretty good you're gonna have to
10:04 - do some fine adjustment just to because
10:07 - the scratch editor you can't really see
10:10 - the full width on your screen okay we're
10:14 - almost done but there's one final really
10:17 - important code block you need to add to
10:19 - a scrolling backdrop and that's in the
10:21 - looks menu and that has to do with the
10:23 - layers you want to make the backdrop go
10:27 - to the backward layer so go backward 10
10:31 - layers why 10 cuz you just want to get
10:33 - it way back there why because every time
10:35 - you add a sprite to your game it's like
10:38 - adding another layer and you want the
10:40 - backdrop to well it's not really a
10:42 - backdrop remember it's just a sprite so
10:44 - you want to make sure it's behind
10:45 - everything in your game
10:47 - so go backwards 10 layers works and the
10:51 - final step is to add your character so
10:53 - I'm gonna add the brown bear he has some
10:56 - nice costumes so he has this walking
10:58 - costume collection so I'll put that in a
11:01 - forever loop and there we go we have
11:05 - or scrolling background with a bear
11:08 - walking

reporter blocks that actually hold the xposition yposition of a sprite but they report back the actual position we're going to be creating our own positioning that's why we made our own variables instead of using these we want to actually set them to a position so X position is going to be 0 Y position is going to be 0 that puts it right in the middle so we'll go to motion and we'll use the go to block and instead of going to this X Y position we will use the variable X position and Y position now all we have to do is put a event block on the top to start the game and it will position the
