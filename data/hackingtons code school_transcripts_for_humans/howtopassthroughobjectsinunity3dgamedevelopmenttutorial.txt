00:00 - hello everyone today we're going to be
00:02 - looking at passing through objects in
00:05 - unity let's check it out here i have a
00:08 - scene i've made in unity i have two
00:11 - ramps with two identical balls that are
00:13 - in the exact same position and then i
00:16 - have these two boxes over here let's see
00:18 - what happens when i run the game both of
00:20 - the balls start falling down the ramps
00:22 - and then by the time they reach the end
00:24 - one of them stops and the other one goes
00:26 - right through the box
00:28 - now these boxes are almost identical
00:30 - except for one thing the box in front
00:32 - here is set to be a trigger this makes
00:35 - it so that anything will pass through
00:38 - that game object this is pretty cool and
00:40 - has a lot of uses in your games to make
00:43 - an object that other game objects can
00:45 - pass through all you have to do is
00:48 - create a game object in the scene in
00:50 - this case i'm going to make a cube i'm
00:52 - going to go ahead and give this cube a
00:53 - different material so it sticks out and
00:55 - then i'm going to check the box on the
00:58 - box collider that says is trigger
01:01 - this controls whether you can go through
01:04 - the box or not
01:05 - so now both of these balls should go
01:07 - right through
01:08 - trigger volume and then hit the end now
01:11 - triggers can be used for all sorts of
01:12 - things you can have them be invisible in
01:15 - your scene by unchecking the mesh render
01:18 - box here
01:19 - now that we have a trigger volume here
01:21 - we can use it to cause something to
01:24 - happen when a game object passes through
01:26 - it by using a trigger we can add secret
01:29 - areas to our game can also use it to add
01:31 - graphical details to our game like a
01:33 - water level in this swamp let's see what
01:36 - you can build in unity
