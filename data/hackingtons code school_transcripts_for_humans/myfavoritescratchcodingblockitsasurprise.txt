00:00 - someone asked me what is your favorite
00:02 - code block
00:03 - in scratch and it's a little surprising
00:07 - check this out in the sensing menu
00:10 - there is a code block that says backdrop
00:14 - number of stage and most beginners will
00:18 - see that and be like well
00:19 - i don't care what the backdrop number of
00:21 - the stage is
00:23 - and then you have these drop downs
00:24 - there's nothing else in there
00:27 - or is there now this code block doesn't
00:30 - work correctly
00:31 - unless there's another sprite in the
00:33 - game
00:34 - so let's go ahead and add another sprite
00:37 - let's
00:38 - add a beetle yeah the beatles i love the
00:41 - beatles oh this is just the bug
00:43 - okay so there's two sprites in the game
00:46 - now let's say this cat wants to interact
00:50 - with the beetle
00:51 - now this is the code block that will
00:53 - allow it to do that
00:55 - why because instead of the stage we'll
00:58 - select
00:59 - beetle there we go now we know the x
01:02 - position
01:02 - the y position the direction that the
01:04 - beetle is facing
01:06 - this is pretty cool i actually
01:09 - as the cat know what the beetle is
01:12 - basically doing
01:13 - so let's look at the direction so what
01:15 - is the value of the direction of the
01:17 - beetle
01:18 - in order to see this we're going to have
01:20 - to create a variable here we go so my
01:22 - variable already exists
01:24 - so let's set my variable to this block
01:27 - right here just so we can see the value
01:29 - right now
01:30 - and let's put a start flag on that so
01:33 - whenever the game starts
01:34 - there so the beetle is in direction 90.
01:38 - pretty cool huh now what happens if we
01:41 - just
01:41 - ah for fun let's just turn the beetle
01:43 - i'm going to use the direction right
01:44 - here oh you can actually drag it there
01:46 - you go
01:46 - i'm going to turn it there okay the cat
01:48 - will never know what direction we're
01:50 - facing in oh yeah
01:52 - the cat knows it's negative 145.044932
01:58 - wow anyways now your sprites
02:01 - can know what the other sprites are
02:03 - doing and
02:04 - that's pretty cool
