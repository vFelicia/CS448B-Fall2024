00:00 - all right let's check out this cool new
00:01 - game
00:03 - what what what's going on
00:10 - what is happening everybody have you
00:11 - ever been stuck at 90
00:14 - and you just think that if you give it a
00:15 - little bit longer it might actually load
00:17 - well it's never going to load i hate to
00:19 - burst your bubble if you're a developer
00:20 - and your game is doing this to somebody
00:22 - then there's a way to fix it
00:23 - so let me go ahead and take a moment to
00:25 - show you how once you're inside your
00:26 - unity project go ahead up to your build
00:28 - settings
00:29 - make certain you've selected webgl and
00:31 - hit player settings
00:33 - inside the player settings it'll
00:35 - actually give you some options that you
00:36 - can change right here but what we're
00:37 - interested in is the webgl output
00:39 - and publishing settings the compression
00:42 - format
00:42 - right now it's set to compression format
00:44 - broadly let's change that to disabled
00:47 - and that seems to fix everything so if
00:49 - you exit out of this
00:51 - go ahead and build your project and
00:54 - once it's finished it should work this
00:56 - time
01:02 - sweet we're in
