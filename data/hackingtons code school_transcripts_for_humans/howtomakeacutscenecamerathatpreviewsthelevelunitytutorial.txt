00:00 - and we'll give it a go and we'll watch
00:02 - the glory happen in all of the
00:04 - resolution that we can render on a Mac
00:06 - Mini let's do this all right so we're
00:08 - going to preview the level and it
00:13 - switches now you just have to do all of
00:15 - the physics to get it to move
00:26 - all right so let's build a super simple
00:29 - like level preview cutscene camera
00:32 - animation thing before our game starts
00:34 - so I have a game here it's just cube
00:37 - slide or qubit or and then whatever you
00:39 - want to call your game but it's
00:41 - basically just a cube that slides across
00:42 - a platform that you have to avoid
00:44 - obstacles in so what I want to do is I
00:47 - want to have a camera kind of take a
00:49 - top-down view and slide across the level
00:52 - before the game starts so you can
00:54 - preview where their obstacles are at and
00:56 - kind of preview what chaos you're going
00:58 - to go through before you actually start
01:00 - the game so the first thing that I'm
01:02 - going to do is go ahead and create a new
01:04 - camera so I'm going to create a camera
01:06 - here and I'm going to call this preview
01:10 - camp and this is going to be the camera
01:13 - that previews the scene now right now we
01:16 - can see the camera preview down here in
01:18 - the right hand corner that's not exactly
01:20 - the angle that we want it to take so
01:23 - let's move it I'm just gonna rotate
01:24 - around here I'm going to raise this up
01:28 - and I'm going to rotate it to face down
01:33 - kind of like that kind of like a bird's
01:35 - eye view that's gonna slide through so
01:38 - how we're going to actually move the
01:40 - camera it's not by physically adding a
01:42 - force to it what we're going to do is
01:44 - we're going to actually create an
01:46 - animation that animates the camera
01:48 - across the scene so I have my animation
01:51 - panel open here if you don't see this
01:53 - you can go to window animation and see
01:56 - this panel I'm gonna go ahead and create
01:58 - a new animation I'm gonna call this
02:02 - level preview I'm just gonna save it
02:06 - directly in my assets
02:07 - alright so I've created my new animation
02:10 - here I'm just gonna hit record and now
02:12 - it's going to record everything that I
02:14 - do for this camera so it's going to have
02:19 - a position here I'm gonna drag this
02:21 - playhead all the way through to let's do
02:26 - one second we can only slow this
02:28 - animation down but for after one second
02:31 - what we're gonna do is then take and
02:33 - move this camera all the way to the end
02:37 - of the level so I'm just going to move
02:40 - it
02:40 - in the z-direction all the way down to
02:43 - the end of the level I can see my camera
02:45 - preview down there in the right hand
02:46 - corner and I'm just going to continue to
02:49 - move this all the way until I get to the
02:51 - end of the level which looks like it
02:53 - ends about there all right now I can
02:57 - take the playhead bring it back to the
03:00 - beginning and stop recording now if I
03:03 - play my animation through we can see
03:05 - that it cycles through the level it
03:07 - takes I mean it's way too fast I mean
03:10 - that's
03:10 - there's no preview there you're just
03:11 - like zipping across the level there's no
03:14 - useful information in that so let's go
03:16 - ahead and slow it down so what I can do
03:19 - all right so I'm just going to go ahead
03:20 - and scroll out on my animation until I
03:22 - see that five-second mark and we're
03:24 - gonna take those keyframes and move them
03:26 - to five seconds we want this animation
03:28 - to take about five seconds and now if I
03:31 - play through it we slowly see the level
03:34 - and it's actually useful information all
03:37 - right so now that we have this animation
03:39 - created we can select it in our assets
03:44 - panel here and we're gonna do a few
03:46 - things here so what we want to do is
03:51 - open debug mode all right so I'm going
03:54 - to click way up in the top right hand
03:56 - corner it's very hard to see and I'm
03:57 - gonna go into debug mode which allows me
04:00 - to make it a legacy clip and change the
04:04 - wrap mode to once that way this
04:06 - animation just plays through once
04:08 - alright so now that I have that I'm
04:10 - gonna go ahead and save my scene and I
04:12 - am going to create a new game objects
04:16 - create an empty game object and I'm just
04:18 - gonna call this camera switcher and what
04:23 - this is gonna do is do nothing but have
04:25 - a script on it that switches between the
04:26 - cameras and then activates our motion so
04:29 - I'm gonna create a new C sharp script
04:31 - down here create C start script and I
04:34 - call this cam preview and open it up in
04:39 - monodevelop or you can it open it up in
04:43 - Visual Studio or whichever IDE you
04:47 - prefer to do your coding in alright so
04:50 - now in our camera preview
04:52 - we need to actually grab that camera so
04:54 - we're gonna do a public variable you can
04:57 - do this in the awake function if you're
04:58 - feeling feisty but for me I'm just gonna
05:00 - slide it into a box just for the
05:02 - tutorial so a game object and we're go
05:05 - ahead and call this cam one that's going
05:10 - to be our main camera and then public
05:12 - game object cam to this that's going to
05:16 - be the preview camera actually let's
05:18 - give these better names let's call this
05:21 - main cam and let's call this one preview
05:25 - cam that way we know exactly what they
05:27 - do so let's go ahead and in our start
05:30 - function we're gonna do what's called a
05:31 - KO routine a ko routine is a set
05:34 - sequence of functions or something like
05:36 - that that runs outside of the game clock
05:39 - so it doesn't stop your game from
05:41 - running for five seconds but we can put
05:43 - a weight on a different function for
05:45 - let's say five seconds so we're going to
05:48 - start a KO routine and let's just go
05:52 - with call this function preview not cam
05:58 - preview you want just preview it's going
06:02 - to not be an actual function yet because
06:05 - we need to create it we don't need this
06:07 - update function any longer and now we're
06:09 - going to do it I in numerator called
06:14 - preview now that should change from red
06:17 - to black or blue all right so now what
06:23 - we're going to do is we're going to wait
06:24 - a certain time and then switch camera so
06:30 - let's do a yield return new wait four
06:36 - seconds and how long are we going to
06:38 - wait let's go ahead and wait that five
06:41 - seconds that we know that animation
06:43 - takes to play after we wait those five
06:46 - seconds we're going to go ahead and set
06:49 - the preview cam or sorry set the main
06:52 - cam to be active and then set the
07:00 - preview cam
07:03 - to not be active we always want to set
07:06 - one camera active we before we turn off
07:09 - the other camera that way we don't get a
07:11 - frame of black in between the switch so
07:14 - this should you know once once we start
07:17 - the game it starts this preview we wait
07:19 - five seconds and then we activate the
07:22 - main camera and then turn off that other
07:24 - camera and if we had other cameras that
07:26 - we wanted to switch to we could do that
07:28 - there what we could do right down here
07:30 - is also turn on the physics for our game
07:32 - so reactivate the main camera or the
07:35 - players movement script all of that but
07:38 - let's just see if this works it's going
07:39 - to go ahead and hit compile no errors
07:42 - that looks great
07:44 - let's go ahead and switch back to unity
07:46 - here and now on my camera switcher game
07:54 - object here I'm going to go ahead and
07:56 - throw on that oops
08:01 - that cam previews script I'm going to go
08:06 - into my preview cam and remove the
08:09 - animator we don't want an animator we
08:12 - want an animation and then we need the
08:18 - animation clip which is that level
08:21 - preview the animations that we are that
08:26 - we have cool it already clicked it in
08:27 - there that looks great let's see if this
08:29 - works so I'm going to go ahead and hit
08:31 - play here we preview the scene wait for
08:41 - it wait for it it's going to wait five
08:43 - seconds it's probably too long we
08:44 - probably could have made a three or two
08:46 - or something like that it didn't switch
08:51 - why didn't it switch tell me in the
08:53 - comments why did it switch well because
08:56 - in our script we never clicked in the
08:58 - actual things that it's switching
09:00 - between let's put our cameras in there
09:01 - ISO preview cam goes in preview cam and
09:04 - main camera goes in main cam we'll save
09:08 - that and we'll give it a go and we'll
09:10 - watch the glory happen in all of the
09:13 - resolution that we can render on a Mac
09:15 - Mini let's do this alright so we're
09:17 - going to preview the level and it
09:22 - switches now you just have to do all of
09:24 - the physics to get it to move but that
09:26 - is a super simple camera preview
09:28 - cutscene thing in unity

Cleaned transcript:

and we'll give it a go and we'll watch the glory happen in all of the resolution that we can render on a Mac Mini let's do this all right so we're going to preview the level and it switches now you just have to do all of the physics to get it to move all right so let's build a super simple like level preview cutscene camera animation thing before our game starts so I have a game here it's just cube slide or qubit or and then whatever you want to call your game but it's basically just a cube that slides across a platform that you have to avoid obstacles in so what I want to do is I want to have a camera kind of take a topdown view and slide across the level before the game starts so you can preview where their obstacles are at and kind of preview what chaos you're going to go through before you actually start the game so the first thing that I'm going to do is go ahead and create a new camera so I'm going to create a camera here and I'm going to call this preview camp and this is going to be the camera that previews the scene now right now we can see the camera preview down here in the right hand corner that's not exactly the angle that we want it to take so let's move it I'm just gonna rotate around here I'm going to raise this up and I'm going to rotate it to face down kind of like that kind of like a bird's eye view that's gonna slide through so how we're going to actually move the camera it's not by physically adding a force to it what we're going to do is we're going to actually create an animation that animates the camera across the scene so I have my animation panel open here if you don't see this you can go to window animation and see this panel I'm gonna go ahead and create a new animation I'm gonna call this level preview I'm just gonna save it directly in my assets alright so I've created my new animation here I'm just gonna hit record and now it's going to record everything that I do for this camera so it's going to have a position here I'm gonna drag this playhead all the way through to let's do one second we can only slow this animation down but for after one second what we're gonna do is then take and move this camera all the way to the end of the level so I'm just going to move it in the zdirection all the way down to the end of the level I can see my camera preview down there in the right hand corner and I'm just going to continue to move this all the way until I get to the end of the level which looks like it ends about there all right now I can take the playhead bring it back to the beginning and stop recording now if I play my animation through we can see that it cycles through the level it takes I mean it's way too fast I mean that's there's no preview there you're just like zipping across the level there's no useful information in that so let's go ahead and slow it down so what I can do all right so I'm just going to go ahead and scroll out on my animation until I see that fivesecond mark and we're gonna take those keyframes and move them to five seconds we want this animation to take about five seconds and now if I play through it we slowly see the level and it's actually useful information all right so now that we have this animation created we can select it in our assets panel here and we're gonna do a few things here so what we want to do is open debug mode all right so I'm going to click way

game object and we're go ahead and call this cam one that's going to be our main camera and then public game object cam to this that's going to be the preview camera actually let's give these better names let's call this main cam and let's call this one preview cam that way we know exactly what they do so let's go ahead and in our start function we're gonna do what's called a KO routine a ko routine is a set sequence of functions or something like that that runs outside of the game clock so it doesn't stop your game from running for five seconds but we can put a weight on a different
