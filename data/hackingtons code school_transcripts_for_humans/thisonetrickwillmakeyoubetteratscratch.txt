00:13 - what's up everybody thank you so much
00:15 - for checking out this video i am stephen
00:16 - croft i'm a co-founder at hackington's
00:18 - code school for kids
00:19 - and we're looking at scratch today so in
00:22 - scratch there's a lot of tools that
00:23 - people
00:24 - typically don't take advantage of the
00:25 - custom blocks
00:27 - the lists the cloud variables but we're
00:29 - talking about one
00:30 - that everybody can use and everyone
00:33 - should be using there is a thing at the
00:36 - very bottom of your screen
00:38 - called a backpack it's think of it as an
00:41 - actual backpack you can put stuff in
00:43 - there and then take it out at
00:45 - on different games so let's say you're
00:47 - going through here and you create
00:48 - um i don't know a
00:52 - a forever uh rotate
00:55 - 15 degrees when the spread is clicked so
00:59 - let's say you create this block and this
01:01 - is your favorite block of all time you
01:03 - want this in every game when i click on
01:05 - the sprite it spins
01:07 - forever well i could remember this
01:10 - i could write it down i could take a
01:11 - picture of it i could take a screenshot
01:13 - but there's a better way
01:15 - we can open up our backpack and just
01:17 - drag it into our backpack
01:19 - and now this script
01:22 - is available to us no matter what game
01:25 - we're building
01:26 - so let's say i create a new project here
01:31 - scratch cat i click it it doesn't spin
01:33 - but i need it to spin
01:34 - i go into my backpack slide that in and
01:36 - now the scratch cat spins
01:39 - it's that simple you guys need to be
01:41 - using your backpack the backpack is
01:43 - going to be
01:43 - your home for all of your more complex
01:46 - snippets of code
01:47 - that you want to use in other games you
01:49 - want to add an
01:50 - enemy to level two build a script for it
01:52 - add it in your backpack
01:54 - every game that you have a level 2 that
01:55 - you want to add enemies in you just slap
01:57 - it in there
01:57 - you have movement created drop it in
01:59 - your backpack then when you're to a game
02:01 - and you need to have
02:02 - input for the arrow keys or for wazda
02:05 - just
02:05 - drag it in and boom you are good to go
02:08 - you are going to build games
02:09 - so much faster if you have a robust
02:13 - backpack to pull from hopefully you like
02:15 - that if not
02:16 - i don't know just like the video don't
02:18 - do that that button just doesn't exist
02:19 - comment down below other really cool
02:21 - scratch tips
02:23 - and maybe i'll shoot a video on them and
02:24 - share them with everybody
