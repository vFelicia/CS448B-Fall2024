00:00 - so we still have that ridiculous
00:01 - friction applied but if we jump over we
00:04 - we hit that box and it sends us leading
00:07 - into the distance
00:19 - alright guys today we're gonna be making
00:21 - something sticky and something bouncy so
00:24 - we're gonna be messing with physics
00:25 - materials 2d
00:27 - let's jump into it and take a look see
00:29 - how these work and why you would use
00:31 - them alright so I have a game built here
00:34 - and it's very basic I have a player that
00:37 - gets moved at a constant force to the
00:39 - right I have a ground I have some
00:41 - enemies that I need to jump over also on
00:43 - the player movement script I have the
00:45 - jumping ability and I have this box
00:48 - right here that is an obstacle we can
00:50 - make this box bouncy so we're gonna do
00:53 - that by adding physics material 2d to
00:57 - these colliders so the collider is the
01:00 - intersection between two objects we can
01:02 - change how that intersection works by
01:04 - adding physics material 2d it's not a
01:07 - component it's a separate object so in
01:11 - my assets here I'm gonna go ahead and
01:13 - right-click and create a physics
01:15 - material 2d it's in this drop-down I
01:17 - know it's off the screen you guys can't
01:18 - see it but we can grab it here and let's
01:22 - go ahead and make this one called sticky
01:25 - now if I take the player here and I add
01:30 - sticky to the material in there now the
01:33 - player itself is sticky so when I play
01:37 - this game we can see that it will
01:39 - probably not slow down hardly at all
01:42 - because I've set the friction to be 0.4
01:45 - which is the default so we can see
01:47 - that's the the normal rate of speed that
01:49 - you can see now if we go into the
01:52 - physics material we can see we have
01:54 - friction and bounciness friction is the
01:57 - friction that it applies to an object
01:59 - there are the friction that it has
02:01 - bounciness is the bounciness of things
02:04 - that collide with it so we're gonna go
02:06 - ahead and change this friction to
02:08 - something like a hundred so that you can
02:09 - guys can really see what happens now
02:12 - when the player falls down and hits the
02:14 - ground we can see that it's going to
02:16 - slow it way down and even make it turn
02:21 - so that the friction is being applied or
02:24 - the friction is on the player and so it
02:27 - is sticky to the ground now let's make
02:30 - something bounce so I have this
02:32 - bounce object here I'm going to create a
02:34 - new physics material 2d I'm going to
02:37 - call this one bouncy and I'm going to
02:40 - edit the bounciness to be something like
02:42 - 50 belts eNOS is a big thing so just be
02:47 - cautious with your numbers but so now
02:50 - this big white box will have once we
02:54 - drag in the material we'll have a
02:56 - balanced eNOS to it so anything that
02:57 - collides with it will bounce off so if
03:00 - you're gonna make a trampolining
03:01 - platform or a or a ball in a game or
03:05 - something like that this is how you
03:07 - would do it now if you're gonna make the
03:08 - ball that's ballon see the ball wouldn't
03:11 - be bouncy everything that interacts with
03:12 - the ball would be bouncing alright let
03:14 - me show you what I mean so if we play
03:16 - the game here and we jump over those
03:19 - enemies once it loads come on Mac Mini
03:22 - you can do it so we still have that
03:25 - ridiculous friction applied but if we
03:27 - jump over we we hit that box and it
03:30 - sends us leading into the distance but
03:33 - that's how you add bounciness to a
03:35 - platform and friction to it objects
03:37 - physics materials 2d super cool

so we still have that ridiculous friction applied but if we jump over we we hit that box and it sends us leading into the distance alright guys today we're gonna be making something sticky and something bouncy so we're gonna be messing with physics materials 2d let's jump into it and take a look see how these work and why you would use them alright so I have a game built here and it's very basic I have a player that gets moved at a constant force to the right I have a ground I have some enemies that I need to jump over also on the player movement script I have the jumping ability and I have this box right here that is an obstacle we can make this box bouncy so we're gonna do that by adding physics material 2d to these colliders so the collider is the intersection between two objects we can change how that intersection works by adding physics material 2d it's not a component it's a separate object so in my assets here I'm gonna go ahead and rightclick and create a physics material 2d it's in this dropdown I know it's off the screen you guys can't see it but we can grab it here and let's go ahead and make this one called sticky now if I take the player here and I add sticky to the material in there now the player itself is sticky so when I play this game we can see that it will probably not slow down hardly at all because I've set the friction to be 0.4 which is the default so we can see that's the the normal rate of speed that you can see now if we go into the physics material we can see we have friction and bounciness friction is the friction that it applies to an object there are the friction that it has bounciness is the bounciness of things that collide with it so we're gonna go ahead and change this friction to something like a hundred so that you can guys can really see what happens now when the player falls down and hits the ground we can see that it's going to slow it way down and even make it turn so that the friction is being applied or the friction is on the player and so it is sticky to the ground now let's make something bounce so I have this bounce object here I'm going to create a new physics material 2d I'm going to call this one bouncy and I'm going to edit the bounciness to be something like 50 belts eNOS is a big thing so just be cautious with your numbers but so now this big white box will have once we drag in the material we'll have a balanced eNOS to it so anything that collides with it will bounce off so if you're gonna make a trampolining platform or a or a ball in a game or something like that this is how you would do it now if you're gonna make the ball that's ballon see the ball wouldn't be bouncy everything that interacts with the ball would be bouncing alright let me show you what I mean so if we play the game here and we jump over those enemies once it loads come on Mac Mini you can do it so we still have that ridiculous friction applied but if we jump over we we hit that box and it sends us leading into the distance but that's how you add bounciness to a platform and friction to it objects physics materials 2d super cool
