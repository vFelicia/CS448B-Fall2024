00:00 - let's add in the player and its movement
00:02 - script this usually if you're working in
00:05 - scratch or even if you're working in
00:06 - something like Unity would take you
00:08 - multiple days you're going to add in the
00:10 - Sprite you're going to add in all the
00:12 - animations you're going to add in all of
00:13 - the code you're going to check you're
00:15 - going to find out that you've typed
00:16 - capital A instead of lowercase a it's
00:18 - going to take you a long time but we can
00:20 - do it really quickly because construct
00:22 - has some behaviors built in
00:24 - automatically inside of the system here
00:27 - so we're going to in our layout I'm
00:29 - going to right click and choose insert
00:31 - new object this is going to insert a new
00:35 - game object now we choose what type of
00:38 - game objects we're going to insert well
00:40 - we're going to insert a Sprite so I can
00:42 - just start typing because I'm looking
00:44 - for a Sprite and it automatically
00:46 - searches for it then I'm just going to
00:48 - double click on the Sprite this is now
00:51 - on the cursor we've seen that the cursor
00:53 - has changed to this this plus sign the
00:56 - Sprite has not been added to the game
00:58 - now the game is asking us where would
01:01 - you like to add this Sprite I am going
01:04 - to add mine to kind of the middle
01:05 - section of my screen but you can put
01:07 - yours wherever you want once we click in
01:09 - the Sprite gets added to the scene and
01:12 - now we can get to add in the artwork
01:16 - so what we're going to do is we're going
01:18 - to go ahead and rename this animation
01:21 - from animation one to say idle i d l e
01:26 - this is going to be the idle animation
01:27 - this is the animation of the player just
01:29 - kind of standing there and not doing
01:31 - anything now we're going to go ahead and
01:33 - add in our art so in the folder of RPG
01:37 - assets there's a lot going on in here
01:39 - we're going to walk through this stuff
01:40 - as we use it instead of just like
01:42 - dumping everything in here but there's a
01:44 - lot going on let's go ahead and go into
01:46 - actor actor are all of the things in
01:48 - your game like players like non-playable
01:51 - characters NPCs all of the characters
01:54 - then we're going to go into the actual
01:56 - character section and we're going to
01:58 - choose our character I want to play as
02:01 - hmm who do I want to play as what about
02:05 - this red ninja no I don't like the look
02:07 - of that one how about red ninja 2 oh
02:10 - okay I like this one a lot more I'm
02:13 - gonna then go into the separate anim
02:15 - folder and this has all of the
02:17 - individual animations broken out and I'm
02:19 - going to grab this idle animation and
02:21 - just drag it into my scene here that
02:25 - that didn't work that that grabbed the
02:28 - entire thing that's not what I wanted
02:29 - okay so let's go ahead and delete that
02:32 - frame actually we'll just drag in a new
02:35 - set
02:37 - and instead of dragging it into the
02:40 - drawing box I'm going to drag it into
02:43 - the animation Cycles then I can import
02:47 - from Sprite Strip This has four
02:50 - horizontal cells and one vertical cell
02:53 - then if I look at the actual artwork I
02:55 - can see that the cells go horizontally
02:58 - four distinct shapes and vertically
03:01 - there's just a single row so that is
03:04 - good to go set up just the way we want
03:06 - it and we want to replace the entire
03:08 - animation because I want to delete that
03:10 - first animation frame okay then I'm
03:13 - going to go ahead and crop this down so
03:15 - that the hitbox is just where the
03:18 - artwork is
03:19 - now I have this animation
03:21 - here that has it facing forward then
03:24 - backward then left then right I actually
03:26 - just want that first cell the first
03:29 - frame here so I'm going to delete the
03:31 - other three by just clicking on them and
03:33 - hitting the delete key now I just have
03:35 - the idle animation facing forward and
03:38 - this for me is totally fine when I'm not
03:40 - moving the character is just gonna face
03:42 - back towards the camera back towards the
03:44 - player I'm totally fine with that and
03:46 - then I'm going to go ahead and close the
03:50 - Sprite editor there I'm going to go
03:52 - ahead and make sure I am logged in to
03:53 - make sure everything is saved that will
03:55 - pop up every once in a while if you
03:57 - haven't connected to the internet in a
03:58 - second and now I have my player right
04:01 - here on the screen it's hard to see
04:03 - we're going to fix that in some
04:04 - scripting but first let's go ahead and
04:05 - add a behavior to it we're going to add
04:07 - movement so add new behavior and I am
04:10 - looking for eight Direction movement
04:13 - this allows me to move up and down left
04:16 - and right and in all of the diagonals so
04:18 - I'm going to go ahead and double click
04:20 - on that to add that in and that is the
04:22 - only behavior that I'm going to add
04:24 - right now because I want to customize
04:27 - this Behavior I want these things to be
04:29 - slightly different than the defaults
04:32 - so this set angle I'm going to go ahead
04:35 - and change that to no I don't want it to
04:38 - rotate I want it to stay flat and just
04:40 - move if it rotates that might work for
04:43 - some games but for this game that we're
04:45 - building this top down game I don't want
04:47 - that
04:49 - we're going to set the max speed to 100
04:52 - we're going to make it move a little bit
04:53 - slower than it was before
04:56 - the acceleration we're going to set it
04:58 - to 10 000 we're going to set it to as
05:00 - large of a number as it will take so
05:02 - that the acceleration is instantaneous
05:04 - and we're going to say the same thing
05:06 - for the deceleration we want the
05:09 - movement to feel Snappy it stops moving
05:12 - when we stop moving it starts moving
05:14 - when we start moving and there's no like
05:17 - slowing down or speeding up or anything
05:20 - like that
05:23 - default controls we're going to also
05:26 - uncheck this we're going to put in our
05:27 - own custom arrows we're not going to use
05:30 - the arrow keys because we're going to be
05:31 - using the mouse so our right hand is not
05:34 - going to be on the arrow keys our right
05:36 - hand is going to be on the mouse which
05:38 - means our left hand has to do the
05:39 - movement and our left hand naturally
05:42 - rests on was and d and that's where we
05:45 - want it we want it on wazda so that's
05:48 - what we're going to change our movement
05:49 - to in a second
05:51 - now I'm going to go ahead and double
05:52 - click on my Sprite here or so sorry just
05:55 - single click on my Sprite I'm going to
05:56 - rename it to player
05:59 - awesome now I'm going to double click on
06:01 - it to open up my game here or open up my
06:04 - Sprite Which looks great it's zoomed in
06:07 - now which is fine in my animations I'm
06:09 - going to right click and add animation
06:12 - I'm going to call this
06:15 - walking
06:17 - down this is the animation for the
06:20 - character walking down the screen now
06:23 - what I need to do is add in the actual
06:26 - Sprite sheet that we have for this
06:28 - animation so the individual animations
06:30 - I'm going to grab this walk animation
06:32 - and drag it in
06:34 - import from Sprite strip and this is a
06:37 - four by four animation because it is
06:40 - four by four individual images
06:45 - and then import we're going to replace
06:46 - the entire animation and we can kind of
06:49 - go through here and we can see that it's
06:50 - walking well this is the walking down
06:54 - animation so I only need the first four
06:56 - frames of this animation frame 0 1 2 and
07:00 - 3. so I'm going to delete all of the
07:03 - other frames so delete delete delete
07:04 - delete delete delete delete delete
07:06 - delete delete delete delete delete
07:08 - delete
07:10 - and delete okay so now we have this
07:13 - walking down animation I'm going to do
07:16 - the same thing for all of the other
07:18 - directions of movement walking up
07:21 - walking left and walking right and make
07:23 - sure you select the same the the four
07:26 - frames that match the direction of the
07:28 - name of the animation this walking down
07:30 - animation would make no sense if my
07:32 - player is facing to the right so go
07:34 - ahead and get all those animations added
07:36 - in and then we'll come back
07:38 - all right I have all of my animations in
07:41 - here of my idle animation my walking
07:43 - down my walking right my walking left
07:45 - and my walking up animation looking good
07:48 - now we can hit play and we see
07:51 - absolutely nothing first off we see a
07:54 - tiny dot of a character and we don't
07:57 - have any sort of
07:59 - um movement or anything in here I hit
08:02 - the arrows oh okay so I have the arrow
08:04 - keys does some movement which is awesome
08:07 - but it doesn't switch the animations
08:09 - we're too far away and the camera
08:11 - doesn't actually move with my player so
08:14 - let's change a few of those things first
08:15 - let's add a behavior
08:18 - that is the scroll to behavior this
08:21 - Scrolls the camera to the player awesome
08:24 - now we're going to start writing some
08:26 - events so I'm going to go to my event
08:27 - sheet here and we're going to add in
08:30 - some of the events that we need so let's
08:32 - go ahead and add an event now the first
08:34 - thing that we want to fix is that that
08:36 - camera is is pretty far away from the
08:39 - player now if your camera is fine and
08:40 - you like the look of it then you can
08:42 - skip this first event my screen is just
08:45 - huge if we actually go back and look at
08:47 - my my layout here it is 4K it is massive
08:52 - so I'm going to zoom in a little bit to
08:56 - get that fixed but if you have this 720p
08:58 - you might not need to add this first
09:00 - event so I'm going to add a system event
09:03 - and I'm specifically looking for the
09:05 - start of the layout so as soon as the
09:07 - game loads as soon as the game starts I
09:09 - want to set something so on start of
09:12 - layout now I'm going to go ahead and add
09:14 - an action it is a system action here and
09:18 - it is going to set the layout scale so
09:21 - layout oops layout and then we can
09:26 - scroll down to set layout angle no ah
09:31 - set layout scale I'm going to set it
09:34 - from one I'm going to change that to
09:36 - three and hit done
09:37 - if your screen is a different size than
09:39 - mine you can change this number if you
09:41 - like the way your game looks like if I
09:43 - hit play here now I can see my player I
09:46 - can see that I can move and the camera
09:48 - oh no I can't I can't move anymore oh
09:51 - that's right the default controls are
09:53 - turned off okay let's add in that
09:56 - movement
09:58 - so first things first we need to if
10:01 - we're not pressing anything we snap back
10:04 - to the idle animation so add event
10:07 - keyboard
10:09 - on
10:11 - any key released
10:14 - this says as soon as we're not holding a
10:17 - key as soon as we're not touching a key
10:19 - do something well we're going to go into
10:21 - the player and set its animation
10:25 - and then end these double quotes is the
10:28 - exact language that we use
10:30 - in the name of the animation so it's
10:33 - called idle
10:35 - all are spelled exactly the same way
10:37 - that you have it spelled in your player
10:40 - when you add it in the animations and
10:42 - then hit done so now if we release a key
10:45 - we stop moving the player steps back to
10:48 - that idle animation now let's go ahead
10:50 - and add in when we hit the W key when
10:53 - we're moving up the screen W is in that
10:56 - up Arrow position so we're going to add
10:58 - event
10:58 - keyboard when a key is down
11:03 - when a certain key is down
11:06 - we're going to go ahead and
11:08 - do the W key that's the key that we're
11:10 - looking for
11:12 - done and then what are we going to do
11:15 - well we're going to simulate some
11:17 - movement because we don't have to
11:19 - actually add a force or anything like
11:20 - that because we already have that eight
11:22 - Direction Behavior we already have all
11:25 - of that code written for us we just need
11:27 - to kind of replace the up arrow with the
11:29 - w key so we can go into
11:32 - the player and we can in this eight
11:35 - direction we can simulate
11:38 - control
11:42 - and what control are we simulating we're
11:45 - simulating the up Arrow pressed done and
11:49 - this will do the same thing the up Arrow
11:52 - would have done
11:54 - if we were still using the default
11:56 - controls which were not because we're
11:58 - pro Gamers here we use real controls
12:00 - we're also going to add another action
12:02 - to change the animation
12:05 - so I can just search for animation I'm
12:07 - going to go ahead and set the animation
12:09 - and I'm going to in between these double
12:11 - quotes spell it the exact same way I
12:14 - spelled it when I was setting up the
12:16 - animation and it is set said to be
12:19 - walking up for me I capitalize the W and
12:23 - the U but make sure your capitalization
12:24 - is the same that you had when you set up
12:27 - that animation and hit done
12:30 - awesome so we have this now so now if I
12:33 - play my game and I hold down W I go up
12:37 - you can't see that I'm moving because
12:38 - this is all just one gigantic gray box
12:41 - but I am see we are going up the screen
12:44 - awesome this is looking great now I just
12:47 - have to get all of the other movement
12:50 - working so I'm going to take the same
12:53 - command I'm going to copy it I'm going
12:56 - to paste it
12:58 - and I am just going to change some
13:01 - things about it
13:05 - one of those things is this W key is not
13:07 - the key that I'm looking for I am now
13:09 - going to go with the S key because I'm
13:11 - going down
13:13 - and then I'm no longer simulating
13:15 - pressing up I'm simulating pressing down
13:17 - and I am no longer walking up in my
13:21 - animation I am walking
13:23 - down
13:25 - done okay so now the S key makes me go
13:28 - down you're going to do the same thing
13:30 - for all of your your movement directions
13:32 - go ahead and get all that in and you
13:34 - should have working movement if you have
13:36 - any questions let us know we would be
13:38 - happy to help you out

Cleaned transcript:

let's add in the player and its movement script this usually if you're working in scratch or even if you're working in something like Unity would take you multiple days you're going to add in the Sprite you're going to add in all the animations you're going to add in all of the code you're going to check you're going to find out that you've typed capital A instead of lowercase a it's going to take you a long time but we can do it really quickly because construct has some behaviors built in automatically inside of the system here so we're going to in our layout I'm going to right click and choose insert new object this is going to insert a new game object now we choose what type of game objects we're going to insert well we're going to insert a Sprite so I can just start typing because I'm looking for a Sprite and it automatically searches for it then I'm just going to double click on the Sprite this is now on the cursor we've seen that the cursor has changed to this this plus sign the Sprite has not been added to the game now the game is asking us where would you like to add this Sprite I am going to add mine to kind of the middle section of my screen but you can put yours wherever you want once we click in the Sprite gets added to the scene and now we can get to add in the artwork so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and rename this animation from animation one to say idle i d l e this is going to be the idle animation this is the animation of the player just kind of standing there and not doing anything now we're going to go ahead and add in our art so in the folder of RPG assets there's a lot going on in here we're going to walk through this stuff as we use it instead of just like dumping everything in here but there's a lot going on let's go ahead and go into actor actor are all of the things in your game like players like nonplayable characters NPCs all of the characters then we're going to go into the actual character section and we're going to choose our character I want to play as hmm who do I want to play as what about this red ninja no I don't like the look of that one how about red ninja 2 oh okay I like this one a lot more I'm gonna then go into the separate anim folder and this has all of the individual animations broken out and I'm going to grab this idle animation and just drag it into my scene here that that didn't work that that grabbed the entire thing that's not what I wanted okay so let's go ahead and delete that frame actually we'll just drag in a new set and instead of dragging it into the drawing box I'm going to drag it into the animation Cycles then I can import from Sprite Strip This has four horizontal cells and one vertical cell then if I look at the actual artwork I can see that the cells go horizontally four distinct shapes and vertically there's just a single row so that is good to go set up just the way we want it and we want to replace the entire animation because I want to delete that first animation frame okay then I'm going to go ahead and crop this down so that the hitbox is just where the artwork is now I have this animation here that has it facing forward then backward then left then right I actually just want that first cell the first frame here so I'm going to delete the other three by just clicking on them and hitting the delete key now I just have the idle animation facing forward and this for me is totally fine when I'm not moving the character is just gonna face back towards the camera back towards the player I'm totally fine with that and then I'm going to go ahead and close the Sprite editor there I'm going to go ahead and make sure I am logged in to make sure everything is saved that will pop up every once in a while if you haven't connected to the internet in a second and now I have my player right here on the screen it's hard to see we're going to fix that in some scripting but first let's go ahead and add a behavior to it we're going to add movement so add new behavior and I am looking for eight Direction movement this allows me to move up and down left and right and in all of the diagonals so I'm going to go ahead and double click on that to add that in and that is the only behavior that I'm going to add right now because I want to customize this Behavior I want these things to be slightly different than the defaults so this set angle I'm going to go ahead and change that to no I don't want it to rotate I want it to stay flat and just move if it rotates that might work for some games but for this game that we're building this top down game I don't want that we're going to set the max speed to 100 we're going to make it move a little bit slower than it was before the acceleration we're going to set it to 10 000 we're going to set it to as large of a number as it will take so that the acceleration is instantaneous and we're going to say the same thing for the deceleration we want the movement to feel Snappy it stops moving when we stop moving it starts moving when we start moving and there's no like slowing down or speeding up or anything like that default controls we're going to also uncheck this we're going to put in our own custom arrows we're not going to use the arrow keys because we're going to be using the mouse so our right hand is not going to be on the arrow keys our right hand is going to be on the mouse which means our left hand has to do the movement and our left hand naturally rests on was and d and that's where we want it we want it on wazda so that's what we're going to change our movement to in a second now I'm going to go ahead and double click on my Sprite here or so sorry just single click on my Sprite I'm going to rename it to player awesome now I'm going to double click on it to open up my game here or open up my Sprite Which looks great it's zoomed in now which is fine in my animations I'm going to right click and add animation I'm going to call this walking down this is the animation for the character walking down the screen now what I need to do is add in the actual Sprite sheet that we have for this animation so the individual animations I'm going to grab this walk animation and drag it in import from Sprite strip and this is a four by four animation because it is four by four individual images and then import we're going to replace the entire animation and we can kind of go through here and we can see that it's walking well this is the walking down animation so I only need the first four frames of this animation frame 0 1 2 and 3. so I'm going to delete all of the other frames so delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete and delete okay so now we have this walking down animation I'm going to do the same thing for all of the other directions of movement walking up walking left and walking right and make sure you select the same the the four frames that match the direction of the name of the animation this walking down animation would make no sense if my player is facing to the right so go ahead and get all those animations added in and then we'll come back all right I have all of my animations in here of my idle animation my walking down my walking right my walking left and my walking up animation looking good now we can hit play and we see absolutely nothing first off we see a tiny dot of a character and we don't have any sort of um movement or anything in here I hit the arrows oh okay so I have the arrow keys does some movement which is awesome but it doesn't switch the animations we're too far away and the camera doesn't actually move with my player so let's change a few of those things first let's add a behavior that is the scroll to behavior this Scrolls the camera to the player awesome now we're going to start writing some events so I'm going to go to my event sheet here and we're going to add in some of the events that we need so let's go ahead and add an event now the first thing that we want to fix is that that camera is is pretty far away from the player now if your camera is fine and you like the look of it then you can skip this first event my screen is just huge if we actually go back and look at my my layout here it is 4K it is massive so I'm going to zoom in a little bit to get that fixed but if you have this 720p you might not need to add this first event so I'm going to add a system event and I'm specifically looking for the start of the layout so as soon as the game loads as soon as the game starts I want to set something so on start of layout now I'm going to go ahead and add an action it is a system action here and it is going to set the layout scale so layout oops layout and then we can scroll down to set layout angle no ah set layout scale I'm going to set it from one I'm going to change that to three and hit done if your screen is a different size than mine you can change this number if you like the way your game looks like if I hit play here now I can see my player I can see that I can move and the camera oh no I can't I can't move anymore oh that's right the default controls are turned off okay let's add in that movement so first things first we need to if we're not pressing anything we snap back to the idle animation so add event keyboard on any key released this says as soon as we're not holding a key as soon as we're not touching a key do something well we're going to go into the player and set its animation and then end these double quotes is the exact language that we use in the name of the animation so it's called idle all are spelled exactly the same way that you have it spelled in your player when you add it in the animations and then hit done so now if we release a key we stop moving the player steps back to that idle animation now let's go ahead and add in when we hit the W key when we're moving up the screen W is in that up Arrow position so we're going to add event keyboard when a key is down when a certain key is down we're going to go ahead and do the W key that's the key that we're looking for done and then what are we going to do well we're going to simulate some movement because we don't have to actually add a force or anything like that because we already have that eight Direction Behavior we already have all of that code written for us we just need to kind of replace the up arrow with the w key so we can go into the player and we can in this eight direction we can simulate control and what control are we simulating we're simulating the up Arrow pressed done and this will do the same thing the up Arrow would have done if we were still using the default controls which were not because we're pro Gamers here we use real controls we're also going to add another action to change the animation so I can just search for animation I'm going to go ahead and set the animation and I'm going to in between these double quotes spell it the exact same way I spelled it when I was setting up the animation and it is set said to be walking up for me I capitalize the W and the U but make sure your capitalization is the same that you had when you set up that animation and hit done awesome so we have this now so now if I play my game and I hold down W I go up you can't see that I'm moving because this is all just one gigantic gray box but I am see we are going up the screen awesome this is looking great now I just have to get all of the other movement working so I'm going to take the same command I'm going to copy it I'm going to paste it and I am just going to change some things about it one of those things is this W key is not the key that I'm looking for I am now going to go with the S key because I'm going down and then I'm no longer simulating pressing up I'm simulating pressing down and I am no longer walking up in my animation I am walking down done okay so now the S key makes me go down you're going to do the same thing for all of your your movement directions go ahead and get all that in and you should have working movement if you have any questions let us know we would be happy to help you out
