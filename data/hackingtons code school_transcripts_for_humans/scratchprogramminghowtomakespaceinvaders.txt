00:00 - we're gonna be building space invaders
00:02 - well our kind of simple version of it
00:04 - because even though this video game was
00:06 - built in 1978 can you believe that it
00:09 - was phenomenal and watch watch this game
00:12 - it's so addicting you're the character
00:14 - it I died instantly come on I'm a master
00:18 - the shoe keys guys ah and those invaders
00:21 - are attacking you really have to protect
00:23 - your planet so are we gonna build this
00:25 - exactly No can you build it exactly
00:28 - perhaps let's see so what is our space
00:32 - invaders gonna look like it's gonna look
00:34 - like this well I use space tacos awesome
00:37 - check this out
00:38 - space invaders was one of my favourite
00:41 - games as a child and building it is a
00:44 - lot of fun because we can practice
00:46 - cloning what are we gonna clone
00:48 - everything we're gonna clone the
00:49 - missiles that shoot and the space
00:50 - invaders that are attacking lots and
00:52 - lots of cloning because there's lots and
00:54 - lots of sprites in this game so let's go
00:57 - ahead and start off by building our
00:59 - blaster cannon I don't know what the
01:01 - official name for it it is but I'm gonna
01:04 - draw it by using the paint and then you
01:06 - can't see right here I'm gonna choose
01:08 - this square selector and I'll point this
01:13 - out you see that little dot right in the
01:16 - middle that's not a smudge on the screen
01:18 - that's not a booger that is actually the
01:21 - center of the sprite so that's where the
01:23 - missiles are gonna come out of the
01:24 - blaster cannon so we need to be very
01:27 - careful to make that the top of our
01:29 - cannon so I'm gonna draw that and then
01:32 - under the next layer what am i drawing I
01:34 - don't know I'm just trying to recreate
01:36 - what I remember what space invaders the
01:38 - blaster cannon looks like and what's
01:41 - really fun is you can take this and you
01:43 - can select the whole thing and then you
01:45 - can change the gradient on it
01:47 - oh let's see is there anything cool that
01:51 - looks cool I like that I'm gonna go with
01:53 - that then I'm going to drag it down to
01:55 - the bottom where it's going to be and
01:57 - then I'm gonna change the backdrop
01:58 - because it's looks so boring and I know
02:01 - that this is gonna be space invaders so
02:03 - it needs to be in space space City these
02:06 - all look kind of distracting I'm just
02:07 - gonna go with straight up stars that
02:10 - looks pretty cool now let's go be
02:13 - careful we're in the backdrop right now
02:15 - so if we try to add code we'd actually
02:17 - be coding the backdrop and I know that
02:20 - because when I click on this code it
02:21 - says motion the stage is selected
02:23 - there's no motion backdrop mode no
02:26 - motion blocks so to fix that I'll go
02:28 - click on sprite 1 and now I have those
02:31 - motion blocks and the first motion block
02:33 - I want is this one that makes it kind of
02:36 - go to where I want it to start of course
02:38 - I need an event like a win the green
02:41 - flag is clicked so that it will go to
02:43 - that position at the beginning of the
02:46 - game isn't that nice
02:48 - now we need to give it that left-right
02:50 - movement can we do that yes we can
02:53 - okay do we want to do with the clunky
02:54 - way where it's like when the right arrow
02:57 - is clicked then move 10 steps to the
03:00 - right now I do not want that kind of
03:03 - movement in fact I want this game to be
03:06 - mobile friendly I want it to follow the
03:10 - mouse pointer Zechs so let's go in the
03:14 - motion and let's see if we can grab the
03:18 - oh we can only grab the exposition of
03:21 - this sprite I want to grab the x
03:24 - position of the mouse pointer that's
03:26 - actually in the sensing menu there it is
03:29 - mouse X beautiful this holds the value
03:33 - of wherever your mouse is so this value
03:37 - can change as the game is played well
03:40 - how do we use it we use it by going to
03:44 - motion and we find set X there we go
03:50 - so we're going to set the this sprites X
03:52 - to the same thing as the mouse X now
03:56 - this will actually not work and let not
03:59 - work correctly unless you constantly are
04:03 - changing it constantly changing
04:06 - constantly checking how do you
04:07 - constantly do anything
04:09 - well you wrap it in a forever loop watch
04:12 - this it's beautiful now it will follow
04:15 - my mouse pointer and it will also follow
04:18 - my finger on a tablet which is really
04:21 - nice for mobile friendly games so we
04:23 - have the game ready to play we just need
04:26 - to be able to
04:27 - so I want it so when I click the mouse
04:29 - pointer they goes beep you and it shoots
04:32 - a little missile thing okay so let's
04:34 - stop this game real quick and let's do
04:37 - let's start the next video on adding the
04:41 - missile
04:41 - so we have our cool blaster cannon when
04:44 - I click the green flag it follows the
04:46 - mouse
04:46 - well actually forever sets the
04:49 - exposition of this sprite to the mouse
04:52 - exposition so it will actually follow
04:54 - your finger which is really nice fun of
04:56 - me follow me ok so we are going to be
04:59 - adding the blaster cannon and we will
05:02 - paint a new sprite for this and just
05:06 - like when I drew the the the blaster the
05:10 - missiles let's see here we can do a
05:12 - round circle that seems a good idea we
05:14 - want to make it right in the center see
05:17 - this little dot right here will want the
05:19 - missiles to be right on that dot this is
05:21 - actually quite difficult oh my goodness
05:24 - if you make a mistake just click this
05:26 - back in time and I'm going to change the
05:29 - color of my missile to something more
05:31 - deadly something more vicious bright red
05:35 - that sounds good and there it is there
05:39 - it's right in the center this is the
05:42 - best I could and I'm going to go ahead
05:44 - and coat it now we're not gonna be
05:47 - coating the blaster cannon to shoot
05:50 - we're going to be coating well putting
05:53 - our code on the actual missile or the
05:56 - bullet or whatever you want to call it
05:57 - isn't that it kind of looks like a
05:59 - button nose we're shooting Rudolph the
06:01 - Red Nosed Reindeer balls that is weird
06:04 - so make sure we've clicked on the sprite
06:07 - that we're gonna be coding click on code
06:10 - and we'll say when the game starts the
06:13 - event we will make it hide why cuz I
06:16 - don't want to see it just right there I
06:18 - want it hidden so here we go hide it now
06:22 - anytime you use hide you're gonna want
06:24 - to use a show and vice versa
06:26 - so when are we going to show it when we
06:29 - press the spacebar
06:30 - we're not gonna use a spacebar in this
06:32 - game we're using the mouse clicker all
06:34 - right good so we don't have the event so
06:37 - here's the deal I'm going to teach you
06:39 - how to use the spacebar
06:41 - and then I'll teach you how to use the
06:43 - mouse clicker for the shooting the
06:44 - bullet the missile event so we'll want
06:48 - to go to events and we'll say when the
06:52 - spacebar is pressed to show and then
06:55 - we'll want it to go to sprite one all
06:59 - these sprite ones this and that let's
07:01 - call this sprite - let's call it missile
07:03 - and this called sprite one let's call it
07:06 - blaster cannon there you can name it
07:10 - anything you want it's just much easier
07:11 - to deal with okay and then we need to
07:14 - Ford to go to here it is go to not
07:17 - random position we want it to go to the
07:20 - blaster cannon let's see if that works
07:22 - press the spacebar it goes there oh it's
07:24 - the button nose into eyes meet that's a
07:27 - Christmas song and then after it goes
07:30 - there then we wanted to shoot all the
07:32 - way to the top so this is the fun part
07:36 - go to blaster cannon and then move where
07:39 - is the move it's gonna be going up so
07:42 - we're gonna be changing the y value
07:45 - change Y and we wanted to change the Y
07:49 - value until it hits the top so let's go
07:52 - to control right repeat until because we
07:58 - want to repeat until touching the top
08:00 - whoops I have to take this apart this is
08:02 - getting difficult I want the change Y to
08:05 - be inside the repeat until and now we
08:08 - need to put a condition in here that's
08:09 - going to be true or false okay so let's
08:12 - go to sensing they have this touching
08:16 - edge I think that will be our best idea
08:19 - so let's put this touching mouse pointer
08:22 - in here that has a drop down and it says
08:25 - touching edge I know they hide a lot of
08:28 - stuff in here
08:30 - right there till touching edge so this
08:33 - should work let's see I know it wasn't
08:35 - that simple
08:35 - boom boom pretty cool and you can adjust
08:39 - the speed by changing this number right
08:42 - here now when it hits hits the edge or
08:45 - touches the edge we want it to disappear
08:47 - so let's just go make it hide looks
08:51 - we'll need that hide right here so we'll
08:53 - put it at the bottom there boom works
08:57 - pretty well doesn't it
08:59 - I like this but you can't rapid fire
09:02 - that's a big problem
09:05 - welcome to cloning cloning allows you to
09:09 - duplicate sprites and the code
09:11 - associated with them rapidly like a
09:14 - rapid fire so this is kind of clunky
09:17 - instead of just shooting one let's have
09:23 - it clone go into control at the very
09:27 - bottom it says when I start as a clown
09:30 - and create clone of myself and delete
09:35 - this clone now I need a little more
09:38 - space for my coding so I'm gonna shrink
09:39 - the screen here and I'm gonna show you
09:41 - how all of these clone code blocks work
09:45 - you need all three of them if you use
09:47 - one you have to use all three so first
09:50 - of all when are you going to create a
09:52 - clone of yourself whenever the space bar
09:56 - is pressed so we just put that right
09:58 - here now the other big rule about clones
10:02 - is clones or clones only listen to clone
10:06 - code that sounded confusing
10:09 - basically this right here the clones
10:11 - don't listen to the start flag they only
10:14 - listen to when I start as a clone okay
10:18 - so if you don't have this when I start
10:19 - as a clone the clones will just stand
10:21 - there be like we're not listening to you
10:23 - so we'll attach this piece of code to
10:26 - that umm and then instead of hiding the
10:29 - clone at the end we'll need to delete
10:32 - them otherwise they will all pile up
10:35 - even though you don't see them they'll
10:36 - be at the top of the screen eventually
10:38 - you'll have so many clones that the
10:40 - computer will start to run out of memory
10:42 - and break down so we we make sure we
10:44 - delete the clones at some point now I
10:47 - think we have the proper code I'm gonna
10:50 - scroll this down so we can see how it
10:53 - looks and I'll make it fullscreen so you
10:55 - can see what it looks like now when look
10:59 - at that oh it froze why because we kinda
11:04 - I kind of spammed it when you spam click
11:08 - it tends to use up all the memory and
11:10 - freeze the computer so one little trick
11:13 - I've learned is to add oh wow
11:18 - it just unfroze if that happens to you
11:20 - let me show you how to fix that
11:22 - go ahead and add this wait one second
11:26 - right there and then that should allow
11:29 - you to shoot without having the computer
11:34 - freeze just a little hack I learned it's
11:38 - a lot of fun isn't it
11:39 - good luck adding your cloning blaster
11:42 - Kennan now I promised that I would show
11:45 - you how to make it work with the mouse
11:47 - down click that mouse click that Mouse
11:49 - ok so right now we're clicking the
11:52 - spacebar let's leave that one there just
11:54 - in case they want to use the spacebar
11:56 - but we need to let's shrink this up
11:58 - right here we need to have that mouse
12:00 - down event there isn't a mouse down
12:04 - event go ahead look in the events you'll
12:06 - never find one see this spacebar you can
12:08 - get all the keys on the keyboard that
12:11 - you want but you can't get the mouse
12:13 - down mouse down is actually in the
12:16 - sensing menu right here and mouse down
12:20 - is exactly the same as touching the
12:22 - screen on a tablet so it's really useful
12:25 - I wish scratch would have just put it as
12:27 - an event you have to create your own
12:29 - event so go into control and say if if
12:34 - Mouse down something will happen
12:37 - well we want it to do this we want to
12:40 - create clone of myself right there and
12:44 - we'll need to wrap this in a forever
12:46 - loop there we go and we'll need to say
12:51 - when the games actually look at this
12:53 - this code right here we can actually
12:55 - attach it it's not doing anything other
12:57 - than just hiding so we can say if mouse
12:59 - down create clone of myself
13:02 - oh there's one second between them ok so
13:06 - obviously we didn't need this little
13:09 - hack right here let's see if it works
13:12 - don't throw at all the big moment of
13:14 - truth it works it works really well oh
13:17 - it's freezing
13:18 - up a little bit I wonder if we put the
13:21 - weight zero seconds right here if that
13:24 - would work you'll have to kind of fiddle
13:26 - with that wow this is so cool I'm having
13:31 - a lot of fun with this let me just show
13:33 - you the code right here in the final
13:34 - screenshot so you can get an idea for
13:36 - what I built there it is beautiful Space
13:41 - Invaders falling from the sky where
13:43 - let's blast them but we haven't actually
13:45 - added any invaders yet to our game so
13:48 - let's do that right now go ahead and add
13:50 - a new sprite and you can choose anything
13:52 - you want yes even tacos that's my thing
13:56 - not yours do your own thing so taht
13:59 - actually is just under taco so I'm gonna
14:01 - add my taco I'm gonna immediately do
14:03 - something that's terrible make a tacos
14:05 - smaller never make a taco smaller okay
14:07 - so that taco is gonna start at the top
14:09 - and it's gonna fall to the bottom
14:11 - attacking me okay so let's let's go
14:14 - ahead and add that code let's say in the
14:17 - events we want to go to the top so we'll
14:20 - grab the motion and we'll say go to here
14:24 - we go that let's see in the middle so
14:26 - the exposition will be 0 right in the
14:28 - middle and the y position will be 180
14:31 - which is the very very top and of course
14:34 - you remember that the very bottom is
14:36 - negative 180 don't you you remember that
14:38 - so I'll try that watch this he'll put it
14:40 - right at the bottom cool so basically we
14:42 - wanted to go from 180 down to negative
14:45 - 180 did you follow that
14:47 - that was pretty confusing so what we'll
14:49 - use is the repeat until because the
14:52 - repeat until is like a forever loop it
14:54 - goes forever but until a condition is
14:57 - met once this condition is met whatever
15:00 - it is it will stop the loop so let's
15:03 - have that condition be whenever the taco
15:07 - reaches a point that is lower than
15:11 - negative 180 so less than so that's a
15:15 - lot of words how did you get so smart
15:17 - mister Matt well I went to school let's
15:20 - use the less than so we're gonna go less
15:22 - than negative 180 and that's in the
15:25 - operators menu and what is gonna be less
15:28 - than 180 the Y position
15:32 - this is a little tricky go in the motion
15:34 - blocks make sure you have the taco
15:36 - selected or whatever your bad guy is
15:38 - scroll to the bottom and you'll see
15:40 - something that says the Y position this
15:43 - actually if you check the box you can
15:45 - see that it holds the value of the Y
15:48 - position of your sprite and it will
15:51 - change depending on where the sprite is
15:54 - so it's a perfect it's kind of like a
15:57 - variable to use for this conditional
16:01 - this conditional will fit right in here
16:04 - and now it's going to check it's going
16:06 - to repeat this loop until the Y position
16:08 - is less than 180 which means the taco is
16:12 - below the bottom of the screen now what
16:14 - is it going to do its we want the taco
16:17 - to be falling so we're going to be
16:20 - changing the Y let's see that's gonna be
16:24 - in motion we're going to change Y where
16:29 - is change Y change Y by law as fast as
16:33 - you want it to fall if we do negative
16:34 - five it will fall fairly quickly there
16:38 - now it's gonna fall till it hits the
16:40 - bottom and then it will stop so we need
16:43 - to wrap this entire piece of code in a
16:46 - forever loop there we go now it will do
16:51 - that sequence over and over again
16:54 - easy-peasy
16:56 - we can beat this game just by staying
16:58 - right here so we need the the taco to
17:01 - actually start in a random position on
17:04 - the x axis the X being the left and
17:07 - right okay so we'll go and grab that
17:10 - random number maker in the operators and
17:13 - we'll replace this go to X position with
17:18 - negative 240 which is the farthest to
17:21 - the left you can go to positive 240
17:26 - which is the farthest you can go to the
17:28 - right and that should let's just hit the
17:30 - start flag that should start it at a
17:32 - random location now I don't need this to
17:35 - be showing anymore
17:36 - so how do we get rid of it go back into
17:39 - oh that's in the motion section scroll
17:42 - to the bottom and then
17:43 - check that it's just kind of you can you
17:45 - can use these to verify where your
17:48 - sprites are it's a pretty handy really
17:50 - advanced technique okay it looks like it
17:53 - is falling in a random position that's
17:56 - great but it's just one at a time I
17:59 - thought you said we were gonna clone
18:01 - these yes we are let's get to cloning
18:03 - now our games pretty simple right now
18:07 - there's just one bad guy that falls in a
18:10 - random location and I promised you that
18:12 - I would show you how to clone the bad
18:14 - guy so there's a whole bunch of bad guys
18:16 - you can shoot at so let's do that first
18:19 - of all go in the control menu that's
18:22 - where your cloning code is at the very
18:24 - bottom there are three important
18:26 - elements three you when I start as a
18:29 - clone create clone and delete this clone
18:33 - you have to use all three of them every
18:37 - time you're dealing with clones okay so
18:39 - here is the code that makes the taco
18:42 - fall what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
18:44 - disconnect this forever loop and I'm
18:47 - gonna use this starting flag to create a
18:51 - clone of myself then I'm gonna use the
18:54 - when I start as a clone to give
18:57 - directions to these clones that I'm
19:00 - making and I won't need the forever loop
19:02 - because each time a clone falls from the
19:05 - sky and hits the bottom it's going to
19:08 - delete itself and you'll see a new one
19:11 - up here up here so I'm gonna go ahead
19:13 - and put this delete this clone at the
19:16 - very bottom here there I think I've used
19:19 - everything when the game starts create a
19:22 - clone of myself when I start as a clone
19:24 - then I will do this code and once I've
19:27 - completed the code I delete myself so
19:29 - let's see if it does at one time
19:32 - perfect now if you want this whole
19:35 - sequence to repeat put the forever loop
19:37 - around create a clone of myself but be
19:41 - careful hold on to your computer watch
19:44 - this it's raining tacos yes the reason
19:50 - why it's doing that is it's creating
19:52 - clones as fast as it possibly can and
19:54 - computers are actually running
19:57 - forever loops very very quickly as
20:00 - you've noticed right here so I'll need
20:02 - to slow this down with my favorite piece
20:04 - of code in actually it's in the control
20:07 - menu the wait block right here depending
20:10 - on how many clones you want you'll need
20:13 - to slow down this create clones there
20:17 - you go now they're falling from the sky
20:19 - but there is a big problem this one what
20:23 - why is this one this taco just sitting
20:26 - right there well when you create clones
20:28 - they'll always be one sprite that isn't
20:31 - a clone it's kind of like the mommy or
20:33 - daddy clone it's like okay children go
20:37 - ahead and listen to the clone code but
20:39 - I'm not a clone
20:40 - so what I typically do with this one is
20:43 - I hide it just go in the looks menu and
20:48 - grab that hide and show those are kind
20:50 - of partners as well you always use a
20:52 - hide and a show together so I'll say
20:55 - when the game starts hide that one and
20:58 - then when the clones are created go
21:02 - ahead and show them I'm gonna I'm gonna
21:06 - zoom in a little bit so you can see that
21:08 - but now it will work perfectly in the
21:12 - next video I'll show you how to shoot
21:14 - these because right now they're not
21:15 - going to react to the bullets and
21:17 - there's also not a game over screen
21:19 - there's all sorts of stuff we need to
21:20 - add I'll see you the next one our video
21:23 - game is starting to look really cool but
21:26 - you can't shoot the bad guys and those
21:28 - tacos are really attacking your planet
21:31 - or whatever they're invading from space
21:33 - so let's add some code that says that
21:37 - when the missile touches the tacos that
21:39 - taco deletes itself and you get a point
21:43 - so where do we want to put this code on
21:45 - the missile probably not we'll want to
21:48 - put it on the actual invader that's
21:50 - invading because we want it to delete
21:53 - itself when the missile touches it so
21:55 - this is going to be another when I start
21:59 - as a clone event so we'll need to go
22:02 - into the control menu down at the bottom
22:05 - and say when I start as a clone you can
22:08 - have more than one events when I start
22:10 - as a
22:11 - clone that's okay when I start as a
22:13 - clone I'm going to pretty much wait
22:16 - until the missile touches me now the
22:18 - missile can only touch you one time so
22:21 - we'll use a wait until rather than an
22:23 - if-statement because remember if you use
22:25 - an if block you'll have to wrap it in a
22:27 - forever loop that's kind of a mess for
22:30 - something that's only going to happen
22:31 - one time the wait until is a beautiful
22:34 - thing so we're gonna wait until it's
22:36 - touching the missile so we'll go to
22:38 - sensing wait until touching missile and
22:44 - when that happens we'll want the score
22:47 - to go up and we'll want the the taco to
22:52 - delete itself so two things let's go
22:54 - make a variable that's going to be the
22:56 - score the points I'm gonna say score
23:00 - there we go
23:01 - and now we have access to what we want
23:04 - to increase the score so we'll change
23:06 - the score by one I'm gonna zoom the sin
23:10 - so you can see when I start as a clone
23:13 - wait until touching missile change the
23:15 - score by one and then delete this clone
23:19 - so that's in the control menu you'll see
23:21 - at the bottom delete this clone there
23:25 - let's see if that works can I shoot it
23:28 - boom yes I can now how do you how does
23:32 - the game end well anytime a taco touches
23:37 - the the blaster cannon that's the signal
23:40 - for game over let's go ahead and add
23:42 - that code to the blaster cannon why well
23:46 - I feel that there's a lot of code in the
23:48 - taco and I really want the blaster
23:51 - cannon to have the ability to say hey
23:54 - game over game started game whatever so
23:58 - let's add it to the blaster cannon let's
24:00 - say this if it touches well if it
24:04 - touches any of the tacos then it dies
24:06 - well then we can use a wait until there
24:09 - we go wait until touching taco and then
24:17 - game over
24:18 - this is kind of an interesting idea I'm
24:21 - waiting till a taco touches the blaster
24:24 - Kanon does it matter which taco because
24:27 - there's like a million clones it doesn't
24:30 - actually matter this touching taco will
24:33 - work for any of the clones because right
24:35 - now I'm using I'm coding for the blaster
24:38 - cannon wait until touching taco and then
24:41 - it's going to be game over let's
24:44 - actually let's send it since this is a
24:46 - blue belt pretty advanced lesson let's
24:49 - use messaging so right here
24:51 - will broadcast the message game over
24:55 - new message game over there and then
25:00 - after I brought broadcast the message
25:02 - game over let's go and have him blow up
25:06 - what blow up that's awesome how do you
25:10 - do that it's a little trick I'll show
25:12 - you go into the costumes and go ahead
25:15 - and duplicate it a couple times there we
25:18 - go now these are going to be the
25:20 - explosions all you have to do is grab
25:23 - these circles and then you're gonna like
25:25 - paint them the color red or gray or
25:28 - whatever and just draw circles on top
25:31 - like this and now draw a couple more
25:34 - that are grey this isn't very great
25:37 - that's very gray there you go bum bum
25:41 - okay then I'm gonna paint this one too
25:43 - even be worse bum bum bum I love
25:49 - creating explosions okay then this one
25:52 - is gonna be like that so now it just
25:54 - looks like that doesn't that look like
25:56 - an explosion okay here you are normal
25:58 - and then boom you're gone so let's go
26:01 - back to the code say wait until touching
26:04 - taco we're gonna broadcast game over and
26:07 - then we're gonna do this cool switch of
26:10 - costumes so go into the looks and we'll
26:13 - say Oh where's this switch costume right
26:15 - here switch costume to cost um not
26:18 - costume one we'll go costume to
26:20 - duplicate it costume three there and
26:25 - then put a little bit of time in between
26:27 - them using the control whoops they're
26:30 - using that control wait so we'll use
26:32 - like a point three seconds in between
26:35 - them the only thing you have to remember
26:36 - is you'll need to
26:38 - to costume one when the game starts so
26:41 - we're kind of there we go when the game
26:43 - starts costume one if it touches that
26:47 - then it goes into this explosion mode
26:49 - and after it switches to that final one
26:53 - you'll want it to actually hide boy I'm
26:56 - getting really complex but it's gonna
26:57 - look really cool in the end here we go
26:59 - so we'll we'll switch it to that costume
27:01 - we'll have it wait
27:03 - point three more seconds before it
27:07 - actually hides point three there it is
27:11 - and we'll need it to show at the very
27:14 - beginning of the game so since we use
27:16 - the hide now we need to use the show boy
27:20 - that's a lot of code right there just to
27:22 - create that cool ending here it is touch
27:25 - boom and it's over that's pretty cool
27:29 - now the final thing is we need a game
27:32 - over like the words game over so let's
27:35 - paint a new sprite well I'm not going to
27:37 - use a backdrop because I still want the
27:39 - stars in the backdrop ooh I'm not gonna
27:41 - choose a sprite I'm going to paint a
27:43 - sprite here it is and I'll just say the
27:45 - words game over and I'll want them to be
27:49 - in the life something that's really
27:51 - visible on here so I'll probably want
27:53 - like white there it is oops I didn't
27:57 - make it quite big enough so I'll use the
27:59 - selector there there we go there put it
28:03 - right in the middle that looks really
28:05 - nice now the code is very simple for
28:07 - this it's just when the game starts hit
28:11 - hide itself hide there we go hide and
28:15 - then of course I need the show as well
28:17 - and when are we gonna show it when we
28:19 - receive that special event that we made
28:21 - called game over when I receive game
28:24 - over show here we go there it is let's
28:27 - just shoot one just to make sure it
28:29 - works and then let's let one hit us and
28:32 - it's game over and we blew up when we
28:36 - restart the game it works it's really
28:40 - cool I like it a lot

Cleaned transcript:

we're gonna be building space invaders well our kind of simple version of it because even though this video game was built in 1978 can you believe that it was phenomenal and watch watch this game it's so addicting you're the character it I died instantly come on I'm a master the shoe keys guys ah and those invaders are attacking you really have to protect your planet so are we gonna build this exactly No can you build it exactly perhaps let's see so what is our space invaders gonna look like it's gonna look like this well I use space tacos awesome check this out space invaders was one of my favourite games as a child and building it is a lot of fun because we can practice cloning what are we gonna clone everything we're gonna clone the missiles that shoot and the space invaders that are attacking lots and lots of cloning because there's lots and lots of sprites in this game so let's go ahead and start off by building our blaster cannon I don't know what the official name for it it is but I'm gonna draw it by using the paint and then you can't see right here I'm gonna choose this square selector and I'll point this out you see that little dot right in the middle that's not a smudge on the screen that's not a booger that is actually the center of the sprite so that's where the missiles are gonna come out of the blaster cannon so we need to be very careful to make that the top of our cannon so I'm gonna draw that and then under the next layer what am i drawing I don't know I'm just trying to recreate what I remember what space invaders the blaster cannon looks like and what's really fun is you can take this and you can select the whole thing and then you can change the gradient on it oh let's see is there anything cool that looks cool I like that I'm gonna go with that then I'm going to drag it down to the bottom where it's going to be and then I'm gonna change the backdrop because it's looks so boring and I know that this is gonna be space invaders so it needs to be in space space City these all look kind of distracting I'm just gonna go with straight up stars that looks pretty cool now let's go be careful we're in the backdrop right now so if we try to add code we'd actually be coding the backdrop and I know that because when I click on this code it says motion the stage is selected there's no motion backdrop mode no motion blocks so to fix that I'll go click on sprite 1 and now I have those motion blocks and the first motion block I want is this one that makes it kind of go to where I want it to start of course I need an event like a win the green flag is clicked so that it will go to that position at the beginning of the game isn't that nice now we need to give it that leftright movement can we do that yes we can okay do we want to do with the clunky way where it's like when the right arrow is clicked then move 10 steps to the right now I do not want that kind of movement in fact I want this game to be mobile friendly I want it to follow the mouse pointer Zechs so let's go in the motion and let's see if we can grab the oh we can only grab the exposition of this sprite I want to grab the x position of the mouse pointer that's actually in the sensing menu there it is mouse X beautiful this holds the value of wherever your mouse is so this value can change as the game is played well how do we use it we use it by going to motion and we find set X there we go so we're going to set the this sprites X to the same thing as the mouse X now this will actually not work and let not work correctly unless you constantly are changing it constantly changing constantly checking how do you constantly do anything well you wrap it in a forever loop watch this it's beautiful now it will follow my mouse pointer and it will also follow my finger on a tablet which is really nice for mobile friendly games so we have the game ready to play we just need to be able to so I want it so when I click the mouse pointer they goes beep you and it shoots a little missile thing okay so let's stop this game real quick and let's do let's start the next video on adding the missile so we have our cool blaster cannon when I click the green flag it follows the mouse well actually forever sets the exposition of this sprite to the mouse exposition so it will actually follow your finger which is really nice fun of me follow me ok so we are going to be adding the blaster cannon and we will paint a new sprite for this and just like when I drew the the the blaster the missiles let's see here we can do a round circle that seems a good idea we want to make it right in the center see this little dot right here will want the missiles to be right on that dot this is actually quite difficult oh my goodness if you make a mistake just click this back in time and I'm going to change the color of my missile to something more deadly something more vicious bright red that sounds good and there it is there it's right in the center this is the best I could and I'm going to go ahead and coat it now we're not gonna be coating the blaster cannon to shoot we're going to be coating well putting our code on the actual missile or the bullet or whatever you want to call it isn't that it kind of looks like a button nose we're shooting Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer balls that is weird so make sure we've clicked on the sprite that we're gonna be coding click on code and we'll say when the game starts the event we will make it hide why cuz I don't want to see it just right there I want it hidden so here we go hide it now anytime you use hide you're gonna want to use a show and vice versa so when are we going to show it when we press the spacebar we're not gonna use a spacebar in this game we're using the mouse clicker all right good so we don't have the event so here's the deal I'm going to teach you how to use the spacebar and then I'll teach you how to use the mouse clicker for the shooting the bullet the missile event so we'll want to go to events and we'll say when the spacebar is pressed to show and then we'll want it to go to sprite one all these sprite ones this and that let's call this sprite let's call it missile and this called sprite one let's call it blaster cannon there you can name it anything you want it's just much easier to deal with okay and then we need to Ford to go to here it is go to not random position we want it to go to the blaster cannon let's see if that works press the spacebar it goes there oh it's the button nose into eyes meet that's a Christmas song and then after it goes there then we wanted to shoot all the way to the top so this is the fun part go to blaster cannon and then move where is the move it's gonna be going up so we're gonna be changing the y value change Y and we wanted to change the Y value until it hits the top so let's go to control right repeat until because we want to repeat until touching the top whoops I have to take this apart this is getting difficult I want the change Y to be inside the repeat until and now we need to put a condition in here that's going to be true or false okay so let's go to sensing they have this touching edge I think that will be our best idea so let's put this touching mouse pointer in here that has a drop down and it says touching edge I know they hide a lot of stuff in here right there till touching edge so this should work let's see I know it wasn't that simple boom boom pretty cool and you can adjust the speed by changing this number right here now when it hits hits the edge or touches the edge we want it to disappear so let's just go make it hide looks we'll need that hide right here so we'll put it at the bottom there boom works pretty well doesn't it I like this but you can't rapid fire that's a big problem welcome to cloning cloning allows you to duplicate sprites and the code associated with them rapidly like a rapid fire so this is kind of clunky instead of just shooting one let's have it clone go into control at the very bottom it says when I start as a clown and create clone of myself and delete this clone now I need a little more space for my coding so I'm gonna shrink the screen here and I'm gonna show you how all of these clone code blocks work you need all three of them if you use one you have to use all three so first of all when are you going to create a clone of yourself whenever the space bar is pressed so we just put that right here now the other big rule about clones is clones or clones only listen to clone code that sounded confusing basically this right here the clones don't listen to the start flag they only listen to when I start as a clone okay so if you don't have this when I start as a clone the clones will just stand there be like we're not listening to you so we'll attach this piece of code to that umm and then instead of hiding the clone at the end we'll need to delete them otherwise they will all pile up even though you don't see them they'll be at the top of the screen eventually you'll have so many clones that the computer will start to run out of memory and break down so we we make sure we delete the clones at some point now I think we have the proper code I'm gonna scroll this down so we can see how it looks and I'll make it fullscreen so you can see what it looks like now when look at that oh it froze why because we kinda I kind of spammed it when you spam click it tends to use up all the memory and freeze the computer so one little trick I've learned is to add oh wow it just unfroze if that happens to you let me show you how to fix that go ahead and add this wait one second right there and then that should allow you to shoot without having the computer freeze just a little hack I learned it's a lot of fun isn't it good luck adding your cloning blaster Kennan now I promised that I would show you how to make it work with the mouse down click that mouse click that Mouse ok so right now we're clicking the spacebar let's leave that one there just in case they want to use the spacebar but we need to let's shrink this up right here we need to have that mouse down event there isn't a mouse down event go ahead look in the events you'll never find one see this spacebar you can get all the keys on the keyboard that you want but you can't get the mouse down mouse down is actually in the sensing menu right here and mouse down is exactly the same as touching the screen on a tablet so it's really useful I wish scratch would have just put it as an event you have to create your own event so go into control and say if if Mouse down something will happen well we want it to do this we want to create clone of myself right there and we'll need to wrap this in a forever loop there we go and we'll need to say when the games actually look at this this code right here we can actually attach it it's not doing anything other than just hiding so we can say if mouse down create clone of myself oh there's one second between them ok so obviously we didn't need this little hack right here let's see if it works don't throw at all the big moment of truth it works it works really well oh it's freezing up a little bit I wonder if we put the weight zero seconds right here if that would work you'll have to kind of fiddle with that wow this is so cool I'm having a lot of fun with this let me just show you the code right here in the final screenshot so you can get an idea for what I built there it is beautiful Space Invaders falling from the sky where let's blast them but we haven't actually added any invaders yet to our game so let's do that right now go ahead and add a new sprite and you can choose anything you want yes even tacos that's my thing not yours do your own thing so taht actually is just under taco so I'm gonna add my taco I'm gonna immediately do something that's terrible make a tacos smaller never make a taco smaller okay so that taco is gonna start at the top and it's gonna fall to the bottom attacking me okay so let's let's go ahead and add that code let's say in the events we want to go to the top so we'll grab the motion and we'll say go to here we go that let's see in the middle so the exposition will be 0 right in the middle and the y position will be 180 which is the very very top and of course you remember that the very bottom is negative 180 don't you you remember that so I'll try that watch this he'll put it right at the bottom cool so basically we wanted to go from 180 down to negative 180 did you follow that that was pretty confusing so what we'll use is the repeat until because the repeat until is like a forever loop it goes forever but until a condition is met once this condition is met whatever it is it will stop the loop so let's have that condition be whenever the taco reaches a point that is lower than negative 180 so less than so that's a lot of words how did you get so smart mister Matt well I went to school let's use the less than so we're gonna go less than negative 180 and that's in the operators menu and what is gonna be less than 180 the Y position this is a little tricky go in the motion blocks make sure you have the taco selected or whatever your bad guy is scroll to the bottom and you'll see something that says the Y position this actually if you check the box you can see that it holds the value of the Y position of your sprite and it will change depending on where the sprite is so it's a perfect it's kind of like a variable to use for this conditional this conditional will fit right in here and now it's going to check it's going to repeat this loop until the Y position is less than 180 which means the taco is below the bottom of the screen now what is it going to do its we want the taco to be falling so we're going to be changing the Y let's see that's gonna be in motion we're going to change Y where is change Y change Y by law as fast as you want it to fall if we do negative five it will fall fairly quickly there now it's gonna fall till it hits the bottom and then it will stop so we need to wrap this entire piece of code in a forever loop there we go now it will do that sequence over and over again easypeasy we can beat this game just by staying right here so we need the the taco to actually start in a random position on the x axis the X being the left and right okay so we'll go and grab that random number maker in the operators and we'll replace this go to X position with negative 240 which is the farthest to the left you can go to positive 240 which is the farthest you can go to the right and that should let's just hit the start flag that should start it at a random location now I don't need this to be showing anymore so how do we get rid of it go back into oh that's in the motion section scroll to the bottom and then check that it's just kind of you can you can use these to verify where your sprites are it's a pretty handy really advanced technique okay it looks like it is falling in a random position that's great but it's just one at a time I thought you said we were gonna clone these yes we are let's get to cloning now our games pretty simple right now there's just one bad guy that falls in a random location and I promised you that I would show you how to clone the bad guy so there's a whole bunch of bad guys you can shoot at so let's do that first of all go in the control menu that's where your cloning code is at the very bottom there are three important elements three you when I start as a clone create clone and delete this clone you have to use all three of them every time you're dealing with clones okay so here is the code that makes the taco fall what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna disconnect this forever loop and I'm gonna use this starting flag to create a clone of myself then I'm gonna use the when I start as a clone to give directions to these clones that I'm making and I won't need the forever loop because each time a clone falls from the sky and hits the bottom it's going to delete itself and you'll see a new one up here up here so I'm gonna go ahead and put this delete this clone at the very bottom here there I think I've used everything when the game starts create a clone of myself when I start as a clone then I will do this code and once I've completed the code I delete myself so let's see if it does at one time perfect now if you want this whole sequence to repeat put the forever loop around create a clone of myself but be careful hold on to your computer watch this it's raining tacos yes the reason why it's doing that is it's creating clones as fast as it possibly can and computers are actually running forever loops very very quickly as you've noticed right here so I'll need to slow this down with my favorite piece of code in actually it's in the control menu the wait block right here depending on how many clones you want you'll need to slow down this create clones there you go now they're falling from the sky but there is a big problem this one what why is this one this taco just sitting right there well when you create clones they'll always be one sprite that isn't a clone it's kind of like the mommy or daddy clone it's like okay children go ahead and listen to the clone code but I'm not a clone so what I typically do with this one is I hide it just go in the looks menu and grab that hide and show those are kind of partners as well you always use a hide and a show together so I'll say when the game starts hide that one and then when the clones are created go ahead and show them I'm gonna I'm gonna zoom in a little bit so you can see that but now it will work perfectly in the next video I'll show you how to shoot these because right now they're not going to react to the bullets and there's also not a game over screen there's all sorts of stuff we need to add I'll see you the next one our video game is starting to look really cool but you can't shoot the bad guys and those tacos are really attacking your planet or whatever they're invading from space so let's add some code that says that when the missile touches the tacos that taco deletes itself and you get a point so where do we want to put this code on the missile probably not we'll want to put it on the actual invader that's invading because we want it to delete itself when the missile touches it so this is going to be another when I start as a clone event so we'll need to go into the control menu down at the bottom and say when I start as a clone you can have more than one events when I start as a clone that's okay when I start as a clone I'm going to pretty much wait until the missile touches me now the missile can only touch you one time so we'll use a wait until rather than an ifstatement because remember if you use an if block you'll have to wrap it in a forever loop that's kind of a mess for something that's only going to happen one time the wait until is a beautiful thing so we're gonna wait until it's touching the missile so we'll go to sensing wait until touching missile and when that happens we'll want the score to go up and we'll want the the taco to delete itself so two things let's go make a variable that's going to be the score the points I'm gonna say score there we go and now we have access to what we want to increase the score so we'll change the score by one I'm gonna zoom the sin so you can see when I start as a clone wait until touching missile change the score by one and then delete this clone so that's in the control menu you'll see at the bottom delete this clone there let's see if that works can I shoot it boom yes I can now how do you how does the game end well anytime a taco touches the the blaster cannon that's the signal for game over let's go ahead and add that code to the blaster cannon why well I feel that there's a lot of code in the taco and I really want the blaster cannon to have the ability to say hey game over game started game whatever so let's add it to the blaster cannon let's say this if it touches well if it touches any of the tacos then it dies well then we can use a wait until there we go wait until touching taco and then game over this is kind of an interesting idea I'm waiting till a taco touches the blaster Kanon does it matter which taco because there's like a million clones it doesn't actually matter this touching taco will work for any of the clones because right now I'm using I'm coding for the blaster cannon wait until touching taco and then it's going to be game over let's actually let's send it since this is a blue belt pretty advanced lesson let's use messaging so right here will broadcast the message game over new message game over there and then after I brought broadcast the message game over let's go and have him blow up what blow up that's awesome how do you do that it's a little trick I'll show you go into the costumes and go ahead and duplicate it a couple times there we go now these are going to be the explosions all you have to do is grab these circles and then you're gonna like paint them the color red or gray or whatever and just draw circles on top like this and now draw a couple more that are grey this isn't very great that's very gray there you go bum bum okay then I'm gonna paint this one too even be worse bum bum bum I love creating explosions okay then this one is gonna be like that so now it just looks like that doesn't that look like an explosion okay here you are normal and then boom you're gone so let's go back to the code say wait until touching taco we're gonna broadcast game over and then we're gonna do this cool switch of costumes so go into the looks and we'll say Oh where's this switch costume right here switch costume to cost um not costume one we'll go costume to duplicate it costume three there and then put a little bit of time in between them using the control whoops they're using that control wait so we'll use like a point three seconds in between them the only thing you have to remember is you'll need to to costume one when the game starts so we're kind of there we go when the game starts costume one if it touches that then it goes into this explosion mode and after it switches to that final one you'll want it to actually hide boy I'm getting really complex but it's gonna look really cool in the end here we go so we'll we'll switch it to that costume we'll have it wait point three more seconds before it actually hides point three there it is and we'll need it to show at the very beginning of the game so since we use the hide now we need to use the show boy that's a lot of code right there just to create that cool ending here it is touch boom and it's over that's pretty cool now the final thing is we need a game over like the words game over so let's paint a new sprite well I'm not going to use a backdrop because I still want the stars in the backdrop ooh I'm not gonna choose a sprite I'm going to paint a sprite here it is and I'll just say the words game over and I'll want them to be in the life something that's really visible on here so I'll probably want like white there it is oops I didn't make it quite big enough so I'll use the selector there there we go there put it right in the middle that looks really nice now the code is very simple for this it's just when the game starts hit hide itself hide there we go hide and then of course I need the show as well and when are we gonna show it when we receive that special event that we made called game over when I receive game over show here we go there it is let's just shoot one just to make sure it works and then let's let one hit us and it's game over and we blew up when we restart the game it works it's really cool I like it a lot
