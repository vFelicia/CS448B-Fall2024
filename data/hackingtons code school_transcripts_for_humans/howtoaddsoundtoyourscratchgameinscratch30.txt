00:00 - if you're building a scratch game you
00:01 - have to have sound no question games
00:04 - must have sound now in the scratch you
00:07 - can choose either play sound until done
00:10 - or start sound and if you click on them
00:14 - they do the same thing
00:17 - well they do the same thing but they
00:20 - take different amounts of time for those
00:22 - things to occur why does that matter
00:25 - we'll check this out let's say in a game
00:29 - you have a cat and you're gonna click on
00:31 - the cat okay that sounds pretty easy
00:34 - let's say this when the sprite is
00:36 - clicked we're gonna start the C out
00:39 - sound meow and then we're gonna change a
00:42 - variable which I've already made called
00:43 - sound finished we're gonna change it by
00:46 - 1 now this is the variable right here
00:49 - watch what happens when I click on the
00:51 - cat well it said meow but the counter
00:56 - went up immediately right when I clicked
01:01 - so what happens when you have start meow
01:04 - is it doesn't stop to run the code it
01:07 - just plays the meow sound and keeps
01:09 - going as fast as it can which is
01:11 - different from the play sound until done
01:14 - let me show you how that one works I'll
01:17 - take this one off and I'll say play
01:19 - sound until done now you'll hear a pause
01:23 - before the counter goes up I'll put the
01:25 - counter right next to it now it might
01:29 - not be a big deal in this game but in
01:32 - your code it might not work correctly
01:35 - because it might be waiting until the
01:37 - sound is done before something else
01:40 - happens perhaps you might have like a go
01:43 - to random position here now you'll
01:46 - really see the delay when I click the
01:49 - cat I have to wait until the sound is
01:52 - done now if I had the just start sound
01:55 - instead of the play sound till done
01:59 - there now you'll see it happen almost
02:04 - which one is better it just depends what
02:08 - you need for your game
