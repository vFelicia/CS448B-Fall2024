joining me in this saturday noon time afternoon time i really appreciate you all coming so my name is wen i'm currently a rising senior studying computer science at the university of washington seattle um and i have been doing a couple of internships throughout my college times uh right now i'm currently a software engineering intern at cloudflare doing a remote internship because of covet and last summer i've been a ux engineering intern at microsoft and someone before i was a new technologist participant and after graduating from high school i also was a high school intern at autodesk as a software engineering intern and i can i'm pretty happy to like go a little bit deeper into each of these experience uh when we get to our question later um and other than my internship positions i'm also currently a head teaching assistant for one of the data programming classes at my school and i'm also rewriting the code fellow which is like a college women community in tech but yeah that's basically about me and i'm happy to answer questions yeah thank you so much and thank you for being here today um we'll get started on our first question which is what inspired you to pursue computer science yeah this is a good question so um just a little bit more background about me so i moved i actually moved uh here to the us from china five years ago with my parents so before i move here i actually have zero exposure to programming so um and then like i just have a free summer after i move because like in china there's a lot of homework so i don't really have free time to kind of explore what i want to do so i have a free summer after i move and then i started playing a lot of video games and i started watching a video on how video games are made and then it just really fascinates me on how like the programmers actually like encode all those logic into like video games uh with coding so um that just like kind of intrigued my interest in like coding in general and after i started high school here i also got involved in the first robotic competition and joined the programming team in the robotics team high school the first the moment that i really feel like uh cs is something that excites me is when i wrote a for loop that actually makes like fancy led patterns because for me it is like the first time that i actually see the power of how like you can make real things happen with code um and then after that i just uh do a lot of like digging around and exploring a lot of resources and kind of learn uh programming in my own time i also took an intro to programming class when i was doing a high school summer college program at stanford and that kind of gives me a little bit more theoretical background and actually learned how to think like a programmer and later i just like get a lot more involved into like my programming team um during my senior year of high school and i really enjoy the pro problem solving process and also finding out what's broken um and that kind of gives me a really solid idea of like i want to pursue a cs major in college yeah that's basically a story wow that's really interesting um could i actually ask you um which game really inspired you to start coding and like what language you started off with from your yeah so the game um that kind of intrigues me is actually assassin's creed uh maybe some of you know the series but i'm really a big fan of like the earlier assassin's creed series um and then i played them a lot but then when i actually started coding video games is i i actually took a video games programming class at my high school and the tool they use is called digipen so it's more like a drag and drop where you can feel like the interface but you can also integrate really simple code and i'm not sure what the language is i'm not thinking about it but after that i also tried to code video games in unity which is a game engine where you can use like csharp with as a language to build video games and it's a really cool engine too okay thank you so much um we'll be moving to our second question now um which is oops do you have any advice for aspiring students in the tech field yeah i guess my biggest advice is definitely do what excites you like for me uh what gets me excited about computer science the first place is video games so even though right now i am shifting more towards like web development and app development just uh like try to figure out what's the best how to create like the best experience for my users um my initial like entry point is video games so definitely if you're interested in building something just start finding resources and there's tons of online resources now nowadays available like their free coursera courses and all those like medium articles people like just write up and just show you how they make their own app so if you're interested in any of those just start like reaching out on those online resources and start looking into it because um you don't want to start up with something that is kind of boring because that will never carry you far that's basically my biggest advice okay um do you have any like recommendations or like places that you think people should start off with like something that they should do to start off with before they you know try to get into their tech field um so i guess uh my advice is to if your school is offering like cs classes um definitely take those classes because it's really like learning cs or programming is like really crucial that you kind of like in the mindset of how to program uh it's not it's something that you kind of need some uh prior training on in order to get into it but um it's not like uh so i would say like programming is not something that have a really high bar entry like when i was in china i always thought that you need to be really smart you need to be really good at math in order to get really good at coding but uh it's not true because like once i get really excited about something i decide to make up my mind to build it i can like look up resources and start like realizing my own idea and creativity in through programming and through that that actually kind of helped me practice my logical uh thinking and get get me better at math as well so i would say um definitely start looking at something that interests you and then look at some online tutorials yeah hope that's helpful okay so third question as a woman in the tech field did you experience any gender biases in school or while you were applying for internship positions yeah um so fortunately i didn't actually experience any ex biases that specifically targeted against me in those like ex like when i'm applying for internships or within classes that once you are in like the cs major or once you started doing all those like technical internships you do start to feel that pressure because you kind of look around you and you just see guys everywhere basically so when i was uh when i get into cs at uw it's just really apparent that when you look around the classroom most of the people are guys and you just see a couple of girls gathering around and that is part of the reason why it's super important as like a woman in tech you want to be really good at finding that community and like use the resources shared by that community um and even when i'm currently in my current internship when all the engineering teammates on my team are men but then so it's just you can feel like there's still a gender imbalance in the depth view in the tech view definitely but um the one good thing is that the tech view is kind of striving to gain more diversity when they're hiring in their hiring process so use this type of push to your advantage because um the tech industry is actually looking for more women engineers to join their team because they believe that you can contribute really valuable perspectives and skill sets and there are also a lot of great communities out there to support women for example like this one girls coded i don't think uh guys have this type of organization so definitely make use of these and for me my community is like rewriting a code which is like an online facebook community where people just like sharing resources on how to prepare for interviews how to prepare for internships and things like that those resources just like online so definitely keep an eye out for those communities um do you think like being in a class with women uh like a small amount of you know girls or like woman you think it brought you guys closer together as friends or did you like maybe not talk to them during the year um i think it definitely brought bring us closer as friends um that because like you assure the identity as a woman and kind of kind of like a minority in this field is really when you start like chatting with each other it's really natural that you share that kind of connection uh in terms of like you can like complain about how this just gets everywhere and then you can also talk about some like common experience like how do you overcome the imposter syndrome or overcome that kind of like you don't want to uh you want to kind of like prove yourself to be as good as guys just because you're a minority which is like basically not true but that kind of urge still exists because of like the gender imbalance we're going to move on to our fourth question then thank you for this one um what was the microsoft internship application process like and how did you prepare for your interviews yeah so for the microsoft internship application the traditional route is that you will fill out an online application form where you just fill out some basic information and also upload your resume and if you have a good enough resume uh the recruiters will reach out to you and schedule a phone screen so you you like kind of chat with them uh on some like behavioral questions like tell me about how you work with a team or tell me about your time you have to overcome some obstacles um and after that if you if they still think you're a good fit to a company you move on to like technical interviews um and in this uh i think like the final round of this process is actually on site so you would actually go to like at least in the normal circumstances you will go to the actual microsoft redmond campus um or if you're somewhere uh not in seattle maybe you would go to the other campuses um but then in the raving campus you just go through a whole day of backtoback interviews and you meet with people in different roles so for my experience is a little bit different from the traditional one just because i have participated in the new technologies program in my in the summer of my freshman year so for those of you who are not familiar with that program is basically a sevenweek academy type program where you learn the whole product development cycle from like ideation thinking about what the need of customer is to creating like a mockup of like the idea or the app that you're trying to build to target the problem statement that you try to solve and finally you work with a team of other college students to kind of build up that app together and that program is kind of designed specifically for freshmen and sophomores so people who don't have a lot of like technical background so it's like so it kind of has a lower expectation in terms of like what what background you want to come in so i was a participant in that program and i have a really great experience and after that i got a referral from a coach in that program and he kind of recommended to me to do this uh ux engineering internship so i kind of skipped the like online application and like the phone screen and i go straight to outside so for my experience um the first like i have around with like engineers just like just asking some whiteboarding questions so you need to actually write down code on the whiteboard when they ask you a question and um that is mostly testing your technical skills and how well you are in terms of like communicating your thought process um i also have interviews with like a project manager and it's mostly like uh testing my design skills like how do i uh create this wireframe and also draw them on the whiteboard and later i have a lunch interview with like a engineering manager and it's mostly him asking a little bit me a little bit about me but mostly is me asking a question to him as well like asking uh why do you work in this team like what kind of intern projects are you expecting me to do for the summer and finally it's more more like uh a final round with um an engineering a design director at microsoft so it's someone who are more higher up and the question she mostly asked me was about like uh where do i see myself in five years and things like that so um because my the role i'm interviewing for is ux engineering so it has kind of a blend between like design and engineering uh if you are going for like software engineering roles you probably will get a lot more like technical focused backtoback interviews but yeah that's basically my interview experience at microsoft wow that's really interesting and i think that would help a lot of people a lot um just knowing that process um next question is what was your daytoday life like as a software engineer intern yeah um i guess i can just use my experience right now because uh again i'm a software engineering internet coupler so the project that i'm working on this summer i actually get to collaborate with a project management intern so uh for he so his task is mostly focused on like figuring out the general direction of the product and also like kind of a little bit of like thinking about what our competitors are like what the interface should look like for the product and things like that whereas me is mostly focused on importing that thing um so usually in the morning or in the beginning of the week i will check in with that intern just to kind of clarify like what will be our todo items for the week and what would be our goals that we want to achieve by the end of the week and then after that is mostly like doing a lot of research on the things that i need to implement and this is the point where googling really comes in handy uh and i would definitely say if you're a good programmer you're definitely a really good googler because you really know how you need to know like how to find the resource you need via googling and even though it uh if you are even if you are like a senior engineer maybe like the besides like the technical experience that you get uh you just like get really good at googling compared to like the junior engineers um so after doing this research of course i need to like start coding and also do a lot of debugging on like the program that i wrote and another aspect is like documentation so after you write down the code you also want to document them and try because that is super important in terms of like uh telling whoever else is reading your code um like how do like what does your code do like how does though how does that work and if you they want to use your code how are they going to use it so documentation is like a super important part in this engineering process just because you want to write code that works but you also want to write code that works for other people as well um and if i get stuck i would like paying my mentor on google chat just asking them for help and then sometimes i also attend like team meetings where i just like kind of report the progress uh throughout the week to the team and there's also like some fireside chats or things like that where the company executives uh get to like uh it's more like a q a with company executives and they're also like social events where you have some interim mixers where you just get to know like other interns within the company so yeah that's basically the daytoday as a software engineer intern um what would you say is the most fun part of your day as a software engineer intern i would say the best moments are the ones that after debugging for one or two or more hours you finally get it to work like even though the debugging process can be super painful but like the moment that you figure out how to solve the problem is like really amazing and it's basically something that keeps you going even though like you know like the next moment when you start working on something new you're going to start going back to that debugging process again but it just feels really good um okay so we'll start opening up to our audience here for some more questions so um here's an open q a for anyone who wants to ask questions you could type it in the chat if you don't feel comfortable with speaking or you can unmute yourself and um you know ask your questions um sharon from the audience asks in the chat what do you suggest to young girls who are interested in coding um so uh when would you like us to answer that um you mean like uh in terms of the technology or like what exactly i think that suggestion is targeting oh yeah she also asked a more specific questions like what language or activities do you think would help prepare them yeah um so i think python is a really good starter starter language to learn just because the syntax is really easy and um there's also a lot of really great tutorials out there just like helping guiding you out how to code the simple python game for example and that is definitely a good language to pick up in the beginning and even though it's simple it's actually a super powerful language because python is used in like the data analysis fields a lot and a lot of and a lot of people also i think it's like almost like the second most popular programming language nowadays um another the top most popular so far i think is actually java so java is like a more you have stricter syntax in java and there is a little bit of barrier to entry to java but then a lot of good concepts that you learn while you're programming java is actually applicable to other language as well so it's really good to have a really solid foundation in java as well and java is actually the language that i started coding in um but then if you want to make some project that you i can actually see things happening i would recommend like learning html and css just like building up your own website um and you can also learn a little bit about javascript which is actually really different from java even though they seem they sound really similar but then is a programming language for web and you can kind of give more interaction or dynamics to your website but yeah i think those are my recommendations that you can start looking into i know it's a lot but um i say if i have a fake one i'll say go for python but yeah um another audience member asks what are some companies slash organizations that offer high school internships high school internships let's see um like autodesk is the one that i know of just because but it's like a little bit more um regional specific because like i think it only hires like participants in the first robotics competition from the pacific northwest region so it's like super specific um i don't really know of anywhere else at this point um but if you like try to google it i believe you can also find find out some of them as well but yeah um another audience member asks uh how many languages you how many languages did you learn and what order did you learn them in yeah i mean looking back i actually learned a lot of language which is even like okay let me pull up my resume so that i can like read them out um let's see so my first language is java like i mentioned because i use it in my robotics team and it's also the language we use in the intro to programming class i have at my school and then the second language i learned is c sharp so uh c sharp is a language that is used by uh what if you need to develop games in unity csharp is an option the other option is the plus plus but that is like a lot more complicated actually c sharp have a really similar syntax to java so if you know java it's very really easy for you to transition to c sharp um and after that i learned swift so swift is a programming language that you can use to code ios apps so if you want to develop mobile mobile apps for apple this is the language that you go for and i learned it during the new technologies program because at that point that program is using script as the language uh for coding up like the app prototypes um and then after that i learned python and html and css and javascript and php and sql actually at the same time so basically what happens is that there are one quarter at my school where i take a web programming class and a data programming class at the same time so what happens at that quarter is actually super chaotic because i learned like six different languages in the web programming class just because you need to use different languages to do different things for when you're building a website whereas uh on the on the other hand i also need to learn python which uh in my data programming class so that was a really cool experience though because like you can as you are like picking up those language and kind of struggling to switch your mindset in between all those different languages you start to see like the commonalities shared between those languages and in fact there's a lot of really fundamental concepts in programming that is uh that is not language specific and as you're learning more and more language you started to see like a common pattern and it also actually helps you to pick up other language really quickly as well because the only thing that is different is um just like remembering what the syntax should be in that different language um and after that i also learned a it's not a language but it's more like a framework called react so react is a really popular web development framework nowadays that a lot of people use and it's built on top of javascript um so if you're interested in web development once you feel like you have a good hang of html css and javascript definitely looking to react because this is a really popular thing that people are using and finally in last quarter of my college i actually learned another language which is c plus and actually c so c and c plus plus are a lot kind of like lower level language in the sense that uh those language you are able to interact directly with like the hardware of the computer so it's not something that as fancy as html css as in the sense that you can build like a front end or like the interface that you can see but it's like those languages are really efficient in a sense that because they are built um with like with because like they're designed for building really powerful and efficient um applications um yeah so like i know this is a lot uh but then i think in the future as i move on to my actual fulltime job or pick up more internship i would definitely learn a lot more languages um but it's just like the life of a software engineer you just need to be really good at picking up new skills and just keep learning great um we have another question um do you suggest any online resources for learning python or any other language um i see online resources so coursera probably have some really cool classes let's see so yeah but it's like let me send a link to the chat so i think coursera has some like free classes uh that you can look into and then unity if you're interested in like game development or just like some um just like interested in starting from building games you can uh look into unity which is this one um this is a link to like the unity so the good thing about starting with unity when you're building things is that they have really good documentation on everything so they have a lot of really cool tutorials that can like kind of guide you through every single step um but yeah this is like the tuesday that i have in mind right now but i guess i can also follow up if i come up with more resources later yeah just a quick shameless self promo we are um our organization is offering um python java and web development courses soon so i'll keep on look out for that we have an another question saying recommendations slash best resources for preparing for technical interviews yes um so i think for high school it might be a little bit early to mention this but um for so usually when people are preparing for technical interviews they use a resource called colleague code and leak code is one that is like super popular and the other one is hacker rank so basically uh for these two sites they kind of have a really similar um purpose of like they just have a lot of like those different algorithm problems um and they would like kind of show you the problem statement and you need to basically call up a solution to kind of solve those problems and they also have all those different test case that you can run so after you pull up the solution you can like test if that solution works or not um but then i guess uh if you for high school students this might be a higher bar of entry just because it would be you need to basically most of the question on there you need to basically have taken like the first data structures and algorithm class in college um to have that kind of theoretical background for you to be more comfortable in terms of like um practicing the actual problems on there and um the other book that a lot of people recommend for a coding interview is just uh something called cracking the coding interview you can google the book and it basically is a book that kind of walks you through the different aspects of like technical interview and um also like talk about some like basic concepts on the data structure but i would definitely say don't jump too fast into those resources because it's really easy to get discouraged if you don't have like the theoretical background coming into solving those questions um but yeah great uh we have another question um what coding language is the best to create a game um it depends a lot on what kind of game that you want to create um c plus plus is a language that a lot of popular game engines uh use just because um like i said before c plus plus is a language designed for building really fast and efficient uh games and you if you are a gamer you can imagine that people don't really like to have their games to lag a lot or just like have you need to wait a long time for the game to load etc and that's why a lot of uh game developers use the plus plus to kind of like build up their game uh to make them as performant as possible um but then c sharp is like c sharpness like c with like a pound sign um so c sharp is a language that unity use um and actually unity provides both options you can either code in c sharp or c plus plus and c sharp definitely have better uh better syntax and this is like a little bit less complicated than c plus plus to pick up but yeah that's the two that i can think of right now but i think um a lot of other i think javascript uh there a lot of people also building up javascript games just like you can run it on a website and it's also something that people use okay uh we have another question um what grade did you start learning programming um i started at grade 11 so after because i moved to the u.s at grade 11 this is uh where i start picking up um coding and yeah i would say like the if i have to say the real the learning like hardcore programming uh it's like at the it's more like the freshman year of my college or sophomore year because um when you started to take data structures class is like where you actually get into like the best side of the cs that's how you can describe so yeah um we have another question uh what kind of side projects do you think helped you on your internship um so i actually didn't do a lot of side projects coming into my internship just because um school is really busy so um for me i i don't think any of my side projects would be really like is something that gets me to those internships but um what i really focus on uh on the other side is actually being a teaching assistant so i am a head teaching assistant for a data programming class at my school and um the nice thing about being a teaching assistant and i would definitely recommend uh any every one of you um yeah if you're interested in being a teaching uh in college you should definitely explore the opportunity of being a teaching assistant just because um it helps you to kind of practice public speaking and also explain your thought process and because you're teaching you're also learning the concepts in cs better and it helps you to prepare for coding interview as well so yeah okay uh we have a really good question um they're saying i'm really interested in coding but i'm afraid of giving up in the middle of my progress is there any tip for overcoming it um i think i would just circle back to what i have before uh just just like try to do what excites you because like this is what keeps me going in terms of like coding if i do something that i'm not interested in even though i'm coding it's not something that i want to continue work on and of course if you're interested in cs it doesn't mean you have to code in front of the computer every single day you definitely need to like take a break um so i would say like if you feel like you have some free time just like take a look into like some tutorials just like building up side projects on the site and every like three months or something it doesn't have to be like doing it every single day okay um someone's interested in the stanford program you attended and they asked are can they still attend that program you attended um so i think it's something that is still ongoing so you need to go on the stanford website and then see uh you need to fill out an application uh let's go to summer college so here is the link to that website um but anyways they offer a lot of different classes not just um programming classes so if you're interested in taking classes at stanford in general just like go ahead and sign up but i think the selection process is a little bit rigorous as well so make sure you kind of like it's almost like applying to college so make sure you like have a really good promising personal statement when you're applying okay uh we have another question asking what's a good way to approach people for referrals um so me personally doesn't really like just reaching out to people out of the blue just like can you give me a referral so uh one thing that i recommend is that one sign up for linkedin because it's something that you can build your professional network and you can also find a lot of cool people on linkedin and then just think about what you're interested in what area of technology are you interested in are interested in data analysis are you interested in like web development um or what kind of companies are interested in working for and you can definitely find a lot of like engineers or recruiters on the platform for linkedin um and then i would say reach out to engineers in general because recruiters are super busy and they usually like don't respond to your emails but if you're interested in a particular area of tech reach out to some engineers who are working on that tag and try to like schedule a 30 minute coffee chat or something just talk about how you learn read about their profile you're really interested in the work they're doing can i schedule a 30 minute coffee chat um and just like talk ask you questions and learn about your experience and once you kind of started to build up that relationship um it's easy like it's easy to like ask for referrals down the road just because um now because you have been talking they have like a better idea like what you're interested in and what you're good at um and it's like easier for people to refer you so yeah okay uh someone asked um is it a good idea to pay for the certificates on coursera to put on the resume um let's see i don't think is a super good idea me personally doesn't really think it's a super good idea because um what you want to learn from those coursera courses is more like the technical aspects like the technical skills that you want to have you can like once you take those courses you can like list them on your resume and if you're can like kind of do it really involved in those classes you can like talk about those in your resume as well and i don't think it's worth the money to um like pay for it just because uh you can always just list it on linkedin um and then yeah and you can talk about it in interviews as well without actually having to that solid certificate that you pay for okay uh we have a question asking how do you score that first internship that that opens you to more opportunities um so my first internship is the high school internship at autodesk and basically what happens is that at the if you're like frc participate in the pacific northwest region you receive an email saying uh like all of that is interested in hiring high school interns and work on a product called synthesis and it's basically a robotic simulator built in the unity engine where it allows like uh programmers or drivers of like robotics team to kind of like import the 3d models of the robot and try it in a virtual field instead of building it up in the first place um so how i landed that internship is mostly like just like apply so look for those opportunities and the first even though like you feel like you might not have all the qualification the first tip that i have is just apply because you'll never know what happens uh and things will never happen if you don't apply in the first place and then after i apply i think is mostly like if you are really involved in some sort of like coding projects uh for me it was robotics back in high school you definitely have like a lot to talk about so get really good at practicing uh how you can like describe your experience like what kind of problem that you have and what kind of approach you take to solve that problem and what kind of improvement that you wish you made if you get a second chance to work on that project it's something that is really good to practice for those interview questions uh we have another question uh before the microsoft internship did you have any work experience if so where um yeah the work experience that i just talked about is like the autodesk leadership yeah okay uh let's see what is a facebook community group that you suggested earlier yep so um so that community group currently is only opening to like college women but once you are in college um i will definitely suggest you to apply since your freshman year so basically uh this is a program that kind of runs uh through your college years and they have like for example if you are okay so let me just like kind of restart it so for rewriting code you can like sign up their website and become a member so once you're a member you can join your facebook group and get access to whatever people are sharing on the facebook groups uh but they also have another position which is called something called fellow so as the rewriting cofellow you need to fill out an application and you need to go to kind of like a selection process on their site but then as a fellow you get more resources and this year they're starting like a big little mentoring program where upperclassmen can kind of uh mentor some lower craftsmen for freshmen and sophomores uh in college and kind of like talk about their experience and get some help in terms of like internship applications and things like that um yeah so that's the organization that made okay uh we have another question asking if you are interested in both programming and design would you double major in computer science and product design um i think let's see um even though even if you are majoring i think the first question that you kind of want to ask is like which do you want to like which one do you like better so um there's not really it's not saying that if you're major in cs you cannot work in design because uh even though if you're in in the cs major you there's still different like concentrations within that major for example for utah we have like hci major which focus more on like humans and humor human computer interaction and you can take some classes that focus more on like the design aspect of things and you can definitely that get that kind of skills um so it doesn't mean that you have to double major in things such that you can take the classes uh and i believe a lot of college classes is open to all the majors so you can like pick up those skills as you go when you're taking those classes our next question is a little bit more general um they're asking how do i get an internship in high school um so i guess i don't really have a lot of good tips at this point um because for me it was mostly like i saw an opportunity and then i go ahead and apply but then in terms of high school internship i believe for microsoft they have like a high school intern program as well and for those high school internships i believe the most things they would look for is like your passion in technology and your ability to learn new things and if you are interested in getting a high school internship definitely try to get involved in some coding projects at your school so if your club needs a new website you can like offer to help them build it and in the process you can like look up resources and pick up new technology um yeah and that's like the type of advice i would give just keep doing a lot of different coding projects and getting good at describing that experience when you apply okay uh next question asks um i'm really interested in graphic design and i want to apply this to cs would it be a good idea to go into the ux engineering field so um i guess uh one thing that i kind of want to clarify about ux engineering is that it's not actually a field where you get to do both design and engineering so for my project it's a little bit special in the sense that my mentor is really aware that i know i really like design so i also have kind of have that experience back in the new technologies program so he kind of tailored that experience for me so for my project i actually get to both design like the app that i'm building and also like implement it but in reality what ux engineers usually do is that they uh usually they are building up like the coding components for the ui component so if you look at like your zoom interface for example you see all those like different buttons like the participants chat and share screen record and reactions all those different comp uh all those buttons uh have are just like components and their code they kind of run those components and what ux engineering's do uh is actually like code up all those components and like figure out how to make them as reusable as possible when other engineers want to use those components and build the app really quickly so yeah the main part of the job is actually building uh like coding not like designing okay uh since we're running out of time we're just gonna answer two more questions that people have already sent in the chat uh one of them is do you know any high school internships a beginner can apply apply to for a cse um high school internships is that the question sorry uh yeah yeah they asked any high school internships at a beginner can apply apply to for cse what's yes um the one that i know of is just a microsoft high school intern program um and again there are probably a lot out there um and they might not be like quoteunquote internships but there are more like summer programs and i think you don't have to have like that type of internship especially out of the high school um but you also you just want to have more experience in all those like different coding programs and get exposure to different technology so i would just say like google like coding programs for high schoolers or internships open for high schoolers and there are some lists that will pop up and just apply okay great we have our last question asking if i want to incorporate coding and design major in college what do i need to to prepare in high school um i would say be coding and design major um like there so in high school there isn't really a lot of things that you can like kind of prepare because um you just um i guess one thing that you can prepare well as a high schooler when you're applying to college is definitely do a lot of research unlike the colleges and kind of get to know like their design program and their cse program and know like what the culture is like in those programs because you want to make sure the school that you're applying to have really good coding slash design programs and there's also some other colleges out there i believe that have like programs that kind of like blend those two areas a little bit better um so definitely look into those and just like be i think um my biggest advice is just try to do what you're interested in and don't feel too pressured to um like be prepared well i know like nowadays there's a lot of pressure in like starting early and things like that but you need to also enjoy your high school times and and have fun you know before you get into college and be super stressed out about everything but yeah thank you so much um we'll be concluding our panel right now um thank you when and thank you for those who came today um as jen said before we will have our future courses on python web development and java you can see more information for future workshops and panels on our website thank you once again went so much for coming this is a great panel and you answered the questions really well thank you all for asking questions to when and yeah thank you for coming
