okay we're gonna start coding now i'll share my screen for scratch okay so um i'm just gonna do a demonstration on a code that i already have but i'll explain every single step um today we'll be covering uh for variables we talked about this last time and then today we'll be covering lists but i'll also summarize what we learned last time so here we have our variables for things like points that we're earning and we also have a code for like high score to calculate um high score that we've gotten while playing our game so we have the code um if touching ball then change our point value by one so this means that every time you touch the ball on the point like the points value over here will go up by one but you can also change this like um to any number you want like maybe go up by five over ten or like if you want to discourage the players from um touching the ball you can like decrease the points like going by a negative number so maybe going by negative one will decrease the amount of points that you get and then tell the players that like oh you don't want to touch the ball because it'll take away your points and the goal of the game is usually to get as many points as possible so if you have your points already and you have it showing up here and you want to make it um go up or down you'll use the change points block and if you want it to go up or down based on a condition you need to put it in an if statement uh with a condition here like um it's touching the ball or something like that and then you'll use the change points does that answer your question yeah okay um also remember when you're doing your game um you want to make sure in the beginning you are starting from a clean slate unless you have something like a higher score so the highest score is never something you want to reset because um you want to keep the high score there forever to compare it to your score now or else um you'll never have like an accurate high school so something like the points that you get per game or like the collected items in a list here you want to make sure that you delete all the collected items and you set your point value to the initial points that you want in my case i want my points to start at zero so if you wanted your points to start at like five then you would change this to like five and then go up or down from there um does anyone have any questions on that i had a different question though it was about um it was about clones so i want to code something kind of like i guess atari breakout but then i don't know how to do a point sis like have a point system if for my clones or do i just need to um have a different sprite for every um block um yeah i think for um the variables here because when you make a variable you get a choice for like for all sprites or for this sprite only um i think maybe use another sprite as a clone um because then you can use the points variable for all the spikes also um can you remind me what atari breakout is it's that um game where you have those blocks and then the paddle move you have to move the paddle so that the block doesn't touch the bottom or the ball doesn't touch the bottom but the goal of the game is to clear all of the blocks oh yeah all right i remember that one now yeah i used to play that on my dad's phone all the time okay so um yeah for that for variables you can use them for either one or all sprites and um usually i do all sprites just so i have a choice and if you go down here today we'll be talking about lists so you can make a list and i already have one created called collected items um you won't see all of these blocks until you've made your list already so when you go down to variables you want to click this thing that says make a list and then once you've created your list you'll see all of these options so the first block here says add thing to and then the name of your list and what this does is it adds like the word that you type in here into your collected items so i have my list here called collected items and i have this code if i'm touching the ball the ball sprite then i'll add the word ball to my collected items list to show that i've collected like a ball and then i also changed points by one and um that's what this block of code means delete one of collected items um there's a number there and that basically references the order of which items are added into your list so let's say i collected a ball and then ball is up here and it's one um and then i use this code that says delete one of collected items that um the first ball that i collected which is the only one would be deleted so technically it would do the same thing as delete all but let's say i had three different items um a mushroom a chicken and a water bottle i have mushroom chicken water bottle in that order if i did delete one of collected items i would delete the mushroom because the mushroom is first if i did delete two of collected items um which means that the second item i collected i would delete chicken is that what i said was like anymore yeah i would delete the chicken because it was the second one i collected and then delete all is just deleting your entire list and i have it in the beginning here because i want to make sure my list is empty when i start the game so i don't have like stuff from my previous thing that i played um answer thing at one of collected items or maybe list means that you're inserting um this word that you put in here at and then a position on your list so one would be like the first item you have on your list so if you enter the word thing into your list at position one it'll be entered into the place where the first item of your list is if you put it like at three it'll become the third position on your list if your list only has like one item so far and then you do like insert thing at three of collected items um there are two ways that it might go down is that one it might not work because there's no second item or two it'll just put it in behind the first item so um i never really tried that one out but if you want to experiment with that um it would be good replace item one of collected items is basically taking the item in that position and replacing it with a different item so if i had mushroom chicken water bottle here and i wanted to replace mushroom with bird i would do replace item one of the list with bird and then instead of mushroom i will have the word bird and then and then answer and replace are two different things because insert is um just adding something at a specific place and then replace is taking out the thing from that area and then putting in something else so this one maintains the length of your list and then this one will increase the length of your list by one and then over here um you see this block these three blocks are like ovals which means that they're variables so item one of collected items is a variable that describes a word because in our list we are collecting words so item one of collected items let's go back to my mushroom chicken water bottle example item one of this if i use this variable if i called the variable for my list this variable would define mushroom because that's the first item on my list um item number of thing and collected item let's say that i have um chicken in here item number of chicken in my list that's mushroom chicken water bottle will be two because um chicken is second on my list so this variable um defined will be the number two and then length of collected items is also a number and it basically counts how many items you have in your list if you can look down here there's the thing that says length and then right now it says zero because our list is empty but when we have more objects um this will this variable will basically carry um how many objects we have does anyone have any questions on anything that i already talked about like i've been talking about right now does everyone understand how to use these if you understand can you give me like a thumbs up or a thumbs up sticker okay cool it looks like everyone understands so i'll move on to this vlog which is a boolean and you can tell because it is in the shape of a hexagon um collected items contains thing this uh basically asks you does our list contain a specific item and then over here over here um you can type whatever item you're looking for so once again going back to mushroom chicken water bottle if i ask um my code my computer that's running it um does my list have chicken it's going to check my list and it's going to see yes there's a chicken um the second item on the list is a chicken and then this boolean value which is can either be true or false in this case it will be true because it did find the chicken but if i asked does my list contain a book and my list does not contain a book the value for this boolean will become false and it in the case that i put this in an if statement if it's false that code won't run but if it's true the code will run and yeah so this has just come in collected items checking to see if we have a specific item okay and then show list and high list here um so our list already shows itself when we have um this checked off so if we uncheck it it'll be gone and if we check it it'll be there but hide list what hide list does is the same thing as if i unchecked it um it will make our list invisible and then show lists if we put that after high list will show our list so those are pretty easy to remember does anyone have any questions about lists or variables um does anyone want like a height to code a high score feature like you want to show a high score thing okay well then um that is what i have for today's lesson if there are no more questions um so i'll give you guys about 10 minutes to 10 to 15 15. how much time do you guys want to work on your projects right now like 10 or 15 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes to work on your project and then um you can ask me a question anytime and then after hopefully some of you guys are willing to share your projects even if you're not finished with your project um especially if you have an issue with your project that you need fixing um it's helpful to share and then we'll talk through it so um i'll start our timer for 15 minutes and you guys can you know do your thing with your project um i have a question is there a mountain sprite in scratch um i'm sure there are mountain sprites but if not you could always um use the painting tool to make your own but i'm i'm like 90 sure there should be a mountain sprite yeah i'm trying to type it but it's not really coming maybe i'm wrong maybe there is no mountain sprite if you want i can take these 15 minutes um to make one for you but that will require me to send it to you through email and then that would probably take a lot of time um so if you want me to though i'm definitely free to do that or okay yeah um do you have any requests on the mountain like a snowy mountain mountain i just want like a regular mountain okay just one like a tall mountain just two that's it two okay well then 15 minutes i'll start now um is there a way to make your project sync or your sprites sync um by sync do you mean like s y and c or s i k sink um like go down um yes but it's a little bit complicated because um if you have a background and you want your background to sync you're going to have to switch it into a sprite because you can't move backgrounds on their own oh i meant to make my sprites sink oh yeah yeah then uh that's fine um here let me like go look at the codes really quick on the scratch and then i'll show you um the code and then explain it thank you okay um elizabeth i think i got a code that will work thank you okay so um the thing though is that sprites can't go under the screen completely so you'll still see like a bit of the head okay so basically the code i wrote is that it'll start syncing when i press the space bar but for here if you use an if statement you can change the condition to anything you want um so this is what it looks like when the spread is fully synced okay so i have my sprite here and i'm gonna just take away the music i have because it's a little bit annoying okay so when um i run the code and i press the space bar down here um this is what it looks like you can also make it go faster um but yeah you can make it go faster by making this number bigger um and what you have to do is you want to change y because you don't want the thing to move left or right you want to change y by um a negative number and you want it to go on forever um because you want it to go all the way down no matter where it is so this is the code you have if and then a condition then forever it will go down and if we change this number to like negative 10 it'll go down pretty fast so depending on how fast you want your character to move down that was pretty fast yeah thank you okay no problem um we have about two minutes and 30 seconds left um i sent you the mountain sprite inside the chat if you wanted to see that thank you um if you want me to change it though i could probably change it okay we can start um wrapping up now so you have 10 seconds um does anyone want to share what they have or if anyone has any questions and want to be talked through uh so does anyone want to share what they have um i can't really share today because um there's not there's like i can't name my project and i can't see my project so i can't share today okay can you explain what your project is about so my project is about like a city with the food truck going by what's the food truck doing like it's just honking well um if i put a sound so it if i share every it's very loud so i thought i thought of like like putting it a little low volume so then and then the and then the food truck says like uh does every um it says just it just says food everywhere so like it just says it has a space bubble and it says food but it's not letting me name my project hmm could i can i see your screen and then maybe i can help you yeah um can you give me the share oh yeah okay yeah i'm just putting this it's just it's not giving me oh i think maybe you have to sign into your account you know in order to like save stuff so just say like sign in yeah if you already have an account um you sign in and then you might need to um move your code over to that account i'm not 100 sure though just try signing in okay yeah i'll tell my dad to come okay or just like explain what they have oh sammy a new episode wow that's really smooth i like how um the potion went to your character there i think that was really cool and the background change and the dialogue was really nice as well this is the code how i made the potion glide okay so when that click wait 12 seconds glide 82 132 change size by 50 to make it smaller and when that click go to the position that was in the wizards hand and then with that click go to size 100 because the wizard is basically holding it that's cool it really shows you how like um a lot of fun code can be written in ways that you might not know but they'll give you like the same kind of conclusion the same i guess not conclusion but the same um final product and it looks good um does anyone else have anything to share i just signed in and it worked okay cool do you want to share your code um i'm not gonna share but i had something i made at the last class but like i was making the soccer game so there's two players so my dad is not really three so i'm gonna only play with one character okay so so he has to try to kick the ball into the goal well um my dad um he's trying to play the other character so he won't be free to play um i forgot to add the score so i'm gonna do after class oh yeah um the code for the cats do you need help with the score now like would you want to start up now yeah can you help me okay so go to variables and then um let's set up the variable with score yeah and then i think you already have it you can press the check mark on it and do you have like a code for when the soccer ball hits the net um i don't really have a code for this oh yeah i have this soccer ball code okay so um do you want a score for each character yeah i want it for both of them okay so um you might need to make another variable and you might need to rename this one um like score green or score red to let people know like which scores for which character did we make it to the other character how do we make it for this character at this side um you can either make another variable that's called score red or you can rename the your other variables to become score red but it's just it just depends on you okay and then i think you can drag the score red on the screen to the right side oh yeah so how do we do the code again okay so do you want it so that every time the ball goes into the net it's a point or do you want it like every time the ball hits the edge it's a point um every time the ball goes in the net okay like yeah this might be a little bit complicated you might need to add like sprites for the net like um uh like if you go to sprites you can find like a net sprite soccer net um try using the search bar i don't i'm not completely sure they have one hopefully they do hmm it doesn't seem like they have a soccer net um but the easiest way is to make it so that the net is a sprite because otherwise you'll have to use coordinates and like make it so that it hits a certain coordinate okay so maybe if you can find like a small enough sprite where it's not very noticeable and put it in the net and then make it so that every time the ball hits that sprite it's just it's a point it'll look like it's going into the net but it'll be with a different sprite and that's just like a easy solution if you don't have a sprite for a soccer net okay so should i just put like um should i just put like some sprite inside or outside of the net um i think put a sprite inside but like make sure it's very small and not super noticeable unless you wanted to be noticeable okay so what can i use so like maybe a small circle or like a small ball you can also adjust the size of your sprite when you're in the code will this little ball work yeah and then just make it a little smaller so go to the size at the bottom if you go down and then change it to a number that's less than a hundred oh that's too tiny that's a pretty good size and then if you put it inside the net over there yeah and then create another one and put it over there look so should i put one at the other side too yeah okay actually um actually no that works um and then if you go to the sprite like the ball sprite and then you can code inside the ball sprite you only need one line of code for this actually or not one line but very few blocks of code if you go to events and then depending on how you start the game um go to your forever loop and then choose an if statement and then do if um in the sensing is touching the one on the very first and then for sprite go to soccer ball um and then go to variables change change score red by one or um however much you want your point to go so if the ball going in is um goes like you want that to be ten points then um you can change the one to ten score red light just change score red yeah and then you can do the exact same thing for the one in green but with the ball to spray okay does that make sense um does anyone else have any questions comments suggestions okay if not then we will be ending our class here and then our next two classes one will be tomorrow and then another will be on wednesday we will be focusing only on our projects and it'll be just like this where um we'll be sharing and asking questions and i'll give you a whole class time to do that so thank you guys for coming like always email if you have any questions byebye thank you
