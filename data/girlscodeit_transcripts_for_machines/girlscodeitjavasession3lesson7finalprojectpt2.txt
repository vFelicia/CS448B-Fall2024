c you all right so just a heads up in about five minutes i like 3 35 um before you guys get too deep into a project i'm just gonna introduce like an extra feature for like if else statements and then we'll let you like play around with it is that again what do i do if i want one thing to print for a stick and another thing different for a wand so basically um just like in olivia's example um you have your if numbers equals one and if number equals equals two right so basically if you want um say number one to be a wand then you will basically put you've earned a magical one under inside of the number equal equals one if bracket then like outside you have the elsif if number equals two and then you can print something else so basically if you want one thing to print for a stick um you can just assign a number to like you can just print something inside that if statement and everything outside like inside that elsif statement what can be for something else sorry does that explain it for you like after you type the wand you can like enter and then you can do system dot out um okay okay so after let's use your example so after you earn the magic wand you can um so then you can add like oh okay then you can add like another choice so you can add like um let's see you have you have a choice like where do you want to go with the unicorn so um so then you can be like type one to go to the forest or type 2 to go to the mountains right so then after that that's when you can either make a new variable or you can use the same one to do the second choice and then you can make like a new if statement like copying the same one if number equals one and then something happens or else if number equals two and then something else happens or they type nothing so see that's like another pair and then you have like you have one okay so you have one set after you go to this set do you see what i mean yes so then you can do the same thing with the second one the um the choice with the stick um i want um okay that's good all right okay i will scroll up a little bit and then let you play around with what i just did and then do it for the second else if statements and you can make as many else if statements as you want it doesn't just have to be two choices it could be three portals or four so can give you about like 10 to 15 minutes to do that oh i see is it juicy who joined um have you attended any classes before sleep so just to cut you up to speed um right now we're basically making our own um choose your adventure game using ifo statements nice oh okay so do you understand how to make a class and start up the doc or do you need me to scroll up and show you see okay and i'm just wondering caitlyn with a c are you caught up sweet all right so i'm just gonna i'm gonna like talk about something extra you can do um before you get like too deep into your project um are you guys familiar with like and and or in java okay so i can just like go over it very quickly this is basically for when if you want to like do multiple if statements like in one giant if statement um and i can share my screen can everyone see it see so basically for this it's for if you want to do like a bunch of statements so in my example i have like if input equals one then i'm gonna quit my game and then input equals two i'll print something else input equals three i'll print like the statement and then for everything else i'll print else so right now my game basically runs like this create a new instance of game and then run it so if i print like three it will say printed three two will print something else for everything else will print else and then one will quit everything so in this case what if like say i wanted to print something else for another number like if i wanted if input equals 3 or sorry 30 i also want to print this so in that case i could just put like another elsif statement over here right and then put like input equals 30. and then do whatever like basically copy and paste this over right but that's pretty inefficient because i basically have the same code twice instead of doing this what i can also do is over here put an or statement so this symbol the two pipes is basically or that means like if input equals 2 or input equals 3 or input equals 30 then i'll print something else and let's say like in a different case right now i have if input equals three then i'll print printed three but what if i wanted like if input like if in a general case if input divided by 2 equals 2 or let's put it this way if input is an even number then it'll say print it even don't don't mind this symbol it's complicated this is basic the general statement of this is if input divided by two is zero or if the remainder of input divided by two is zero so basically if input is even then i'll say print it even but what if i wanted like more cases so input divided by two equals zero but i also want this input to be less than ten and i'll print even less than less than and less than 10. so i have multiple conditions then i'll use this symbol this is the and symbol so if input is even and input is less than 10 then i'll do this so these are just two helpful tools for you to use in case you want to check multiple things at once any questions sweet so i'll let you go back to your coding and just let us know if you have any questions or like any trouble with your program do you still need my screen or y'all good you you you all right just a heads up guys we got about 10 minutes left for this class so foreign foreign um all right so we'll be ending a few minutes early because there's another meeting that's gonna be happening like right around seven or sorry four p.m pst sorry but um thank you so much for coming and we'll see you on one today bye
