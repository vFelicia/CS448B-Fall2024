hello so today we're talking about sound um that you can add to your game it's like mostly aesthetic reasons but i think it brings a lot of depth into your game and um i think it would be a good idea to have that in your game as well it also ties into a lot of what we're talking about yesterday and the class before about sensing and like the if loop so yeah here we go going to share my screen okay so let's look inside the code that we were working on yesterday okay so as you can see on the left here we have code costumes and sound um what we're going to be looking at today will be the sounds and uh it's basically the same thing as sprite or backdrop you can go over here look for sounds in the database record your own sounds choose a random sound or upload a sound that you already have on your computer so the sound that they give us as a default is the meow sound because um the default sprite they give us is a cat um you can hit the play button to hear what it sounds like and you can also alter the sounds here um with things like making it faster slower louder more quiet you can mute the sound um and then fade in fade out you can make the sound go backwards or you can make it robotic so um yeah you can just alter the sound like that and it'll be inside your database or your scratch codes um you can also go here choose sounds and like choose music to put in the back of your game so if you go over here to loops basically these um these oh my gosh um that's not okay okay um you take these like loops and then when you loop them throughout your code you'll have background music for your code so if you go over here like hover over it or like press the play button it just plays like music and then you can loop it so then that'll always play during your game and i'll show you guys how to do that right now um so here you have your cat you can make it play a sound whenever you you know touch something or anything um let's say our cat makes a sound every time it touches the sun so we already have code down here for what happens when it touches the sun um we switch the costume to a red cat and then we also stop everything but before that we can also make it play a sound so let's go to sounds here and then we can play sound this until done and let's make it now okay so now when we're starting the code or walking towards the sun and then the sound plays when we touch it and then it also turns red because that's what it says in a code and then our code also stops so that's how you put sound in um the difference between the play sound until dawn and the star sound is that playing sound until done means that however long your sound is over here it'll play until completion and it won't stop in the middle if you do start sound um it'll start sometimes it'll complete all the way to the end and sometimes it won't it really depends on your code if you say if my cat is touching the sun start the sound and you are constantly touching the sun then the sound will always replay from the beginning because it always sees you touching the sun um as the first time you touch the sun so then the sound will always start from the beginning does that make sense um does anyone have any questions or like thumbs up if you understand anything don't understand thumbs up if you don't understand maybe do a thumbs down okay seems like everyone understands so yeah and then i'll show you guys how to make a music loop in your game this might be a little loud but you can also adjust the sound if you go over here i'm going to use the bossa nova music but it's kind of loud so i'll just make it softer sorry hold on okay sorry about that um back to the music here we made it a little softer and then we can go into the code and for events we'll make a separate one that says when green flag is clicked over here and then our forever loop because we want um our music to loop as long as we're running the game and then for sounds we want to play until it's done or else it'll sound really weird and glitchy so from the beginning now we have the bossa nova music in the background and then we have the same sound where we touch the sun and then everything stops so that's basically it on sounds remember different ways you can get sound is to look in the database and you can search something up uh you can record your own sound if you don't have anything in the database that you would like to use or you can get a random sound or upload your own sound so is there any more questions about sound okay well i'll just also talk about this you can affect the sound inside the code instead of doing it outside of the code um like if something happens that makes your sound go up a pitch in your game you can do change the pitch effect by and then a number so the positive number will change the pitch to go higher so it'll be a higher pitch it'll be more squeaky a negative number will make it lower and like you know lower so you can also set the pitch um i think 100 is the normal and then a pitch higher than that would be like over 100 and then picture lower would be lower than 100 um same thing with volume if you use a positive number the volume will increase and get louder use a negative volume it'll become quieter and then set volume percentage is the same 100 is the normal percent um but if you want to set it like two times you do like 200 or like 50 for half the volume and yeah you can also show your volume on the side here that's the volume it is that right now the normal volume okay so does anyone have any more questions on sound um thumbs up if you have no questions just so i know or yeah thumbs up you have no questions if you understand everything okay awesome so then it's 4 10 right now um i'll give you guys 15 minutes to work a little bit on sound and then after i'll um maybe ask a few of you guys to share and i'll also talk about like some more things that we might use in the future like our events section okay so i'll stop trying okay so 15 minutes uh we'll come back at 4 25. hello for those of you who just um entered we are using 15 minutes to work on just sound effects that we are going to add to our project and we'll come back at 4 25. if you have any questions please message it in the chat and then i'll go over it okay so we have um we should come back now from working um someone asked where's the disappear block um is this for making the sprite disappear because um the sprite disappear would be in the looks block would be in the looks block um here and it says hide and that's how you make your sprite like disappear it just makes your right hide itself okay so the next thing we'll be talking about is the events um we briefly covered this in the beginning but basically they're just um conditions so when something happens and then below it something else will happen so when green flag is clicked our code will start running and this condition has to be met before anything at the bottom um happens at all so you can make when the space key is pressed i don't know make the character change colors and then you can do this throughout the game um you want you don't even need to use these at all unless they are activating your game so um if you have green flag over the code that basically runs your game you have to press it but if space the space key is only something like changing colors then and it's not important for your game you actually don't even need to press it the entire time that you're playing your game so these are um pretty useful for things that you might not want clogging up your regular um area here you can always make duplicates of these and then they'll both happen at the same time because they both have the same condition uh yeah and this will help you organize and also help you do things like changing whatever when something happens okay so we also have this if else if and then a condition then else this happens um this is different from the if statement because it says if this condition happens then um they would do this but if the condition is not met something completely different would happen so if we're talking about points and you wanted your character to get points every time you touch something but you wanted your character to lose points whenever they're not touching that thing you would do if sprite is touching that thing then points would go up else points would constantly be going down when the character is not touching that object um this is um a loop repeat until condition is met in java this would be a while loop while something is happening um keep repeating something um and then while that thing is not happening then the loop will end so it's kind of like a while loop but it's also different because this is waiting for a condition to be met and then the while loop is waiting for a condition to not be met so there are those um we also have our sensing here and all that stuff and we'll talk about a lot of these operators in the future as well as the variables um but yeah now that we've gone over that do you guys have a project that you want to share so um elizabeth and then sammy okay so elizabeth do you want to share okay um yeah you should have permission now thank you i have to get um it's not very impressive but it took a long time yeah no worries if you have any questions i can always help you with those okay i don't know if you can hear the music oh yeah we can hear oh and i see you added points there as well it's not really working really well today but it's fine if you do you have any questions on um some things in the game or like how to code something okay well then um sammy do you want to share next or oh is this your next episode in your game um this is the third one actually the third episode yeah it's pretty cool nice hmm what is the ice dragon there every so when i when the magic spell sound plays the i dragon says no and then it just disappears was the ice dragon there in the beginning um yeah it was i'll i'll show if you want me to if you want to see it again i can show you yeah can you share the screen again yeah oh okay so i need to do something yeah okay yes yay good episode i like that one yeah i made another episode two where um gigan pico meets these other three characters are you planning to make like a whole series with them yeah awesome yeah a lot of people who use scratch like to code um things like drawings or stories and yeah it just shows that scratch isn't only for coding games yeah is there anyone else who wants to share what they've done okay well um it's a little early to end class so i'll probably just talk a little bit about operators um and then we'll use that for next class so operators are you know things like addition subtraction multiplication and division and anything in the shape of an oval is supposed to be an integer or like a number so as you can see here um in this oval they have a number and uh these things are shaped as an oval you can actually put them in the spaces that have ovals in them so you can put it over there and uh that changes a lot of things because you can now like change the things while your code is running by using variables and there are things like pick random which basically picks a random number from one to ten and you can use this to play like to make games like um where you have to enter a number and then a computer enters a number and it could be like if you get the higher number then that was then the one generated by the computer you could win and then you can also change that into something like rock paper scissors where certain numbers mean rough and certain numbers mean paper and then stretching numbers mean scissor and then um play rock paper scissors against the computer which is always really fun to code um the one that are hexagons are boolean so they're true and false if this variable here is greater than 50 then the boolean there the boolean value will be true and then when the condition is true as we know usually things below will start to run okay so we talked about those integers booleans and then now we have string which is basically just words um if you join apple and banana you're basically combining the word and you'll get apple banana and then letter one of apple you see it is a oval which means that it is a not okay so it's a variable not um a number um for these cases there are numbers um the ovals actually i made a mistake before when i said it was integers they're actually variables and variables can be both integers and string yeah sami do you have a question operators are mostly math right yeah mostly mostly math for the integers but um in this case they're kind of logic based as well because um the strength here is uh the words here are less math and more like just dealing with words so like joining apple and banana you would get apple banana letter one of apple will return a the length of apple will count the amount of letters in the apple and then return that as a number value which would be five this i don't know word length of apple would be like how long how big a app like the object apple is yeah that um the thing is because the our code has to be really specific when it says length and then a word usually they have to find the length of the word itself because you can type something in here that's not even real like like just run random letters and then if it was calculating the you know the length of that in real life it wouldn't know how to because it doesn't um the thing doesn't exist so when it says length of and then a word what it's talking about is the length of the word itself and not the word the object that the word is referencing so yeah whenever um it says length of something a lot of the time it's counting the amount of objects in the thing so in this case the letters um absolute value i don't know if you learned that in your math class i'm sure you guys did though is um the distance between the numbered given and zero so negative four the distance between negative four and zero would still be four absolute value is basically just a positive value for every number um so if you give 2 the absolute value is 2. negative 2 they'll still be 2. that's just what absolute value means um yeah and then we have variables which we'll talk about in our next class so our next class will probably be a little bit longer than this one because can help like score point yeah you can make um let's make the variable right now actually and then i'll talk more about it next class points and then it'll show over there basically it shows you how much points how many points you're getting and you can change it so that it'll give you points whenever you do something and then you use these to you know change your variable set variable to a number change by number and then show up here or hide hide it up there um yeah for variables you can also make it so that they keep track of different things like location so let's say you're walking and you want to walk 10 spaces from wherever you are and then you want something to happen you can make it so that the points go up by 10 while you're walking and then when you reach a certain area it senses that the points um are over a certain number and then something could happen there so yeah points um i mean variables can be used for a lot of different things as long as you know how to use them um so hopefully next class there will be a lot of questions on it and then i can explain a lot on variables so yeah um that's it for today if no one has any more questions um yeah that's it for today then thank you guys for coming bye bye
