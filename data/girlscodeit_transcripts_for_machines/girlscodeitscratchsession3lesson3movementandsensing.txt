okay so 15 minutes is up um does anyone want to share one of their projects or the product that they were working on um can i share my project yes of course yeah um yeah i should have given you the ability to share your screen i think one second can you help me oh is this a like a tennis game kind of it's like uh you have to try to make the ball bounce it's kinda so you want the ball to bounce on the green like what's in it i'm trying to play it okay um i think um something to really spice up the game and let people know that they want to hit the green paddle might be to add like a point system in here like maybe every time the ball touches the green rectangle um the player gets points or something and then maybe have like levels where i don't know where the score is um yeah we'll cover that when we learn about variables but yeah it's pretty easy since today we talked about um sensing and stuff already it'll just be based off of sensing and stuff like that do you mind me looking in your code i just want to see what's going on in there yeah i'm just going to say stop sharing not stop code is this yeah it seems like the ball is like twisting when it's touching the paddle yeah but yeah it's a really nice game and i think it could really be made into something that's like really nice um to play and like if you post it um after you're done i think a lot of people would enjoy playing it yeah i don't really know how to post it though oh yeah don't don't worry about that right now um because i think once you post something um i'm like 70 sure that it's a little difficult for you to edit it later and then post it again so i would say complete your game first and then um share it to the public yeah okay um yeah right now it looks really good and um probably in the future you could add maybe some more levels and like a coin system with what we learned today with the background sprite interaction or like just background interaction in general i would like to share a project that i made yeah of course okay everyone who wants to share um is welcome to share so was that you um yeah okay one second let me go ask my dad if i can change thank you oh um hello for those who maybe join a little after my lesson let me go i made this new project called on a run good name okay the problem is that it's not running properly it's like just teleporting there um um so you did a move 30 steps 300 steps sorry yeah oh i think i have the solution so on your left you can probably see a block of code that says glide blank second or like glide one second to and then position glide one second to random position oh not to random position on the one that says glide one second two x um so not that one the one under the one underneath that one the one that says glide one second to x 107 and y negative 146 so you actually want to use um the line of code that's at the bottom um go back to your left and then go to the one below the glide to random position yeah the glide to an n coordinate and then um choose the coordinate that you wanted your character to stop at the coordinate yeah um so the coordinate is the one that says x and then y if you go to your right and it's a sprite and then you go walking yeah to the right of that um you'll see x and then y and then you'll see negative 204 negative 137 yeah um drag your character to where you wanted your character to go i want my character to go like here and then stop okay so then that would be um if you look down at the coordinates again 168 for x and then negative 141 for y 441 where do you want me to put the block of code um put it right where move 300 steps is like right under it or right above it um where it is so you can actually take that out um you can take the move 300 steps out okay and if you want your characters to always start from the beginning yeah you can do the when the flag is clicked go to and then the coordinates that they start off at so the coordinates that the um red one or the orange one whichever one you're clicking would be negative 186 negative 147 and you want your character to start there so go to the um your left again go down a bit oh you know sorry it's right there um it's under go to random position you go up um not that one if you go from there yeah go to and then x and y put it right under the first block so right under when flag is clicked or yeah that's a good place for it and the coordinates already in there so you don't actually have to change anything and then do the same thing for the other one okay as well yeah you don't need to change um that number since the character is already at the position unless you wanted your character to go somewhere else no that's good okay so you don't need to change any of the coordinates for that and then what is it for the top yeah go to and then you have to move your character back to where you wanted them to start off yeah so let's see um that's gonna be it and then that would be negative 205. and negative seventyone uh i'm making it like a tiny clip i'm making like i'm making it like a really short video oh a short video yeah okay so um do you have what you want to happen next already planned like what the next video is gonna be yeah like is is this video complete yeah oh okay awesome so i guess you can start working on hopefully that saved i think it did okay don't tell me it didn't save yes awesome yeah whenever i click it it just always saves it for me okay that's good i was just a little worried there yeah i think so i'm like brainstorming what the next episode is gonna be right now all right so once you have that done um what it's called brainstorming for your code i think it's called pseudocoding so what you're doing right now is pseudocode where you think of what you want to do and then you think of the code like the basic code outline that you think will do it you try it out and then um there probably will be some issues if it's rough it's a rough code and then the next process would be debugging the code and then fixing it so that it works the way you want it to so right now um it's good you're in the pseudoquitting step let's go um olivia or dylan or anyone else does anyone else want to share their project um no one else wants to share a project or like a game that they're working on or something they've done in the past if not then we could probably end the class here since i um unless anyone has questions about what i talk today with motions and sensing okay so next class is tomorrow um at 4 p.m still 4 p.m pacific standard time we'll be learning about sound um which would be a really good touch for games so i'll just see you guys then and then we'll send out a reminder for today and also tomorrow thank you guys bye
