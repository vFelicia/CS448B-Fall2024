okay so welcome thanks for joining us today to learn some python i hope you guys are as excited as i am um just for a brief introduction my name is rachel and i am an instructor for girls coded and i will be teaching this python course and i am also the other instructor and my name is moiseland and i'll also be teaching okay so this will be a um introductory course to python so if you do have experience with python then you might see some concepts that you've already learned before and um if you want some more information about our um if you want some more information about the course and our course content you can go on our website let's just get into the lesson today we'll be giving a basic introduction to python we'll just be going over some of the benefits and applications of python and then after we'll be writing a few lines of code um i will let morris take over after this loan okay so um what are the benefits of python python is very easy to learn because it has a clean syntax the code you'll be seeing later it's going to be very simple um hold on we'll give you an example later and it's very easy to understand which means that python is a good beginner python with a simple syntax can also get problem solved very fast because less lines are required to input a command um python also has a limited amount of libraries which means that python can be used for a variety of different ways such as graphing calculation and more also with python's massive support base this means that generally if you have any questions or problems you can always ask online for help because there are many people who knows how to use python's language also python is a good it's going to be used by a lot of companies which means that you can find a lot of jobs that have required python as a language and you will see why and how the language will be used in the next slide okay so um in web development python uses a serversided coding which means that it can interact with databases and files that are within the website an example is if you take a website like amazon all the products when you click on them are always different but the layout stays the same this is where serverside coding comes to work and in backend development is basically the same concept as web development which means like the code that operates behind the website so in software development um python is one of their many many languages that are supported so yeah and in data science in relation to web scripting works together because they both extract data and help display on the website for example a website called forecast watch extracts data from other sources and compiles all the data together which finally displays the collected data using a website code and in automation automation are kind of scripts where you can easily create to do very repetitive tasks or just save you some time an example this is creating a skip that a script that records a tv show that you like um during a certain time when it airs um in the last two mobile apps and artificial intelligence they both are they both um use python as one of their supportive languages and that'll be it and data science is definitely um one of the more common uses for python you can do a lot of things with data science such as creating libraries and there is actually there is a lot of free open source libraries that are open to the public so you could do a lot of cool things in data science like making graphs or data visualizations and yeah that's a really cool thing that we'll actually be going a little bit into later on in this course um now for some more general information on python python is an interpreted language so it is dynamic typed meaning that the reference type is determined on runtime and if you guys don't really get what this means um we will be going over it a little bit later on but basically what it means is that as you write the source code um it should the python will translate it into machine code so as an interpreted language this will do it when you run the program but if you compare it to something like java which is a static and compiled language then this the translation from the source code to the machine code will be before you actually run the program so a lot of people do use java because it is faster but python does have a lot of benefits as well python is also parsed through white space so this just means that it is really important that you make sure to indent and that you have the correct syntax or else python cannot read your code and what you're trying to do and again python is a super readable language since it has a really simple and clear syntax so the reader can really easily understand your code and your text and down here you will see these three arrows and this is what you call a chevron and this basically tells you that you are in the python interpreter and i can show you guys and rebel it really quickly which we'll be signing up for a little bit later in this lesson but um if you can see my cursor um can you guys see my cursor yeah okay so here this orange arrow in the interpreter side this is basically how replit writes the chevron it's just one arrow here but normally it is three arrows okay so this is just a comparison of the java versus the python syntax tags you can see that java is definitely much longer to just print out hello world into the console whereas python is just one line and um here are just some common types of errors what errors are are basically when python can't really understand or interpret your code say you made a type typo it doesn't mean that your program is bad at all it just means that python can't read what you're trying to say or can't understand what you're trying to say and usually these errors will pop up something like huge red letters you won't miss it and yeah the one of the more common types of errors is a syntax error which is basically when you write code that violates some of the grammatical errors so if you make some typos or you don't have the correct indentation as i mentioned before since python is a white space parse language um it will shoot you back an error if you're missing a quotation mark and as shown in the second line there's missing a quotation mark you will also get a syntax error message when you're on your code now for logic errors these are more difficult to debug this is when you think the program is right there aren't really any grammatical errors or syntax errors but the results just aren't what you expected they're really unpredictable and can sometimes make your program crash uh if you do have any problems with this as you go through the course please again go to our website fill out the tutoring request form and you can ask us any questions and the volunteers will try to get back to you as soon as possible now for exceptions these errors basically just indicate what happened they're not really fatal to your program but some examples are say you divided by zero which um you can't really do so it will just shoot you back an exception error um another thing could be if you try to print out a variable that you haven't declared before and that will also give you an exception error and these errors are usually handled with try and accept statements and we will be going over trying to accept statements later on in the course so you don't have to worry about that just yet and now we will just uh help you guys set up the replay account and morris will walk you through this okay so to um set up a reference account you want to click the link that rachel is going to link very soon or you can just go to repl ip and i'll give you some time for you guys to go to the website okay so once you're you are on the website you want to enter in your information that you want and yeah and make sure you are you log in for yeah so you're gonna get a popup where it's gonna ask you some questions about yourself it doesn't really matter what you put you just can fill it out based on who you are and once you're finished with that you're gonna um you'll get another popup where it's to um prompt you to ask it prompts you to select three languages you wanna of course put python as one of them and for the other two i suggest you guys to put java h and html css and js or javascript because you we will be teaching those in future courses and i'll just wait for you guys to photograph so on the very top right of your screen there's going to be a plus button and what you want to do is you're going to press the plus button to create a new replica and once you click on it you're going to prompt for a language so like to select python as plain language and once you click on language on the language you want you're going to there's going to be a randomly generated name it doesn't really matter what you click you can name it just any pretty much anything you want you can just leave it at the default meeting that is generated for you and i'll give you guys some time to do that everyone's done so now that we have our replay account all created we can start coding hope everyone's excited it's gonna be pretty difficult to switch between the tabs but make it work okay cool so replied will be the ide that we will be using um to run our code so we can just start by printing our first line of code um you guys can try this along with me just print out hello world and this this line basically just says um you will have to have the print function here with parentheses and then inside is whatever you want to print into the interpreter here and you guys will see once you press the green run button it will print hello world and this is a string you'll know this because um there are quotation marks around hello world but say you wanted to print something like an integer like one two three then you do not need to include the quotation marks around the numbers and this will just print one two three like so but you could also convert this into a string and it will print the same thing and don't worry too much about these data type strings and integers we will go over that more in the next lesson okay um i can just demonstrate how to print string again i want to print hi super high but say um you forgot a quotation mark then you will get the syntax error as i mentioned before and then it will try to guess um kind of what your error is and you can debug it and fix it like so it'll run saying hi and yeah python does not need a semicolon yeah python the syntax super clean no semicolon um no brackets really yeah really great language okay here this is um basically just saying um to print a variable so basically a equals 24 um the value 24 is being stored in the variable a so a is initialized that's 24 and if you want to print the value of a you can do so like this and it will print 24 in the interpreter and if you're not really sure what variables are and again if you don't really know what these data types are we will be going over it in our next lesson so don't worry too much about that now and now for input statements um this basically allows you to um print out a question and then have the user input their own response and then whatever the user inputs will be stored inside this variable a and then i will just show you guys how to do that oh yeah if i'm going too fast or if you guys have any questions please just let me know in the chat or you're going to need yourselves let me check the chat real quick okay that's cool i'll just show you guys the input statements equals what so here on the side here it printed what is your name into the editor and then it asks for your input so i would put rachel and then you can see that it was stored inside the variable ace as it was printed below here let's say you wanted to print something like hi with this variable a so it would say hi rachel then you can do hi and then comma a and this comma basically it concatenates the string together um but the comma uh creates a space between um hi and a show you guys here and i'll say hi rachel with this facebook team you could also do this with a plus sign but then the plus sign will not put any spacing in between so you'll have to manually do that yourselves and you can do any input here i can do morris and it will print high morphs is everyone good with that does anyone have any questions okay since we have um a lot more time for this lesson we could show a video and these will just give you a better idea of how you can apply python um yeah what how what applications you can do with python in this video i'm going to answer the top three questions my students asked me about python what is python what you can do with it and why is it so popular in other words what does it do that other programming languages don't python is the world's fastest growing and most popular programming language not just amongst software engineers but also amongst mathematicians data analysts scientists accountants network engineers and even kids because it's a very beginner friendly programming language so people from different disciplines use python for a variety of different tasks such as data analysis and visualization artificial intelligence and machine learning automation in fact this is one of the big uses of python amongst people who are not software developers if you constantly have to do boring repetitive tasks such as copying files and folders around renaming them uploading them to a server you can easily write a python sorry to automate all that and save you time and that's just one example if you continuously have to work with excel spreadsheets pdfs csv files download websites and parse them you can automate all that stuff with python so you don't have to be a software developer use python you could be an accountant a mathematician or a scientist and use python to make your life easier you can also use python to build web mobile and desktop applications as well as software testing or even hacking so python is a multipurpose language now if you have some programming experience you might say but we can do all this stuff with other programming languages so what's the big deal about python here are a few reasons with python you can solve complex problems in less time with fewer lines of code here's an example let's say we want to extract the first three letters of the text hello world this is the code we have to write in c sharp this is how we do it in javascript and here's how we do it in python see how short and clean the language is and that's just the beginning python makes a lot of trivial things really easy with a simple yet powerful syntax here are a few other reasons why python is so popular it's a high level language so you don't have to worry about complex tasks such as memory management like you do in c plus plus it's cross platform which means you can build and run python applications on windows mac and linux it has a huge community so whenever you get stuck there is someone out there to help it has a large ecosystem of libraries frameworks and tools which means whatever you want to do it is likely that someone else has done it before because python has been around for over 20 years so in a nutshell python is a multipurpose language with a simple clean and beginner friendly syntax all of that means python is awesome technically everything you do with python you can do with other programming languages but python simplicity and elegance has made it grow way more than other programming languages that's why it's the number one language employers are looking for so whether you are a programmer or an absolute beginner learning python opens up lots of job opportunities to you in fact the average python developer earns a whopping hundred and sixteen thousand dollars a year if you found this video helpful please support my hard work by liking it okay hope you guys enjoyed that video do have a lot more time left we could go over this workshop that is completely optional since there are a couple of concepts um that we haven't really gone too in depth with and we will be going more in depth about them in the next lesson but basically what this workshop entails is that um it is a mad libs workshop so you want to have like questions for the user to input their own answers so questions like what is your name what is your age and then let the user respond with anything that fits these conditions and then um whatever they respond will be inputted into this preprepared string that you guys will create and so here is an example say the user inputted taylor swift for a celebrity then it will be added into the string taylor swift is one of the best selling and then the same thing will happen for these so taylor swift is one of the bestselling gorillas as of hanukkah of 2020. yeah and i can give you guys an example about how this will work okay so you can initialize a variable called name with um actually yeah you can initialize it with the input what is your name and then you can do another one that is say age you can ask the user's input about what their age is i'm really sorry for the lag and then for the third variable you could put a pet and then you can ask the user name a pet and then below here you want to print out a string that utilized that and concatenates the variables with the string so you could say something like my name is and then you will assign and then you put in the variable you want to input so here would be name and then you could put i am i'm sorry i forgot to add another plus sign here but i am and another plus sign and then put in the variable age and then another plus sign and then you could say and i have a put in the variable x should run smoothly um what is your name i'll put rachel what is your age 16 and then name a pet dog oh there was a spacing issue but here you can see it says my name is rachel i am 16 and i have a dog and that's generally what mad libs is and how you would do it um so if you guys want to try that out right now you guys could and if you have any questions you can ask us or we want i can do another one um if you guys have some fun variables you want to create first a fun story you guys want me to create and i can just visual give you guys a visualization of that the input function yes okay so we will be again going over this more in depth in the next lesson um so basically this input function here you type in the input function and then it prints out what is your name or whatever you put in between the parenthesis it prints it out into the interpreter here it prints it out into the interpreter what is your name here and the input function here asks the user to input whatever they want you could input a string an integer anything like that and then whatever the user inputs will be stored inside this variable you can create any type of variable we'll be going over variables more later but yeah it stores this input into the variable here in this case it'll be name and then since this input ratio is stored inside name you can call declare the variable um you can call the variable sorry you can call the variable in um this print function here if that makes sense um does that make sense oh yeah oh rachel um someone has a question of um whether the slides are going to be sent to the participant oh yeah so this um this uh lesson is being recorded and then we are going to be uploading it on our website so you guys can rewatch it as many times as you need okay yeah i can show how i name i added my name to the box so here it's just what is your name it asks for my input so here i can type anything i want i can type precontrol here or i can type in morris um you can type in anything and then from here you just press enter and it basically that's all you need to do to get this to be stored inside of the variable name is that did i answer your question liesl if that's how i pronounce it i'm sorry okay okay cool um i think i'll just be concluding this meeting thanks everyone for joining us today just to learn a little bit about python and coding um if you need any help please feel free to reach out to us you can go to you can email us at girlscodepv gmail.com or you can email me um with the email i sent you guys with the link with um or you can go on our website i will show you guys up here you will see on the bar the button free tutoring you can click that and then you can just scroll down to this button book and from here you just fill out the form and ask your questions and one of the volunteers will try to um answer them as soon as they see it yeah that concludes our lesson thanks everyone for coming i hope you guys enjoyed this lesson bye bye
