okay guys hello welcome to java second class um well the second class in the session um uh we're really glad to have you here and hopefully more people will join later but we're just gonna get started now um i'm alex one of your java teachers as you remember from yesterday i'm andre doing it i want to introduce myself hi i'm andrea and i'm also one of your drama instructors um and i'm candace and i'm your other java instructor hey okay so we're gonna get started with our lesson um just let me share a screen okay so today we'll be talking about scanner yeah and so okay we're gonna be learning about scanner today and scanner is like this useful tool that allows you to get user input so what that means is like for example if we have like a website like gmail or facebook or something and it asks you for like your username then the user can enter their username and stuff so or like in their password so it's kind of like interacting with your computer like yeah with computer and the user so um candace andrea could you do i'm sending them sending the link really quick okay andrea yeah wait what wait are you doing the second slide oh um i thought i was gonna send like the link again i'm sending the link could you do it oh can i do the second slide yeah okay sure okay so to use scanner first you want to import it like right here it says to import scanner so what that does is it just gives you like the ability to use the scanner and um yeah uh we're going to go over an example in the next slide but basically you import it like right above the class stain which um alex will show later so first you need to import it and then we also need to create a scanner tool so to do that we just use this keyword scanner and then this thing is like the name of your scanner so you can name it like input keyboard user whatever you want and then you use this equal sign and then this new which just means you're creating like a new scanner and new scanner and then parentheses system dot in and parentheses and as always your semicolon so yeah next um this we have a system.out.printline so this part enter a number is just something that like prompts or like asks the user to enter something like a number and then to use that to like get user input sorry we have to do something called input which is the uh what we named our scanner and then something called dot next int and dot next and just gives you like an integer or um stores an integer value so um and then we have to store this in a end variable because um just so that we can use what the user inputted and yeah okay so this can be a lot of steps all in a row that seem kind of random but once you do it a few times you'll get used to um using all of them so now we're going to do an example of how to use a scanner so you all want to open your bluej or whatever code compiler you're using and then you're going to want to create a new class for today so the new class button in the top left and then just name it whatever i'm just talking and then double click on the new brown box and you should get a screen with all of this code that looks complicated and confusing and we're just gonna delete all of them and start new class um you can follow along with me in typing all this out or i can copy paste it into the chat once i'm done with all of the like foundation code problematic void main string arcs okay so i put it in the chat what did i do um okay so if you guys have that typed out we're going to start like andrea said before um the first thing we need to do is import the ability for the class to use the scanner tool um it's going to be all the way up here above your class name um you're going to type import java youtube dot scanner um and again you can name a class anything you want up here so we have to type that step up there and then the second thing we need to is to make your scanner tool like andrea said before um and also like you can see a powerpoint over on the right here we're going to type scanner you can name this anything i'll just go with input equal new inner system in and that is how you make your center tool um okay and so now you're free to start using your scanner i'm just going to ask the user for a random number uh so that they know that they can put something in uh so to do that we're going to print a statement like we taught yesterday um and just go enter an integer really let's make enter a whole number so like we yesterday this um this is now going to be printed out to the user and see that and then when they see that they're going to go oh okay so i'm going to type a number into the computer and press enter so a third to um that number that they typed in uh we're going to do as it says in this slide and create an integer value and enter your variable to hold that number so let's say this yesterday we're making an integer variable so we go in and then any random name so i'm just going to call it user answer and then it equals and then to use a scanner here we're going to type input because it's the same thing this word and this word dot and then next it to get the integer variable that the user typed in so that should be the basics of how to use a scanner and that this program should ask the user for a whole number and then store that number in an int variable i'm just going to compile and run it just to check that it works so the compile button as you remember is up here and then down here you right click on the brown box then click the second option okay and so it's going to ask to enter a whole number um chantal why don't you give us a random whole number honey sure see like since it like opens the ability to type into this box i realize that i make it like the answer actually we're gonna do that now then i'm just gonna print out their answer back to them you typed and then just going to print out the variable that we stored that value in compile it again oh shoot run the code it asks for a whole number we put in a whole number and it grabbed our variable and used it so yeah um yeah so like this thing might be kind of like awesome to you guys but i think after more practice and just more exercises you can like quickly get the hang of it and so yeah like right now it might be really like a lot of stuff like thrown at you but like with more practice i'm sure you guys can like get used to it but um if any of you guys have any questions then feel free to tell us or you can type in a chat or like yeah all right so um as you can see on the powerpoint it says reading other data types so right now in the example that alex just did we did an int variable um by using input.nextint but we can also use other data types and if you remember from yesterday when we talked about the different variables we also had double which is a number just with a decimal and we had a string which is like any text or anything like that so we can also read those data types using the different uh different things that we see on the powerpoint so it's pretty much gonna work it works the same way as the instance um where you do dot next except for double if you want to do a double then you do dot next double if you want to do a string you could do dot next line or yeah so dot next line if you want to do a boolean which i know we didn't talk a lot about but that's where you just have a true or false then you could do dot next boolean um and dot next is just going to so the last one which is just dot next and that's going to pick up anything but it'll only pick up the first thing that shows up so for example if you typed in like orange juice um it would only pick up the orange because you have that space separating it so in the case of two word inputs like orange juice then you would want to do um dot next line in order to pick up everything but yeah so it works the same way you would do the name of your scanner in this case the name is input and then dot next and then whatever data type you want to pick up we're just going to try um some examples for all of these methods um in your coder in your compiler um so the first one we're going to do is double so remember double as a decimal note though i'm just going to ask to enter a decimal number and basically the only thing that's different is this statement instead of next int um we're going to go next double so the computer knows and then we need to change our variable type yep you're right um because yeah it's a different type of variable um i guess i'll run it and here's the window oh well this is still from last time but enter a decimal number uh does someone want to just give us a random decimal okay whatever um i'm going to take three that's a decimal and it works here because uh it's a double and we changed it to reflect that um now one of the more common ones is you want to get a string a sentence or a word from your user so we're going to use next line for string uh notice that it's not dotnet it's done um just something you have a chat for and so we change that to dot next line and maybe enter a sentence and of course we have to change this to a string variable um we're going to run that really quick just so you can see that it works um does anyone have a random sentence we want to put in coding is cool okay is cool we're gonna put that in and if it back out to us um so you see here it took the sentence coding is cool a string stored it in a string variable and then printed it back out to us alex just to show them why don't you try doing just dot next and don't do the dot next point sure um so dot next is slightly different from the other ones uh it should only take in the first like word um in the string so we're gonna go with coding is cool again and so since we use dot next it only grabbed the first word and stored that and printed back up do you guys have any questions about this before so far want us to go slower or want to repeat anything like that all right okay so a little okay a little okay so just to recap scanner is um this tool that allows you to get like user input so the user can enter something and the computer can store it in a variable to like whatever they want to do with it so to use scanner we have to import it and um import java.util.scanner semicolon and we also have to create a new scanner and then afterwards we import it and create a new scanner then we can use it and we use it by just calling the scanner like what we named our scanner so in this example i need my scanner input so to just use scanner you just call it by the scanner name and then dot next whatever um whatever like type it is so like if it's a strain or if it's an integer or a double which is like a decimal so yeah you would do dot next line or dot next it um before we get into this madness game let's let's try something um we can kind of combine what we learned yesterday with the like in variables or decimals uh doubles so alex why don't we try something where like we um have the user enter in like dimensions of like a box or a cube or a triangle and then it could print out you know multiply uh whatever you're trying to do and then you could find like the volume or the area or something like that so we could kind of combine scanner with stuff that we did yesterday sure okay so you guys know that coding is really useful and it can be used uh to help us do a lot of rudimentary functions um so now we're going to find the volume of a rectangular prism given the length width and height um you've probably learned how to do do this in school but basically to find the volume of like a box you just need its dimensions so we're going to write a program that asks the user for the length width and height of a box and then it should spit out the volume of that so okay so first we're going to need to ask the user for those we're going to do that separately um what is the length of the box um as always we end with a semicolon and then we're going to make a double variable that is going to store the length um so that's going to be input.next double you can also use int but i'm just going to go with double because they might want to um and we're going to need to do the exact same thing for the width and the height so and if you wanted to try this with any other shape or anything like that um it's the exact same concept um like if you want to do triangle you just ask for the base and then the height and just you know do a formula for that um so if you want to try something different please feel free to do that as well it's fun to experiment yep okay so once you have this all typed out actually i'm going to give you a minute to do that like candace said like feel free to do any shape you want or just i'm just gonna go with a box but you can do anything okay so there are a few ways you can do this but i always feel like the easiest way is just to make a different variable to store the volume and then we can print that out to the user so that they can see it um so we're going to make a variable a double variable called volume that's going to where we're going to calculate and store the actual volume of the box and to get the volume we'd multiply the length the width and the height together again like this is something you probably learn in math class but if you haven't yet it's okay it's a really simple formula so as we said yesterday to multiply it in java we're just going to use an asterisk a star and that should give us our volume um and then finally we're going to want to print this volume out to the user so this is going to use another print statement like we used above and like we talked about yesterday um system dot out dot print line and we're going to tell the user volume box is and then we're combining um different things to print out in this single statement and we're just going to print out the variable volume um i remind you that it's really important we don't put quotations around this variable um because if we did this it would just print out the volume of this box is volume but we don't want to print out the word volume we want to print out the variable volume because that's going to give us the actual number so that's what i'm going to type out i'll give you another minute to like up if you haven't already and like how alex has said before about how there's multiple ways to do this um what she might is that like right here we created a variable called volume which multiplies length width and height um you could skip that all together and directly print out so in your system.print ln line um instead of writing plus volume you could do just directly length times width times height um it would print out the same thing it's just a matter of preference um so yeah you could do it any way you want you like uh we're just doing it where you create the variable first and then you print out the variable yeah like candice was saying instead of doing what i did you can do it like this and it should give you the same output but i personally just like to create a variable because oops this is a good idea when you uh code like longer codes so maybe you want to use the volume again later and then you don't have to type it out again but yep okay so i'm going to run it um if you're falling behind or you think we're moving too fast please just let us know and we'll like wait and pause for you uh like never feel afraid to speak up or anything so we're going to compile this code go to the round box right click second option okay so does someone want to give me a random length a double var example double value that is caitlyn do you want to give us a random double 10 okay sounds good um nikki how about a width five okay and then why don't we do it um like a decimal one for the next one sure ellie do you want to give us a decimal uh 7.5 okay sounds great so now we have three double values and then it gave us the volume of the box is 375. i don't know if that's actually right um i think it is yeah right doesn't have questions or did anyone have errors in their code that you want us to help you work out or anything like that nope no everyone's good to go don't ever be afraid to ask for help that's what we're here for all right should we move on to the last activity thing yep sounds good so i'm just going to delete all of this code but you can comment it out or save it in another class um so we're going to move on to our final activity which is basically mad libs um this is like you might have played mad libs before with your friends it's like a game where we have a prewritten story with like certain words that are just blank and then the players come up with the random words to put into that story when they don't exactly know what the story is so anyway it should come out to be funny and um it's a great way to practice using scanner um okay so we're going to make up a story you guys can do it however you want but i'm just going to um give the example up here um so the first thing we're going to need in our story is the name of our character so i'm going to type code that asks the user to give a name i'm so like um and then like before we're going to want to make a string variable not like before we like we're going to want to make a variable to store the user's answer in and since this is a name a word we're going to use a string variable to store that and then like you remember input dot next line for strings um actually that is really awkward wording so what is the character's name um we're going to do an adjective now um um type in an adjective a description word and then i think we're able to store that um we're going to do just for the sake of an integer variable we're going to do an age so type a whole number oh typo this is not a string um this is an h and we're going to get in it um one more for now we're going to do type of pet um and then store that nash okay so i'll just give you a couple of minutes to like finish your own maybe you want to do different types of variables and i did or like different questions um give you a couple minutes for that and then we'll move on so uh yes okay um okay so now that we have our variables we're going to start writing our story um this is going to um print the story out to the user so we're just going to use a print statement um okay we're going to start our story by going the character's name went for a walk um and to get the character's name we're just going to use the name variable that we made earlier um so name plus because name remember we're not going to put that in the quotations because we're going to call the actual variable and not just type the word name um actually we're going to say how old the character is um we could say like when you're walking this many objects something like that you're not gonna use the number for me okay um oops okay name went for a walk oh also notice i'm putting all these spaces like at the beginning and end of the quotations because if we didn't it would just the computer is not going to recognize that we need a space between words and it's just going to go alicia went instead of alicia space woman so that's something that people get tripped up on all the time but it's a really easy fix um he could be a he saw and then it's time to use our okay i guess it's not an age anymore number and then we can do enter if we think it like looks better or just for organization um so it the a single line of code doesn't just run all the coffee page but like there are very specific places where you can do that um on number i don't even know um butterflies uh she went okay i remember why i wanted to do pets so she went on a walk with her pet um is it we asked for that earlier um and we stored it in the variable pet so right now i'm going to read i'm just going to put in random things right now alicia went for a walk with her pet jaguar she saw 12 twelve butterflies and we have an adjective so we're just gonna use that to describe butterflies um oh but notice we need a space between the number and the adjective because well the computer is not going to recognize that there are two different words so space and there we go um i think that should be good so i'm going to run this code does that have any more time to write your own um sentence or copy down whatever it says can you scroll back like sideways oh alex do you wanna maybe just extend your screen there you go yeah just full screen i'll give y'all a few minutes to finish typing or like to make up your own story so okay all right does anyone need more time or are we good to try to run it okay so i'm just going to compile it up here and then run it so yeah it asks us for a random name um does someone want to give us a random name um ellie do you want to give us just a name um alex great okay um an adjective so like this can be pretty much anything don't think about like what it's what would make sense just like any adjective to make it funny um nikki silly um a whole number caitlyn do you want to give a random whole number 11 sure sounds great oh well all right let's fix that error okay so basically if you guys see how um after says type in an animal right we should have been able to type in like dog cat giraffe camel whatever we wanted um but i skipped over it and directly went to the next thing which was to print out our whole um it's called whole sentence i guess um so the way the reason that happens basically i'll see if i can try to explain this is um if you see uh back to the code um this happened after our int number software says type in a whole number so basically what happens is if you think about kind of you have like a curse on your computer and it picks up whatever is next to it so after the int it it stays at the end of that line um and we need it to go to the next line in order to pick up what we are going to write there so because the int it stays there and it doesn't move to the next line that's why it skips over the type in an animal so the way you could fix that is to kind of think about like consuming that extra space and then so then you can move over to the next line so the way you do that is after um where it says number equals input.nextint after that and before the the next one that you want to get before the string pad equals input on next line and what you're just going to do is input dot next and i think um i think that should fix it if not so yes what this is going to do it's going to get rid of that it's going to move the cursor from the end where there's nothing after to the next line where you can then type something in and then it'll gather that and put it into your next variable so hopefully this works okay we'll see and so much of coding is about troubleshooting so this should be common um okay we're not going to go through asking again just do what we had before um hello yes okay that didn't okay try pressing enter uh okay that did not work so let's stop next line next oh yeah you might have to do that next one i feel so as you guys could see errors are very very common in java um as you do more and more errors will hopefully decrease but um do you put it here um do you want me to try dot next one dude dot next line where we had it before try that okay hmm yay uh i'm just gonna go for yay okay so that worked um so i mean this is a pretty that's a pretty common error when working with scanner um so the reason why next line worked and just dot next didn't was because dot next line that's why it moves to the next line it was my bad i'm sorry about that but next it wouldn't move it so you need that next line in order to move from the end back to the next line where you can then input your next variable so yeah there's our little uh fun little mad loves game um again you can do anything you want make it longer shorter different kinds of variables different kind of story that's just a little simple thing to um i guess incorporate all the things that we learned from today and yesterday as well so so we have five minutes um you can use time to like maybe make even more labels up here that um we ask for so that we can make a more complicated story or if you want you are free to go uh does anyone have any final questions about anything all right cool so i think our next um next lesson is next saturday i think um wednesday isn't it oh yeah i think it's next saturday yeah it's saturday yeah um i have a question actually um about the tutoring that i saw in the email is that you know something we can use to communicate with you about questions um um did i send you the email yesterday or was it a different email um i've just seen at least maybe in a few emails that there's some kind of tutoring component on you know your website and i'm wondering if it's like you can just yeah like go there not during class times with yeah so the tutoring thing um i believe it's if you sign up then you could sign up for like a 30 minute um like one on one with one of the girls coded volunteers um as for just quick questions i think i don't think there's currently a function on the on the site where you can just type in a quick question um i'm not sure really alex you know andrea if i think they said they're trying to work on it but i don't think that we have a function like that yet um but the tutoring yeah so if you sign up for that um you could sign up for a 30minute session and then um you and whoever like whichever volunteer you're dealing with would work out a time together um through like zoom or google meets or something like that and then i'll work on something there does that kind of make sense to your question um yeah i think so um yeah thank you yeah no problem yes as for just quick questions i don't think we have anything on the site yet i think they might be working on it i'm not a hundred percent sure um hopefully we can get something like that soon that'll be pretty cool yeah yeah right now sorry but you might just want to try googling it or saving it the next class when you can ask us okay that's true also thank you yeah thank you all so much for coming i hope you enjoyed it and learn something new yeah um from now on you can always practice or go back and try to code your own little something and we just hope you have fun you
