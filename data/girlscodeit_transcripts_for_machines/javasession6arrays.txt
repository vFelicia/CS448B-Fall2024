this is our sixth lesson i believe on arrays in java and we're going to be covering what our arrays and what do we use them for so arrays an array is a collection of data it's used to hold multiple related values at the same time in one collection so it's kind of like a list of different pieces of data so an object that an array is an object it holds a fixed number of values of a single type so you can only have like strings in it or you can only have numbers in it you can't combine those two also you cannot change the size of an array so you can't change the number of things inside of it once you define it so you can have an array of type integer of type double of type string etc you just can't combine them and if it helps you um you can visualize an array as a table so like a little like table down here um and each of those little boxes is like a piece of data in the array like a piece of text or a number so does everyone understand this are there any questions just about very basic introduction to arrays thumbs up that's good okay everyone looks good so let's keep going so index so to access things in an array you need to use their index and an index is just like the number that represents the position of an item in the array so each element of an array each item in it has an index number depending on where it is in the array and so you can keep track of the specific element and you can like reference it and use it in your code a very important thing in most programming languages and especially in java is that you start counting at index number zero so the first item in an array it does not have an index number one it has an index number of zero so in this example down here we have an array of numbers and it starts at seven and we have 11 6 55 etc however the index number so like the the index number of the first element is zero and not one so if you want to get the number seven or the first item in this array you would have to use zero so the number is zero and then the second item is number one third item is number two and so on until the end of your array um how to create an array now important um so this is like your this basic way of creating an array and this doesn't put anything in it this just makes like the remember on a couple of slides there was like this blank one so you're just going to make like that blank row of um of possible elements so you start with saying the data type so in this case we're making an array of integers so you put int and you put two square brackets and then you put the name of the array in this case array one and then that equals a new we put the data type again so int and then put the square brackets again except this time in square brackets you're putting the size of the array so if you want there to be five elements in your array and you can't change this so i guess be careful with that um you just put a number five there and so now after this step only after that can you actually start putting numbers into your array and you can put up to five numbers in here um there is however another way you can make an array and this is usually a little easier uh but it depends on your on what you want to do with it but um in this in this case you're actually putting the numbers in it from the start so you start of course with the data type and your um square brackets the name of the array array one equals mu you type again square brackets and after that on the same line you have curly brackets and then inside you put all of the elements in the array so in this case the first element located at index 0 would be one and the second element element located at index um one would be two so this way you can actually put everything in an array from the start um and it ought and you kind of automatically tell it how big it is so there's five numbers so it's obviously going to have a fixed size of five you can't change so in our next slide here you can see you're printing out you have to put semicolons at the end as well so let's continue um the next now that we know how to make an array we can learn how to like get things from an array and print them out so to access an element in an array you can use as index in brackets you can print use using system.out.print so to get an item in an array you would use its name so you can see in pink array one or two and then you put two like um square brackets and then inside the square brackets you put the index number so if you want to get the first element of an array you would put a 0 in there and that would print the element at index 0 and then if you want to print an element at index 3 you would put a 3 and that is the fourth item so the zero thing might be a little confusing but yeah i'll set the demo link right now sorry about that um so there's a demo to explain this concept a little better that is a demo uh make sure you fork the demo uh before editing it all right so in this demo we just have a little scanner to get user input and then we have an array right here so this is an array of movies it's a string array um so string movies equals mu string excuse me and then you can see the curly bracket way of making an array so there's curly brackets and then it just lists off each item and each item has like a comma between just so you can separate them and so this has one two three four five movies and then um actually i'm gonna fork this as well just so i can play around with it on my own so uh and then it asks which movie should you watch today pick a number from between uh one and five and then based on that uh number it like prints a movie for you uh make sure to subtract one because arrays always start at the index of zero so when it here is uh how you're getting an item from the array and as you can see the index number that you're using in in between the square brackets takes away one from what you input because if you want to watch the first movie you would normally put in one right but to get the first element of an array it's an index zero so you have to be taking away one and so you just type in a number and it gives you the fourth item in the array uh one two three four is sonic the hedgehog um this is a really cute demo um yeah so make sure when you're getting an item from an array you're using the square brackets and then putting your number inside of them um okay so now that we know how to get an item from an array and print it out um we can also talk about the length of an array so you can find the length of an array or the number of elements in an array the number of things in it and you can get that using array dot length so array being just the name of your array and then dot length so if you want to put that an integer you can just go int length equals array one dot length so array one being your array um and yeah you have to be aware that length is not the same as index so have an array with six elements um like the one in our example here the last index number is five because you started zero and you got the five yeah yeah and if you forget this you can get a little error um so in our little array down here uh index the first item has an index of zero and the sixth item has an index of five so an important concept that's what we saw in the last demo um making sure that you know the difference between its index number and its like position in the array because like the position can be the first the first item but its index is zero pretty much um i hope everyone's doing okay if you want to print an entire array so go through every single item in an array and i'll show you the demo um you can use a for loop so you just get this you just get the demo right here and send it to everyone if i can get the chat chat there you go so make sure you fork the demo um let's open it up um fork it so um because there is there's no builtin way to print an array you have to iterate through every item in your array and print them out so in our example here we make a an empty string an empty array sorry of strings string fruits equals mu string five so that makes a string array with five that can have five elements in it you the first element is grapes apple banana strawberry orange etc and then down here you have a for loop to print out everything so the for loop if you remember for loops you start at zero because i is zero um i is less than fruits.length so fruits fruits.length is 5 so i only goes up to 4 because once it hits 5 5 is no longer less than 5. and then it increments by one each time and then you can print out fruits i so it started zero and it would print out grapes and apple banana strawberry orange and then when i would get to five it would stop um so you can just run that and you can see how it prints out all of the fruit um at the end it says hope you found something you liked if not how would you add another fruit also i plus plus so someone asked um what does i plus plus mean that just means um add one so you can change i plus plus to plus equals one it's just a shorthand way of adding one to eye um okay so at the at the bottom it says if not how would you add another fruit so let's say you wanted to add like um a lemon to this array does does anyone have any possible guesses about how you would add another item to the array a sixth item i'll give you a hint you would go on to this line and you would make something equal to lemon like that uh you can you would put fruits five if that is the yeah so it's five someone typed it that is correct um five would be the next item in the array after four you can just run that um oh you would also have to change this to a six sorry i didn't realize that but yeah yeah yes thank you thank you two people realized a good job you you caught that for me thank you so you would also have to say six up here because otherwise you would get the error i just got but other than that you can keep adding every as many things as you want as long as you're changing this number here and you're adding it here the for loop it runs off of fruit stock length so because you're using fruit stock length it will automatically change whenever you add something new in here and whenever you change this number so um yeah go ahead and try that out adding fruits and things to to your array to your demo so we have two more demos to go through i believe let's continue so now i can move on to printing an entire array with the for each loop so this this does the same thing as the for loop it's like font like it does fundamentally the same thing except we do it a different way so this iterates through every item element in the loop without relying on index so this is a new kind of loop called a for each loop and here's what it looks like for it number array one system about that print number so for each number in an array you can print out the number um let's i'll send everyone the demo for this one let's make sure you fork it but here it is um i'm just gonna fork that yeah now wait a second make sure everyone's ready for this little demo so in this demo we have a string of veggies this time and this time they're all the array is initiated so it's created and all the elements are added on the same line so this one's convenient because i don't have to change a number in here i can just like comma and then add another item um and then ask which vegetables do you sell and then you have your little loop so if you want to do a for each loop um you would need to you need an array first of all to use this loop and then inside your round brackets you would first put the data type of your array so we have a string up here so you would put string down here and then you would put a name that basically would represent one item in your in your array you can change that to whatever you want it doesn't really matter and then you would put a colon in the middle and then you would put the name of your array and then inside of your for loop you can now use this like symbol to represent every item in your array to to print it out so if you run that it will print everything out uh by going through each item um we can also try something else where we can have it print the length of each string this depends on how many letters there are so that's just how you can see it um maybe a little more advanced printing out more things so you can use these for each loops pretty conveniently because they're a little simpler than a for loop they're easier to understand so you don't need to use index at all here and if you want to add a new item for this type of array declaration you can just you know type in um can't think of a vegetable for some reason right now um a tomato like that and it would do that um it would add it to the array and then it would get printed out in our for each loop so we only have one more demo left i think and it's all of them progressively get more complicated so um do ask any questions at any point if you have some um our last concept is a search so it's called linear search that doesn't really matter but it's just the simplest way to search an array for an element so if you want to find something in an array this is the easiest way to do it so in our example we're using a for each loop and first you declare your desired number so if you want to find a specific number in the array and you go through every number in the array if the number in the array is equal to the number you want your desired number you can print out that the number was found this is the the concept we're looking at in this demo so i'll just send that in the chat and make sure you fork before editing and this one is a little more complex looking but fundamentally it's pretty simple so in this example of search if you want to find something in the right we're going to use input in this case and then we have a another string array called database and all the things are listed here they have a bunch of countries let's see if the country you live in matches any of those in our database no you can just add that then if you want so let's add nigeria so you can add as many countries as you want um um and so then it'll ask you what country you live in um you get to type it in you type in the country and then you enter a for loop so in this case we have to use a for loop because we want to print out the index that the country is found at so because we want to know the exact index of of uh of the index number in the array we have to use a for loop um so then inside the for loop which goes up to the length of database which is i don't know what it is it's pretty big um if database i so um a database country equals the country you typed in in uppercase print out yay your country exists in our database it can be found at the index where you're at and that would end the loop so let's run that which country do you live in and you know i'll put in nigeria for an example and it's like yay your country exists in our database it's founded index 14 so nigeria is the last thing in our array its index is 14 how many items are there in the array um without counting so if it's it's the last item in the list and its index is 14 how many items are there in the array 15. yes i would i think that's correct and then we can just double check three four five six seven eight fifteen fourteen fifty correct so it's the last item um and its index is 14 so the number of items in the list must be plus 115. also someone asked what does two uppercase mean so um dot to uppercase on a string just makes it all in uppercase so the reason we use it in uppercase so if you type in um like canada and it's an all lowercase and you try to like see if it's equal to canada here in all uppercase that's not going to work so um it's so you can it like it's so you can capitalize it however you want and like it still works that's the point of um doing it to uppercase just puts everything in uppercase um does that answer your question okay good um yeah so this is a helpful way of finding trying to find an item in a database you can add even more countries if you want um so let's let's get started on our quiz um uh i hope no one's all the answers but anyway so uh the first quiz question is and feel free to put your answers in the chat um so the first question is you can change the number of items in an array after initializing it true or false as we have a little bit of conflicted answers and we're saying true they're saying false okay let's take a look at the answer so the answer is false so you can't change the number of items in an array after initializing it so i think i know why some of you if you reinitialize exactly so you can't change it once the code is already running so you can change it when you're editing the code itself but um when the code is already running there is no way to add something to an array you can only do that when you're editing the code like when i showed you changing the number from a five to a six or whatever that's separate from this there is no um way in your code to change the number of an array like when the like there's no line of code to do that does that make sense it's only in the editing stages of your code where you can change how how long your array is yeah so i understand why that might have been confusing to some of you only if you reinitialize um um or if you if you change you edit your code can you do that um quiz question number two what number is printed with this code so you have an array of numbers 1506 2172 and then a print statement what numbers printed with this code okay yeah so let's take a look at the answer and the answer is um d 21 number 21 is printed because an array's index starts at zero so number 15 if you want to get number 15 you would put zero if you want to get zero you would put one if you want to get six you would put a two and if you want to get 21 you would put three so that's how this works are there any questions about that about uh indexes because this can be a little confusing but just remember that try to remember at least that it starts at zero and goes up from there all right uh let's keep going question number three how do you get the length of an array so you have four options here um array.length as a method array.length as a property um length array and or you can't get the length of an array without iterating through it so the answer is b so so when it comes to arrays um length is a property of an array and it's oxed with dot property so dot length it might be confusing because with strings it's a so if you're trying to get the length of a string you would go string.length with the curly brackets but if you're trying to get the length of an array it would be array.length and nothing else so that can be i always i mess that up pretty often so it's okay if you can't remember that exactly but there is a difference a slight difference there between getting the length of an array and a string so let's continue question four what is one correct way to initialize an array of string objects and look at them carefully because they're kind of um some of them are a little tricky but which one which is the correct way of initializing a string array so the correct answer for question four is in fact c so the correct formula for initializing an array with a fixed size because that's what the options are is type so string array name equals new type string and then size so one person put d um it's not d because d is missing two things a d needs to have string at the front before you put array and then when you're putting the size like number five it has to be square brackets and not curly brackets so c is the correct answer i have one more question i believe um so quiz question number five what is the output of this code and look at it carefully as well i'll give you guys a little bit of time to to analyze this one okay so the correct answer for this one is b um the reason that it's b is because in the in the for loop um the the third statement instead of being i plus plus or i plus equals one it's i plus equals two so i increments by two each time instead of one so it would start out by printing one because that's index zero of course but then instead of i goes to two um no sorry i goes to one i would skip skip skip that one and it would go to two so go 0 2 in terms of the value of i and so the index 2 in this array is 3 so 1 3 5 instead of one two three um that might be a little confusing but um if you i it's okay you can catch that but um when you're analyzing a for loop it's important to see how much i changes yeah very tricky it's important to see how much i changes each time so this time it changes by two instead of the normal one so you'd have to do a little bit of code tracing in your head to figure out um exactly what would print in this circumstance um someone said a and the reason it's not a is because the loop starts at zero um i starts at zero so you would print out the number one first anyway and then it would continue from there yeah so this is a little this is a tricky question um i'm very glad that everyone tried their best anyway um that's always good to see um so that is it for our lesson though um now it's time for questions feedback form um and the workshop as well of course so um i'm just going to open up our workshop um you can do your feedback form now or you can do your feedback form at the end of the lesson but that is really appreciated in terms of um lessons and things i'll just i can just quickly send the feedback form i'll just i'll just have that one in the chat now and then also give you um the the resources links will come pretty soon but i'll just send the workshop link this is a cute slide um workshop link is this one make sure you fork and be mission forum link is this one yeah okay let's work this and there we go okay yeah and there's also a bunch of resources in the chat um so today's workshop is this so um you finally managed to sneak into one of the ice cream stores this is i guess a continuation of the plot line you receive a top secret lead saying that each ice cream tub is actually a tunnel leading to a secret room where they could be keeping your friend let's try the one with your friend's favorite ice cream flavor in it what is your friend's favorite icing paper okay go on and the important part is going to be the loop at the very bottom here um but up until then i'll help everyone out with this workshop so let's import something we can use to collect user input so um we've done this quite a few times i think all of our workshops like to use input so we can just start with import java dot um util dot scanner um to get our user input and then does anyone remember how to create the user input object the object that we need to create user input it starts with scanner um and you can name it something um doesn't really matter what equals mu gamma like that and then inside of the brackets system dot in um and that will create your your scanner objects you can create user input um and then down here let's create a variable to store the user's input so it already gives you the variable called flavor right here so if you want to get if you want to get user input and put it in flavor um does anyone know what you would have to type after the equal sign um keeping in mind that our scanner object is named scan at the top yeah feel free to put your answers in chat i can i know it can be a little nervewracking but uh yes next someone said it next line so scan is the name of our object so scan dot next line good job caitlyn um scan dot next line and that will store the user's input um and now there's an array created for you so it says now we have to create the array of all the different ice cream flavors in store let's make them uppercase so we can easily match the user's input so um yeah a good tip a good tip for something like this trying to find some trying to find something in an array is making all of the things in the array have the same case so they're all uppercase in this case you can also make them all lowercase um just so that it's easier to match the user inputs to them and if you have any other ice cream flavors feel free to add them to the array so i really like um cheesecake flavor ice cream which is kind of a wild card but there's some really good flavors and i also like cold coconut so i want to put those in there because i really like those um and then the last part the for loop and like the search i'm gonna leave up to um you guys to try and figure it out if you wanna put your code in the chat or leave your answers so i can see them you can also do that but um now you're supposed to go through all the flavors and see if any of them match your friends favorite if you find a match print out the index you found it at as well so they have a bunch of little tips here about how to write the for loop and how to conduct the search but this part i want i think it's a good idea if you try it out on your own and if you need any help with your code though and you have any other questions um this is a good time to ask you can also ask me like privately like send me a like a private dm on zoom you can do that um but yeah that is pretty much everything for today's lesson i guess it's technically a little bit early because like seven minutes technically left but um that is really all we had to go through um so we went over a raise um getting items in an array printing arrays searching an arrays yeah lots of array stuff yeah of course uh before you go you can please fill out the feedback form which i want to send one more time really helpful um but yeah that's pretty much all for today um you can stay if you have questions or need help um but thank you for coming have a great day everyone i think i'm not 100 sure what our next lesson is it might be classes it might be arraylist but uh yeah thank you everyone for coming hope you're learning something i hope you work on your workshop at home bye
