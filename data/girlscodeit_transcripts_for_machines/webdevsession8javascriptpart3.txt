ah there you go okay perfect so string intros um string as we all know is anything with text so not numbers because that's an integer uh and it must be enclosed with quotation marks just like if you would see it in a book so like you know when someone's speaking in a book it's like quotation marks it's the same thing with strings um you can use double or single quotation marks um either one works and assigns strings to a variable with an equal sign so um this is a good example of that um see this variable fruit one is watermelon that assigns um the variable fruit one to watermelon so when we say console.log fruit one the console will show us watermelon because we've assigned that string to the variable fruit one how many characters are in the word watermelon so today we're going to get to something called like string length which is an operator that counts the number of characters in a string and then that value is an integer that you can then manipulate for things so the length property returns the value of a string and you have to write dot length after the variable so variable fruit is watermelon remember that so we have our fruit is watermelon by saying fruit.length we say okay what is the length of the string that is this variable so what is the length of watermelon and it counts the letters so watermelon and there's ten so there's ten different characters within the variable string which then gives us the value ten this number ten is an integer so this is a string this is an integer two different data types um you can also just would see it in like code this way so variable fruit watermelon variable word length equals fruit.length console.log word length yes so we have two different variables fruit and word length this one is an integer this one is a string yes what's the difference between a string and an integer so a string is like words so it's text an integer cannot be numbers sorry an integer cannot be letters it cannot be letters so we specifically use integer when referring to numbers because it allows us to use mathematical operators so like plus minus equals multiplication all that stuff so we need to use integer when talking about those because you can't like multiply strings because you can't like multiply words together so by using integer we allow ourselves to use mathematical operators if you want to use a number because it's like part of a story then you would use it as like a string so like all numbers can be strings but words cannot be integers basically um there was another question let me answer so is 10 going to be different from 10 yeah so quotation marks 10 is a string but 10 by itself is an integer and therefore because it's an integer we can perform mathematical operations on it so yes it is different good job um the different string methods serve different purposes so access method through variable dot method so um here are two like variable methods um index of returns the um index of method returns the index position of the first occurrence of a specified text in a string so example say i have the word watermelon yes or no let's use this example because it's right here say i have the word hello if i said like index of e it would give me one yes because it goes to like the first instance of the character sets that's in here and then it finds that and it gives you the index one important thing to note when you want to do indexes it doesn't start at one so it counts all of the characters like this but it doesn't start at one so it would assign all the values but it goes zero one two three four so you might say oh there's five letters characters in this string hello but the computer starts at zero so the computer would say h is at the position zero e is at the position one so always subtract one yeah um the word that you want to find the index of goes inside the the parentheses and to uppercase converts the text to uppercase so basically to uppercase is basically just like the caps lock button on your computer um that's what that means um i saw there's a question i'll answer that in two seconds variable string i like to sing yes we have a variable str so the variable is called str the variable is i like to sing it's a string variable variable position string index of like console.log position 2. in this case it looks like it's giving it different words why it says two is unknown to me because the output should be one java and javascript are the same as in the sense that they start from zero so you don't start counting at one you start counting at zero so two is actually incorrect here but yes yeah yeah no it starts at zero i'm not going crazy yes so i think it's because there's a space is there a one too i don't even know because it says index of like i've never seen being like indexes of words before and like counting words yeah i think that starts at um the next two i don't even know because the i is zero one yeah zero one two three four five six seven eight so the period would be eight yeah okay so in this case we're counting words spaces do count um spaces do count when you're talking about like a sentence like that because it will go through um let's see what's index index is basically just like the places of the word so like um it's like if you were like number the letters off so like zero one two three four five the index is like the number that the letter corresponds to if you were like number them off starting at zero um variable text hello console.log text to uppercase so see our builtin function to uppercase basically just like if i typed it with caps lock yeah arrays arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable arrays are tricky so if there's questions please ask them the values are closed with square brackets you can't use you can't use circle brackets you have to use square brackets array index numbers start from zero yeah see i'm not going crazy array index zero numbers start from zero everything starts from zero so even index of like specific words it starts from zero there's um no different thing the first array element is zero the second one is one all the way to the length of the array minus 1. this is true for even if you're just asking for the length of one string like one single word it's true access array elements by referring to an index number so say um it's like you're going to like a library does anyone know like the dewey decimal system or am i just like really oldfashioned where like you would go to a library and you would say okay i want um charlotte's web and charlotte's web on the code for the library they identify it by like a specific number well that's basically the same thing here so i have all of these different items well i want to categorize them by numbers so i can know how to find them from the specific numbers so in this case we have variable comic yes so spiderman iron man deadpool we'll say i want to access spiderman well that's index zero so i have to go find index zero i want deadpool well that's index two so i want to go find index two spiderman is assigned the variable favorite because the index number for spiderman is zero the first array element in the comic array so in this case variable comic array of different comic books yes so i like to think when you're using array it's not like one specific variable it's more like category of all of the variables here and then my variable favorite is comic and then whatever comic is at index zero and i can change this around i can change these around but whatever comic is at the index of zero that's my favorite so like if i have a different favorite comic i can change them around so whichever one's at zero is my favorite and then the console.log favorite so we print out the variable favorite and it prints out spiderman because spiderman's at index zero but if i were to change the list around i put deadpool at zero then it would print out deadpool um length property returns the number of array elements so dot length after a variable the length property is always one more than the highest array of the index um constructor constructor property runs in a raised constructor function dot constructor after the variable used to check if the variable's an array i don't like those explanations so i'm going to try and explain them in a second so the length of fruit is for the highest array index is 3. we know this because we start from zero so banana is zero orange is one apple is two mango is three therefore the highest array index is three the length of the list is four because there's four different elements in the array and the computer knows that but the highest like indexes start at zero but like this is confusing for me because i'm 99 sure that lengths also start at zero so let me check that hold up because i don't want to be saying wrong information this is oh okay so this is the whole like banana orange apple mango so the length should be three because length start at zero array started zero length started zero indexes started zero yes everything starts at zero i this is a typo i really this is a typo so the output function array variable animals equals cat dog penguin animals.constructor function array so like this just checks if it's like an array like that's all this does um animals.constructor just checks if it's an array but variable animals cat dog penguin that just it like it just checks that it's an array yeah it's not checking for length it's just checking that it is an array right so constructor just checks like what type of thing it is and then it says what type of thing it is okay convert elements into a string so join remember how we had like our methods like dot length and like to all uppercase join is another one of those so join method joins all arrays if joins all array elements into a string so it takes all of the array elements and puts them into a string yes so um i like cannot how do i okay yes perfect sorry so see this see the whole like this is a good example of this so join if we use join and we like add a exclamation point it just adds an exclamation point to the end of each thing why is there not an exclamation point after mango there should be there should be one um oh no sorry there should not be one because it puts it in between each element so it doesn't put it after each element and puts it in between each element so it uses them to like join them together basically um remember how concatenated statements how we have plus signs to join them together well it's basically like saying that but you know it just puts a character whatever character you want um pop removes at the last element from an array so and push adds a new element to the end of an array so these are just like little shortcuts that you can do when you want to modify an array on the fly um so there's a lot of these pop slice unshift shift sort two string join splice map reverse these are very interesting um a lot they have different functions but basically like shorthand ways that you can manipulate an array very easily so let's go through this code variable fruits banana apple mango fruits join exclamation point we add an exclamation point in between each one to join them together fruit stop pop we delete the last element so we delete mango so mango's gone now fruit push great add grape to the end so banana apple grate fruits dot join doesn't add like it doesn't modify the array specifically it modifies like like the words of the array kind of but like well no it does modify the ring it's just hard to explain because like i would like if it was just like more in a format because basically what it does it like it puts like banana in its quotation marks comma exclamation point in its quotation marks that's like basically what it does um i wish this was in array format it's not it's in just like regular words format but anyway you get the point question if you were to use a constructor what sort of output will it give um that depends so if you're using an array it will say like function array because it's like oh that's an array if you're using like mathematical functions it would be like oh like um what's a mathematical function math.random that's one yes it's one for java so it should be one for javascript um so you it would be like function like math.random because it's like an inherent like function that it shows so depending on what function you're using it will give a different output object and dictionary create a dictionary by creating an object with curly brackets so inside the curly brackets add key value pairs there should be a comma after each pair so these are very much like arrays in the sense that like we have different values separated by commas within brackets yes few things to note curly brackets for dictionaries square brackets for arrays very important because the computer will like help decipher what you're trying to do based on the brackets based on your syntax in general so very important use the correct brackets um key dot value pairs is basically just like it's kind of like how we establish a variable so you know how we like a variable a name so we say like variable y equals the value of the variable it's very much like that so we have like well like information that this is the actual information so like you know it's like first name last name you know it's very much like that um luckily we have this use as a thing age 154 54. so it's always key value key value dictionary 54 get the value through the key so dictionary first name so anything is this is the key and this is the value yeah so when calling up information in a dictionary we say dictionary and then we say the key yeah so if it's like a weird key like this we can just put in the bra like in the square brackets to call it but if it's not we have like dictionary.firstname because we have first name as like an established thing there's some different syntax that goes along with these um that you mostly just learned through experience which is really rough uh dictionary age let's use these examples dictionary age so notice how we have like square brackets to classify what we want to talk about we put the key or we put the key here and we put oh no this is to change it sorry this is to change you want to change something you need to put it like the same kind of syntax so if you want to call it it's dictionary and then square brackets with the val like the key that you want to call yeah so if i put dictionary last name it would say mendez but if i want to change it it's dictionary category of information equals the new information we want to put in so dictionary age equals 10. this takes this one changes it to a 10. dictionary last name orlando so then it takes the last name and it's now orlando yes so putting an equals new value after it changes information just putting the dictionary with the information key tells you the information in order to change you have to put equals and then new information okay so we have a fun replit today i'm gonna so okay guys if we can all go to the replit i will meet you guys there and we're gonna do something where we talk about like line numbers so i'm gonna say the specific file i want you to go to within the reply and then i'm going to say the line number that we're all going to talk about yes i think that's going to be the best way to do this for now because you're going to be seeing the same thing that i'm seeing um and i will answer questions so christian did make this um and if you're looking at the reply right now just like i am you're going to notice that there is an advanced script file and there's a script file so it's going to say advanced script.js and script.js um i would like everyone to go into the script.js file yeah so this is a harry potter quiz show it uh or like a quiz game it looks like a lot he tailored it for his class which is great but there's going to be definitely some questions so at this point if you have any questions about the reply were like please just like shout them out because i know that there will be some okay so let's go into the script.js file and i'm just going to go like through it in like sections and kind of explain what each section does yes okay script.js lines one through four um these just like are like variables documents stuff like that they create um method document element yeah so return the reference to the first object with specified value of the idea name attribute yeah so it's just calling references for things that establish our code later on user information username house response these are all variables yes so these are lines seven and eight so let user name house response all strings all like user information stuff points is an integer variable and because we're starting at zero because it's a quiz game we're starting it at zero there's no quotation marks because it's an integer yes and there's no quotation marks on any of these even though they're strings because it's the variable name not the string itself um lines 10 and 11 go to a button which is an event list listener um so basically what an event listener is it just like sits there and listens and waits for something to happen and then once something happens it like executes its function so he made the buttons event listener so that when you click the buttons it advances you to the next question um he used an arrow function here for that um and that's basically what that means so lines 10 and 11 are like when you click the button like next it takes you the next question yeah um lines 14 15 and 16 um basically like pressing enter like takes you to like the next question i think if i remember correctly let me just like put it in like as like a little um yeah so what he did is he put like key up so like like you can either click the button to take you to the next slide or you can like press enter to take you to the next slide so 14 15 16 pressing enter to take you to the next slide 10 and 11 you have to click it to take you to the next slide um so he likes to do these things because it makes for a better program um so basically this whole thing lines 20 to 54 is a function yes and he did this because the entire function um is like one question yeah wait let me check i think it is yeah so basically he did this because it's one function for the question and let's go through each section of it so lines 20 to 23 that's the question itself so professor snape like that's the root you're taking that's the question um root get responses so notice how this 20 to 54 is a function but notice how it's like cascading if else statements so like if this thing happens then that happens if it doesn't happen then it goes to the next option he does this because it's a multiple choice question so if answer a is picked then code executes else it will see if answer b is picked if answer b is picked then it does something else so that's basically what these like if else cascading statements do um the first one is the question itself so it shows like the it creates a an array called possible responses and it says like stay silent make a random answer stand up for yourself yell back at him those are your those are your answers um those are your those are your like various different responses to the multiple choice question and you put them in an array so that's what it does it it the first question it takes all your answers puts them in an array that's what that does 25 to 27 else option set attribute hidden hidden response input value um don't worry about it it basically just like sets the like stuff and makes it so it like functions kind of um let response any so like it just like it's like oh like we're gonna have an input value the input value is going to be like the click like multiple choice thing or no it's going to be a type in a b or c um so 29 through 32 if response character code at less than 97 greater than 90 or like less than 97 oh yeah if it's less than 97 and it's greater than 99 or yeah it's greater than 99 um basically it basic it just means that like oh you didn't put a valid answer in so it just says please pick a b c or d or a b c a b or c so that's what that means this like 29 through 32 is basically just like oh you didn't put in like unacceptable response value um that my computer could recognize so like i'm going to tell you to do that that's what that means so it looks for like you're the length of your input and then it's like oh like what's your deal there with that um lines 34 through 40. else lex selection you picked dollar sign response so christian likes to put the dollar signs in because it's concatenated statements um i use plus signs because i think that's easier for me to identify he uses dollar signs so that's how to do concatenated statements on the shorthand um dollar sign curly bracket the thing you want to stick in other curly bracket yes so that's all that means it's a concatenated statement but he likes to pull in that way um so else let section you picked response if response equals to a then like if our response in here was a you lose points because that wasn't the correct answer yes so you start at zero you lose points so like see this our points minus equal to ten there was a question last week about how to like change points on the fly that's how you do it i have my points variable that we established earlier in the code and then we change it here yeah and then below that is like the response for the question so like when you pick an answer it gives you a response so um it like just says like oh concatenated statement your selection so it repeats your selection to yourself then slash n that's some syntax it's newline so it just moves it to like a new line just kind of like a typewriter so just press enter um professor snape is annoyed that you ignored him he deducts 10 points new line you have x amount of points concatenated statements we insert points the variable into points yes and then input value is nothing because there's nothing to input um and then 42 to 4 so 42 onwards is basically the same thing but for answers b and c yes so we know here that b is the correct answer because you get points for that answer c is the incorrect answer because you lose points for that answer and then below that is like the responses that you get for when you like give those given answers uh jeez a lot of lines i knew this why am i acting surprised 56 function so 56 to 65 uh function crea so this just creates a list of the responses so it just like creates a list for them um and then the current response it makes a list for them um yeah so it just creates a list for your responses um 69 to 75 function all questions if question get attribute name equals equals question 1 username input value question set attribute name question two so basically notice there like if you put your name in that like name thing that's basically what it does it just like puts your name into like the question yes so that's what it does um this is the same thing like question inner html like what house are you in so it just like takes the value like the inner like the input value of like what house you said you were in and then puts you in that like it like adds it to the story through concatenated statements um else if name question equals two input value name question three so it's just like an else if like all else fails situation here um last chunk 82 to 85 let introduction these are concatenated statements so like this is like the introduction stuff concat native statement um yes and then 87 elsif um it's just like the elsif scenario like your name is question three and then professor snape it like calls the function professor snape um that gets responses i think i don't know i don't oh no basically because the questions about professor snape so it calls the question function yes he put an advanced javascript file in there um which i think is interesting personally i wouldn't look at it right now um these are like really for his class but i'm gonna stop sharing really quick and then we can talk and like talk about questions okay yes
