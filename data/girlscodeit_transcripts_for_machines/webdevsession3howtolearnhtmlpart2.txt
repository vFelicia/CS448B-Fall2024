first of all we're gonna talk about comments so this is html part two um there was a couple comments in the code last week there are a couple this week i mean i made the example so i'm trying to think um there's a few um you used to leave little notes in your html document um these do not affect the integrity of your code they don't add anything to your code except for a comment and only the person who wrote the code can see them so they're in your code they just are helpful little notes but they don't like make anything run so say if you wanted to add an image you can't do that in a comment because the comment doesn't affect the code um to do that carrot bracket exclamation point dash dash that's basically our syntax for comments so carat exclamation point um dash dash is your opening tag however fun thing to note i know that we just went over in a kahoot that the closing tag for html is slash care bracket um not for comments comments are a special one and we're just going to use dash dash carrot bracket so that's a fun one just remember but you will also notice that you're doing a comment correctly when the comment turns gray so a lot of your code it's like black or some elements turn blue or purple but comments are always gray so that's to know how comments have been initiated because they're always gray so inline scripting this is a little bit of a fun little thing inline scripting is contained directly in an html code so that basically means that our javascript functions are javascript but they're going to be in our html document um you don't see those a whole lot but they can be used for like little javascript things in an html website uh using it requires the script tag which we talked a little bit about earlier so this is to embed javascript within an html file um it's a little bit tricky but it's not for your entire javascript file it's for like little little things so this one shows an alert which pops up as like a little one of those like little web pages um but that's what this is for this is not for like making your website do all of its javascript functions this is for very very little details and i want to emphasize that because if you use this script tag and you paste your entire javascript file into there or at least the contents of it it will not it like it just won't work the way you want it to it might not even like function as code so i want you to make sure that you're only using this for like little things um if you want to use an alert you can also just be used the alert function but that's a javascript thing so this would be used to make this but in the javascript file i see a question what type of code is this again so this is actually two types of code um that we're seeing here on the web page this is javascript so this alert open bracket close bracket that is javascript and that's a javascript function which we'll get into later because you're going to see them in our example today but this chara bracket script um care bracket dash script that is html so it's really interesting but html javascript and css all go hand in hand so you're going to see all of them in web pages um inline styling so basically remember what we did with javascript where we said okay little things that we can do with javascript we can put them in our html file well we can do this exact same thing with css so um inline styling css code contained within the individual lines of html use the style attribute so remember how we use script for javascript well because style is css we use the word style but in this one we're not going to use the open bracket close bracket so remember how um we use open marker close bracket for this one we're going to use style equals and that's just because that's the syntax for css so in css we use style equals um or we use color equals um this is a little bit tricky it's like css formatted in html we're not going to get into it super today because we don't have our css lessons yet but when we get back into css i'll talk about this more but you don't need it for today um inline styling syntax explained so the style attribute declares what you're going to add to style so this tells us that it's going to be a css and this tells us what we're adding so it tells us it's going to be a css the color property is set to the value blue this is called declaration so declaration means that we're declaring so i'm sitting here and i'm saying the color is blue that's what's known as a declaration and that's what we're doing basically by saying the statement so we're saying the style of this is that the color is blue and that is our declaration and that's basically what from this semicolon forward means um properties are separated with a colon so this semicolon or sorry declarations are separated by the semicolon but properties are separated with a colon i don't like to think of this as separating a property um i just think of this as listing the attributes of the property so the color think of this as is so think of this semicolon as an is so color is blue break text align is center so we line our text in the center um that's an easier way to think about it if you think about it in like word blocks but yeah we're not going to use a whole lot of this today but it's an interesting feature um to know about so display information in a table format there are four tags associated with tables four table we define that we have a table tr divides a row within the table so tr think of it as table row th defines header so table header the first row should contain every single header so say if you wanted to have like a column that was like times of day and like the activity you were doing that first row would be like activities or it would be the times you know what i'm saying um and then td defines individual cells um why is it d i don't know but it it is um so this table right here this is the code that is this table so we have table tr so we have our tr here oh my gosh can that go away sorry i'm trying to let me make pointers so it maybe will go away okay so th header is the name age is the name or yes so name h we have that um sam 18 is our content in the cells of our table um again won't be using that today but it's interesting thing to look at um table examples this is our css so this tells us like the border width of these boxes and that we have boxes but this is the html code for this yeah thumbs up thumbs down yes no maybe any questions okay i see a chat do we need to merge the two different codes um okay yeah so there's nothing like merging really happening um when we go into the example i'll point out but basically how you do it is you like link your different sheets to your html sheet so in your html i'm going to look there and i'm going to have something that says like css sheet equals style.css is stylesheet very rough but that basically says that everything css in this html code is going to be found in this style sheet so that's basically how replied does it replit and like a lot of other programs have html css and javascript because they all have different syntax they're all different coding languages they all have different styles and while they work really really well together they're best friends they're all still different so by having all of these different things we just link them together in the html file and i can show you how to do that we're going to talk about that later so forms used to get user input such as text drop down um three important tags related to forms form enclosed all the different elements label use before input element to label it input an element with many different options for input so kinds of form inputs um see the inputs text radio button check box button number we're going to see a lot of these text inputs today because our project sneak peek is a mad libs and a lot of the mad libs questions are like input a noun here and those are examples of text inputs because they're words but if we want to say um say we wanted to make like a math problem in html or in css and javascript we would use a number input because we want to have a number input answer so they're different inputs and that's what they're used for they're using different circumstances um so this is a form example if you want to learn more about it check the link out below after class but it's definitely an interesting thing to do so like first name this would be a text input last name would also be a text input this would be a checkbox input because you're checking you're either checking it or you're not checking it um interesting but these are the ones we're going to talk about mostly today and you're going to see the examples of those in roughly so we're here at workshop mad libs i'm going to drop this in the chat but before i drop it in the chat i want to really emphasize the fact that we are not going to edit that reply we are going to fork it and then we are going to edit it we had a couple instances of people just going in and then editing that reply that replie is meant to be a pristine copy of code that is functioning and working and by editing that one we can't guarantee that it's going to work and then people want to go back check their work and we need to make sure that that one maintains integrity if you don't know how to fork it wait for me yeah i see some questions about forking if you don't know what forking is i will explain that right now but please be sure to fork it and if you don't have a replant account and you're like the person i talked to earlier stay and i will find a way for the code to work for you because i know i can format it in a couple different interfaces so i'm going to click this link to join it if you click that link when i put in the chat you're going to get taken to this that's probably christian um you're going to get taken to the code we're going to click this button this button so it's going to say willa html mad libs because i created it it's the html it's mad libs we're going to click that button i'm going to go all the way down here it's a little tiny teeny button it's a teeny teeny tiny button we're going to call it fork i'm going to click that it's going to say forking and then all of a sudden just going to take us to a new window and it's gonna say willa html mad libs dash one or like dash two or whatever it's gonna be a number but now you're gonna notice that the person that was here is no longer here because this is now my own copy of the code and i can edit it and nothing will happen to the original code which is good because you can always save the original code and if something happens to this code and whatever you can always go back to the original fork it and try again we good we good we good okay so now i'm gonna go through some really cool stuff in the code so first of all i want everyone to take a look just at my screen first because you're gonna have the exact same thing on your screen so my screen first just we know we're all at the same page this right here is an example of a comment so notice how it's gray and it's sort of a little bit lighter than the rest of the code this is an example of an html comment i know we talked about that a little bit earlier but i just wanted to give a nice example just so that everyone could be familiar with what that is um this is again our html opening bracket this is our our like utilitarian data do not touch this like just don't it just tells us our character set this is in english um it tells us that like our width should be our device with and like all of the other like just cody bits that we don't need to deal with so it's not content so just don't touch it um but yeah so harry potter mad libs that's what this is i made an example for harry potter i did a harry potter website last week i like harry potter um and it's also just easy to do so i just ran the code so you can see the output as well um so this imports the web pages style sheet i remember there was a question about linking two sites together if you notice on this side we're gonna have a index.html main.css main.javascript this says we're going to link our main.css file stylesheet and it's a type text is css so that basically means a css file in css controls this style elements of this web page and you can find it right here and that basically just links this file to this one you don't need to worry about that today we're not going to really do that much css today we're saving that for a couple weeks down the line i think we have one more week of html and then we get into css so if you're holding out to make some pretty like color web pages just hold out for two more weeks i know it's so much fun um but now we're going to get into the web pages html code so what are we going to use we're going to use these text input boxes i have a bunch of test stuff here that i was using from before ignore that but we have a bunch of test text input boxes here and that's what these are so if you see we have name input type text id person and now these all have different parts but i'm going to go through them one by one because they're the same for each of them name so this right here in between the paragraph tags is what shows up right here so whatever you put in between here is going to show up right here cool fun fresh fantastic that gives people what what about coding on a blank page are you going to cover that um what do you mean code like you just like open a rebel and it's completely blank is that what that question means yes okay so if you open up a replit if it's an html like okay if you have a replit account and you don't know this you can make a bunch of different styles of code so i can open up a reply and make a python file i can make a java file i can make a javascript file um html isn't really like that so html is going to give you like a lot of this stuff it's just not that fun to code um but i think like the final project in this course is like you guys make your own project and we're just here to help you so i think that comes up then but you need a lot more skill set stuff before we just get into like throwing you guys into an empty web page and saying make something awesome so i think that does get covered in this course but it's like way down the line because you need to learn javascript first you need to learn css stuff first you need to learn how to link it all together you need to know how it works together so that's way down the line but i think we do cover it anyway getting back to this name this is what shows up on screen input type text that basically just gives me an input box and it says what's going to go in this box is text i know we covered that a little bit but yeah this id and you're going to see it in each one so this one says id person id thing id verb id location id names this id tag is how this variable is going to be because it's a variable it's a none it's an unknown input into a web page it's called variable this id tag is going to be how the computer tells what that like how it identifies that input text variable i know that's just like a bunch of really weird code language but i will show you this in javascript so remember how we have this input file and it says id person so name says id person if we go into our javascript file variable person remember that so our name is actually a variable ver var called person and we id'd it as quote person so that the computer can identify it as quote person and make it a variable that is named person and therefore we can refer to that in our different web pages so notice how it says person is now a variable in a different part of our web page that's because we were able to ideate and initialize it in our html file it's really tricky and if you have some trouble with it let me know but basically it initializes it as a person and then we can use it here to set it again to person and then use it again here to put it in our story so as an example i think i'm gonna run the webpage because i think that's gonna make a little bit more sense so i'm gonna put a name it's a harry potter story so i'm going to say ron um noun plural um spiders because if anyone knows the harry potter series they know ron and spiders have a thing verb i'm going to say you know keep it silly keep it fun a location um hogsmeade and names i'm going to say harry and hermione so i'm going to say now create lip and what does it say ron ran down the stairs to find what he feared most spiders they came at him too quickly they didn't know how to stop the spiders they swam to hogsmeade and when they got there they saw harry and hermione who helped them defeat the spiders then they all went to the great hall for dinner so basically what just happened is our index.html file took my text input ron made it a variable made that variable and called it person went into the javascript file said okay variable person equals dot get element by id person so we go to a document get the element by its identification which we called person person give it a value and then stick it back in when we need it at this given point does that make sense because that's the core coding lesson we're trying to teach today so does that make sense yes no maybe thumbs up thumbs down questions i understand if there's questions i know it's complicated i'm gonna go into the chat yes maybe kind of okay is there anything that i can do to help make the kind of a little bit not a kind of not really we're not coding anything right now i'm just trying to explain the code but if you want to fork it like if you are listening to me and you fork the replay and you're like this girl is telling me nothing new i already know everything she's saying then feel free like go play with the replit go have fun but if you wanna stick around i will be explaining it okay for the people who said kind of i want to make it a yes so is there anything that i can do to like help you understand it like is there a question we have is there is it just like we need to go over it again what's up i'm waiting for some chats but i don't see any okay chats the javascript part okay yeah for sure for sure so i'm going to go over the javascript first because that was the first request that came in so we're in our javascript file this is javascript this is no longer html this is no longer css this is javascript and it's in a javascript file now we're gonna go through each different part these if you've noticed is basically just the same thing over and over again with different things so i'm just gonna go through one of them and when you ran the tab and it brought the story yeah for sure okay so that's actually a different part of our code that's actually this so um basically the javascript basically this is a function in javascript so in javascript we have things called functions and what functions do is you can just make them do whatever you want to so this function is called madlibs this is the syntax for a java function you say it's a function we're gonna name it madlibs it's gonna well this is a null it's a void function because see if you see that it says it's a void function and that's because there's nothing in here so if you have that question come back i'm sharing my screen we're going through it again we're talking about which stuff we can touch what stuff we can't what stuff is for us to play around with okay so hopefully everyone can see my screen and everyone is here that needs to be here who wants to be here cool so this title basically anything in like black right now um this is the html file i'm gonna go through the javascript file separately um css like there's nothing really in css this just tells us like the container stuff um html anything so head don't touch this don't touch head title change title um this don't touch this don't touch the links to the s style sheet and at the bottom here you're going to see importing the web pages javascript file don't touch that either um button unless you know how to make a button again i wouldn't recommend touching this i really wouldn't um i know i said anything in the block this is an exception do not touch this unless you know how to make a button and can like redo that because if you just delete it and then don't remember how to make it again it won't work and there will be no button so um this body stuff up until that first divider is basically what we're going to be playing around with in the html file i saw there was a question on because i think that's really important okay so sure screen screen share what is div i saw that question right before divis stands for divider um so it just like divides up the sections of the code so it's not just like one long blurb um it's also just for like aesthetics sake too um yeah um i'm really hoping that wasn't a question because i can't like see the chat right now i don't know what's going on anyway so this change because that changes what shows up on screen here so change that um input type text unless you want to input numbers don't change that ids you need to change the ids unless you want it to be the same ids in the same spot you need to change the ids now if you touch the ids so say i change this to person one crazy i know if we go into the main javascript file we need to find person and we also need to change it this to person one and we need to change this to person one and we need to change this to person one they all need to match so if you change the ids write them down take a photo or whatever because they need to be the same in the javascript file if they're not the same you're gonna see an error that says like um void like javascript void cannot define function and that basically just means it's trying to define something that doesn't exist because if those things don't match it can't match them up and therefore it will think that they just don't exist and the compiler won't compile so you need to make sure that they match that's one of the most important things you can do um change the variable names if you want this document.getelementbyid don't touch that um it's a special tag don't don't touch it and this dot value don't touch it but anything that's like person one um person one like change these variable names and mystory.innerhtml equals don't touch this but anything else touch for this it's weird how you edit it basically if you want it put a variable in you get the variable name you put plus variable name plus anything in red is the words that were going to show up on the screen regardless and are not variables so yeah change the red stuff but if you want to insert one of your variables because it's mad libs you end your quotation marks so each red is in closing quotation marks you end your quotation marks you plus thing so plus variable name plus quotation marks again and then we can start our write again um yes we don't have class next week if you're coming back i will see you january 2nd have a great holiday everyone stay safe have a great holiday um avni if you're still here i will answer this question do we turn this in yeah you can turn this in if you want to it's in the google form it was in the original chat um but the link will also be in the discord yeah it's in a google form oh good omni you fixed it yeah so that's the error that happens when um the like you don't match up your variable names in the javascript and in the html so that's a really good it's a good error to have because it teaches you yeah hi thank you guys happy holidays have a good one see you in two weeks um stay if you have questions though because i'll be happy to answer them and i will stop recording now
