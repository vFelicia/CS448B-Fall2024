what inspired you to pursue computer science i've always been pretty decent at math so like both my parents are computer like are software engineers so i've been like math has always come pretty naturally to me so once i decide like i didn't want to continue with my nursing major um cs has always been my backup but like so at first i i can't say like i was really passionate about cs when i first went like went into the major but like as i've learned more and more about it i think something that really inspires me about cs is just like it's such a big field there's so there's so much things to learn and you can never really like know all of cs and for me like i just really like learning things in general so it's really nice to always be like learning about something new and like being in such a young industry too what is college life like and a followup question for that is um how is it different during covid so college life is i would say like it's what you make it to be um for me it's been a lot of just like studying and like being a nerd basically so like going to hackathons doing like side projects doing like grinding the um my classes and stuff like that but i also know like some of my friends through the whole like college party life um so and like the thing with i i think like the thing the difference between um high school and college is like for high school you don't really have a choice in like how your schedule is or what your daily schedule looks like but for college you do so like you choose your classes you get to like choose how you spend your time and what clubs you go to um you don't really have that urgency to like i have to take these classes if i want to get into like a good job or something it's just like you can choose whatever classes you're interested in so like it's just like what you make it out to be so you can either like be studying all the time or like you can be a party person and take easy classes but for like during coven um it's just not like online classes so it's just like just homework and then staying at home have you ever thought about giving up in computer science and if so how did you overcome these difficulties yeah a lot of times it's basically like for me like each semester is like oh no can i actually like pass the semester i'm taking like so many classes and like i don't know if i can actually like if i can actually finish all my projects on time um but i think like just dealing with that it's like you you can't really avoid the classes you have to take and if you want to like learn more then you just have to do more so for me it's like i i find like all my every semester very daunting and it's like it gets very scary thinking like oh i have to do i have like four projects due in one week can i actually do it but um i always think like there's no other there's no other choice um so i just i usually like take things little by little so like breaking it down day by day and being like oh i can i can spend 10 minutes on this project we're like one hour on this project and even if like it's a little bit of time it's still progress in general so it's just like overcoming things step by step and then once like the semester like before you know it the semester's over or like you're graduating college and then you realize like oh it's actually doable yeah um did you have any like trouble with any computer science teachers that you've had that kind of made you want to give up the major um for professors i wouldn't say like it was i've had really bad professors or professors who made me want to drop out of out of the major but i've had very like very hard classes like for example this semester i'm taking intro like operating systems which is the hardest classes in the department and like there have been a lot of times where i'm like i can't finish this project or like no matter what i do i don't know how to actually like solve this or um or i i don't think i'm like actually learning this properly but i think like for that i after like i have like my little like panic moment but then like afterwards i think like this is just one project this is just one grade as long as like even if i can't like if i can't do it and like get a hundred percent or like get an a plus like i can still pass the class so like in the bigger picture like even if i don't do this like well i can still like do my as long as i do my best and i try my best like everything will kind of work out i recently learned a coding language where do you think i should go from there when you learn a coding language i think like the best way to like or the next step would just be to apply it to a project um usually like because that way like i think like personally for me i learn best when i'm applying a language it's very hard for me to actually like sit down and learn java or like sit down and learn python usually that's like i just um i guess like i learn while i'm doing something so so like you can you can like build a little personal project that like uses the code you've learned so like for example if you just learn python or something i think like the best way to um to like go from there is just to like just to go ahead and apply what you've learned so like building an app out of python or like building um building whatever project you want and then that way like sometimes you can encounter like problems that you've never like faced before and then once you encounter those problems and you work your way through to debugging them then like you can learn a lot like a lot about the nuances of the language so i guess like just working on a project that's like applying that language to like something practical do you have any like examples of when you learned a language and you tried to make your own projects um yeah like i think oh basically all my projects honestly are like me learning a language on the fly or for example like how i got my internship as qualcomm was actually like during at a hackathon and that was like the first time i used python um and for that like i didn't know any like python before that but during like those two days i was just like making a small like um game of snake and then i was learning python while i was trying to build that app and that's how i learned about like how do you make python classes how you like make python functions and stuff like that um and that was that's how i basically learned all of my online languages so if you look at um a lot of the projects i have on github are like are using languages that i haven't like used before right um definitely you should keep that in mind for everyone who's trying to learn new coding languages what motivated you to switch your major from nursing to computer science i know you already talked about like um you know being more affluent in math but um was there any other things that motivated you to switch i think for me like so the reason i switched sophomore year was because sophomore year was the first time like for at least like the mystery school of nursing where you had to go in the hospital and like do an eighthour shift every week so for me like that was when i realized like i'm not social enough to actually like to actually like be enough be in a hospital and like interact with patients for like eight plus hours every single day um it was honestly very tiring like i was i'm still interested in like medicine and healthcare and stuff but it was very emotionally tiring to like be in a hospital and like have to deal with like have to like talk to patients um interact with people constantly but also have to deal with like really emotionally stressful things like my the um the floor i was working at wasn't really that like wasn't that um it wasn't like an icu or like a trauma floor it was sort of like a general floor where people were recovering from surgery but there was still like a lot of things that went on in there because like you have patients who are in like very they're in very emotional stages of their life because like it's they're like coming out of an important operation or something and it's very emotionally like emotionally draining for me so like i didn't really have the personality or like the i guess like the um the emotional intelligence i would say to like be a nurse and find it like not tiring so i think like the switchy computer science which is like not as social was was natural yeah are there any times that um you regret switching um honestly not really like i guess i kind of regret switching schools because i left a lot of like my friend group back at university of michigan and it was um it was a little i guess it was a little strange being um served one or two years older than to like be felt because i wasn't a traditional college student or i didn't see myself as like the traditional college student because i felt a little behind but um besides like besides like having to rebuild my social circle in college i don't think like i really miss the um the nursing major itself yeah i think i regret like not being in cs first i'm losing those first two years yeah um i guess another question would be to like anyone who's about to go into college or who's in college right now and they're not interested in their major would you um like on a scale of one to ten how much would you suggest for them to switch to a different major um i think like you have like for in my opinion like the first two years of college you don't have to worry too much about like do i have to commit to a major or do i have to like force myself to like this major that i'm not too sure about you have like the ability to switch your first two years of college and then like by junior and senior year um then you have to really commit to whatever major um your you've selected at that point um to be honest for like a lot of people who aren't sure if they're gonna um if they like which major they're gonna do i would honestly recommend something like community college because that way you can save money and you can like save you can like explore around without like without it being too high risk for me like like university of michigan was like the oneyear tuition cost more than like my four years at university of maryland because i was paying out of state at that point so it like while while like i did like i did enjoy my time there it was it still cost me a lot and i think like if you if you're not sure about your major or like if you aren't sure if you commit to whatever major you've chosen um feel like you're senior um don't force yourself to like do something if you don't like it because because like getting a degree in something requires requires passion to be honest yeah especially for like once you take those hard classes um you really have to rely on like how much you want this like once you work in that specific industry feel like push you through those harder classes yeah um okay our next question is um for someone with no experience in coding is majoring in computer science feasible definitely like when i when i um started my cs major i had no experience in coding and it's definitely like doable the when colleges look at potential um applicants for like a cs degree they aren't exactly looking for like prior experience in coding because it's not you don't really really need to know like have coded for it to be like to have good good potential for coding it's more about your strength um how like well you are in like how good at you are in reasoning and like how good you are in math and honestly like even for internships and stuff the what they are looking for isn't really like oh how many languages do you know or like are you a linux master or anything they're looking for how quickly can you learn and how well you can communicate um for these people with no experience do you think they should do like outside of class kind of coding work by themselves i would recommend like even if you have experience like start working on personal projects and start exploring what you like about cs and which like which fields you like and what interests you in cs um a cs like just taking cs classes in college isn't enough to actually like to actually learn about what cs is like in industry um to be honest like a a lot of college classes don't teach you very important like industry relevant skills such as get or um or things like that so i would recommend like experience or no experience always like always be willing to learn outside of class and always be curious about like what classes don't teach you but what was your experience like transferring universities like did you have to travel a lot and um did you have to like go apartment hunting or were you living in the dorms and stuff before transferring universities it was like so when i was at michigan like my my family's in maryland so that was like a lot of traveling a lot of um a lot of apartment hunting um i would basically be away from home for like half a year um each year and then but like once i came back like i i kind of got lazy it was like i don't really want to apartment hunt and like apartments are too expensive in like a college town so i decided to just live at home and commute um besides that like i like i said like there was a big social change i had to like really get used to how um i had to adjust my expectations i guess because like university of maryland is a very large university um sometimes like like both physically and like peoplewise so like it had a lot of money it could like afford a lot of like fancy stuff but also like my classes would sometimes be like a 45minute walk away or something like that while like college park um or university of maryland was um it was very small like the longest i had to walk was 20 minutes and there were very few people and it didn't have like the budget behind like university of michigan so i had to really adjust my um expectations because like i couldn't expect like i can't expect um university of maryland to really match up like financially or like with like fancy buildings and stuff like that when as compared to university of michigan so it was just like getting used to a new place getting used to um getting used to a new department because i was transferring majors too and also like um having to adjust my credits and stuff so um i actually like lost half of my credits when i transferred to university of maryland i had like 90 credits from my nursing school and then i um only 45 of them transferred because there's my nursing classes were too specific do you like match up to any of like university of maryland's requirements so it was sort of like it was sort of like going through all of that and like a little bit of um a little bit of paperwork trying to um count my crap as many of the of the credits that i could yeah um how like how important do you think the credits are to keep in mind for people who want to transfer majors like let's say that they want to drastically change their major from something um and they're going to lose a lot of credits at that point do you think it's worth the switch um i think like for that it depends on your priorities like for me the reason i made the switch was like i knew i couldn't last as like a nursing major i knew that like if i continued the nursing major and if i continue like taking more out picking up more hours at hospital i would get um burnt out eventually so um for me like the like sacrificing half of my credits was worth it because i knew i would i would be better off being a cs major and like at least be doing something where i wouldn't be like social like emotionally and mentally burnt out um but like if you're transferring and you um i would say like first like shop around so like make make sure you have a bunch of different alternatives so like if one school doesn't accept most of your credits maybe like another program does um i think the major thing is also um your gen ed so like a lot of um colleges will require some sort of like you have to have x amount of humanities x amount of stem credits no matter what major you are so um also keep that in mind and try like seeing how you can fit like your current majors classes into those gen eds um like to be honest like my situation was a little it was a little weird because for the nursing school they didn't have like these gen ed classes and that's like where i got hit the most when it came to like transferring transferring um colleges so um just like i would say like just try to keep your alternatives open we have a few questions i'll be asking them to jessica and so the first one um this person actually asked two questions and i'm going to start off with the first part the question was could you please speak more about the qualcomm internships jessica um sure so for my qualcomm internships i was for both my internships i was under their um their general android graphics like gpu unit or gpu department my first internship was during it was during my first semester or it was it was during the summer after my first year as a cs major um and that was sort of like working on internal tools um they wanted like uh they had like their an internal tool that was written in pearl which is a pretty cursed language and it forced them to like to um if force people on the team to like download large packages and stuff and go jump through a lot of hoops basically just to get that tool running so my job was just to translate that tool into python and then add like a graphic user interface on top plus like a command line interface on the side um and my second one was for their um their display um display processing unit team so like it was it was similar where i had to like i also had to work on their internal toys and that was but that was more um working more closely with their um their hardware so my second internship was involving like reading registers that were on like that were on the um on the dpu chip so it was they were about the same my first like my first one was in python my second one was um in c plus plus and then that was like when i learned c flows um do you know any internships for high school students um so i do know like google does have their step program and i think micros i want to say microsoft also has um also has a program geared towards high school students to be honest like most internships are um are focused on juniors and seniors in college because a lot of companies want to be able to hire you like within one or two years of you being an intern um but i think like if you look around or if you like ask local companies um they might be accepting high school students for internships okay sounds good our third question was um actually what do you hope to do after college um honestly like i'm not too sure um i like i guess like short term i want to like get like um work at qualcomm for a few more years hopefully like um depending like maybe transfer to um a different company hopefully apple or something um to be honest like i kind i kind of like i kind of got my qualcomm internship by chance and that's when i realized like like sort of you really don't know where like where um where life really takes you so like just like i don't know i don't know what i want to do after college probably just like work a few years hopefully like work my way up to like become a team manager maybe i don't know oh but what i do know is like i do want to get a graduate's degree um like for me personally like i don't think my undergrad education was a lot like i i feel like there's just so much to learn in cs and like i don't know i don't even know like a quarter of it to be honest even as a senior so definitely like get a graduate degree and actually like find out which which like subfield of cs really inspires me that makes sense our um next question is do you know of any scholarships for high school students scholarships for high school students um i would like firm from my experience a lot of the scholarships were from the universities department itself so like for example when i went to nursing school their department had a scholarship that they gave to me and then um i know for university of maryland specifically they have like that they have scholarships that will like like you can like get free um that like college board offers um but besides that like i personally didn't apply to a lot of scholarships like that were given by either foundations or private companies but like if you do once you go into ccs or stem um and you are like a woman you could there are definitely like scholarships out there for you that you can apply to okay sounds good um our next question was um actually about what is like the transition like from a more female dominated major to a more maledominated one it was very jarring yeah like my my nursing school had like literally seven guys out of 170 175 students in the freshman class seven guys and then once i like went to ccs i was like oh my god there's so many guys around it was yeah it was very strange at first like i honestly didn't notice in in like the lower the um like the beginner classes so like intro to cs classes i got the impression that like it was relatively equal um male and female but like once you get into like the upper level classes where they're only like 30 some people then you realize like oh wow i'm like the only girl in class or something and it's i think like it was it was it was just very strange yeah that's understandable um our next question is um someone is asking um your advice like when is it the best time to do a college transfer in your opinion like freshman or sophomore year um what's the best time to college transfer that's tough like it really depends on where you are at the moment like i would say it's if you're transferring colleges like probably freshmen to be honest because like if you if you know like this major or this college isn't right for you it's best to get out as early as possible so you haven't like you haven't spent too much time too much too many resources or credits in this specific major and you haven't like committed too much to it that way like you can you can sort of like switch colleges like by the time you're a sophomore you've honestly made like you've already had like settled down in that college you've like you've made your group of friends hopefully and um you've you've already like built a life in that college because like you've already spent a year there so it's pretty hard to like to just like up and like leave that college so i would say like freshmen but like also i would say if you if you like aren't if you aren't sure but like you really like this major but like you aren't doing too hot in there or something like that um don't don't give up too easy i would say like there's find that like balance find like the there's like a fine line between between those two yeah it's it's honestly like hard to say to be honest yeah no that's definitely understandable um but our um next question is if you had any like specific personal experiences with the gender discrimination like with gender discrimination in general that we talked about earlier um personally no like university of maryland has been really good about like supporting women and stem um i've personally found like a lot of female friends who also do stem so it's like i haven't i haven't really felt isolated as like a woman in cs and i've been able to find like find friends and peers who are like also who are also in like a similar situation as i so personally i haven't like really experienced any discrimination that's really good um our next question actually goes back to the college transferring um and the person was asking if you're going to transfer colleges and you don't make the transfer if you don't like if they don't accept you does that damage anything from your current college that would really depend on your situation um so i think like because like in my situation i was transferring i was transferring from the nursing school um and at that point i had already like transferred i've had i had already um confirmed the transfer to like a separate department in like the university of michigan um it would really depend on on like the specific situation so if you i i would say like usually probably not because because when you're transferring colleges it's not like you've officially dropped out of like the current college you're um you're attending unless like you've actually confirmed like that you no longer attend with that college but if like say you apply to transfer to harvard or something and harvard doesn't accept you um it's as long as like you're still confirmed a student at like your current college i think like you'll be fine it's not like it's not like your your school will be like oh how dare you like try to transfer out and not be able to and then we'll attract like colleges aren't won't like be mad if you try to transfer out and it for one reason or another doesn't work out so you haven't had any experiences with like professors looking you well not you but like you wouldn't have any experiences with like professors looking down on you or like the other people just talking about about you type thing um not really like so when you're transferring like colleges and stuff that's between you and and maybe your advisor like i honestly didn't even tell my advisor that i was transferring colleges like it's like it could be between you and your advisor it doesn't have to be it's like that is like your own private business that like you're it's up to you to disclose to whoever whoever you want about like transferring and stuff like that um professors and stuff like if they look down on you for transferring i feel like that's on that's on them like i don't know i yeah i don't think like professors i haven't had professors like them because like i dealt with my transferring like very privately it's nice that you could do it privately i think that that's important um our next question was actually about like what websites or resources would you recommend for beginners trying to learn to code do you have any ideas um websites and resources um so for for um general like language and stuff languages and stuff um i know geeks for geeks and w3schools are pretty good if you're like looking up a quick reference or like you want to know like oh how do i make a class in java or something like that or what are the list functions of python those are two very helpful resources um i personally haven't used like i know a lot of people recommend sites like udemy or like sites that will like actually give you a crash course to a language but i personally don't use those a lot um this might i i haven't seen people recommend this but i would highly recommend you like read through any official documentation for that language that way like those are the most helpful sometimes like they might be hard to read and you might have to like sometimes the terminology is a little strange but i think like those are often the best resources otherwise it's just like looking through stack overflow questions or like looking through obscure email chains and stuff like that if your bug is really bad um our next question is um what is the most common language like of code that you have used most of the time that you have worked in yes um this is this one's really hard because like i've i've basically been learning like new languages every class for like each each different class i take but um i think like the most common one for me is probably c and c plus plus um because like oh my i'm learning a lot more like lower level stuff now so like i'm i've taken os i've taken an android systems classes class and those were like two c classes over the summer um i had to work with c plus plus and c plus plus is very similar to c um yeah aside from that i guess like java job was also pretty common yeah sounds good our next question was actually going back to your qualcomm internship could you describe i know you said that they reached out to you but could you describe like was there anything more specific about how they like how you found it or got your internship how they reached out to you that you could share um sure so like my like how i got my internship was basically like i don't know if you you you are familiar with um with the all women hackathon technica i basically like attended that my first semester that's it's like a i want to say it's like a 16 hour hack 16 or 48 hours i forgot but like it was uh it was over two days and then during that time like i um i basically did a project with my with my friend where like we wanted to learn python so i basically made like a like the game of snake in python with like using the pi game module and then added like some graphics and sound and then my friend was like a um she was an electrical engineering major so she knew a lot more about lower level stuff and she basically ported that onto dragon like qualcomm's dragon board 410c um they're like it's kind of like a raspberry pi but like basically that board and then like um she also like worked really closely with a few qualcomm engineers and recruiters who are like they're like sponsoring that challenge at the tech like at the hackathon um oh just give me your emails and like send you an invite to one of our special interview events during winter break and then i was like sure why not like i'm looking for like internships anyways um and i i don't even know like like at that point i i honestly didn't know what like qualcomm was as a company so i was like sure why not like i have nothing to lose um they sent me like an email a few weeks after the hackathon and then like throughout the entire process my parents were like this has to be a scam because like there's no way like there's no way like you got you got like an interview offered that like that easily um but during like winter break they just flew me out to california and we did like a twoday event where i did two technical interviews and then after that like they just gave me a gave me an offer so yeah i guess like the general just was i i got really lucky yeah that sounds awesome um our last question is actually i think a really good way to end offer panel um someone asked if you could comment or like the current job market for cs graduates like is it harder like how hard it is to get a job because of the cover 19 situation um yeah definitely like it's definitely way harder to get jobs in like in this current market because of covert um i know a lot of people have had their internships canceled and a lot of like fulltime offers rescinded um yeah i know like some some companies are like still hiring or looking to hire i know like qualcomm is still interviewing and hiring people um but definitely like it's definitely a lot harder than usual to like to get a job for cs grads um hopefully like by the time you guys like graduate college and get a degree like it's it won't be like in this situation um but usually like the job market is really good for cs i know like a lot of people online sort of fake it out to be super competitive and like super super draining just to like do interviews and apply online but like to be honest that's if you're trying to like get the really fancy like google tech jobs but um yeah like in general it's not like if you if you have a cs degree you will find a job one way or another um it's just that like for because of covid like a lot of companies have been really cautious about actually hiring people due to like stocks dropping and stuff like that okay so i believe that's all the questions that we can take right now since we will be ending the panel soon um but before we end here's just a little um a little information on us girls code it as an organization um so what we do is uh we connect beginner coders with mentors so we're very a very beginner friendly organization where we're um you know taking in people who have no experience in coding mostly and then connecting them with people who do have experience and then for those who do have experience we do also have volunteer and leadership opportunities like for board positions um and volunteer positions like jessica over here volunteers also do get volunteer hours um we welcome everyone all genders ages and backgrounds to the organization i know the name is girls code it but we we do strive to include everyone in our mission with an emphasis on closing the gender gap um we have a discord server where we can foster community among girls in computer science because we know it's very important to have that safe environment for women who want to do computer science once again all genders ages and backgrounds are welcomed in the server as well we promote coding education we provide classes and tutoring sessions and all of them are free to the general public you can sign up to get more information on when we are holding these classes and you can also sign up for tutoring sessions based on what you need help with so as of right now we added something on the tutoring site to give you guys an idea of what we can help you with and what we cannot so before you do sign up for tutoring please make sure to read that as well and once again our main goal as an organization is to empower more women in the field of computer science and to try to close that gender gap okay thanks so much for coming here's our social media our instagram is at girls credit pv uh we have our website it should be in the chat right now thank you so much simone and then you can email us if you have any questions at teamacroscodit.org oh we had a qr code on the last slide to scan to become a member so we also have um another link for that in the chat but i'm going to go back here in case you guys wanted to scan and that's basically it please check us out
