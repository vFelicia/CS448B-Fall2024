okay cool so we're gonna get started um welcome to java um class number four now um i'm alex i'm one of your instructors and andrea's the other one i don't know where she is on your screen but yeah uh so yesterday we were talking about if statements and if you didn't um have the chance to come to class yesterday i think we sent out a video a recording of the class so if you want you can watch that on your own time um but today we're going to be moving on um i'm going to share my screen actually before we do um i'm going to go over uh does anyone want to talk about the activity that we did yesterday with the if statements the magic 8 ball if anyone had any problems with their code or just want to ask questions about it or about any code actually feel free to talk now so just a reminder the activity we left off with yesterday it was the magic 8 ball if you were here um so we really hope you guys went um went home and kind of like fit around with it or added more options or just tried to run the code yourself and so if everyone's good with what we learned before um we're gonna go ahead and start the lesson for today okay so today we're going to be learning about arrays and arraylists and these are useful because before when we had a variable like stream name is equal to alex um that variable only holds one value which is alex but with arrays you can hold more than one value so you can hold like an int of numbers like one two three four five six seven but they have to hold the same type yeah hey do you want me to do an example now oh wait first yeah sure okay okay um okay so everyone as always we're going to want to make a new class so we can do some examples and write some code today during class so when you open up bluej you have this screen and you click on new class up here and name it whatever you want um so then you get this screen with all of this random code and you're going to delete all of that and just type public class array class or whatever you mean your classmates love like static voice and i'm just gonna copy paste that into chat in case you don't want to type all that out basically the public static void mainstream stuff it just allows you to type code in it and so you can run run the code too hello where did the chat go well this is fun okay i can't find the chat so you guys might just to copy this down by looking um i'll give you like a minute to catch up yeah thank you caitlin who talked and posted the code yay do you want to go over how to exactly make the array or like yeah okay so to create an array you have first have to declare the data type and the data type is just like if it's an int double string and yeah so you just do int in this example and then you do these brackets and the brackets are like above your enter sign and they're like the square brackets and then you put the name of what you want to name your array and then equals new because we're creating a new array and then the data type again and in brackets and inside here inside the brackets you want to put the size because for arrays you have a fixed size so if you declare a size of 5 then it will only have five values and you can't change it so you can't add or delete values okay so like we said before you can make an array of any type of variable so like in double and string but all of the entries and your array have to be the exact have to be the same type of variable so an array of all ends or all doubles or all strings so just to like emphasize how you just to go over how you make one i'm going to make an array in blue jay over here um so an int array okay maybe not a string array so you start with the type of variable and then brackets to let the computer know it's an array and then you name their rate like anything you want to like dogs and then equals new to let them know you're making a new array the type of variable again and then in brackets how big you want it to be so i'll go to seven and that should be it um that is basically how you make an array and we'll show you how to print it out later um but for now that's basically all we'll do yeah so for arrays um to add like okay so first for erase it's a bit different like how you're normally used to so arrays they start counting starting from zero so it would be zero one two three and four and the index is just like a pointer that points to what value you want to access so it's kind of confusing but if in this example you want to put like the number seven in the first value for the array you would have to do array brackets zero bracket equals seven instead of like array one so zero means the first value yep kind of like you can see in the diagram over here so like at index zero that's basically going to be the first entry in the array because we start counting at zero and then the entry with the index one is basically the second entry so it's kind of shifted a little and that's really important to remember when you're working with the rays and so before we set like the value 7 to um at index 0 so to print out the value we would just do system dot out dot print line parenthesis and then the array and then you want to put the index because that's how you refer to the value so it's kind of like the index is a name tag and the value is a person so to call the person you call them by their name so the index is kind of like their name yep so like i said we we're going to talk about how different an array like andrea was just talking about so um this is a really this is basically why you need to know the index the concept of the index when you're talking about erase so that you can properly print it out like maybe you just want to print out the third number in your array and so you would use array bracket 2 because the third entry has the index of 2. that can be really confusing but you'll get used to it though um i'm just going to wait so i'm going to fill this array with seven strings um because there are seven slots in the array so like we showed you before you're going to use the name of the array and then in brackets which um index you want to add in your element at so i'll start with zero because it's the first one and then it's an array of strings so i'm going to fill it with names of dogs because i didn't get dogs um so oops fluffy um i'm gonna make it before because seven is not um i don't know what you name your dogs okay um and notice that even though we're ending at index three we have four entries in our array on i don't know man okay okay so now we're now maybe you want to print the name of one of these dogs and you just and to do that to print a random entry in your array you're going to use the system.out.printline method that we taught you before so it's really pretty simple you just go system to have a print and then as always parentheses and inside the parentheses this time you're going to call an element of your array using the index that it's at um basically how you identify a certain element is always by its index so i'm just going to print whatever is in index 2 and that's going to be the third entry and that's marley so i want to see if that actually works so i'm going to compile my code go down to the brown box right click second option okay and i printed out marley yeah that worked so you can do this with an array of like any type you can do integers or doubles whatever you want and yeah do you guys have any questions please feel free to ask questions or if you have any errors in your code we can help you figure it out especially since we have a smaller class andre is there anything in the chat i can't see no okay cool we can move on okay so since you guys don't seem to have any questions we'll move on to the second part okay so for there's another type that's called an arraylist and an arraylist is a bit more flexible because the size is actually not fixed so the size can change as you add elements and also as you delete elements so yeah it's a bit more flexible so too and also for an array list creating one in java is a little bit different first you have to do arraylist with a capital a and a capital l it's just like that and then these angle brackets like the less than and greater than sign and inside there you want to put the type of array list you want and instead of doing like int or double or string you actually want to spell it out so int becomes integer and double becomes double and stream becomes string but it also has to be capitalized so like capital i integer and then you name your arraylist whatever you want dogs cats colors and then equals new arraylist again and then you put the brackets and data type and then parentheses and inside these parentheses you can leave it empty or you can also put the size so you can put like three and you'll have three values in it but if you put three values in it you can also add on to your array or you can delete items as well so like throughout your code you can change how many values you have in your arraylist yeah yeah um so i'm just going to go ahead and make an arraylist for an example right now wow it's while this slide is down the screen and i'm just going to comment out the code from before and another thing with arraylist you have to import it so like right above the public class scene you want to type import java dot util dot arraylist this is kind of similar to how we imported the ability to use so we're going to import the ability to use an arraylist okay so to make an arraylist it's just like you see in this slide on the right over here so you're going to start with the word arraylist careful to do all the capitals in the right places um because as we explain java is um a caps sensitive language so it cares about that um so a realist and then less than less than greater than sign and inside you're going to put the type of arraylist you want to make so i'll just go with double this time oops um and then we're going to name our arraylist so i'm going to call it scores scores equals new arraylist and then the type of realistic it is again so like the type of value the type of variable you're storing in it and then parentheses and a semicolon as always if you're making your own arraylist on your own computer you can like make whatever type you want i'm just going to go with this okay so tell us if you need more time whenever you do um but right now i'm just gonna move on to the next one okay so to add values into our arraylist it's just the arraylist name and then this dot add and then parentheses and then whatever value you want to add into your arraylist goes inside the parentheses so realist.add5 adds the value 5 into the arraylist and this time you don't have to specify the index it just adds on to your arraylist at the end and to delete an array to delete a value this time you want to do the arraylist name and then dot remove and then the index and the like index 0 gets removes the first value and the reason why you want to put the index instead of getting the value is because if we have an arraylist with like two values that are like 11 if you get if you do not remove 11 meaning you want to remove the value that is 11 but you have two 11's then the arraylist doesn't know which one you want to remove so yeah you have to basically yeah yeah you always call it value by its index yeah yeah so next slide andrea do you want to do the next slide oh sorry and then to print the value we would do system.out.printline arraylistname and then dot get and then we would put the index yeah so that's like before you tell the computer which element of the index you want using the which element of the array you want using its index okay so now that we've made our arraylists over here hopefully you made your own on your own computer um i'm going to fill it up with values and we do that with the dot add method like we talked about before um so the name of the arraylist math score is and then we'll go with a 90.5 um i just add in a few so we have valleys to work with notice that doesn't it doesn't matter like what size the arraylist is as you add more values it keeps expanding if you remove values it gets smaller and like the size of the arraylist isn't set permanently okay so i just filled in a few random scores i'm imagining like scores on a math test but you can do whatever you want so right now we just know how to print out like individual elements of an arraylist we can teach you how to print out the whole arraylist or the whole array later but right now we're just going to concentrate on printing individual elements so say i just want to know what the third student got on their math test um so like in the slideshow we're going to use a system.out.printline method um like we said before that's basically how you that's basically just how you print something out to the computer um always a system.out.printline you can do a print or a print line it doesn't really matter um so the name of the arraylist and then to get an element in order to print you're go when you're using an arraylist you're going to use dot get and then inside the parentheses you put whatever index whatever is the index of the element you want to print so since i said i want to do the third student does anyone want to tell me which index i should put in the parentheses to print out or do you see do you have any guess two yeah exactly so i'm not sure who's on that but like great job so we start counting from zero so therefore the third element is going to have the index of two so when we print this line we should get 9.8 because that's the third element so i'm going to compile again make sure there aren't any errors right click second option okay and it printed 99.8 that's exactly what we wanted and yep so say we want to remove an element from the arraylist for some reason maybe we just don't need it anymore maybe like a student isn't participating anymore or whatever so maybe i want to remove the fifth element from the arraylist so that picture was like i'm going to drop your lowest test score right yay so now you see that it's very nice so yeah so i'm going to remove the fifth element um this is like really similar to the dot wait this is not similar to the dot there we go this is similar to the dot get so do that we're just going to use the name and then dot remove and then inside the parentheses we put the index of whatever we want to remove um so since i'm doing the fifth element here i'm going to go with index 4 and i don't really know how i can show you that it removed index 4 but it did maybe since this was the last element in the arraylist maybe now that we don't have the fourth now that we don't have the fifth element anymore if we tried to print the fifth element i wonder what the computer would tell us it would probably be an error right because if we want to print the fifth element but there is no fifth element i can't do it so i'm just going to try that see what it's going to tell us so dot wait math scores dot get and then the fifth element is compile and wait was this and it didn't print anything and it told us their out of bounds exception so index four is out of bounds because our arraylist is only four elements long so it doesn't have an index four and it can't print it yeah because it has zero one two and three index yep so basically right now since we removed index four all we have in the arraylist is this but maybe what if we remove the second element so this one so that would mean everyone's indexes are gonna shift so if this one like just gets removed then 99.8 is going to have the index of one now instead of two everything's going to be everyone's index is going to become one less because we removed that if that makes sense so if you imagine them all like you know like books in a bookshelf if you remove one of the books all the rest of the books are gonna slide over and take its place so yep i'm gonna give you guys like a couple minutes to maybe hatch up or play around with both arrays and arraylists um and then we're going to do a short activity okay so if anyone has any questions about what we just taught you about arrays and array lists how to add things how to remove things how to print them um go ahead and ask them like and meet yourself or type in the chat or any areas in your code that you can't figure out okay then so if no one has any questions we're going to move on um we just have a short fun activity for today we're going to simulate having an inventory in a pet shop so um we're going to use an arraylist for this because it's just more flexible maybe the pet shop sometimes it has five pets up for adoption but maybe sometimes it has seven and you just don't wanna like put a hard limit on how big the inventory can be so we're going to make an arraylist to like simulate um like holding the num holding all the information about holding the name of the pets in the pet shop um okay so in order to make an arraylist like we did before we're going to type oh and remember that like when you start a new class and you want to use realist you'd have to use this import statement okay so you do you write arraylist just like to let them know you're making an arraylist and then for this we're going to want to make ooh does anyone want to tell us what type of a realist we want to make in order to keep track of animals in pet jump lena do you have a guess or anyone else string yeah exactly um perfectly right uh usually arraylists are like often strings because you store like names of people in a class or things like that so uh we're going to make it an arraylist of strings so inside your greater than lesson signs you put the word string and then you name the arraylist so i'm going to call mine pet shop but you can call us whatever you want um and then you realist type again and then parentheses and as always your semicolon and in here you can put spaces or you don't have to it's just like personal preference but i think it looks easier and it's easier to like keep track of and look at if you put a lot of spaces whatever you want so i'm going to fill this array list of strings with a lot of pet names um all the names of the pets i think that pet shop has up for adoption and this is kind of like what we did before with names and strings so pet shop dot add um i'm so bad at coming up with names um you guys go ahead and like add your own names but i'm just gonna do this over here um cotton candy oh this is not what i would name my dog is anyone like have a pet if you do like i can add their name in okay i'll do one more okay so now i have this arraylist of strings that has all of these pet names in it and i'm just saying that these names are the names of pets in the pet shop and so maybe we'll make a program where the user can put can tell the computer a random number from like one through six and then uh we can like randomly we can assign them or like give them the pet that's in that index now i realize that you'll want to ask them for 05 but okay so in order to get um in order to ask the user for input and to get their input back and use it in your code we're going to use the scanner like we talked about before um so we need to import the ability to use a scanner so we type at the top of our class before we name the class import java.util and like you can see that's really similar to arraylist okay and down here basically wherever you want to put it um i'm going to make a scanner tool um see if i remember how to do this scanner you can name your scanner whatever you want i know we like used the word input before but i like to use scan and yeah so like i said you can change this to input or whatever you want and this line of code can go anywhere in your code as long as it's before the pet shop stuff and so we're going to print out to the user like hi um enter a number okay so we're going to take this number and like use it to use it as the index of the pet that they get so basically we're asking them for an index number and since indexes start counting at zero and go up we're going to ask them to enter a number between 0 2 5 because there are 6 entries in here so the last index is going to be 5. you can also do this with like the pet name but it's it's a bit more complicated and it uses like if statements and stuff so yeah we're just gonna stick with index yep but yeah there's totally a way where maybe they want series and they can type in the word series and we can do it that way but it's a little more complicated like andrea said so in order to print something out to the user as always we go system.out.print line if you want and inside the parentheses we're going to print out a string so we'll go hello welcome to the pet shop um enter a number from zero to five you get a pet and this is what the computer is going to tell the user and so once the user re reads that statement they're going to okay i'll type in a number from zero to five and in order to get that value we're going to make a an int variable that will store whatever they type in and it's going to be an int variable because since it's the number 5 it's going to be a whole number an integer so we're going to make an integer value you um hope you guys remember how to do this from before but if not no worries you can always review so and i'm gonna name it response and then equals and this is where the scanner comes in so we're going to use our scanner tool like we made up here and go scan dot next it and that should take whatever the user types in and store that in an int variable that we named response i'll give you like a minute to catch up okay so once they type in their index we're going to tell the user the name of the pet that they received so in order to do that we uh do it like before and use the dot get method so we're going to do system.out.print and just go your pet is remember to put a space after whatever you typed because if not it's going to go your pet is strawberry um because the computer doesn't know to put in a space so you need to put in your space right here and then plus and then we're going to use the dot get method and do pet shop dot get response and we're going to use response here because remember we basically asked the user for the index of the path they want and then we're going to use that index in the get statement to get it and print it out and i'm just gonna and if we really want to be fancy we can actually remove that pet from our pet shop arraylist since the user quoting got the pet so it's not in the pet shop anywhere so we're going to do that just like we did before and go pet shop dot remove and then remember here we put the index uh we can't call the call the element by the actual element so we can't go like remove serious because what if there are two seriouses in the pet shop like andre i said before and it doesn't really know which one to remove so we're going to remove it using index and we know the index at because the user typed it in and we stored it in response so we're going to go remove the element at the integer response okay uh so i'm going to compile this hopefully you guys are caught up by now and i'm just going to run it through one time and then we'll be done with the class today so we'll go here right click on the brown bot second option okay and yay the first part of the code works it types hello welcome to the pet shop and our number from zero to five so i'm just gonna go with three and it told us our pet is cotton candy and that's right because cotton candy is the fourth one in the array so that means its index is three and so therefore our pet is cotton candy and so our code works and you guys can go home and play around with this code run it as many times as you want um but right now we're going to be down in the class for today does anyone have any questions anything at all does anyone have any errors okay then so uh we are done for class with today i think that's all andre do you have anything to add um nope okay so we hope you guys had fun and learned something new and if you're free to go home and practice if you want and yeah thank you all so much for coming i think the next class is is wednesday okay see you all thank you bye uh i'm again so see ya okay bye
