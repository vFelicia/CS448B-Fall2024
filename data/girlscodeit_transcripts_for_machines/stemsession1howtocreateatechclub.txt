i just like to thank all of you for showing up today this is our official first official stem session and it'll be going over how to start a club and we're thinking about having these every two weeks or so and at the end of each course i hope you guys are all taking the python courses we're offering right now and at the end of each course we will have a guest speaker come in and talk about their achievements um but for now i'm just going to talk about how to start a club if you guys have any questions please save them until the end and let's do this so i'm going to share my screen with you guys so as i said today's session will be a how to start a club and it's i've titled it the eight steps to becoming a leader plus ideas so i will just basically talk about the eight most important steps in my opinion of how to start a club in school or outside of school and then i will give ideas suggestions for fundraising all that fun stuff so please stay until the end and just if you have questions please save them until then so i'm going to start by explaining the two types of clubs there are in my opinion so there's a school club and a outside organization nonprofit organization whatever you want to call so our organization girls coded falls under the category of organization of course and so the difference is is that one is in school obviously and one is outside of school and as you can imagine the one that's outside of school probably has a lot more work involved in it we have like a whole website a lot of the school clubs are just based in school and um not all clubs fall under one or one category or the other and as as i'll show later with one of the club ideas they can be both at once but this is just the general separation i think so the first step to forming a club is to find something you're passionate about so you really have to find an idea that you like because then you'll be able to put more time into it and you'll be happier and you'll put in more time into the club and you'll be able to do it better so the first step in this step is to brainstorm ideas and you'll want to brainstorm ideas because you can have a lot of ideas but you also have to brainstorm if they'll work or not and you have to see how willing you are to put time into that idea um you can either build on a subject you like such as girls code we're building on programming and coding and empowering girls in the stem field or you can explore something entirely new if you've recently become interested in art you can form an art club so that for people who are also recently interested in art they can join too and just if it's a school club make sure your club doesn't already have a club that's based on our idea because schools will not take duplicate clubs of each other so just make sure your idea is unique original and it's something that you're passionate about step number two is to find a few friends to help you so this stuff is important because you can't really start a club on your own so if you find friends who are hard working and willing to put time into your club's ideas you can combine their ideas with yours and it'll make the club even better because it's all inclusive and it's important to have a lot of members in your club so just don't limit it to friends i say friends because usually people when starting a club they find their friends and from there they branch out but just try to reach out to someone form a club with them if you have someone who ha if you know someone has the same interest as you and this club then start the club with them but having more friends and members in your club by doing that you can get feedback and improve on your own ideas so um just try to find my tip for this one is to find hardworking and devoted members because you want members you don't want to start a club with just friends who are there to take up the leadership positions right because we all know there's some people who do that but you want to find devoted members who are willing to put the time into your club and have fun with it and work to make it bigger so for example all of us and girls code it not all of us are friends but for example i joined because my friend who is the vice president asked me to join and we're all hardworking and devoted to coding and from there we can meet other people from our website so that's a little bit different in school it's easier because you know most of the people but just my last take on this is to try and find friends and members who are devoted and willing to put the work in and they also like your idea because you don't want them joining and then saying that they want another idea so step number three is to find an advisor and usually this is a requirement for all school clubs because um you need someone who to have their like room open for you to meet in and you also need them to give you advice because the advisor has to you have to have an advisor to monitor how your club's doing what they have even in outside organizations it's good to have some an adult to reach out to because problems can be caused that need to involve an adult and so the advisor can also help with the registration process of your club which i'll talk about later but the registration process in most schools is difficult especially since it's not always made clear and a lot of students end up doing it on their own if they want a club because a lot of people have work in school but then again this doesn't really apply to outside organizations like girls coded because we didn't really have a registration process it's just for school and an advisor can also provide a room to meet in which is also good because you kind of you can't just meet on the lunch tables usually but if you want it to be in official clubs and just make sure to explain your goals and expectations for their involvement because an advisor will only join your club if they know is involved what they have to be involved in because usually a lot of the advisors in schools especially have multiple clubs that they're monitoring and so it'll be good to have um to have them know if you're expecting them to like say drive you or be present at events outside of school then they'll have to know that beforehand because you can't just tell them oh yeah we need you to do this and they might say no because usually teachers have a lot of work to do and um that'll just make it harder on them and on yourselves because it won't allow you to have those events that you want so just make sure you tell your advisor what you expect of them and make sure to have an advisor if you're in your school i most schools need an advisor and it's better to have one once again i'm saying just for a room and for advice step number four is to check with your school so a lot of schools have registration process for clubs you can't just say i'm gonna start this club four members and expect the school to go with that in a lot of schools they have to accommodate many many many different clubs so each school has different registration processes and you have to pay attention to that and um so that you can actually make a valid club in your school and there's a lot of deadlines for this stuff because um again this stuff is only for school clubs but um there's a lot of deadlines like when you have turn in this form and what you have to platform like club constitutions and all that sort of fun stuff but just make sure to be aware of those deadlines and follow them really really closely and make sure you're really um on task for that and step number five i call divide and conquer but it's basically to divide up the roles in your board positions because you don't want to be the dictator of your club right you want to have a large set of friends and other members to help you and because if you divide four positions you'll be able to have more um ideas and that way your club will be more inclusive and people will want to join more so just allow your club members to vote on a board because that is showing that you care about their opinions and more people want to join because their opinion is being heard also ideally i'm saying this as a girls coded experience but you should have especially in school and outside organizations um i'll talk about how it's a little bit different there but in school your club a lot of schools just want a present vice president and secretary and maybe sometimes a treasurer but it's good to have a communications director too and these clubs and these positions can have multiple members and them just so that you can if your club is really large and to make it as inclusive as possible and so the present or copresence i'll talk a little bit about expanding later but the president will plan the majority of the events and run the whole club as a whole that's basically their job is to keep the club together right and the vice president can will assist the presidents because usually the president's job especially if your club organization is really large the presidents will have a lot to work on so the vice president will help them with that and that way the workload is divided and the club can function better the secretary can keep track of participation and write down any ideas or questions that club members or board members may have it's important to keep track of ideas because as i said you want to be it's really important to be inclusive in the club so you'll want to include as many people as possible and that involves writing down their ideas using them to better your club and um yeah so the secretary basically does that the treasurer is in charge of the budget if your club has a budget so not all clubs have budgets usually school clubs don't and um i'll talk about that a little bit more later in the next slide but usually um outside organizations um like for example girls code is a nonprofit organization so we don't currently have a treasure we're thinking about it just because we want to make a club better but if you're just starting out no you don't always need money to start out your club um but if you have a budget if your club is going to be really big and for example if you're extending from like a charity organization then you'll need a treasure to keep track of the money that they're donating to those organizations so the treasurer is the one in charge of the budget and the communications director sends out emails which is really important because you really want to notify your members of your meetings beforehand you don't want to tell them the day before oh hey guys we're going to have a club meeting tomorrow because not all of them would make it and that really discourages members because they don't know what's going on and they'll just want to get out of the club because it's very unorganized so the communications director's job really makes the club organized and scheduled so that because they send out emails notifying the members of any changes events or meetings so making different jobs helps the club become organized and efficient more organized and more efficient so dividing the rules helps with organization because the workload is divided and it's not just all um on top of one person it's not all on top of you as i said we don't want to be a dictatorship we want to have like parliament i guess but um making different jobs helps with that and it also improves the efficiency of the club because dividing the workload means that the different work the all the work can be done quicker and that way your club becomes better and it's able to attract more members and it's important to allow other leadership positions because we're not a dictatorship but it's important to allow other leadership positions because other people contribute their ideas and by combining your ideas with other ideas you're being inclusive allowing for people to benefit your club and that really helps um to make your club better and more inclusive because as i said the one important takeaway for a club is to have it be inclusive because then more people want to join and um oh yeah this is my tip so allow for clubs to have for club positions to have two members if your club is very large so you can have more than two you don't want to have like a whole group for each position because that may be a little bit unorganized but if you have multiple numbers for each position then especially if your club is really large like for girls coded we have at least two people on each position but um it helps with the workload dividing it as i said dividing the workflow it makes the um club process much more efficient and it gets the work done quicker and so step number six is optional it depends on your club but it's to plan a budget and i just want to talk about this one because it is important sometimes but some schools have events where clubs can collect money for example in my school we have this thing it's called club rush where we each buy um like food items and we sell them for a higher price to make profit and that way we get money for a club and for a lot of clubs this is necessary because you need money to function if you're going to plan a big event where everyone goes somewhere you have to pay for buses for food and for transportation is buses but all that stuff you have to pay or if you're planning a technology competition related club you have to pay the registration fee and that's just where the budget comes into play but not all clubs especially if you're new to starting a club and if you're if your club is small in the beginning and you don't really need a budget you as it gets larger then but you so as i talked about you have to decide what the club needs and how you're gonna get all that money because if it's an insanely large cost you're going to have to go out and require more money and usually that's what puts a lot of people off because they don't have the funds for that so just start small is my advice and grow your club larger and as it grows larger you can get a budget and you can have people donate to a club or you can hold fundraising events which i'll talk about later and my third um point for this is that this can be a separate job headed by the treasure as i talked about the last slide the treasure is the specific handles specifically handles the budget if there is one and usually school clubs as i said don't have a budget but if you're gonna collect money for an event or something um then it's good to have a budget planned so that you know how much you spend how much you already have so step number seven is to plan ahead and planning ahead is important because you have to schedule your meetings beforehand in order for people to come as i talked about the communications director's job is really really important because imagine that you're a club member and you get an email like the day before and it says tomorrow we're going to have a club meeting would you go to that meeting i wouldn't because it's just i might have too much on my plate at that moment i might be too stressed out and i just wouldn't want to deal with it or i would forget if you know something for a while beforehand if you get reminders about it then it helps to remember so you want to plan ahead make sure your meetings correspond with as many um members calendars as possible because you can't schedule a meeting and expect people to show up because they people not always put your club first they might have other time commitments that they've made beforehand and an important tip is to ask um what days and times works for people like through email maybe say um we'll have we're planning on having like our meetings wednesday or thursday please respond with the day that you will more more like you most want the club to meet and is most convenient for you and coming up with events that people can go to is very encouraging and engaging to your members and also i want to talk about um planning events so different clubs need to plan different events for example um let's say that your club is the interact rotary club and they go and they build houses for people they help build houses for people who need homes for the homeless and um you have to plan the event so you have to tell your members when that event is going to be beforehand you can't just tell them like saturday we're going here because no one will want to come so you want to make sure you know about those dates and that you communicate that to your members beforehand and finally our last step is partnering and i know this may seem like a big goal because if you're starting out small you usually start small and then get bigger and bigger and bigger but partnering is important because it expands your um club it expands in your club's influence for example i'm going to give an example with girls coded we're currently partnering with an organization called girlplex and they are on the east coast and as you can imagine in california we are very far away from the east coast because we're based in california and we're a small but through making our meetings and our website and through um and through reaching out to people through social media and all that stuff we have managed to gain their support and we have partnered with them so now even though we're based way on the west coast of the us we have influence in the east coast too people on the east coast know about us that partnering is um makes your club larger and have a greater influence because you want to know that as many people will be able to join your club as possible and that involves making it bigger making it more and you want to make people want to come to that club and expanding its influence can be done through partnering and so now i'm going to talk about ideas for clubs and um my first club ideas are the classics so we have the book club the key club and homework club and i'm sure you guys have heard about those in classics the problem with classics is that usually your school has them if you want to make it a school book because usually these are school clubs i think most of my ideas are based on school clubs but um these classics are the first ones that like for example my school has about a hundred and fifty maybe a hundred clubs and you can imagine that they probably already have a book club and key club and homework club right so you want to have an idea that is really original but if your school doesn't have these it's a great way to start because most people will know about that and more people want to start these because they're so well known and um homework club i just want to say is an amazing idea because it involves people getting together and helping each other with homework after school and that can be amazing to students because a lot a lot of people need help but they're too afraid to reach out and so a club can be a really stressfree environment to reach out to someone for help that's necessary um so my second one which is really popular is partnering with the charity organization and this one is an amazing cause charity organizations are amazing because people um this is basically based on helping other people and with charity organizations you can also get volunteering hours which is often used to encourage members to join but it's just a great cause like you're helping other people and these are just three but operation smile make a wish and save the children are really well known and usually these are throughout the whole country or even expand outwards from that operation smile helps um gain money or donates money for kids to get surgery if they have the cleft lip and you're bettering people's lives by donating money fundraising and charity organizations a lot of people join because it's such a great cause and for makeawish i was going to talk about how clubs can overlap between a school club and an outside organization so make a wish expands by letting students have school clubs outside or just be chapter presents outside of school or even just have fundraisers so um i'm gonna give an example with a school nearby me that they have host a fashion show and donate all of that money to make a wish and makeawish is actually they collect money and they um find and they use that those resources to buy stuff that kids really want but can't get and they gift it to them and it's amazing but um the great thing is that it doesn't it's very flexible make a wish allows for people to be for students to start a club in school and expand from there or they could just be chapter presidents because usually starting an outside organization is easier because you don't have to um the registration process i mean because there is none but usually it's harder to um work with so i just wanted to let you guys know that it doesn't limit to just school club or organization it could be both or yeah and my third tip is trying a stem club so girls coded is a stem club we are based on coding and but we're also based on empowering girls and encouraging girls to enter the coding field and overall stem field and so these are just a few options but there are so many different stem clubs and competitions so you can find a competition a team competition and start forming a team and that could be your club for example the science in ocean bowl is like trivia but for science and ocean and you go and you have the competition and you answer questions as a team and you gain points like that robotics is also really fun the two robotics clubs at my school are vex and frc and both are amazing because people join because you're able to create something with your hands and then go on a competition and experiment with that coding is also really good because programming and software development are so high in demand for jobs and literally every stem field has been very high demand so i really encourage you guys to pursue a stem interest but fourth option is to explore an artistic talent artistic talents are amazing because they are they you know they allow you to show your creativity they allow you to um and they just allow you to be like use a hobby for it to develop or even if you want to go into the art um industry this really helps because it lets you teach and be top art and so these are just diffuser photography art review magazine comic book club these that all sound really fun and um they're very creative and they're very flexible with what you can do and um they usually have a very stressfree environment which brings me to our last option which is just fun and stressfree quotes and usually these are um used in school but uh you so imagine your school day is really stressful right and how awesome would it be to go let's say to lunch or an after school club that just involves like a harry potter kahoot um a lot of people are obsessed with harry potter i am and um these are just um basically small silly debate topics like which house do you prefer and stuff like that or you can have a magic club magic clubs are awesome because you got to learn a whole new talent which is amazing magic so great and cooking just allows for a stressfree hobby that you could develop and if especially with um a lot of cultures in your school a lot of different ethnicities if you form a cooking club then you can develop it into an international club which includes cooking and customs from different ethnicities and so on so those are just some ideas for clubs to start and now i'm going to talk about tech clubs specifically because we are a tech club and we really encourage students our students to go into these so tech clubs are amazing as i said before because they offer a um jump start into the stem industry and right now the stem industry is very um it's looking for a lot of people so if you pursue a stem interest then you will most definitely find a job and i don't want it to sound just because of that but stem is an amazing field an amazing subject my favorite uh school subjects are always stem subjects because they allow you to experiment visualize they allow you to do everything and i'm just some ideas for tech clubs are for of course girls coded is a tech club that empowers girls to code because right now we don't have a lot of girls in coding and um in stem industries and we really seek to bridge that gender gap that is forming and we want to encourage girls to apply for stem related jobs because a lot of girls are intimidated by it i um last year i took a stem class in which i was the only girl and that can really intimidate a lot of women and they want to drop those and they'll want to pursue something with more girls in it and there is a lot of sexism in these industries where people um look on um and it's just harder for girls to apply but we're seeking to bridge that because there is no way to fix this without pushing girls into the stem field we have to um try and do this stuff because it is better for us and we have the opportunity to do it so for tech clubs we um you can have there's a lot of local opportunities to visit tech companies like not necessarily the big ones the big ones it's usually through school through an advisor who talks to them and they bring you in as a school trip but smaller companies can have you can have your club visit them and thus learn about their opportunities for work what they do and it's just a fun experience it's almost like an internship except for like an hour but and you're just learning about it and also working with other businesses so you could some of these businesses um extend to members to students trying to form clubs and it really helps because um a lot of people don't know from where to start and these businesses sponsor these causes to um push more people into the stem field because it is the major one right now in the world today if you see if you look around there is technology everywhere and it's so important to be involved in that and also this one is kind of like um additional point but looking for stemrelated events at libraries libraries have and there could be other places but i know for sure that libraries have a lot of stem related um events including little um organizations that develop their businesses in there and you can we also have we all know um an hour of code right and schools develop that but you can also work with that and you can spark your interest of for coding there or through organizations like girls code which i'm so happy you guys have joined because that means you're pursuing an interest that you like and that will be so useful to you so moving on i'm going to talk about some fundraising ideas and fundraising ideas include bake sales which i'm sure all of us have heard of where people bake and the all the donations go to the club science fairs are amazing especially for technology related clubs because students have the opportunity to show what they have made and earn money in the process for their club movie nights are also great because they should make a stressfree environment for students to come to and they pay for that um entertainment and that can be used to fuel your club scavenger hunts are fun school olympics are also fun like school olympics and fashion show i feel like go together because they can be a whole school effort and everyone will want to participate and you don't even have to raise money for a club you can raise awareness for a club like raise awareness how we do breast cancer week for example um and it's just you're raising awareness for that cause so um or you can have a craft fair where that kind of goes in with science fair both crafts it all gains money for your club right and fundraising.com if you guys want to write that down that is an amazing website because a lot of stores and businesses will lower their costs for products if your club if your club reaches out to them and says and like says we want to sell this and gain money from it and profit from it so that we can you use it to fuel our club or donate it to a charity organization like for example you can buy like a whole bag of lollipops for a very low cost and then sell each lollipop for a higher cost at your school fair for example and that's just helpful to profit your pub and i think okay and we're almost done and i just want to say that the most important thing is to choose something that you're really passionate about and that you'll have fun and put time into because if you're not passionate about this club idea then it won't last long because eventually you'll get tired of it you'll get tired of having to deal with it so just try to find something that you're interested in all right this is the time where you guys can ask questions i will stop sharing and feel free to write them in chat or on yourselves and speak thank you for listening to the presentation all right thank you everyone for coming i really appreciate you supporting our first stem session we believe the next one is going to be an intro to github these are amazing if you want to um pursue like small interests other than coding but make sure to sign up for coding classes they are free we will teach um python until i think the end of november or midnovember and then we start web development courses so just make sure to sign up for those um it'll really help you guys tech clubs are amazing support us and also come make sure to come to our next stem session in two weeks on friday at 4pm thank you all for showing up thank you for being here thank you for supporting us
