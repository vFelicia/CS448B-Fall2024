html is basically everything that is going to be in a web page so if we look at the inspect element and if we go into inspecting a web page if we click that inspect element it's going to be all of the code that we see in a web page so basically there's a couple elements of html that we're going to go through so an element is part of one html document and the document is basically that code that we see so it could be a piece of text like a paragraph or a header it could be an image a video or a link that takes us to a different website to declare where an element starts and ends you must enclose them in these tags and each feature is unique to each kind of tag oh i'm trying to make it okay i'm just gonna put that there for now um if there's a lot of questions and i can't see them please just feel free to yell at me um so most elements need an opening tag and a closing tag and i'm gonna change that most to all so everything we're going to be using today requires an opening and a closing element and that tells the computer that what's inside that these closing and opening salmon co opening and closing elements is our content so it's like a sandwich you have the two pieces of bread and whatever is in the middle is your contents of your sandwich um that's basically the same thing one of the examples that we're gonna go over today is a paragraph very very simple paragraph p p that denotes your paragraph one of the big things you want to note with html though is that you have an opening tag as shown here and a closing tag your opening tag is always going to be carrot bracket element that you're talking about so like a letter a series of characters closing carrot all of the things that are in that and then you're gonna have your carrot your closing bracket think of this as like the door that closes your element tag you always need this to close the element tag and you only need in the closing tag and then that same set of characters and then your closing carrot tag does that make sense to everyone perfect um i'm gonna move on here um okay so an attribute um an attribute gives additional information about an element just like an attribute of an object in the real world gives us more information about that object in the real world so attributes add style links image sizes classes ids etc this is mostly going to be when you think of style stuff most of this is going to be under css which is cascading style sheets which is going to be all of your pretty things about a web page but we can use it in html for things like images which is an example here any html element can have attributes attributes are always declared in the opening tag and they're usually in the format attribute equals a given value so in this one i should have thought about this before i said all they are right it is most um so this is your example your example of your image tag and we're going to go through this because this is one of the most unique tags we see in html so first we're going to have our opening caret same thing we always have our tag which is our series of characters or characters just like the p from the paragraph tag this is img so image so when you think about it src i know that can sound like really weird but if you think about it as source we have image the source of the image the source of the image equals this link and this is how you insert every single image into html files because what you do is you say okay carrot i have an image that image's source is this link and it's just a url or a jpeg link or other image file link name insert here and it's just within those two brackets so that's a this is my source this is how to call it and then you just close it off with your carrot bracket and your your slash and that's basically it it's just as simple as that you can really just take a link off of google images put it in between those two brackets and call it your image and that will insert it into your html file um so the structure of html documents we're not going to get into this too much right now but document root your html so your html file and then head title um href stuff which is you'll see that when we get into the replica file but it's basically just like your standard stuff body elements um and then text header all that stuff so structure of an html example you're going to see this in the example we're going to use today doctype.html what does this mean this means that our file is an html file it's not a java file it's not a python file it's not a javascript file it's an html file so doctype is html one this line is talking to html so first of all we're going to note that we have html opening tags and html closing tags just like we have everything else there's an opening and a closing this denotes that anything inside of those two tags is html code it will be read by the compiler in the html code it will be read by the browser's html code so these are really really important to have second head the head tag includes metadata about the webpage or other introductory information um you're going to notice that like i don't know the head is kind of a weird one we're not going to touch on it too much for now because you're not going to really need it but know that it doesn't really give you content so the the head is not really showing up on the screen as anything it's not like a header so this h1 is a header and this is the header that we see and this prints on the screen welcome as a header the one tricky thing about headers is that the number that is here in the opening and closing bracket for headers matters so i had a really good example of this um but basically play around with it when you're making your websites today the headers matter because they change what the header looks like so you can always change it back in um css but headers come with their own css like just inherently it's not like that bad like it's like header one is bigger than header two and it goes all the way up to header six so for easy css work if you think your header's too big just decrease the number and if you think your head is too small increase the number um if you're having a little bit of trouble with that call me over when we're doing reply and i'll be happy to help you um body so this is the body of your webpage it comes below your headers and it comes above your footers there's no example of the footer here but your footers anything that's at the bottom of your web page anything that's in the body is going to be like the middle the meat of your web page and example paragraph this is text now i know we talked about how the headers how the number here matters in paragraphs we don't have that in html all paragraphs regardless of the number here look exactly the same you could have paragraph 155 and it would look exactly the same as paragraph one so that's just something to keep in mind headers the number here matters and yes hyperlink uh what would be the difference between like an h6 versus a paragraph would they be the same size um they're a little different the header six is a little bit more bold um i i mean if you're really interested just play around with it honestly the whole point of web pages is just to play around with it but yeah so definitely play around with it but i mean if you don't like it you can always just take it out but yeah it's a little bit more bold um so linking css and javascript css and javascript can be used html in two different ways internally in the same file that's why we have our html opening and closing tags because we can use html and css in the same file so we want to differentiate between our html and css or externally in different files which is going to be the example we're using today so you'll notice when i go through the replica example that the html file will have a link to both the javascript file don't worry about that today and the css file probably don't worry about that today and you'll see how we're able to link the files externally to the html file so that all of it is referring to the same web page externally is recommended that's what we're using today more organized and different html files can use the same css and javascript files so how do we link the files great question perfect so linking this is exactly what you're going to see in our replied example today um so this is the code right here it's kind of in a little pink box um so it says script script file source equals script.javascript now what's i remember we had a question about what's between the brackets does this are the quotation marks excuse me the quotation marks does that matter for this it does because what is in between these quotation marks to link your files must be the exact same as your file name otherwise it won't link because it will be trying to look for a file that doesn't exist so that's why we need to have the exact same file an easy trick to do that is i always like to use my html file so if i have index.html i'm going to have index.javascript and index.css so that i know all of these files are linked to that specific html file so i don't get confused but since we're only working with one html file today it's okay just be careful with it but i think the default is script.javascript and style.css we have a question what does meta stand for oh i think you can still see meta on this no oh yes mata so meta is we're gonna use it in this example so meta is an inherent um attribute not an attribute but it's like an inherent um line and basically it's bringing in like an attribute of the site so basically it's like it's it's kind of like the overlying css but i would rather call it principles than styling so if we see here meta is telling us that our content has to be the width of the device it can't be larger and it can't be shorter because that just makes for easy viewing experience this meta is telling us that our character set of the site which links into css is utf8 which is a given character set that's probably in our css file so meta is like our overarching rules that our site has to go by yeah so like meta is going to be in basically everything don't worry about it for today um here let's show the replica example because i feel like that will help us more than looking at this so this is your replica file that we're all going to use today you're going to fork it but it's going to be yours um i made a starter site for you all um it's about harry potter but you know it works so this meta is linking our character set um i don't really have any css in here i just put some sample but the cf the meta is only going to be found in the like html file but whatever it's linking could be in like other files so i mean this is like a standard character set utf8 it's like a standard like web browser friendly character set character set if you've noticed not every single web file out there is one font right i have one font here i have a different font in my google slides i have a different font for this run button not every single web thing is the same font a character set is what kind of allows us to dictate not only the characters we're using but like also that font so um oh sorry that's completely wrong that's font family character set is the characters we're using so are we using cyrillic letters are we using the spanish alphabet are we using the greek alphabet are we using english like the anglican alphabet like what are we using that's our character set yes so it's the letters like the specific alphabet we're using i'm so sorry that was really confusing i didn't explain that well um but yes so that's our character set and then our meta is basically just like bringing that in telling the computer this is the character set we're specifically using recognize these characters i see chat so i think this is just an example but i think i mean with device width like if you're talking generally like height doesn't really matter right because if we're scrolling through a web page our dictated height is like our web page is going to be longer than our computer right but we can scroll down right so our height isn't necessarily a factor but our width matters because if our width is 500 feet long and my laptop screen is 15 inches it's not going to work so by making width equals device width we can have this rectangle that is the standard width so our content is able to show up on screen but the height doesn't matter because we can just scroll through and adjust height as we see fit okay yeah does that make sense yeah then why isn't content in a separate meta um honestly it's for simplicity's sake because this meta is talking about the viewing so like name viewport like this is like the viewing meta and then the content of that meta is how we're able to view the given web page we always say ahrefs just because it's easier but totally go for href i'm just trying to find where the given ah attribute href um ahref is like a weird one i'm trying to see i might have a better example of it in my um replit to show you here this is an href so this is inserting a link which is like the challenge for today um having so hrefs are always enclosed in the a tag so this is my href i have an a tag with this but it closes over here so href so a open we leave the tag open because ahrefs are within one opening tag um they're kind of weird like that they're an exception of html but it's how we insert links into other web pages so it's how we are able to have multiple web pages on the same web page so say you're on amazon and you want to click the checkout button the checkout button is an href button because the checkout window is not the same window that you just bought slippers in right so ahref is how we are able to link sites together so href this is my link it's like the example like we linked harry potter because it's a harry potter example site so this is our href link to the site and then below that we have what it would say if somehow the link didn't show because you always want to have an alternate something goes wrong so below that it says summary and that's what would show oh no that's not the alternate sorry summary is what shows as the link so i'm going to refresh this and you're going to see the webpage if it i have to run it perfect so this is my href right here href it says summary but it is my href because if i click on it it's going to open wikipedia because that's my href and it linked the sites together so href is our linking bridge between one site and another so that's our tag to do that well not our tag but it's our operator to do that our tag is the a i was gonna put these in but i think we can go through it body tags what goes in a body tag can someone tell me i'll look in chat too to see if anyone had said it in the chat body text yeah so body is like the meat of our website um we can have paragraphs we can have headers but that's what goes inside the body tags paragraph tags what goes in there a paragraph um and what attributes do you need to use to link css to html href so what i said before href is our bridge from one to another here we're using href to link our css sheet to our html seat we can also use it to link our um one web page to another but they can do a lot of different things but think of them as bridges linking one thing to another and a rel is like the name it's like i it's hard to explain but you don't need to worry about it right now the most thing you're gonna have to worry about is the href because that's inserting a link in there it's like rel is like how it's like referred to basically so we're gonna make a webpage today is everyone excited about it um honestly it's a really fun workshop i'm gonna because if you copy and paste it you're editing the communal one can everyone see my screen again we're gonna go through forking it okay great we're gonna see this little arrow this little arrow right here can everyone see that we're gonna click it and we're gonna hit this button it says fork yes everyone sees that perfect yes can everyone see that awesome once you click that button see it opens a new one see how it changed to part 13 this is now my own reply no one can see it except for me this is the original once you forked it i want you to close the original because that means that you have all the codes you need right here and you're not editing anyone else's by accident forking it means that you're basically taking the one that was given you're making an identical copy and then that identical copy is unique to you so the file that i gave you is access to everyone it's accessed publicly so that means even after this workshop you want to go back to it you're more than welcome to do so by forking it you're creating your own unique copy of that file that you can edit without changing the original file so that the original file maintains its like coding integrity because we don't want to have that file be all messed up and then people are looking at it for reference and then h tags are all wrong and then paragraphs are a little bit weird so we want to make sure that that is maintaining the same can you fork any code um in reply specifically or like just in general in general so a lot of the code builders are so i mean i've used at least for html and css i've used mozilla thimble i've used glitch i've used droplet every single one of those services are going to allow you to fork it um they might not call in it forking it they might call it making a copy um they might call it making a reference but every single one of those services have allowed you to do that now in terms of like i have a question here that's about those gray tags um those are not tags let's talk about them um i'm gonna share my screen again um thumbs up we can see my screen awesome so i think what that comment is referring to is these um these little gray text blurbs um these are not tags these are comments so comments are really really useful when we're coding because it allows us to understand our code just in like plain simple english so this comment is saying import the web pages style sheet because that's what this line of code does i see a chat okay um yeah so that's what this line of code does so these comments how you make a comment is you do carrot exclamation point dash dash i mean the dash dash isn't necessary that's just because we wanted to have that centered but it's carrot exclamation point closed carrot and anything within the carrots is considered your comment it doesn't affect how the code runs and it's only visible to you the person who's coding and it basically just tells you whatever you want it to tell you so i can edit my comment to say fluffy bunnies are amazing but that doesn't really give me a whole lot of information about my code so coders often use comments um to just tell us what is happening with the given segment of code um so you can use them as often or as little as you want you could have no comments in your code and it would run completely the same as if you had 500 comments so comments are just really there for the coder to understand what's going on or it's for if the coder wants to share their code with people we can put comments in to let the other people know what's going on with the code now while i have yes i see another chat what's going on how can i center my heading that's a great question um i'm going to give people a little bit of time centering your heading is something that happens in css so we're not going to really touch on that today because we didn't do any css coding but if you go into style.css which you also have access to because you forked the file body h1 image with font style color background color these are very very basic so play around with them um but if you go i'm gonna give you a hint and if you still can't figure it out come back to me after i've helped um her find the replit file but i'm gonna give you a hint that says you have to put something in here that tells you about the margins on either side of the header so that's all i'm going to say for now i'm going to stop sharing my screen and i want you guys to go into the file and i want you to take everything that's like black text so you'll see like black text it says harry potter talks about all about harry potter i want you to change all of that i want you to make it a web page about something that interests you it could be your favorite food your dog your favorite class at school um it could be about anything and i want you to make a web page that tells me about that thing so so this is the website right here this is the link basically if you want to change that link i want you to copy and paste whatever website link you want into that href i'm going to change it because i think i'm going to do it on camera so dogs dogs are great love dogs um first link that comes up dogs wikipedia so i want to change that harry potter link to the link about dogs because i'm sick of harry potter i want dogs um oh my gosh i like can't do this because okay there we go so i don't want harry potter anymore i'm gonna take that out i'm gonna make sure that i have my two quotation marks still there and i want to center my cursor in the middle of those two quotation marks then i'm going to ctrl v paste my new link in there and then i'm going to go to the summary um that's what the word says in order to clink on the link and i'm gonna make it so it says like link about dogs so that's what changes it um i saw that there was a chat so how do we change images great question i'm going to do that now to show everyone so if you want to know how to change an image pop back into the zoom meeting we're going to do that really quick so um we're going to use our example of dogs again hold up let me refresh the page the replit page so you guys can understand what i just did for emmanuella who asked the question about inserting the link yes do website need to cite the source of images that's a really good question for this no because you know like if you're just using it for fun like no that's fine um oh always make sure if you want to see your web page you have to click run and then do that so emmanuella i don't know if you're still here but basically our link was this and i changed it so this is what it says but this is the link it goes to so that's how you change a link um okay perfect we can that's how you would change a link so i hope that kind of made sense oh shoot wrong thing sorry my bad we're gonna share the screen again perfect okay now next question changing images awesome let's do that now so we're gonna go back to our use of dogs um we're gonna go to images little i'm trying to find one that has like not a whole lot of um not a whole because a lot of these perfect this one so i'm gonna go here i'm gonna find an image i want on google i'm gonna copy so i'm going to right click and i'm going to play copy image address okay we're going to copy image address click then i see chats i'm going to get those in two seconds if we see image source equals same thing as the web page we're going to go everything in between those two quotation marks i want you to delete it delete it and then we're going to paste our new image link which is really long because it's an image source link why is it so long didn't realize it was that long okay we're going to control z but basically you want to paste your image source link um okay let's try this one i'm trying to find one that has like a short one that we can um use but it's like not really working all that well because a lot of these have just like really long image links for no reason anyway sorry about that so we're going to paste our new image link in there it's going to be long it's going to be gross looking but that's usually how image links are then this is our alt text our alt text is what shows up if an image doesn't render so we're going to change that to like a picture of a dog because that's what this image is a picture of a dog then you're going to see right now in my webpage it was a picture of the harry potter cast because that's what my original image link was if i refresh it or i have to run it it's a picture of a dog now because we changed our image link to the link that was like the image source link or not the image source link the image link itself so yeah so this is our google submission form if you want to submit your website that's really fine you do not have to do it now um oh my gosh i'm so sorry thank you everyone for pointing that out to me so that's our submission form you do not have to do it right now um totally take some time you know play around with your stuff have fun with it um but yeah take some time but that is our submission form if you guys want to submit it um and yeah if you want to exit out you have something to go do you want to eat dinner you want to get a snack totally fine um i'll be here for a little bit more time answer you guys questions help out but i'm going to stop recording right now because it is the end of our time so yeah
