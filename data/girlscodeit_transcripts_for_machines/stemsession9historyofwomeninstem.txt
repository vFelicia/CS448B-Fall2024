hi everyone welcome to our ninth stem session and today we'll be discussing the history of women in stem first we'll go into some historical discrimination that's happened in the past then we'll talk about some inspirational stories of influential women in the stem field and then we'll go on some more inspirational and motivational um quotes as well as ways that you can really get out there and pursue a stem education so let's begin um we'll start off with the history of discrimination throughout history many women were never able to receive an education this was a very this spanned a very long time were met there were all men schools women were seen as people who had to stay in the house cook clean and men were the only ones getting an education leading to the inability for them to pursue a stem career like how are you supposed to pursue stem if you don't have an education in some places it was illegal for women to have jobs or to pursue stem careers and the male workers would receive credit for their research which was very frustrating because who wants to um work on something for so long only not to get the credit for that and there were prejudices towards women of color and um always with racial minorities and it's been harder for women of who belong to those groups to receive education in recognition for their work but it's really important that we recognize women um in general and that we help women as well as helping ourselves to pursue those stem careers because them is such an amazing and versatile career education option that is so big and that can really help us in the future so now we'll discuss some historical contributions of woman and first we'll start off with mary jackson and you guys have probably heard of her she's nasa's first africanamerican woman to help in america's win at the space race which was the competition between the soviet union in the usa and she really helped put the um she helped build the rocket and she was very important um our next woman who we will talk about is ruby heroes so she was a japaneseamerican biochemist who conducted research for the development of vaccines for polio and hay fever this is a different field of course mary jackson worked more in like space engineering obviously ruby heroes works in biochemistry and well worked and she really helped there too our next woman is kanda kadambini ganguly who was the first south asian female physician and she was trained in western medicine and she graduated in south asia um especially in asian culture it was really hard for women to pursue um stem education or in many cases education in general so it's really a great achievement that she was able to be the first female doctor really who graduated in south asia and finally we have helia bravo hollis who became the first certified biologist of mexico and she even introduced a new career that we know today is botany and i think that not only are these stories inspiring of these women who have done so much in the past but also it's important to see all the different fields in stem you have biochemistry you have rocket science literally you have botany and you have medicine and it's just stem is not just engineering and programming there's so much more to it and that's why it's so important to get people into it because there's a lot of career options and it can help us so much in the future now we're going to talk about some ongoing discrimination as well as some statistics so women are really not represented in certain fields and that causes a lot of women who go into these fields to feel overwhelmed and isolated so of course a lot of women will not want to pursue stem careers if they're the only ones in their classes or their workplaces current stereotypes include that women should be more oriented towards fields that involve caring such as nursing teaching fields that aren't really um that are still important but that are not at the basis of stem the instead of nursing women should instead of doctors women should be nurses and another key thing here is that to bridge the gender gap we also have to allow male representation in these fields because a lot of men are not these jobs aren't seen fit for men either so that's also a key point that we should try to implement also there's a lot of lack of confidence when women are going to stem fields because even though as of this presentation mentions here young girls have the same or higher scores as men or as boys on their tests they tend not to go into these fields because there are so many men in their workplace or classes and they just don't want to feel alone there's also a huge gender gap in stem and that is what really girls code is trying to eliminate that gender gap that guy should do this girl should do this and guys should do more stem um girls who code actually report that 74 of middle school girls are interested in stem which means that they have all said that they want to go into it but only 0.4 percent go to pursue computer science as a major in college that's a huge difference that's a decimal literally like a fraction less than 0.5 it's um terrifying that those girls who have these dreams when they're let's say like um 11 or 12 that they want to be engineers or programmers that they only that they can't get into those majors because they feel isolated and overwhelmed at the male dominance of those careers and among stem another statistic is that among stem graduates aged 25 to 34 women account for 59 percent of those in science and technology but only 23 um percent of those graduate from engineering and 30 are from mathematics so um women only account in general for 13 of engineers and that's way less than half we should have a 50 and 50 men and women should be equally represented in the stem fields but as you guys can see there is only 13 percent of woman and much more men male representation a lot of obstacles for women in stem is that they are being held to higher standards because of course they are not expected to go into these fields so once they do they're um there's a lot of competition there that um there's less women so they should be able to do more in a lot of cases um they should just be held to the standard of women or equal to male to men so they should have the same abilities and another key obstacle is family or cultural pressure many women especially in asia report being told by a coworker that they should work less after having children and in some countries it's illegal for women to have jobs if their husband hasn't authorized them to so all of this um a woman's so in a lot of these cultures a woman's life depends on her husband or her family and what they want her to do which is unfair because a lot of times tradition can be blocking the progress especially getting more people into the stem careers and fields and finally mistaken identity is this one is very unmotivating because women um working in stem are often mistaken for just custodians or administrative staff such as secretaries um and instead of being seen as scientists and engineers and doctors and those people who really do the research and who help with that and it can be very um damaging when you do so much work and people only see you as let's say a custodian when people look at you and they're like oh you're not a scientist you're a custodian that's very um demoralizing and so now on a more positive note after we've discussed all those ways that um women have obstacles in the stem careers let's talk about ways to bridge the gender gap in stem and we can make a difference and that's the important thing that if we work together if we bridge that gender gap if we have um men and women working together then we can make the most progress and be the best society that we can be an important part is to showcase women in stem as role models a lot of girls will be looking towards role models that are women when they're in a class full of guys or when they're in their workplace full of men um and they'll need that inspiration from someone they should be able to see someone see oh she was in the same spot as i am but look at how far she got and there are so many women who can serve as role models such as the ones that we mentioned in the beginning they have inspiring stories and they should be showcased um instead of suppressed and that's a very that'll motivate other girls to pursue these careers um and a key other point is to encourage girls around you you should encourage your friends your family your colleagues anyone who's interested in stem to really pursue this career because it's an amazing career path and everyone it should be open to everyone um if you're a girl try to get all your friends if you're a guy try to get your girlfriends too to um pursue these stem careers it honestly doesn't matter your gender just try to get everyone around you to interest them because everyone should be allowed a chance and with that encouragement from your friends and family and with that support people girls or guys will be more likely to go into the stem field and we young women will feel more represented and won't be so overwhelmed if they're in a safe and supportive environment another thing is to get handson experience a lot of people find stem to be boring just sitting in front of a computer all day typing and tapping and typing and typing without much achievement and actually it's not like that with stem there are so many different career paths that you can pursue that eventually you'll find something that you like and the stem is really handson a lot of it is on the computer but if you think about it um you can have the science part of it or you're doing something and that's really motivational um and stem can be creative you can have you can find a problem and try to solve it in your own way and that creativity is very based on your own unique personality and what you can do and that's why a lot like 72 percent of girls it says here indicate that their willingness to work jobs that make a difference and 90 percent of girls identify as creative however they see stem as boring and pointless and this is important to educate um everyone about first the importance of stem and second that they can really be creative with it and that it's not just a job where you sit at your computer all day just typing out words on the screen and you everyone should try to join stem extracurriculars these extra classes extra ways to delve into stem are an excellent way of bridging the stem gap early on because they will allow everyone to see the beauty of stem and they will allow girls to have more experiences with stem more positive experiences with stem and can also it can also teach about real life and actual jobs a lot of these extra activities are just introducing you to a real life experience that you could have with a stem job and a microsoft study as it says here concluded that middle school girls who took part in extracurricular stem programs we're two to three times more likely to study physics engineering and computer science and that's huge because um when girls take these extra activities they're more motivated they're more interested and this is the point of these activities to make girls and everyone interested in these subjects and to pursue them later on to show them that they can be fun and creative and interesting and important and of course never get discouraged um it can be very discouraging um to see to be in a class with all guys to be the only girl in the class or to be in a maledominated workplace when and of and of course is very discouraging if these people around you do not support what you're doing and um that's why it's really big to have that support from people around you but um you can't let all those obstacles overcome you there's so many inspirational stories of women out there who have done so much the stem career is so versatile there will always be something for you to do you will be you will be accepted and together it is important that we um bond and we can make we can create that supportive environment for girls and really help them pursue those stem fields to make our world more equal and to make our world progress really and change and change in a lot of cases can be good especially in our um coveted world right now we need so many people who are interested in those subjects such as stem to help us through these hard times and to find solutions to all of these problems and another key point is to be comfortable with mistakes mistakes are a part of progress um if you make a mistake that's okay because now you know what you did wrong you can keep going from there it can be very discouraging to make a mistake and to feel like you failed but you can't be successful if you haven't failed in the past because that just means that you're not pushing yourself enough that you're not going for the hardest that you're not going the 100 percent and it can be very discouraging when you do make a mistake but you just work through it and the more you mistake you make when you finally get in the end the more confident you feel the more um the more you feel just so good about yourself and the more achievement you can get and it's true that a lot of times women can be judged for failing harsher than men but it's important that we get over that and that we keep making those mistakes that help us make progress in our research and that really help us bridge that gender gap because um we are the change and we have to do something we can't just give up we have to keep going even when we make a mistake and it can be discouraging it can be hard but we have to get through that and make those mistakes in order to know what we're doing wrong in order to fully push ourselves and make that progress and here's some organizations to check out and of course it might not be easy if you don't live close to them but the smithsonian science education center you guys can look all of these up the open colleges society of stem women of color the national academics of science engineering and medicine and the stem sisterhood all of these places are known to bring guys and girls together to bridge that gender gap to support women in their journey through stem make sure to check these ones out and if you're passionate about stem you should explore those skills that you and those things that you like doing and get more into it and that'll make you feel more confident and less overwhelmed entering into a male dominated field knowing that you can do something very well is a huge morale booster when you're going into a difficult field in here of course are some resources and most of them are for all ages if you want to start somewhere of course we have girls coded courses that you can start with but you can also go for these code.org scratch hopscotch cs unplugged thimble coursera all of these you guys can look up and look into them because they can help girls get access to a coding and stem education and now we're going to talk about some few inspirational quotes of course these are quotes by women who have worked in the stem industry and as we said it's really important to have those inspirational stories and that inspirational advice and here is you have to always be open to learning new skills and miss maina says dare to dream and then go for it with everything you've got i'm not going to read an entire quote you guys can read on your own but it's really important to be open to learn these new skills because that's how you make progress you have to be open to learn new things in order to pursue those different paths to open your mind really to everything that's out there um the next quote is don't be afraid to ask questions questions like mistakes are not bad um questions can show your interest your curiosity your motivation questions allow you to understand better and um they'll allow you to make progress faster if you if you're not sure about something it's not good to just keep it to yourself because then you may make a mistake and that will hinder your progress even though we said mistakes are good asking questions if it can prevent those uncertainties and when you have an uncertainty you're really not motivated to keep going right so you have to ask those questions you have to make sure that you know what you're doing and that you're sure of the path that you want to take and of course you have to believe in yourself you have to believe that what you're doing is good and that what you're doing is right that what you're doing is motivational and inspiring and that even when it gets hard that you are making a difference i know sometimes it can seem unrewarding when you are working on a problem and you haven't been able to get far on it but even that research that you've done on that problem that is still really really big because the research is helpful since then you can communicate with others they can tell you they can add to your research and that communication with adding to your research eventually we will figure it out as a group and communication and believing in yourself is key because when you believe in yourself you can really break through all those stereotypes break through all that discrimination and that is key to being able to pursue any path that you would desire not just them but any path that you want to take in life and of course we already talked about this but don't be afraid of failures and this is another quote that helps with that um because failures teach us that we have to be accepting not only of others but of ourselves and without we have to be aware and that we realize what we need to work on and that's what failures help us with that's what mistakes help us with they really help with the progress the journey and its mistakes are the bene beginning of everyone's career path as she says in this quote because it is essential to learn what we that what could go wrong before making that progress um once again we talked about not getting discouraged because even if you got a negative response you should keep going because you don't need the um you have to believe in yourself you don't have to be discouraged by people giving you um harsh feedback because um you have to work hard and get past that because though you have to remember that those mistakes are fine and that that negative response is just trying to discourage you and that you can be you can change the way they think about you that you can really break through those stereotypes and be the best person you can be because of course the way she says it here you are perfect the way you are you have to believe in yourself that you can solve this problem even if people do not support you have to support yourself and that's really the most important thing to support yourself in your journey because eventually you will get there and it will be amazing um celebrating small successes this is a key part of progress um progress is made by a few small successes and then you get to the big ones even the smallest things can help you motivate you to keep going and that's why it's important to have those small um achievements because they lead up to a big achievement and really help you be give your best and um having those small successes lets you build up to one or many big successes in your life and every achievement should be celebrated and now let's talk girls code it as a part of girls code it you are already making a difference by learning to code in our lessons you are creating a safer environment for young women to prosper you're supporting people and um you it's amazing that you have chosen to enter into this organization to be a part of this organization to support others in their journey and to have others support you that you believe in yourself enough to challenge yourself with these classes and these videos in these challenges and to be able to help others along the way and in girls code that's what we really try to create a positive environment for a woman to work together um alongside a lot of guys to be able to bridge that gender gap and to help young woman prosper and really find that stem can be creative that it can be an amazing field and that is not just for guys last quote by our president obama one of the things that i really strongly believe in is that we need to have more girls interested in math science and engineering we've got half the population that is way underrepresented in those fields and that means that we've got a whole bunch of talent not being encouraged the way they need to and he's right when half of the population are girls there's so much talent hidden in there that we haven't unlocked that we haven't used and that's really terrible because in order to make the most progress in order for our world to be the best that it can be we have to all work together and having half the population represented by the while the other one is suppressed is not a good idea because then we only get half the progress and half the amazing achievements that we could have well thank you for listening everyone i hope you enjoyed this presentation on the history of woman in stem feel free to um let us know in the comments who is a woman that inspires you and to let us know about any suggestions to make our girls code organization more supportive and better and of course make sure to check out our classes and the rest of our stem session videos our web dev class is currently going on and just remember that it is important for you to be in these fields it is important for you to push yourself and to believe in yourself that you can do this and that is the um conclusion to this presentation the summary the most important point is to believe in yourself to that you can do this that you can pursue a field that is largely male dominated and that we can work together in order to create the best world possible thank you for listening everyone
