and run it so basically what this project option is is um it's like a shop so you can as you can see from these options here you can view the items add items remove items or check if an item is in the shop so first of all um nothing is in it yet so we are going to add an item so let's just say like apple continue yes we want to continue um let's now view the items and as you can see we added apples and now there is apple um let's remove items to enter the index so the index is going to be zero so and then view items so we can see there's nothing nothing in our shop now um and so that's pretty much it and then check if an item is in the shop you basically just um write what you're looking for and it'll let you know if it's present or not so that's pretty much it in this project um i think it uses everything i talked about so it has um the items are stored in an arraylist if you guys remember that we talked about that a couple times ago um and since we have options whenever we have options we're going to be using our if statements so um yeah this project uses everything so this is one of the options okay untranslated so for the um for the other option we have a game it's like a make your own adventure game so click on it that's not compile just to show you the results it starts off with this hello traveler and asks you for your character name so i can enter anything like okay and this says welcome andrea here are your stats there's your health and your damage and your inventory and right now our inventory doesn't have anything so yeah and then we can go on an adventure and you press enter and you walk and then you stumble upon this rock so you can either choose to one pick it up i mean ignore it or to pick it up so let's say i want to ignore the rock and it says i tripped over a rock so i lost some help so sad anyways and then we continue walking and then we find this stick and i pick it up so there's plus one stick in my inventory and then i see this old man that asks if i can if he can have that stick and i can either say yes or no and you're doing just one project and you can choose so let's just say yeah i'll give it to him and you give the man a stick and you continue along the journey and then oh you give him a stick and he gives you a sword and this sword does 50 damage so then continue on your adventure and then you see this blue devil oh no what are you gonna do you're gonna look into your inventory because you decided that you're gonna fight with it so one i look into my inventory and i find my stick and my silver sword and so um i decide to fight this monster you fight the monster and you lose health most of the enemies loses health and then you win so that's just my example of an adventure game and you can make it as simple or as complex as you want but like both of these objects project examples we cover if statements making variables doing loops and also making arrays and arraylists so it's just a way to practice what you learn and yeah and both options are great yeah so basically um you'll be choosing one of those projects um and like andrea said for her adventure one you could you don't have to do the adventure that she did you can make your own thing um so basically you're gonna choose one of the two options and then you'll be working on that for the next three meetings including this one so this one and then the next two so just take a moment and just think about which one you want to do and then either type it in the chat or just take your mic off and let us know so if you want the shop one which was the one that i showed you just like type shop or something if you want andrea's and then just type adventure um okay so i guess the first thing when we're doing the adventure game is to think about what story i guess or what adventure you want so like andreas was your traveler you go you have the option to pick up a rock um or stick i don't quite remember what it was um but basically just adventure where you have to make decisions so the first step in um creating your own adventure code is going to be to come up with that basic guideline of what you want to do um main like basic storyline i guess um the important thing is just to be sure to have decisions to be made so maybe it could be you're walking on a trail do you turn left or right or it could be i mean that's a pretty boring example but um so feel free to spruce it up a little bit and get more creative um it's just important to make sure that we have decisions and for every decision that we make um something's gonna happen so if we turn right something's gonna happen if you turn left something different is gonna happen um so if you want to take maybe i don't know what do you guys think like 10 minutes do you think that's good yeah like 10 to 15 minutes to just brainstorm and yeah yeah and it doesn't have to be a super long complicated story just something simple with a couple of decisions i will start with like one or two decisions and then of course if um you feel comfortable we can totally find ways to make it more interesting and add more things to it but just to start just come up with like one or two decisions um and the basic storyline i guess of your game so if you guys have any questions meanwhile uh please feel free to just to ask us we'll be here um if not then we'll give you guys some time to get started to like code anything today we're just going to come up with some ideas and maybe share them and you guys can develop your story more until the next time we meet as well can even change your story it would be great because we only have 10 minutes left for class so it'd be great if you guys can share something it doesn't have to be your entire story just like one decision be great all right then caitlyn do you want to make me share one of yours yeah so like um if you if you feed this squirrel it takes you to a magical portal and if you don't then you just see a normal portal and if you go to the magical portal you meet a unicorn and then i don't know what happens next and if you go to the normal portal then you see the mysterious man who gives you a sword if you give him the stick yeah that's perfect that's great um michelle do you want to share why don't you uh michelle why don't you share one of your decisions okay so she said in my story you're royal and you have to make decisions to help your kingdom um example help a peasant find out they are a princess in disguise what just happened yeah michelle that sounds really really interesting that sounds great um so both of you guys uh those storylines sound really really good um and like andreas said we'll be starting to actually code on the next i think that's tomorrow um so tomorrow will help you guys start to code but it's great that you have your basic ideas um and feel free to continue that after this if you would like to i guess we're ending a little bit early today audrey olivia is there anything else we need to do today oh nope i think we're good all right um then michelle keithley do either of you guys have any questions or anything like that no okay perfect um then hopefully we'll see both of you guys back tomorrow and then like we said earlier we'll start to actually code it um tomorrow so hope to see you then thanks for coming guys thank you bye bye
