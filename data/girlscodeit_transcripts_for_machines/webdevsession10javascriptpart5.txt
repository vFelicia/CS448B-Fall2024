now the session's officially recording and i'm going to share my screen and we're going to get into javascript part 5. get excited get hyped uh oh this is our project ignore that that's our project okay let's do javascript part 5 guys so today we're gonna be talking about manipulating the dom now what is the dom well you already know what the dom is the dom is the document object model and it's a tree like representation of the contents of a web page so let's go to our demo replay link um our lovely instructor christian made this for us um this is some like manipulating the dom examples so it's basically just like the content of our web page see we have this one that's highlighted blue you know this one that is green in color a little bit you can't really tell but this is what the dom is the job is our content of our webpage and manipulating the dom is manipulating the contents of our web page so yeah it's a fun it's a fun lesson um ids is basically not ids why did i read it like that ids giving an element an id attribute allows it to be selected in the javascript code so basically by saying oh this element like giving it an id name like giving it identification it allows it to be used within the javascript code which therefore allows us to manipulate the dom a specific can i a specific id cannot be reused by other elements this is important to note because you don't want to have two things that are like going on at the same time um that's also important to note because if you name like it won't run if you name things the same thing and if you name things the same name it might run but it might just manipulate things in a way that you don't want them to so always make sure you're using different names for different things so they correspond correctly when you're manipulating the dom all right um fetching elements so remember how we have each element each element has an id name so the fetching elements we're going to say this is kind of like the syntax of it if we can let me use my pointer this is like the syntax of it so like dot get element by id and then bracket id name let's talk about through this so document.get so we're going to say okay get the thing so in the document we're going to get it get element by id so we're going to say okay you're going to get an element but you're going to get it through its id you're not going to get it through like a tag like headers you're going to get it through like its specific element name and you're going to put the element name in these brackets yeah hopefully that makes some sense um i want to take note that like these are case sensitive so you notice how we have some weird like all lowercase all lowercase and then capital of the first letter capital the first letter capital the first letter these are case sensitive so like be careful with that when you're doing it um and that's just the one thing to note when we're going through when you're saying document.getelementbyid a string is passed on to dot getelementbyid as an argument and can be saved into a variable so we're just manipulating it into different various forms of data and saving it into a variable allows to be manipulated later on which is useful when we're doing things like counters for example um all elements with a certain class name can be fetched by get elements by class name yeah so like a class like um middle a class like i think we have um a class called the middle in the example today so i'm going to use that example like class so it would be like dot get elements by class name bracket middle so that would be what you're going to see in the code today um here's an example of that is a syntax a variable element so an element called variable or a variable called element equals document.getelementbyid id so the name is id lowercase how's it going so far do we have some questions how are we feeling yes no maybe i'm gonna look at the chat yeah yes or no maybe thumbs up thumbs down i see no thumbs up i see no thumbs up okay one thumbs up chat can you explain that again okay what is i'm gonna explain fetching elements again okay so fetching elements basically just means when we want to work with a specific element we're going to call it so remember how we like called variables we called methods we called functions not methods because you guys don't know about methods yet we're doing that today calling functions remember how we called functions and we said like function you know and then we called it by saying the function name and then brackets so it's basically the same thing whenever we want to manipulate an element we just have to call it with this specific syntax yeah so this is the specific syntax to call an element and when we call it we're just calling it so we can work with it and manipulate it okay so um event listeners um after fetching elements an event that uh an event on that element can trigger javascript code to run yeah so what event listeners kind of are if we're going to think about it in like layman's terms is that an event listener is like it's like a puppy right so the puppy sits there and sits there and it sits there and it sits there and the puppy waits for key words right so if you say come the puppy will come to you if you say sit the puppy sits event listeners are just like that so when you give them specific commands they listen for specific things and when those specific things happen they complete actions accordingly so like when you say sit the event listener would sit if you say come to me the event listener would come to you as like a puppy example we use them in java because we went to say like when this thing happens trigger this line of code so like say if we have a dice game where we pick random numbers and we say like oh like you're like we're rolling digital dice and we pick random numbers our event listener could be like if we roll two sixes trigger code like you won the game you know like that's a good example of event listener so when something happens the event listener picks that thing up and then executes code um events can also range from actions just like keys or clicks so like when you click on a web page that could be an event this is the example for add event listener click so like when we this would be add dot event listener so add event listener click so when we click the web page display date so it would display the date the given date and we can do that because date is like a programmed in function in java so you can always like get date and time and you don't have to do external programming for that yeah yes no maybe i'll go back yes no maybe hopefully yes no baby what does the event listener do the event listener just listens for the event and then tells the subsequent code to run so that's what the event listener is the event listener just like waits for a certain thing to happen and then once that thing happens it just tells the code that this thing happened so that like code can run yeah so it's basically just like an intermediary kind of yeah okay chat yeah okay manipulating events so we have our events so events like are things that happen in our web page things that happen in our code the contents attributes and styles of selected elements can be changed with javascript so like our our like the content of our web page can be changed through javascript and that's the whole point of today's lesson the whole point of today's lesson is manipulating the dom and we can change the contents of the javascript through uh we can change the contents of the web page through javascript and we can call that manipulating events because events can be whatever so that's what we're doing here so in this example document.getelementbyid some random id dot inner html hello there let's go through this document.getelement we already know this we're getting an element by id the id name is something random id so we're looking for something called something random id yes so we're going to go and try and look at all the elements by id and once we say oh we found something random id we're going to take it dot or html so we're going to use our like coded in html and we're going to say hello there let's go through inner dot uh dot inner html so remember um a couple examples ago we had like script in our html page right so we had something that said like um like it was a function that ran i think the most recent example of this is probably last week where we saw like uh javascript code within our html page javascript css and html are all interchangeable they all work together on web page so you could program html within a javascript file when using dot inner html because you're saying oh like right here this is html code so they all work in tandem like that you can use javascript within an html file you can use some html in a css file you can you know mix and match and like that but there's certain syntax you need to use to do that so when you're in a javascript file and you want to change some html you're going to put dot h in our html to signify it's html and then it will change the webpage's html within your javascript file oops sorry so that's what this does get elements by id get some random dot id gets dot inner html then it just says hello there now we're going to go and we're going to look at the next example replaces existing content with the element id attribute as it's assigned so document.getelementbyid some random id we know what this does yes get some random id dot set attribute attribute value so say some random id was like i um a flexbox right so say that our flexbox called some random id had a flexbox is just like a box on your screen that you can change the dimensions of and say we wanted to have the box be 100 pixels by 100 pixels that's how it starts out by doing this we say like set attribute our attribute could be width and the value could be 200 so now all of a sudden our box is 200 by 100. so doing this you can change attributes of html elements within your javascript code manipulating events so changes a specific style property of a selected element um property can be background color margin etc right so we talked about our properties um the styling for that specific property goes into value so remember we had our width and then 200 pixels right so the specific way we want to style it and then the styling element so with 200 pixels um in this way we're going to do document.elementbyid some random id we know what this means dot style css as soon as you see style you should know that that's css dot property so property like what is the property we want to change sticking to our example dot with value 200 pixels yeah how do we feel about that yes no maybe reactions i see nothing in the chat so i'm assuming we're okay okay one thumbs up too okay awesome so methods methods are actions that are performed on objects in javascript so like one specific action that's performed on an object is a method right so like functions can be a series of actions but like one action is a method acting accessing a method so like calling a method remember how we called functions accessing a method or calling a method goes as follows so object name dot method name right so we want to talk about the object we're talking about then the method we want to call so like what method it is and it's very similar as our function syntax remember function so we just have the function name and the brackets well this is just method name and then brackets but we also have the object name there are also several builtin methods so remember how math we have our um like builtin math functions well if you're talking about something like a string like we know it's a string you can use builtin methods like two uppercase which changes all of your words into um which changes all of your words into uppercase so like they're all capital letters so there's builtin methods like that just like there are builtin methods for the math portion as well okay is there any questions this is the end of the lesson so is there anything we want to go back and talk about are we good um excuse me yeah um so maybe um we can go over the important points again the important points what do you mean by that like the important stuff um can you give me like like a question that you had because there's a lot of important things you know so like is there like a specific area you wanted to go over again because there's a lot of important things like we talked about a lot this lesson so i don't want to like go through it all again if we don't need to especially if there's people who get it so there's a specific question you have can you try and narrow it down a little bit and then we can talk privately during the breakout rooms um well if you go back a few slides like two or three i think okay tell me when to stop like right after this wait one right after this this one like forward this one yeah that one okay what's what do we what's the question um i don't really understand it okay so manipulating events is basically just we're talking about like so remember we have our event examples like key clicks or um key clicks or i mean key clicks is a good example so an event is like like events are something that happens within our web page that we can like look for and then when it happens we can do something about it so a good example is like a key click so when we say like oh like the web page has been clicked we can do something like we can like display the date we can say like hello there we can do all these things manipulating events is basically just saying like oh we're going to use javascript to manipulate the event so we're going to say like what happens when the event happens right so like summary and id we have an element here so we have an element it has an id we're using html so that we change it to hello there so we're changing the event right so in this case we're setting attributes so we're changing the code through javascript so we're changing certain events through javascript if that makes sense if you still don't get it we can talk about it later okay so guys let's go into our project for today um i will as always drop the submission link and the link in the chat give me two seconds to do that and yeah we're gonna get through it today i'm gonna go through the replicode as always and then we're gonna get into our challenges for this week in our project yeah this one was a short lesson guys um but you guys are really like getting on your way with coding so that's good okay that's the replit and i'll drop the submission form okay there you go so that's your upload that's your submission form as always we're going to go to the replay and we're going to make sure that we fork it because that's always important to remember yeah so make sure we fork it guys make sure that's what we do we're gonna have to fork it remember and i'll share my screen so we can go through the replica if we have any minecraft fans in the house there are some minecraft references in the replit today so i hope you enjoy those we tried to make the image fun so okay so we're going to look and we're going to notice that our script file first of all is completely empty this is intentional you're going to be using your javascript within your html file to manipulate the dom that's the whole point of today's assignment i want everyone's script file to be completely blank let's go through the code index.html we have our metadata we never concern ourselves with that first of all divider class center id letters what is this element and id we know what that is we have a class called center and we're going to call it id letters right because we're talking about the letters and what this says is we want all of our colors to be centered and we call it class center because we want to manipulate everything in here so we give it a class and we call the id that class so we can manipulate everything in here and we do that within our css file so here we just have hello exclamation point pretty letters fun colors then we're going to end that divider new class class center id shapes so we have shapes and letters both under the class center because we both want them to be centered so we both want them to have that same style attribute so we have shapes we have with 100 and 100 and background color blue height 10 pixels class center 200 100 background color red so we have two different ones 100 by 100 200 by 100 two different shapes yes they're both in the class center they both have different sizes they're both different colors yeah so we have classes with ids that's what this is showing us here another one that says class center input container again class center same as always id input container input type text value two boxes above my head input box with text we know what that is class center once again id the span quote um different id same class style margins border style border radius all these fun things where it says change what this says and then last we have our image so we have our source our alt in case our image doesn't load our style um we have our class and then we have styling so margin width and then a caption so our assignments for today are to change the colors of each letter change the colors of the shapes change what's in the input box change change what this says span change the scenery image source change the caption for the image optional add a new button that makes all of these changes when clicked yeah this sounds like a lot i promise you can do it i'm going to stop the recording now and i'm going to stop sharing and i'm going to answer questions and we're going to go through the replica together okay
