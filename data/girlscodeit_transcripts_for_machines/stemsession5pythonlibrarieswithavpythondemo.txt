hi everyone welcome to our fifth stem session in um the girls coded stem session series this one will be on python libraries and we will cover what exactly is a library how and what they're used for we will i will show some basic shapes how to do them in v python and we'll end in with the bouncy box in a bouncy ball in the box tutorial i'm simone i'm the director of education one of the directors of education for girls code it and i'm really excited to share this information with you please subscribe to our channel make sure you come to our classes and without further ado let us begin what is a library so a library is actually premade code that can be important imported to avoid repetitively typing it out if you think about it if you have a lot needed to type out so if you have a program that is very long you don't want to keep typing out the same code so many times especially if it's a long piece of code that someone could have already made for you so if it's a basic function like maybe making an image you don't want to type all of that out someone would have already made it for you which is what libraries are they offer an easy and less timeconsuming way to accomplish important tasks currently there are one third 137 000 python libraries python is such a commonly used language that there are so many libraries because libraries are so useful so it's no surprise there are so many python libraries and libraries in general can help with machine learning data visualization image manipulation and a lot more crew today we'll be going over 3d imaging how to um put how to how to demonstrate images in python but most commonly python is used for this data visualization and manipulation and if you guys want to look into that i would recommend watching our past two stem session videos that were on an intro to data analysis and on a data analysis demo project and commonly used python libraries include numpy tensorflow and vpython and there are so many more but these are the ones that i have heard a lot so i assume you guys have heard them a lot but numpy is a data visualization one tensorflow is used for deep learning machine learning and v python well they're used to help with that and v python is used as i said for 3d images and animation okay let's get started with our visual python so visual python is a python package for 3d animation and design since python doesn't have a builtin 3d visualizer visual python really helps with that that's why it was created in 2000 by these by these men and they were very helpful since this allows us to make images in our code we're using code if you think about if you're creating something like a game the user will be really really bored if it's just text that they have to input and then it spits out something it'll is much more engaging if you have images and that's what v python will allow you to do but so for installing here i'll go into the v python demos so to install the python you can follow these instructions and this is for v python 7. this document is geared toward that but i've installed v python 9 which is a little bit different which is why some of these commands are a little bit different so just pay attention to that make sure you look into that before typing your commands you might get frustrated and then realize that it's just not the correct version but in terminal for os you type this and then in cmd in windows you can type this in both ways you'll get it but the way i'd recommend is i will demonstrate and these are the demos we'll just be using but if you go to this website and i will link this website in the description you can download python python from here and then download v python and of course you need python first before downloading v python so these two make sure to follow these instructions and here it has them for a variety of different systems and it'll take you to this website just download it make sure they're safe you've downloaded the entire file and then you can start using and this will pop up this little icon will pop up and you can start using the python so without further ado let's get to the demos so i will be going first over some basic shapes and i'll do this mostly here but the first thing you want to do is type this line this will allow you to import all of these functions instead of having to import them separately if you don't do this none of this will work you have to make sure that you import them asterix basically means that you're importing every single function that is used in this library you can import them separately but that takes so long it's much easier to just import the whole thing if you want to import like arrow then import box that just doesn't make sense just import them all it'll be way faster way more efficient and you will spend less time with it so i will begin with our arrow so what this is it's basically libraries are basically just a set of functions and that can include all these different attributes to draw out these shapes and the position attribute and there's so many different attributes i will link a website that will go through many more than i will ever be able to go over in a presentation but for now i'll show you guys the basics the position defines the starting point so where you want your arrow to be drawn from and that is zero zero zero and all of these quantities are in the x y and z planes and it's just a vector that you have to add it and you'll see where it is so we start from zero zero zero you guys can start from somewhere else this is just easiest to view for me but to you can start from zero zero zero and here we wanna comment this one i was working with it and uncomment the arrow but you guys start from zero zero zero and to run this you can press run and click run module or you can just press f5 i found find that to be easier the axis will give it the direction that it wants the arrow to go in so it starts from 0 0 0 then it goes in a certain direction for a certain length which is defined here the default value for length if you don't include this it's no biggie it'll just default it to 1 so your arrow will have a length of 1 and the color will be green well i did i said it would be green you can change it to a different color here i've tried to include all the possible colors that can be used in v python but for now let's make our arrow green we click f5 and we get this we have our arrow it starts from zero zero zero and it goes in the axis direction and there's so many different attributes you can make it you can make the width of it to be different you can make this top part to be different so many different things you can do with this but for now let's focus on this so here it starts from zero zero and i just want to show how you can rotate to rotate you can press the shift key the right mouse key and then just move around and that is how you can rotate your arrow to zoom you can press the alt key alt the left mouse button and just drag your mouse forwards and backwards we x out of that x out of that this is the python shell that i showed a little bit before it runs your program let's comment this and move on to our next shape which is a box and the box is really useful it is going to be used in our bouncy ball in the box tutorial but for a box you want to define a starting position so it starts the center is at 0 0 0 then its axis the way it is going to extend outwards towards is this vector 1 0 1. you can change these of course all of these values i've just set to values that popped into my mind but except these these are zero zero zero i think is the most efficient one unless you want you're making like a better project if you just want to view them set them as zero zero zero so they're in the center of your screen the length we've set to three height three with three of course if you don't set these they will just default to one and the color i've set to blue so let's run this and see how it is and all of the rest of these i've commented which means that you the program won't read them it'll just skip over them so we click f5 and we get our box and here is our beautiful magnificent box that starts at zero zero zero extends outwards with a length height and width of three so it's technically a cube if you want to think about that but this is our box and this is the basic way to make a box and of course there are so many different attributes i will link the website again i keep saying this but i'll link the website for you guys to look at the other attributes you can use moving on we have our cone and i wanted to demonstrate with the cone a different way if you want to work with this cone not just to have it print out you can and you want to do other stuff to it which we'll do later but if you want to just do different stuff with it you can define it as a separate variable and that way you can call it later in your program just like we call variables and define them in python but here we have our cone we've positioned it the vector zero zero zero the axis it'll extend outwards is this the radius of the base is three and its color will be red and here i will show this a little bit later i'll actually delete this for now and something cool you can do with it but let's run it and look at our amazing cone so this is our cone of course we'll want to rotate it a bit that's just the view that it gives us in and this is our amazing cone here has its base with the radius of i believe i said three yes three and you can rotate it around just like i said before and that's how you make a basic cone here i want to show how you can use materials so material is um just you can use you can make it like steel wood whatever there's a bunch of ones that are default already built into the python or you can import your own but for now we're just going to use the wood which is a simple built in one we're going to click f5 and it's going to give us a wooden oh whoops you want to type in materials not material my bad so you type in material equals materials dot wood f5 and you rotate it around and it's a wooden material and that's really awesome because this means you can create like a house in v python you there's endless possibilities so i hope you guys look into that next up is our cylinder our cylinder have made white we're going to make it start i've just been demoing these for you guys i could just link you guys to this document but i wanted to show you guys how these work um our cylinder starts at zero zero zero the center then its axis that it extends up and down from or side to side whatever direction it extends from is 5 0 0 and this will be sideways because of course this is an x coordinate that's being changed and our radius is 1 and our color that we've set or i've set is one is white f5 and this should give us a horizontal cylinder with a radius of one we could rotate it as i showed you guys before and here is our magnificent cylinder and if you guys sent it to a different um point it'll rotate around that point right now it's rotating around zero zero when i rotate it but otherwise if you just offset it would rotate around different point of course here we comment cylinder and we move on to our next one which is the ellipsoid which is basically an ellipse i don't know why they call it ellipsoid but ellipse the center will be at zero zero zero the length will be three height eight two with two and of course i've just made up these values you could of course change them but this one works out really well in the small window we've set it to color yellow and let's see how it turns out f5 and here is our beautiful ellipse it starts at zero zero extends with the height width and length that i said and it is yellow yet another color that can be used in v python okay next we comment that and we have a helix and a helix is really neat i'll actually go to the powerpoint for a sec but um the helix and of course all of these have links attached to them but you guys can just find it at the main link that'll link in the description here it says navigation which i already went over but let's start with the helix the helix is basically a spiral and it looks really really cool it looks like a spring and we want to position the center or it to start from to start spiraling from zero zero zero then we're this is the axis or the vector negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 is the vector across which it will spiral around the radius of 2 how large the coils will be and the color will be orange so let's go f5 and here we have our amazing spiral it starts from zero zero spirals with a radius of two and it's along the axis that i defined and to find the axis you can just do a basic vector addition it's basically a coordinate in the x y and z planes pretty selfexplanatory i hope but that is i think that is the one of the coolest ones of the shapes i really like the helix and now i'm going to actually move in to label and text and this is you can make text and in v python which is really cool if you want a label or just have text in it but the difference is that label will surround your text with a box text will just type it out but label will type it out with a box around it and let's see the difference i will demonstrate it here let's uncomment label so we uncomment labeled and you can change your text font whatever f5 we're going to make it a magenta color by the way v python does not you can't type in purple here you have to type in magenta as i have learned from experience because purple is my favorite color and they didn't have you have type and magenta it's so sad but f5 and here we get the label of girls code it is amazing in our magenta letters and with the box around it and i just wanted to demonstrate and here it's centered at 0 0 0. i wanted to demonstrate how you can change it to a different font this is right now this font you can import fonts or just use the default builtin ones from the python i'm going to use the builtin ones because i don't have time to import but we can change it to this separate font and if we click f5 it'll give us a different font see it's a much smaller different font okay and that as you guys saw and you guys can change the text here girls code is amazing which is why i put that in the text um i hope you guys join our classes subscribe to our channel watch our videos so on so forth but it starts at zero zero zero then if we comment this and we go to text i would just want to show the difference but text you um text will here we i'll just show you guys text is green and here i've aligned it left but it doesn't have the box around it which is what is different and i hope you guys see that it's pretty evident no box no label if we want to align it a different way here we can just type in center or right if we type in center it should put it in the center without us having to define it as a vector for its starting position and of course it puts in the center big words subscribe to our channel make sure to follow what the python is telling you guys subscribe to our channel alrighty moving on from text and labels we have we have our pyramid and this is just another shape i wanted to show this color is just a very light blue i have no idea how to pronounce it please don't laugh at me but this color is a light blue we have it at a starting position of zero zero zero as we've had all the rest f5 and here's our pyramid of course we have to zoom out a bit because you can't really see it so if you click alt and then you um drag the mouse down then to rotate shift right click and rotate and here's our beautiful pyramid it's a light blue color alrighty next shape we have points and points are really useful if you want to just like show a graph in python or in v python maybe or just have like a scatter plot different points or just have points everywhere i don't know if you want to make like a connect the dots type thing and be python sounds fun you guys should try that um but points we define their um where the point want we want it to be located its size and we define its color and if we click f5 it will give us a point right in the center at 0 0 and its color will be red and if you just want to make multiple of these at different origins just define it at like 1 0 0 which will be like here and then you just can keep going like that to create a connect the dots game our next one that i want to talk about was the sphere and the sphere i wanted to note how we have a position radius color size so why have radius and size why did i put that there the truth is you don't have to do this um you can either use one i just put them here so it's easier for us to for me to show you guys but if you put both of them the program will still work python will just v python will just default to the first value and it will not pay attention to this value so if we run this it should give us a sphere with a radius of 5. and if you guys want it's a good opportunity since i don't have enough time but to try just this one and you'll see that it's a different sphere make sure to delete this one of course but um right now it will default to radius equals five so if and of course we have our starting position here f5 and it should run and give us a beautiful magnificent egglike sphere with a radius of five if we want to zoom in or out out but we just drag our mouse down while pressing the alt key and here's our magnificent sphere that we can use let's say for a bouncy ball in the box commenting that we move on to the last thing i wanted to talk about which is i'm going to go back to the powerpoint for a second so here as you guys can see i actually didn't go over the curve from the last slide so make sure to look at that it's um really useful if you want to make a curve i just didn't have enough time to cover it but if you want to um i didn't go over lighten lighting either so make sure you look at that too this is pretty neat um in the python it's a nice feature but if we go on the extra features include such as textures materials which i showed you is very similar to textures which is why i didn't show textures i thought materials would be cooler textures is also really cool so you guys should look into that clone will just clone your object it'll make the same one but a different object if you want if you want to manipulate or change that object but make save the other one this is really useful rate will change the rate at which your animation is um completed and angle is the one i wanted to show angle will actually rotate your object so if you put it you want to have like c rotate angle let's make it like let's make it like 170 degrees and we want to rotate this object make sure to uncomment this if you're going to uncomment c because we've defined this object here we don't want to just call in a random object that we haven't created so it'll rotate it 70 degrees so f5 170 sorry and here our pyramid is rotated and it's not really visible because it's so close to 180 but you guys should play around with that too here we have our wooden pyramid our redwood pyramid rotated at 175 and it'll rotate it around the axis that you defined for it so make sure to uncommon this so it has an axis to rotate around let's close this yeah um and we comment this and let's comment that one too and i just wanted to note how here we define this object as c equals this is an example of how an object can be referenced or a variable can be referenced later in the program and that's really useful if you don't want to just print it out and if you're making a more complicated program like the tutorial for a ball in the box you want to define these objects beforehand so that you're not just having them print out and then not knowing what to do with them after that okay so i think let me check real quick awesome okay we're on track but um here as i explained rate is i don't think i explained this one i i'm gonna explain it right now again sorry if i'm explaining it again but this is the rate at which the animation performs so animations such as the bouncy ball on the box those will perform at a certain rate so you just want to define your frequency that you want them to perform at if you want to go slower so you can you know see how it's made trails is really neat it'll show you the way that the object has traveled in an animation or how it's made so it'll have um points appear and it'll show you an arrow like not an arrow but like the direction of how it's traveling so you guys should definitely check these out i didn't get to go through a lot of these but they're really cool um so i'm going to link this in the description which is just more information on it on v python and i just remembered that i forgot to note that you have to make sure to include this line at the top this line is very important because what's the point of using all these functions if you haven't imported them asterisks will allow you to import all of them i'm not sure actually if i went over this sorry if i'm going over it again but it'll allow you to import them you don't want to import them all separately that would make no sense but here in v python 7 this is a tricky thing because in the document if you guys noted it says that you have to import v python but we're importing visual so this is the an example of how different versions conflict so you have to make sure to know which work what works for your own version asterix will import everything make sure to include this line in order to actually be able to use these functions and of course i'd like to especially thank our volunteer kennedy for making us this presentation um thank you to the sources that she used which is this link that i'll link in the description that has a lot more information that covers this this was basically going over some basic shapes i hope you guys found it helpful but this is more in depth if you want to create a project and as i'm going to link this in the description but this is a bouncy ball in the box tutorial created by by our volunteer kennedy um this is one of the many projects you can create in python here i'll show the code for it how it looks we want to open and if you download it from here it has premade code for you so you can click open click bounce 2 which is the bouncy ball in a box this is all the code for it and we click f5 to run it and look at how cool it looks it's so mesmerizing but basically this you have to know about colors about the spheres that we talked about about boxes for the walls the trace here and um you have to know how to offset these so that it looks connected right so i hope you guys look into this more and create some fun projects such as this one look at the tutorial video it includes all the code necessary for this with explanations all right i think this concludes our lesson so of course thank you so much for being here with us our next stem session stem session six will be a live um zoom call with some of our volunteers who are in college and they will talk about their experiences and um you guys will have a chance to ask them questions so make sure to attend that one of course check out our website we have courses that are ongoing check out our channel if you can't make those courses to watch them recorded um right now we're doing python make sure to sign up for the web dev courses that are coming up sometime in late um in late november early december and yes thank you so much for being here make sure to look at some of the previous stem sessions i hope this tutorial helped for v python i hope you guys are interested now to see what v python can do and what how many projects you can create with it make sure to check out this tutorial thank you for supporting us oh and make sure to subscribe to our channel vpython tells you to subscribe so make sure to subscribe so thank you guys and hope to see you all soon bye guys
