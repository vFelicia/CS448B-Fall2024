all right so hey guys my name is jessica i'll be your teacher for today um i'm a senior cs student at university of maryland so and for this lesson or for this class i would just be like going through the um intro to java just giving you a basic overview of like what this language is about why you should learn java um we won't be doing any programming for today so don't worry about um all of that and let me see oh yeah if you have any questions feel free like if you're comfortable uh and and just like ask away um otherwise you can also just ask in chat and i'll try my best to answer all right so again for today's lesson all we'll really be doing is just going over a basic overview of the course like what you'll be learning and what to expect for this course um next just like what is java why do you want to learn java um finally like setting up our our ide basically we're using reflect for this class so just learning how to make it account and how to like start a java program um finally kind of a workshop more like a demo of like what java looks like um and then tips for learning a programming language and finally any helpful links so first off um just wondering how many of you are um wanting to take like the ap exam all right so basically on this course is sweet so this course is basically following the general ap curriculum um however like if you aren't if you aren't planning to take like the ap exams or you are an ap student don't worry this is still pretty accessible to beginners um and like i said it's designed to basically prep ap students for exams so we'll give you like example um frq and multiple choice questions if you aren't planning to take the ap exams um we do have questions that are geared more for beginners um again it follows the ap csa curriculum um don't worry about like having to be good at math you don't need to be good at math to honestly learn most programming languages unless they're like specifically geared towards math so don't worry about like oh i don't i haven't taken like calculus or anything so can i learn java you can still learn java um in the future we'll try to have separate breakout rooms that are like more specifically for ap review and other breakout rooms are that are geared for beginners um and yeah so the general overview of the course is basically um today is just a basic introduction um eventually you'll learn how to like use objects do you like bullying statements um iteration writing classes um we also have one lesson about arrays and working with the raid list um find the inheritance recursion and then a final project just to show um how much you guys have learned um it seems like a lot but don't worry it's these are all um well we'll try our best to like get you guys to learn it um and yeah that's so first off what is java java is a pretty um pretty old programming language originally developed by sun microsystems and now it's being maintained by this company called oracle um it's it ha it's basically a language that's centered around classes so everything in java is basically a class um we'll exp we'll like get to explaining all this later so don't worry if if you're not too sure about it um and because it's a language that is basically all classes it's super good for learning objectoriented programming and java is kind of like the objectoriented language finally java is a compiled language that runs on a java virtual machine which basically means that um in order to run java on your computer you have to download a compiler called a jvm and there are several different versions out there some are free some are paid but um you have to download one of these to be able to run java um because these like these jbms are basically what's going to translate java into something that the computer can read so next um why learn java java is like i said it's the objectoriented programming language so the most important part of why you should learn java is that it's really good for learning the fundamentals of objectoriented programming and this is like a skill and sort of a concept that you you kind of um have to you kind of need to learn other languages too and on a more practical level java is like used to create a lot of things so like there are games that are created in java if i recall correctly minecraft like just recently um refactored their code base to be in java um you can also even like make make mobile apps so a lot of android apps are actually made in java and there's like so much more like you can make entire programs that are really complex just in java itself and finally it's a great beginner language a lot of college courses actually use java as their sort of intro to programming classes so like for for university of maryland um our first language like my first language was actually java and it's compared to like other languages the concepts and like the sort of the skills you need to learn java are pretty low so and so there's first off there's a little barrier of entry and also um there's a lot of really helpful online um resources that you can basically um use if you learn java so for this class um we have we're using this website called roughlit to basically run all our code on so the reason we're using breathlet is that it's very accessible you don't really need like to download anything to use roughly and also um it's pretty easy to like create an account and act get like all the access to a code finally um all all of our demos will be on roughly so it makes it easier for us to share it with you but um if you want to create code locally there are several different um platforms that i can use to develop java um first off you have like for example you have blue jay um intellij idea or vs code um the really big one or the really big ide is eclipse and you also have nothing um again some of these are free some of these not so free but if you're interested in like in sort of being able to save your code to your disk um these are the ides you can look out for so um for today we aren't really gonna have you um do any coding but i'm gonna show you how to make a breathlet account so first off when you go to reflect you're going to see this um you just click on sign up you can log in through like google github or facebook but in case you don't want to you can just make a username enter your email um is a fake email account but it's okay and then um make a password and then just click sign up any questions all right also like again if you guys have any questions about like what i was talking about earlier um feel free to ask all right so let me log into my real wrestling account or my actual roughly account and then i'll also show you guys how to just make a oh what is an id is is an acronym that stands for integrated development environment so it's basically um an app that or a desktop application that allows you to create code so um for example eclipse will allow you to like open a file and basically like create your own java program in like on your own computer instead of like online so you can think about it sort of like um sort of like microsoft word or like microsoft office but for like coding yep so now i'm just going to share my screen again see so now i'm in my own roughly account so if you ever want to create code you can just go to create um sorry click this um plus button you can choose like java i'm going to call this java app press enter and it'll open sort of environment like this where um on the left hand side you have your files on the right this is sort of like where everything will print so this first program is just the hello world program um again like i said java is always like everything in java is a class so even your main function is sort of wrapped in the class called name and in java um you have this really long name function that will explain like what all this means later but right now the main function is public sac boy main string arts and um this is sort of where your program starts so what this program will do is it will just print out hello world and you can test it by clicking run um java will first compile and then after a few seconds it should print out hello world and then over here you have files you can even um like download packages which is pretty cool for roughly and then finally um so for this course we'll be sharing a lot of demo code and just a very important heads up so basically um whenever we share code and you sort of want to put like play with it or change it make sure um you press you click fork before you um do anything with code so um basically make sure you always fork before you like edit any devil code any um questions about that all right so um let me just do this and get back to the presentation so finally i'll just be going over like some tips that i have for just learning a programming language so and um basically in college like you have to it's like in programming in general so what does fourth do fork is basically um it basically will create your own copy of the code so um if i give you like a demo link and you look at it it's sort of like it's kind of like um google docs where we're sort of looking at the same thing so um the issue if you don't work before you change code is like i'll be like doing a demo or something and then if you like delete a line then it'll happen to my code too which can cause a lot of problems or like for example um another teacher might um change the code while i'm typing which will be an issue so basically um what like you should work before you change code so that um anything you change on your side won't um show up on my side so yeah yep um i'm moving on so just like some tips for learning languages um first off practice so um always like when we're we're like going through demos um just play with the code um don't be afraid of breaking anything um so make sure like first off whenever i'm doing demos you know how that code works um second off learn how to start like making your own programs so um fork all the demos and then you can even just like make little changes see what happens um second off google is your friend um don't be afraid of like oh is this cheating or like i can't copy code um just like don't be afraid of just copying other people's code um if you have like if you're running into issues google first um hopefully like especially with java there's really good online support so um if you have an error probably someone else has like has already had that error before and um someone has a solution for it um just like be careful when you're copying code because um don't just copy and paste blindly without understanding what's going on in that code what i find really helpful is that whenever i'm like i see someone's code online and i want to use it i don't just ctrl c ctrl v and call it a i'll actually type it out and just go through their code and try to understand like what's going on and why they like made these decisions um first off like not everyone's code online is perfect there might be some bugs that you can catch and second off it's sort of a learning experience for you so like you can see sort of someone else's logic of why they need code this way um second off this is more of a test taking tip so pay attention to details um i wouldn't call like a lot of questions on exams or trick questions but um there's like a certain logic behind um behind certain pieces of code and if you don't pay attention to small details you might get tripped up um lastly diagrams are very helpful so um when eventually we'll be learning things like about classes subclasses and inheritance um and it's always very helpful to draw class diagrams this is very important especially when we get to like more complex topics like inheritance and polymorphism and stuff like that um that way like that it just allows you to sort of organize everything visually and then finally i'll be posting all these links in chat so don't don't worry about like having these screenshots or anything um these are just a list of resources that we've compiled that um that are things you can refer to to sort of help you learn java first off is geeksforgeeks which is a really good tutorial site and they have really extensive like articles about anything you want to learn in java um second is just a youtube channel with java tutorials um yeah i also have like the college board csa um playlist w3school is kind of like geeks for geeks where it's a bunch of java tutorials um finally like if you want to apply like everything we learned here hacker rank is pretty good for um just doing practice problems also like hacker rank gives you um sort of example interview questions that you might see um when you're trying to like get a job in programming and then also for ap students there's also like whole bunch of examples of frqs and multiple choice questions so any questions about what we just talked about or like anything job related to be honest sweet so oh also i'm gonna first just drop the a discord invite to the girls coded discord that way um if you guys have any questions like outside of class or like uh just about anything um you can just ask us directly on discord so can you tell us some ways people use it applications so um an example of a java application like if you're familiar with minecraft that the entire like people have minecraft is basically coded in java um also a lot of android apps are also in java so um for example i did like uh i did an android app that would basically recognize like facial expressions using computer vision and machine learning and it'll like put an emoji like if you're smiling you'll put a smiling emoji or if you're frowning you'll put an angry emoji um that was all in java um other ways so java has a really strong um uh graphic ui library so like people will make like a lot of people a lot of companies will actually make like internal tools using java so um for example my parents are both computer programmers and they just use java to make a bunch of web apps and and that sort of stuff um and let me think if i'm missing anything else but that's mostly it like it's mostly used for like a lot of internal schools for companies um android development is both in java and kotlin um also yeah and even like games like minecraft do you need to know javascript to know java no you don't need like any you don't need to know any other language you know java and that's actually like what's so great about java is that like you don't need any uh like prior programming experience or anything to learn be able to learn java i would actually say that you need to know a little bit of java to know javascript because javascript is a scripting language that's based on java so i would say like more like the other way around than like and then i'm gonna start dropping the um resources links in chat um feel free to like just ask any questions or or like any of that while i'm dropping these all right oh yeah finally um for this class we also have a feedback board that it's like if you want to fill out it's really important that like me and like the rest of teachers know like how we're doing so that we can sort of adjust our teaching styles so that you can learn the most so please fill out the um feedback form otherwise um let me just show this otherwise we also have um a website girlsquoted.org and we also have um if you have any questions that you want to email to us we we're available at education girlscoded.org we also have the instagram girl's code at pb and then i'll drop the um the discord i can drop the discord invite again um i if i run correctly we'll also be posting slides on discord which is why you should um i should join also um if you want to talk to me directly um i can also drop my butt otherwise that's kind of it for our lesson today thank you so much for um for coming
