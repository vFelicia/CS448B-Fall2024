hi everyone if you don't know my name is willa and today we're gonna start something really really exciting and that's css so does anyone know what css stands for um you can drop it in the chat you can drop it in anything dynamic cascading styles yes cascading well it's cascading style sheets but yes you were very close um and that's what we're gonna be talking about today so today's lesson is css part one so we talked about html that's what we've been doing for the last couple of weeks um so html is basically like the bones of our web page and css is like the skin the muscles like the physical attributes of our webpage so it's actually what makes a web page look really really pretty and gives it all of its different style attributes so what is css we got into this today um we talked about html but with css we can modify colors font types font sizes shadows images elements sizes everything if you want to make something look a different way that's how you're going to do it you're going to do it through css so um how to approach styling which is what we call coding in css um first of all you want to decide your general style of the website so every what kind of color scheme are we going for what kind of font family are we going for what kind of style are we going for what kind of images do we want to have all these things very important to establish this decide the theme so color mood something related to the website remember the key elements of graphic design so good principles of ux and ui user interface user experience what's going to enhance the user experience what's going to keep people wanting to enjoy the website so high contrast text background make it easy to use um yeah don't use annoying colors like don't have yellow text on a white background common sense things and utilize white space for good effect so selectors now we're going to get into the code part of it um css so a lot of times when we talk about code we talk about syntax and the syntax is like the special ways we encode instructions to the computer well good news for everyone css has very little syntax and it's a lot of like whole real english words with just like semicolons and brackets so it's actually really easy to use um selectors are used to select which elements you're gonna style so does anyone take a guess at which part is the selector so we're going to take this example this text box here i'm going to use my pointer i'm going to take this text box here what is the selector the p the csx declarations go here or this line eight text align center does anyone want to take a guess what is the selector i have a chat yes it is the p it is the p so a selector is the so like the selector is selecting what will be affected by the css code so the selector here gives the style attributes for anything within the brackets does that make sense yes no maybe html and we have h1 so but does everyone remember when we had our care bracket h1 and there was all these words in it and then closing well this cascading style sheets or the css file is going to link to the original html file the html web page so when we have this selector the selector p is saying all of the paragraphs so everything with a p tag so the selectors correspond to the tags so everything with a p tag everything that's a paragraph is going to follow these set style attributes so every selector corresponds to the tags in the html so h1 in html is the same thing as h1 here p in html is talking about the paragraph the same paragraph that is being talked about here so the selectors are the same things as the tags and they help us to identify what helps the computer identify what is being changed by the styling code here so can i give it like a a real world example that might help so say i have a bunch of shapes i have squares i have triangles i have circles i have diamonds my selector in that case so that's my html file my html file is squares diamond circles penta pentagons my selector in that case would be triangle yes my attributes here would be triangle color colon red does that help people does that help us understand what that is yes no maybe thumbs up thumbs down thumbs up i'm liking that that's good hopefully that was like a good explanation yeah okay i only saw one thumbs up um maybe nope okay another one i'm looking through is there more questions about that do we need to go through it again do we want to move on okay okay so i don't okay the general selector is more like an indicator right it indicates what the points below change the selector is no the selector is more like an identifier for the computers the computer like the selector it's more just like an identified tag like it says like that's what the id selector this is the id selector the selector and the id select are the same things okay yeah okay we're gonna go to the next slide because i think when we see it in the example it will help us make some more sense of it so tags the tag elements and style in the html can be applied to elements but some cps will not work for certain tags okay so font style of an image selects the body elements remember this this is our selector and it's selecting the body element yes so here we're calling it tags but it's the same thing it's the selector so the selector selects the body element here we're selecting the selector is selecting everything that is a table a th or a td so everything that has a tag table everything that has a th everything that has a td now css is also kind of smart so it can be applied to all elements like you can do things but like it's smart in the sense that it won't let you do things that are physically impossible so this is a great example if you have an image so this tag would say img because it's an image and you said font family helvetica it would say that doesn't make sense to me because you're telling it that i want you to be font helvetica but it's an image so it knows that it can't be fought yes so it works for things that it knows works which is good because if you're playing around with it it will tell you what it knows works and what doesn't okay yes i know it's a little confusing but i think the example will help us so class and id the class and id selectors select elements based on class id and name so you have different classes and we haven't really got into this because this was more something that the advanced group got into but basically there's classes and there's like there's classes and there's different types of stuff so these are just some different ones that we didn't really get into you're not going to be needing them today if you have questions about them or you want to integrate them to your project come ask me later but it's basically the same kind of syntax so all p elements with the label class so all paragraphs that are under the label class and that basically means that all paragraphs that are defined in the class label so all paragraphs that are labels will have the color gray it's weird but it's a way of identifying certain elements in grouping them so if i have a whole bunch of headers and i want them to all be in like a top like header bar i would maybe use like a label tag because then i can group them all and use them all and give them all the same syntax without having to write five different css functions so it's a really good way of like grouping things together but our projects so far are not going to be that complex so you won't need to worry about grouping a bunch of things together because you're not creating web pages with 500 different things on them so it's an interesting concept but what's a class label um it's interesting so which one you like from the before class label this is class selectors a class label no the question was about class labels so okay you know how you have binders so like if you go to school or you have gone to school you know how you have binders and you might have a binder that has your math work your history work and your um your math work and your history work and your science work yes i'm gonna use a real world example for this because i think that might be easier you have a binder with all these different subjects in it what do you do to divide that work you use these like plastic divider thingies i don't know the word for them but i think they're called dividers but you use these plastic dividers and they say okay all the work from this divider to the next divider is my math work right so a class label is basically saying if we think about it in terms of like the computer we can say for this example right here p label i have a binder and they're full of paragraphs right they're full of paragraphs every single thing in here is a paragraph i put a divider i put a couple dividers in instead of having a divider that says all of these paragraphs are math paragraphs right we can just say all of these paragraphs are under this label we don't have to give the label a name we can say all of these paragraphs are under this label and then we can take that label and stick it in the css and we can say okay all of the paragraphs under this label are going to be gray that's their defining characteristic not that they're about math not that they're about science they're defining to characteristic is that they are gray so all of the paragraphs in that divider or also known as label are gray does that explanation help does that explanation make sense i tried to give it a real world example i saw a chat come up basically yeah it gives each paragraph an identity yeah and it gives each paragraph the identity but it gives all of them basically to the css the same identity i'm getting some kind of i'm getting some yes i'm okay so i think that might help i'm gonna try and use some more real world examples because i feel like those are resonating and that's good because it's what about makes sense for you so we also have pseudo classes so this is a little bit interesting you're going to see one in the example today you don't have to touch it if you don't want to but you're going to see one in the example today i put it in pseudo classes are selectors used to define the style of an element when it's in a certain state that's a really long and convoluted sentence right okay so let's take our example that said remember our binder our binder that had all the paragraphs in it and we had our label and our label said all of these paragraphs are gray right we got that so now we have this binder full of paragraphs and some of those paragraphs are gray now we're going to say okay all those paragraphs that are gray when we put our mouse over them they're going to change color so you're taking that class that class of all of the paragraphs that were gray and you're saying when this case happens when my mouse hovers over these paragraphs i want them to change colors so it's a very like if statement right so it's a it's a good example of an if else statement which is something you're going to see a lot in java and javascript these paragraphs are gray if my mouse is on these paragraphs they are red so they change color they become red else my mouse is not on these paragraphs they turn they are the same color they are gray that's a really tricky example but we're going to look at it visually here so dot label we have our label all these paragraphs are gray well change their color all these paragraphs are blue right when we hover over all of the paragraphs in this label with our mouse that's what this means when hover that's what this means they change their color to gray yes so all of these paragraphs yes all of these paragraphs are under this label when my mouse goes over these paragraphs they change their color to gray that is a pseudo class a pseudo class is a class for a special case yes no maybe on the explanation yes no maybe on the explanation i saw there was a chat i'm going to look at the chat i know in matlab you need to use the else if conditional but it's not by css2 no it does not apply to css css you just have like a cascading like so this is the cx this is the dot label colon special case the special case here is the hover so the special case here is the hovering that's the syntax there's no if else that's not in css that's in java and that's in javascript we'll get to that in three weeks don't have to worry about that for now but that's where it at i saw some thumbs up i'm really glad that we're getting this i know it's a tricky concept okay so attribute selectors i know a lot of selectors it's crazy it's a lot of things but think of it as we want the computer to do exactly what we want it to do and having all of these special things to tell the computer what we want to do makes css really precise so attribute selectors select all the elements with a certain attribute so remember all of our remember our binder with the paragraphs yeah okay so i remember a binder with the paragraphs and we had a label and that said all of the paragraphs within this label are blue not all of the paragraphs in the binder are blue but all of the paragraphs within this certain label section are blue the attribute selector what it does it looks at your binder and it doesn't look as one certain it looks at the whole binder it goes through every single page of the binder and say your attribute selector your criteria is is the paragraph blue yes put in one pile no put it in the other so it looks at every single page every single paragraph and it says is this blue if the answer is yes stick it in one pile and if the answer is no it sticks in another pile according to your attribute selector it could be okay take all of these paragraphs that are blue here you wanted all the paragraphs that are blue to do something with them i don't know what you want to do with them but here because this is all of the things that were under the given attribute here do things with them and then under that you do things with them so in this example we're using images so this is one without an attribute selector the one that's on the left is one without an attribute selector so image height that's not an attribute every single image has height whether it's 1 pixel or 10 000 pixels they all have height image height equals 500 pixels that's an attribute because not every single image is going to have a height of 500 pixels so what this attribute selector did is it went to our binder full of images we went to the binder full of images and it said okay let me look at these images one at a time and if the image has a height of 500 i'm going to put it in this pile and if it doesn't i'm going to put it in this pile then i'm going to take all of these images that have attributes of 500 height and i'm going to give them to the person and the person is going to give me a style element for those specific images in this case that the border of these images is two pixels and it's gray doesn't mean that it adds a style attribute 500 pixels no it doesn't so it doesn't add a style attribute to the image it cannot add a style attribute well okay it adds a style attribute but it doesn't so okay we have our binder full of images not all of these images have 500 pixel height right so not every single one of them is going to have 500 pixel height what the attribute selector does is it takes the ones that fit the criteria so say we're looking at um okay say you're at the grocery store and you're in the cereal aisle and you want lucky charms there's there's frosted flakes there's cheerios there's um there's like the wheat bran cereal you don't want any of that you want frosted flakes but you don't want to go to the grocery store so you send the attribute selector to go for you and you tell the attribute selector i want lucky charms so the attribute selector goes and it goes to the grocery aisle and it looks at all of the cereal and it looks at every single box and what it does is it looks at every single box and it says are you lucky charms and if the answer is yes it takes the box and it gives it to you and the answer is no it leaves the box then what the attribute selector does is just gives you all the boxes that's all the attribute selector does the attributes lecture just gives you everything that fits your criteria what the css under that though which is this line 33 line 33 is not an attribute selector line 33 is the css under the attribute selector so the attribute selector just gave you all of your images that have height 500 gave you all the lucky charms now you writing css tell it that all of the images have to point gray so it doesn't give it anything it just it doesn't give it any style elements it just gives you all of the things that fit your criteria yes no maybe i know that there was a comment that said we didn't understand it did that maybe help does that mean the attribute selector is also looking for that border along with 500 pixels no because borders are not inherent to images images do not have a border unless you're giving them a border so this gives it a border but it doesn't have a border until you give it a border so the two pixels happens after the attribute is done so once the attribute goes through the grocery aisle and picks out the lucky charms and okay picks out the image with 500 pixel height once it found all of those then it gives every single one of them two pixel double gray border i know it's tricky stuff and i know it's hard but you will get through it just ask questions when you need to that's what i'm here for does the two pixels happen automatically by the coder the two pixels happens when you tell it two pixels i think you're focusing a little bit too much on the two pixels the two pixels this this border is not part of an attribute selector this line 32 is the attribute selector border two pixels double gray that's not an attribute selector that's just a styling element of css that's what css has css is telling the computer what we want things to look like this could be 10 pixels bright red this could be 5 pixels navy blue so it yeah so yeah so rgb that's a really great question okay yes some of you have looked down here rgb is a color code so um basically if you want to find a color and this is really useful for css you're going to see this in the example but you're going to use you're either going to use a predisposed list of colors or if you want a custom color which i suggest you do because they're really fun you're going to pull up a little color wheel and this happens in reply so be warned you're going to pull up a little color wheel and you're going to look and you're going to drag and you're going to find a color that you like and you're going to say i want that color and then computer's going to say okay and it's gonna give you a little square with that color and it's gonna say rgb three numbers or it's gonna give you a hex code rgb stands for red green blue and it's a code that we use to identify number like a code that we use to identify colors because in the computer's eyes all colors can be made with a certain amount of red green and blue so you know how you have a printer and the printer has black ink blue yellow and magenta i think it is well it's basically like that but with red green and blue so it says okay well this color here has 226 units of red for every 248 units of green for every 255 units of blue and if we mix that in our little mixing pot that's what we get so that's an rgb color code a hex code very similar except i do not understand how hex codes really work it's a it's a six it's a series of six letters and numbers um that identify colors just a different system but yeah rgb color codes are really interesting um you can play around with them today there's a there's a few in the example so i'm gonna move on to the next slide if that's okay with everyone um yeah declaration property and value okay so a declaration is a line of css which makes up the second part of a rule set crazy so that's what we were talking about before you can have multiple declarations in the rule set so each acceleration has a property which is then assigned value so property value for multiple decoration for rule set use semicolons okay that's a lot of coding garbage well not garbage but coding language remember this remember our little selector okay so this is a selector this is an attribute selector this is a thing that's not what we're talking about right now what we're talking about is these three lines text align color and padding and i want everyone to focus on just these three lines these three lines are examples of individual declarations so each line is its own declaration the three of them are not one there are three declarations here each declaration has its own line you cannot have two declarations in the same line what this does is a declaration says okay here here's my property and here's the value i want to give this property so it's basically like saying well property value here's my house and i want to assign a value of five hundred thousand dollars right that's a property that's a value here is my triangle and i want to make it red property value our examples here encoding well we have three here and i'm going to go through what each of them mean text align where do i want my text to be aligned this is a property you can have in css do i want my text line to be in the center do i want it to be to the left do i want to be the right you will have experienced this in google docs or word docs when you go and you say do i want my text line to be in the center to the left or to the right that's the example of text line we're talking about so i say okay property semicolon the value for that property so i'm saying i want my text line to be in the center so that means when my text is on my web page it will be in the center of my web page it's not going to be off to the left it's not going to be off to the right it's going to be in the center um before i get any questions about this yes it's american spelling css will not recognize canadian spelling or british spelling um i'm american so that makes sense for me but if you're in the uk or you're in canada or you're in another place that uses british spelling you're going to have to use america at least for reply at least the version i use um so we're gonna do property colon value for that property semicolon yes no maybe so how we so color what color do i want my font to be what color do i want this header to be right because these apply to this so what color do i want the header to be i want the header to be black padding that basically just says like it's a weird one but it's like how much space do i want around the thing that nothing else can be in so how much space do i want to devote on either side to that header and it's 10 pixels basically what that does is it draws a little line and that line is 10 pixels long and it traces the header around and it draws a little rectangle around the header and it's like 10 pixels the padding it's a weird one you don't really have to worry about it now but it's more for spacing and aesthetics if you want help with that one let me know we can work through it in the example i see a question do the properties have to come into specific text like are there only certain words yeah so there's only certain words that css accept so like text align is the certain word color is the certain word you can't just say like you can't say like text color that's not a css word so these are specific words they are specific words um you can't just write whatever you want to write there's specific words but notice how it's not like weird coding word like it's pretty much english which is generally okay because you can kind of piece together what like what you want to say by just trying some things out property and values so um we're getting to the end here i know it's a lot a property is a characteristic that something possesses so such a color font weight background or color remember the properties we had remember these these are properties so these are examples of more property font weight you know how thick is my font do i want a really really skinny font do i want a thick bond that's basically the difference in microsoft word between regular and bold by going bold you increase font weight by doing regular you decrease font weight um background color what is the color of the background in this case purple well it says blue violet but it's purple um the value is given to the property not following a colon remember it's a colon not an equal sign very specific so a value can be a number that assigns font size or height remember pixels not inches not in feet not in centimeters in pixels and a word that assigns the color of the position of the object okay let's go through this example one by one body all of these are going to apply to the body element in the html for this body element we want our font size to be 14 pixels yes we want the color of this font so we want the color of the body to be white so so far we have a body we have a body anything within that body is going to have a size 14 pixels it's going to be white and its background color is going to be purple um today this is our project before i get into the project i'm gonna stop sharing my screen really quick um so this project is a little bit interesting it's supposed to be an about me web page and i know that in order to submit this you have to like in order to get the certificate you have to submit your projects and i want to be very open so if you don't want to put information on the web completely understand that my challenge for you is to make an ugly web page so that was one of my first challenges with css um that they always tell you it's like make an ugly web page that's what i want you to do i want you to title it my ugly webpage and you can put whatever words you want on it i mean no bad words like no curse words but um you can make the background color whatever you want you can make the text color whatever you want but i want you to play around with it and that's your challenge if you don't want to make a web page that's all about me you're going to make the ugliest web page you can so now i'm going to share my screen and we're going to go through the example for today um that is css oh and i'm also going to put the link in the chat um so that everyone can oops sorry um so that everyone can get moving on it if you know what's going on and you want to just get on with it um fork it first how do we fork it we go here and we go fork click the little arrow here and we fork we do not touch this one we fork yes everyone's gonna fork it before we touch it all right so i'm going to go through this pretty quick because i want to give you guys some time to just like play around with it and for you guys to ask me questions as always i'll be staying around behind um at the end to answer some any lastminute questions we have so this is my example i made an all about me webpage it's not super detailed but you'll get the gist of it so all about me um i want to tell you about me my name is willa and some of the things that i like to do is code bake cookies and hang out with my dog and i have an image here of some cookies what we're really interested here is style.css so this is our style element um this is our style.css sheet and this links to that so without this file this would just look like black text all to this side you know very boring but we have some background colors we have some different font colors we have this what what is this drop it in the chat go go go what is this what is this an example of i'm hovering my mouse over the list and it changes colors what is that an example of we talked about it today yes yes andrea it's a pseudo class it's a pseudo class so um basically um chat basically i'm gonna go through this css stuff a little bit body body is like a really large portion of our um stuff it applies to all of our headers all of our paragraphs so that's why i just try and make my body stuff pretty general my background color so you notice how that's the dominant background color of my web page it's like a nice cream color see this see how this is like a really really ugly thing it's not an rgb coat this is an example of a hex code so hex codes are what i said six digits letters and numbers in this case is just letters that correspond to a thing see this remember how i said oh if you want a custom color like reply will help you out with that and give you a little color selected wheel this is that so you can go around you can select different colors you know make it all pretty um and that's what this is this is a color selected wheel that will give you a hex color um replit does accept rgb codes but if you're doing the custom color selector in reply it's going to give you a hex code both of them work both of them are fine but i wanted to go over that um because there's a lot of a lot of hex codes in here so yeah let's go over that so body font family georgia garamond ariel these are all web safe fonts so if you have a font and you're like i want to use that i would recommend googling if it's web safe first and all you would do google ads is insert fondant here web safe because sometimes some operating systems don't support certain fonts don't ask me why they just don't um but like a lot of pretty standard ones are going to be supported so my font family is georgia garamond ariel that means if georgia isn't supported garamond it will go to garamond automatically and if garamond isn't supported it will go to ariel everything uses ariel like literally everything so you know if you can't think of a font just use ariel because it will be supported by everything margin 2em just gives me my margins on um the stuff and my background color is this hex code color that gives me all of my style attributes here yes h1 my first header if we go into the index.html we have where's my header i know i have it here here's my header h1 all about me right here same thing all about me so if we go into the style we see that h1 text align center what does that mean my text is in the center of my web page it's not off to the left it's not off to the right bot style georgia that means the font of this is georgia the font is georgia the color is this custom color hex code thing right here it's an ugly thing but you know in the background color of the header see this notice how it's green notice how it's this d2f 3da that's this color and that's because you can select different background colors for different attributes so that's why i have green here i have a yellow here i have an orange here i have blue here because i selected different background colors for different parts of my web page this is my selector this is my property this is my attribute remember how we were looking at that in the slides selector h1 we're selecting the header one the header one is gonna have the property of text align its text align is gonna be in the center does that make more sense now that we're seeing it in like a real web page yes no maybe so yes no maybe so how do we feel about that i'm looking at the chat yes good good good i like to see that i like to see that okay so um oh just wanna make sure that's not a question how can i change the colors excellent question so i'm just gonna use this um header one for example if i want to change the color i'm gonna click right here notice how it comes up like that it's a little bit weird but you have to like hover over it see i just like i'm not clicking it i have it clicked there but i just hover over it it's a little finicky i don't like this but i hover over it and this pops up this nice little color wheel and say i want to change that to like um let's go with red red works it's not the most aesthetically pleasing but red works say i want to change my color to red see how you have this bar here it says my old color was this purple my new color is this red right so that's my new color and it does it automatically see it just changed the color code and if i click run again now it's red so you're going to do that with anything you want to change the color of that's how you change color yes no maybe so does that make sense to people okay so i'm gonna go and talk because these are basically all the same there is one thing i want to get into with the images and there's one thing because this is a new tag that we haven't talked about before so i'm going to go into that image display block basically i display it in a single block margin left auto margin right auto with 50 what do these things mean this is how you center an image i know i'm gonna get 500 questions about that you can't just do you know margin left auto margin right auto as soon as that happens the margins equalize themselves because the computer wants them to be equal so as soon as you put both of them at auto it equalizes them with 50 now we're probably looking at that and we're like that doesn't make sense oh have a good one um be sure to check out the video so um with 50 i know we're talking about this and we're like that doesn't make sense that's not a pixel value you're right it isn't with 50 well that tells us that the image width so this distance from this corner to this corner is going to be exactly 50 percent of the distance from this corner to this corner or no sorry this corner to this corner because we have our padding remember our padding margin sorry margin remember how we had our margin 2em that's this distance from this to there so our width for our image is this entire blue block distance and by saying with 50 we're saying our image width is 50 of the image distance i could change that to 25 and it would look like this right so i'm going to change it back to 50 because it keeps it big but that's what that means and by doing margin left auto margin right auto we say okay the width is 50 gives me a given value and because the computer wants everything to be equal it's going to equalize it on both sides so we're going to have a centered image that's how we center an image ul and ul hover these are the pseudo classes yes does anyone want to tell me what we think ul is it's an interesting one it's not one that you would like guess so i know if we don't have any guesses that's that's okay does anyone want to guess what ul is i mean we're looking at it we have oh this is a background color and we have a red what do we think ul is it's no it's not under iron it's not ultimate label ul is actually list so if you want to make a list that looks like this with like the bullet points pretty standard list you're going to use the tag ul i'm going to go into my index.html show you guys so the tags for list are a little bit complicated you need two tags first one ul ul that tells me everything in here is part of the list now if i want to have different items on the list i can't just do like like code enter bake cookies enter hang out with my dog that's not how that works you need to use the li opening and closing tag so we see this li that seems more logically like list but that's just like a single item in the list so notice how i have ul ul everything in here is a list li item on list so code li first item on list second item bake cookies third item hang out with my dog so li is an item on a list and ul is encompassing the whole list it's an interesting one but it's a fun one to know yeah so the li is basically the equivalent of a bullet point yeah so it's an interesting one it's not one that you would like be familiar with we haven't talked about it yet but that's a fun one so ul is our list now remember we have pseudo classes so we have ul hover so that's our pseudo class so when ul is hovered on by our mouse remember here it changes its color to red so normally ul is this color this very dark black color but when we hover over it it's red and that's an example of how we would use our pseudo class so when something is hovered on it changes color yes no so if you want to get going that's totally fine i'm going to stay for an extra couple minutes answer questions go through them things with people if you want to and i'm going to stop the recording now so thank you everyone for coming if you are heading out
