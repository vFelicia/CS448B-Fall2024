development today we'll be covering what web dev is what is web dev well it's a process of creating websites like a single web page or creating web apps or games how do websites work when you access the internet you probably use something called a browser like google chrome or safari these browsers are what we call clients client center request website files from a server so that they can display the site what's the difference between client side and server side well client side oops well client side is the side of the website that you see when you visit sites like google yahoo or youtube any changes that you make to the client side webpage will make changes to what's what gets displayed on other devices server side is the side of the website that the server sees this is where your website files will be located what is html html stands for hypertext markup language and it's used to create and arrange things like text images and videos it's like the foundation of your website and it's what gets displayed to users that's what you're editing and i'll show you how that works um what is css it stands for cascading style sheets um it's to kind of edit the elements that you added on the html file to make it look prettier right like this slide the example is very bare there's no font there's no styling but with css which is cascading style sheets for short it makes it look really pretty and you could also work on like margins website layout all that stuff with css and here's an example of how that works so it's it looks a lot better than just black and white right and so now we have javascript um it's added it's used to add functionality and to change the behavior of websites and so it could be as simple as like a click of a button on the website right your to make that button work you have to use javascript right or to make it modify something that's on the web page or give you data you need a you need javascript right and um to get into apis which we'll get into later which is fetching data from another server um you need javascript for that you need ajax or fetch but those are both javascript things um some examples like you could get the time that's stored on your computer using this this is a function and then you could run the function and make it display the time upload account you can just create new and then make sure this is html and css javascript and we can name this let's just name this demo um i'm going to create the replit are you um okay so these are tags uh we have things like head meta link man let's go to these demos okay so you could put this on the bottom um i like to always put it on the top but i'll show you how you can do that later and so these this file all the elements get added from top to bottom right and the head tag anything that's within the head tag it's not going to be displayed on your website except the title um which is going to be this one and that's going to be displayed on the tab right and the body is what actually gets displayed on your website and so we have some important tags and i'll show you how they get displayed on the website see we have hello so if i man if i decided to put this in head it wouldn't pop up because nothing on head gets just okay never mind okay but you don't want to put anything in head head is basically what for all your imports and stuff like that and the body is what gets displayed in your website right and so we have some common tags here here's div e um image i'll stewie is okay so these are some commonly used uh tags um div is used a lot um actually i guess i should show you something first so in html all the elements which is stuff like div is um in a box right all these all these like this layer yeah for every element they're all boxes if that makes any sense and i'll show you what i mean um i'll set this to id right i'll show you what id means later as well but let's just set this okay you don't have to worry about what i'm doing i'm just trying to show you that these are rectangles and um all right so can you see that these are all rectangles it doesn't matter what the dimensions are they would always be rectangled and so you have to keep that in mind and um elements like to be added from top to bottom where they kind of stack up on top of each other um they very rarely want to go from left to right and so if you want to do that you'd have to do that with a css file but i'll show you what a couple of these common image tags do um this is a paragraph tab and so you can just write a bunch of things in here and it'll get displayed all right let me actually get rid of this box all right so we have a bunch of text like that gets displayed um the image tag is pretty cool because you could actually um get images from other websites so let's say i were to want to get an image of a bagel right go to images let's get this photo right here it doesn't look very appetizing but and if we were to get this photo and then put it into here we would see wow that's very big but yeah we see the photo of the bagel and it's very large so if you want to edit the size of that you're going to have to do that on the css file um we got the link not one second one second i'm sorry okay so now we're gonna work on inspecting element now that we know what those basic tags are um actually wait i haven't i haven't showed you all the tags yet let me finish sharing those really quick and then so now that we got the image tag out of the way um actually it should i didn't show you what the source tag did the source tag is really important or the source um just the source yeah you need the source for the image right now this could be a local file that's saved on your hosting service or your desktop um it's basically it could either be the folder that contains all these three files html css and javascript files or it could be a url either they both work right um now we have uh the link the link is really important because it's right here link and script this works here okay it works um these are really important because the link is to import your css file and we could see that in the link right here and then the script allows you to import your javascript file and then these are the headers now the headers are important because your website kind of gets ranked on your headers as well ranking means like how high up your website is is on like the google results right and then so if we have a header of hello and then so there's headers one through six and they basically work like that now header 1 is bigger than header 6 and header 1 is usually reserved for the title of your website and then we have span which is basically like another text box i'll show you that right here okay all right now let's do the uh inspect element i think that'd be good all right so i'm gonna send you guys the link for the inspect element so we have the weather website and we have this website oh they're both the same size okay i'll send it to you guys in the chat i don't know if i can get this thing to work um i don't know why it's not showing up for me oh here we go okay so here's a link to the weather and then here's a link to the disney website and so we're going to work on the weatherworks uh weather website first and uh it's going to be pretty cool so once you guys open that all up we'll get started okay so this website right here um it runs on the same three files that i mentioned before html css and javascript and so whatever whatever is being displayed on the website that you can see right now it's because of html and uh css for styling and so that means that whatever you edit will also be an edit to the html file right which in turn edits what it displays and so now when we inspect element on certain elements of the page we can kind of mess around with what a website displays and you might have done this for i don't know your grades to show off or something but um in case you don't know we'll go over it and we'll kind of go over how it works and so let's say i want to change the weather to 400 degrees right um we see a span here which is what i kind of showed you on the replit right here the span right and we know that it's a text container and so we could change this to be something like 400 and then it gets displayed right because we're editing the html file which edits what we see on the on the website right and then so let's say we want to change this video or this image is this a video oh it's an image okay let's say i want to change this to the bagel image right um let's see let's look for that bagel image again that's how you get the same image right here and there is a new tab copy this is so we see the source that's what i showed you before the source is really important because um it's where your file is going to be sourced from i'm not sure why this isn't working but i'll show you an example of that on another website um so yeah i mean you could edit basically any text or any image on the site you could say connect with them i don't know and then um let's see if we could do something fun with this are you guys all following along by the way i don't know if you guys are but it's a good idea too so now let's move over to the uh disney site and then so let's try and change this image to the big website i'm pretty sure this will work let's move over here okay span here is the image source okay there we go how do you guys like that i oh wait okay wait hold up hold up that was actually really cool i like that let's let's leave it at that okay so now i know we have a bagel so we we changed the image using the image tag right the really use an image tag and then if you want to change this to um this one's actually pretty cool because when you click stream now it takes you another website right let's see if we could change that to do something else oh okay so an a tag is basically saying um move me to this page or something like that right so it's basically telling you to move to another page it's like an action you could say um if we wanted changes to move to google.com we could very much do that um let me see right now oops okay let's change this to google.com right if we click it now okay i think we're gonna need https okay so now when we click this it's going to take us to google and so it just shows you like you could literally edit anything on whatever website but it only shows up for you and the reason why that is because you're on the client side the server is set up so that it doesn't take changes that you make on the website so i mean if that was the case if we were allowed to make changes on whatever website we wanted that was that would be a huge security issue um let's see my chats you guys have any questions so far you did not get the link okay okay um i don't know if we're supposed to go back yet do you guys follow along okay yes yeah that was pretty cool okay sounds good um when i'm gonna spend a couple more minutes on the replay and then we'll head over and watch this last video okay so i'll kind of show you a quick demo of javascript and um css so let's say i have a button here now button's also a tag and i say click me right you'll have a button called click me now if i give us an id and an id is basically a way for an element to be identified right so if i had a thousand button elements if i if i just say hey when i click a button you know do this or that because you can't do that because you don't know what button you're talking about right it could be buttons for different functions and so we would give these ids a unique name right so we'd say um color button right now whatever id you give to any element here it automatically allows you to retrieve it from the javascript file in the css file you can see an example of the css one right here when it says box oh i think we are done for the day but um yeah i hope you guys learned something um i think they're closing the breaker now but in the meantime i guess i could finish this off um so we have uh okay well i guess we have to go now all right thanks guys
