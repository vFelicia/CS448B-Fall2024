what's up beautiful people it's your girl Jillian and I am so excited to welcome you to the code zone I'll be your host for this digital Series code along coding art with meaning in p5js brought to you by black girls code four part series we will be coding art with a powerful message using a really cool platform called p5.js so welcome to video one now in this series we'll be focusing on creating digital art to share important messages with the world but first let me drop some knowledge black artists have always been at the Forefront of using visual art to spread messages about social justice take a look at this piece by Octavia Inc showcasing everything that black Joy is selfexpression creativity Liberation identity Freedom as you can see art is meant to have an impact on us and it can also often have a powerful impact on society maybe I could use my skills to make my own piece of art see what I did there when I created this piece I wanted the viewer to understand that art can be a perfect medium to sharing my message with the world I wanted to show that our art whether you use the power of the pen microphone or paintbrush can truly change the world and I did it all in p5.js I mean it was super fun to make and now I'm going to show you how to do the same let's get into it now first things first let's talk about p5.js p eep.js is a JavaScript tool for Creative coding think of it like an artist's Sketchbook but instead of drawing and painting with physical brushes and paint we are using code to accomplish the same goal we've leveled up from pencils and paper fam we'll start first by creating an account on p5.js that way we can save all of our work and make sure nothing is lost as we go along that would be the worst go to editor.p5js.org click on the sign up link in the top right hand corner of the page take one moment to do that now well not like literally take as long as you need now that you've got your account set up it will bring us to the text editor so a text editor is actually a computer program that allows us to write and edit plain text but in p5.js it's like our sketch pad meaning we'll draw on it with our code on the text editor page you can see the play and stop buttons at the top left of the page these buttons will start stop and update our drawings the best option is to select the auto refresh next to the stop button this will allow us to see the changes we make to our canvas immediately now below these buttons is where the text editor sketch is located and to the right of our text editor is where we will see the preview of the drawing we are creating okay so now that we know how to create an account and use and view the text editor let's dive in and start making some art and like any good artist before we break the rules we first have to learn them the basis of all art usually involves lines shapes and colors so in today's video we will focus on learning how to create those in p5.js but first we'll learn how to add shapes inside the draw function the first thing we will do is change the background color to Pink then let's add a circle to the canvas we'll do this by adding our shapes inside the draw function an ellipse represents a circle or oval you can set and change the size of the ellipse the first number or argument represents the xcoordinate second is the ycoordinate third is the width and fourth is the height of the ellipse and there we have it a pink donut oh I mean a pink circle sorry I was definitely thinking with my stomach okay so now we have a circle in the middle of our canvas it's currently white with a black border but I want to change the color of the circle to my favorite color gold oh yes see now I know you're thinking I'm a little extra but it's not my fault it looks good on me to change the color I will use fill and all I have to do is type in what color I want but wait our Circle went away it looks like we have an error don't stress that we can solve any problem if we just think it through now when I look closely at the code I see that gold is spelled correctly but my circle background isn't gold that's weird so I'm feeling like this is going to be one of those times where we should work smarter and not harder okay you know what this isn't a test so why don't we look at our cheat sheets okay so it says here that we need to put quotations around gold so that Phil can understand what color we want just like when we change the background to Pink if you remember pink had quotations around it awesome and we fixed it told you that you got this so now that we have a gold circle with a black Border in the middle of the canvas why don't we add another circle to the left side of our gold Circle let's copy and fill an ellipse then paste the copy below and I'm going to change the color of the second Circle to White okay so I want to move the second circle to the left of the gold Circle the way to do this is by subtracting from our x coordinate or the horizontal coordinate think about it like this subtraction allows us to move to the left and addition helps us move to the right if I subtract 100 then the second Circle will move to the left to the left by precisely 100 and now we'll try to change this circle to an oval and make it look smaller than the first Circle we can try adjusting the width to 75 and height to 50. I also don't really want a black border around the oval so I'll use no stroke to remove the Border and listen I'm not here to stroke anyone's ego but you are really doing great now we have two shapes one mediumsized gold Circle in the middle of the canvas and a smaller white oval to the left side of the circle but wait something happened when we added no border for the oval no stroke took away the border for the first gold Circle as well how well by default if you draw a shape then it will have a black border so when we added no border to the oval draw applied it to all the shapes and made it so that none of them have borders if we want to add a border back to the gold Circle then we will have to specify how thick we want the border to be border thickness is written as stroke weight the numbers range from 1 to the width of your canvas each number represents one line width on your canvas for example our canvas is 400 by 400 so that means we have 400 lines going from left to right and 400 lines going from top to bottom if we increase the thickness by one or two then we are adding individual lines together so let's make the stroke weight equal four this will be the same as four lines added together stroke tells the shape what color border you want I think I'm going to choose gold cousin the color yellow of course as the Border this time let's add our border to the gold Circle and change the color with stroke why don't we try adding two more ovals one to the right and one beneath the gold Circle we now have four shapes on our canvas three ovals and one Circle circles and ovals of the canvas as you like seriously guys go nuts really there's no such thing as too many of these guys okay maybe I went a little overboard next up it's a pyramid it's a mountain no wait angle now that we've mastered ovals and circles why don't we try adding a triangle to the top of our gold Circle and color it yellow we'll also give it a gold border with a thickness of three I want the first point of my triangle to be in the middle of my circle the second and third points will be below the first point just above the circle and they will be the same width as the circle look at that I guess I wasn't so obtuse after all okay okay that was my first and last triangle joke now pinky swear now you try adding more triangles to the canvas but don't go crazy remember what happened last time scary now that we have mastered triangles and ellipses let's add some rectangles as we all know rectangles have four sides they can be short and wide or slim and tall why don't we add a wide and short green rectangle below my circle on the right side drawing a rectangle is similar to an ellipse because you set the X and Y coordinates first then set the width and height awesome we have a light green rectangle on our canvas but it's not looking the way I want it to look yet I thought the rectangle would be behind the oval but it's legit trying to upstage the oval but thankfully it's simple to fix draw is Red from top to bottom so whatever you draw at the top will be drawn first and whatever is drawn next will go on top of it in real life if you paint on or over something already drawn the new object will cover the old object and it's the same for our digital canvas if we draw a rectangle that is in the background we will have to move it towards the top of our text editor so that all the other shapes are drawn on top of it and draw let's find the area where I am on top of the pink background but not on top of any other shapes here's the spot now let's add a tall purple rectangle with no border to the left side of the canvas yes and you did the thing two different rectangles in two different places on the canvas one in the background and one other in the foreground now go ahead and practice adding other shapes to your canvas alright we're done learning how to code today but there's still one very important lesson left and that is the lesson of saving your work because there's literally nothing absolutely nothing worse than losing all of your hard work trust me I've been there so with that said let's go ahead and save our artwork we'll go to file at the top left side of the page and select save you can also share your artwork by going to file then clicking share real talk you absolutely slayed we learned so much about how artists use their work to spread important messages how to use p5js to draw in color shapes and while I know we didn't create a masterpiece here but listen Rome wasn't built in a day and Rihanna's music slash fashion slash Beauty slash charity Empire wasn't built overnight either okay so as badgal Riri would probably want me to tell you be patient with yourself I promise we'll make something Museum worthy once we finish learning the basics that's all for now thanks for watching and learning with me today until next time stay cute and stay coding foreign
