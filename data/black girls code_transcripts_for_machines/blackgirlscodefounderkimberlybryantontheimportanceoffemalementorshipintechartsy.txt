women were becoming more educated women were becoming more present as technologists and consumers of the technology but we were still experiencing things that my mother's mother made experience and that was something that bothered me greatly I get a lot of joy from just encouraging girls to not be afraid to say I'm good at something especially if it's something that were not normally supposed to be good at where I grew up in the inner city of Memphis Tennessee at a time that you know there weren't many women going into the fields of engineering especially for a young woman of color so I think for me it was a bit of a surprise perhaps to my family that I would choose this particular career field I definitely experienced bias throughout my college career I was just determined that I would make it through there no matter what even though the first few years of college were extremely difficult there weren't too many folks in my room that looked like me I didn't even have any female professors for a whole four years I think one of the things that has always helped me was finding my community finding this bond other sisters in the field that could share a bit of their experiences of me that could give me advice I had to actually go into this very male centric manufacturing environment where I had to lead a team of men that could be my grandfather literally as a 20 year old student coming out of college and I had to figure out how to do that and show that I was knowledgeable and capable black girls code was born out of my recognition as a mom to my daughter who at the time was going into middle school and really interested in computer science and engineering and game development specifically and I discovered that the classrooms in the world that she was entering at that really pivotal point in her development as a kid look just like my college classroom 20 plus years ago so I created microscope to create a community of girls that look like my daughter has similar interest as my daughter and could give her that sense of community and support if we teach a hundred or two hundred thousand those girls will become exponential leaders in their own right the most impactful leaders can connect on a level that goes beyond just the surface element the mission of the company and really get to the human quality of the work I love being a mentor that's something that I get so much joy from because I'd love to encourage be the encourage er because I didn't necessarily have that I really want us to get to a point where it's not an anomaly for a girl to be a computer scientist it's not an anomaly for a woman or a girl to be a robotics engineer I don't want those gender barriers to hinder the next generation from being whoever they are and I think it goes beyond that right I wanted them to understand that they have the right the power to create the life that they want for themselves and it can't be constricted by others opinions on what they can and can't be you
