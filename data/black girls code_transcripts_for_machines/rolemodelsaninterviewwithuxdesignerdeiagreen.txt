are you ready to meet a virtual reality artist I am Dia green does not only create animated worlds as a VR artist but she is also a user experience and immersive designer at the Walt Disney Company she's a multifaceted creative and she's front line in this whole new digital world of ours so welcome Dia thank you of course thank you for coming to the code Zone this girl I'm so excited awesome okay so we're gonna be playing Jenga to get to know you a little better okay so basically each of us will remove one block and place it at the top of the tower without making it collapse if it collapses that round of the game is over and another one begins so as you can see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer a question from that color theme the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career green for inspiration and blue for a challenge okay ready to jump in yes awesome go ahead okay I've never played Jenga before so well this is a great way to start at the code Zone like yes I love that let's try this first green black okay and then when you're ready you can stack it on top okay and then we'll put it on the top like that yep awesome so green for inspiration yes ma'am what's your design process and our storyboards involved for AR design storyboarding I think is a little bit more important because it's a lot more Visual and interactive than ux is on ux design is more foundational and then AR is like more HandsOn with a phone or with a VR headset so storyboarding really helps to like lay out the visuals for that particular interaction if that answers the question that definitely is the question yeah awesome great first question try foreign ER let's see so explain to us what a ux designer is how is your job different than others in the industry my favorite example to use is how do you watch Netflix on your phone versus how do you watch it on your laptop versus your TV versus your like game station like Playstation or Xbox all those uh require different user needs no that's kind of like what a ux center does they think about how a user interacts with these different digital products and interfaces and we try to make it an enjoyable experience for the user I'm gonna go for [Laughter] okay good good choice and we haven't done purple yet no really um it's these middle ones that are easy Once I run out of the little one okay that's okay okay guys we are back for round two yes I unfortunately lost that round it's okay so they are all winners in the code Zone okay okay all right your turn I think you can get a purple one because I think I can get a purple one too it's not meant for me I want to get into these childhood memories girls okay look at that easy peasy nice so describe how you became a ux designer I went to undergrad at Virginia Tech for industrial design which is like physical product design and then I quickly realized that industrial Zone was not what I wanted to do so I was like what can I do that still incorporates that same design process but less HandsOn and more on the digital side so people that graduated from that industrial design program they went on to be ux designers so I just like reached out to them connected and after I realized that okay this sounds really interesting this is what I want to do plus when I started to look at grad school programs I got into grad school in 2019 I was getting my Master's in human computer interaction for ux design I feel like once I took that step just the doors opened up for me it was like the best decision ever for me okay let me try this orange and like I said these middle ones that's all me that's all me perfect okay career we're doing pretty good though no good way better than the first one way better okay how is designing AR different from designing any other piece of digital art I feel like AR it's a mix between 2D and 3D elements versus other I guess digital pieces of art it's usually 2D augmented reality is still very very very very new still very young so I think that sets it apart like how new it is how much of an unknown it still is and how it brings together like different elements into one handheld experience and look at that we literally won with two rounds I didn't mess up I know awesome awesome thank you so much for coming to the code Zone and playing Jenga with me you are such an inspiration thank you so much of course well I hope to have you back oh yeah let's do this next week awesome all right see you guys foreign
