what advice would you give to Young viewers who want to be actors in The Gaming space I um studied a drama school I then went from drama school into shooting sort of TV shows here and there and it was funny because with my team they would put me forward for roles that I never would have thought I would have been seen for and I think that there was a show that I did in the UK where the lead character I think was supposed to be from Germany and she was written with blonde hair and blue eyes and my team were like you would be great in your version of this character would be fantastic go in
