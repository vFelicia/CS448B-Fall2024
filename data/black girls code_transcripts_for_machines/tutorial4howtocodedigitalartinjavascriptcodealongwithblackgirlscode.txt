what's up my brilliant coders it's your girl Jillian and I'm your host for code along welcome back here's where we left off we drew three fists using quads and rectangles and we also created two different colored arcs to give some Dimension to our piece and now we're gonna finish together what we started all right then let's get into it so before we jump back into drawing I just wanted to let you know that if you ever get stuck or forget how to draw a shape we have a super handy cheat sheet that you might find helpful and as always feel free to pause whenever you need time to complete a task sound good alright let's start our session by adding four arms to the fists we've already drawn we'll start from left to right and add them using quads below Palm on each fist label forearm and using the quick and convenient X Y tool we can find all the points to the quad very quickly for all three forearms why don't we take a moment to draw and color all of the forearms now foreign is looking really really great we'll now focus on adding our art tools the microphone phone paintbrush and pencil once again let's move from left to right starting with the microphone above left fist label mic we can use a rectangle as the base of the mic from the sample drawing there is a small gap between the edge of the canvas and the mic so X will be 10 and Y is 120 because it will be centered in the middle of the Fist now I want the mic to expand 190 and have a height of 40 as well as round the corners at six then we'll want to add the gray band around the top of the mic that connects to the grill or windscreen we'll also use a rectangle for this part and now the last step is to add a black round Grill to the top of the mic base to do this we'll use a circle function it just takes in three values the X and Y coordinates and the size of the diameter meaning how big you want the circle to be y'all that microphone looks good enough for me to sing on a minute I'm gonna need a cinnamonome and a woman to pump okay now it's time to add the phone to our middle fist I know it might seem a little ironic for us to include a phone in this art piece on activism because people are usually on their phones for entertainment I mean it doesn't love a cat video but really though the phone is one of the most transformative tools when it comes to social justice and that's because phones are ultimately communication tools and sharing information is one of the most effective ways to stand up for what you believe in above the label middle fist label phone I want the phone to be black with a gray border of six we can accomplish this with a rectangle but you knew that you're basically the Beyonce of coding at this point so we now have a microphone and cell phone and the last two tools we need to create are our paintbrush and pencil above the right fist label pencil let's make this an orange pencil with no border and give it a width of 190 and a height of 15. now let's sharpen the pencil by adding a beige triangle with no border but we can't have it be a random triangle so we'll connect the base of the triangle to the top of the pencil finally the last tool we need to add is our paintbrush I broke the paintbrush down into three parts the handle the Fastener and the bristles the handle and Fastener will follow almost the same steps as when we created the microphone using a rectangle as the base except the height of the handle will be the same as the pencil 15 and the corners will be rounded at six okay now on to the paintbrush which I'm actually the most excited to draw I'm sort of in my cool art girl era if you couldn't tell the pay paintbrush is created using two parts we will use an ellipse to draw an oval which will serve as the body of the brush the width of the oval will be 60 and a height at 20. that's a throwback all the way to video one and we'll make the tip of the brush using an arc The Arc will be the same color as the oval and have no border we'll start the arc at 180 and end at zero yes and you did it we finished drawing all our art tools oh wait we have just one more thing to do adding Stripes to the background we can use a line function to accomplish this task but if I added line by line it would take a long time and I don't know about you but I got places to be if only there were a better way to do that I'll let you in on a little secret we can use something called the for Loop function the for Loop function basically takes in three values and it runs the block of code inside of it until the conditions are false a bit like a hula hoop that just keeps going around and around and around until we stop so this is what the for Loop looks like in p5.js the first value is where you want your for Loop to start the value is stored in a variable they're called variables because they represent information that can change our variable is called I and it is storing the value of zero now let's change the length to 600 representing the length of the canvas and console log the values of I so now that I've changed the length to 600 I wonder what values I'll see so I'm just going to scroll down and it looks like you can see the change in values start at 0 to 5.99 that's a little sus this one's another thinker I wonder why the values stop at 5.99 maybe it's because the second value is the condition you want to check each time we go around the for loop as the variable increases the second condition checks whether I is less than 600. if that is true then I want to run the block of code inside the function if the condition goes from True to false then we stop I is increasing and the condition is true until we reach 600. at 600 the condition is false because 600 is not less than 600 it's equal so the last True Value will be 5.99 remember how in Cinderella the Fairy Godmother tells Cinderella that midnight her carriage will turn into a pumpkin her dress back into her old clothes and her horses back into mice that means that Cinderella will only have until 11 59 to be bougie Cinderella 1159 is like the last True Value in the loop and at midnight the condition becomes false and Cinderella has to go back to her old life sad but it does have a happy ending don't worry oh shoot I said no spoilers in the last video right actually I think I get a pass on this one I mean it is a tail As Old As Time the third value in the for Loop is how much we want our variable to increase by I plus plus means we want to increase by one every time the condition is true we were able to see our variable increase by one in the console now let's add our line pattern to the background I want to start at 0 and expand the width of the canvas but I want to increase the space between the lines to 20 instead of one I'll now add a pink line with thickness of 10 inside the for Loop foreign okay now remember the line function takes in four values the first two values are where you want the line to start and the last two values are where the line will end I want to start in the upper left corner of the canvas I want the y coordinate for the first point and the x coordinate of the second point to increase every turn of the for Loop I can replace those with I creating a sloped design foreign wow we have come such a long way and I'm so proud of you for taking it step by step and using the concepts we learned to make this amazing digital art now I hope you take your new skills and art and make something with the message that you care about and hey maybe you'll even share it with the world until next time stay cute and stay coding foreign
