now I know my Nickelodeon fans will love this guess Ariel Paxton is a junior motion designer for Noggin I mean can you believe it a real animator for real cartoons she literally brings art to life on an everyday basis and I can't wait for you to hear about her career as an illustrator are you excited to play yes I am awesome so we're gonna be playing Jenga to get to know you a little better so basically each of us will remove one block and place it at the top of the tower without making it collapse if it collapses then that round of the game is over and another one begins now as you can see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer a question from that color theme and the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career green for inspiration and glue for a challenge so would you like to do the honors yes okay you can choose this one okay yeah that one looks really easy perfect okay purple childhood memories describe how you became an animator did you go to college or university what did you study and why did you choose that major I went to Savannah College of Art and Design which is scad campus in Atlanta and I chose to like get my degree in animation and the reason I chose that is at a young age I watched a lot of cartoons and since I fell in love with it I really wanted to bring that Joy of watching cartoons to a younger audience as well so that's kind of where I started okay so I will go ahead and pick one okay I think this one Yep looks pretty easy okay so blue challenge okay let's see what is your experience being a black woman working in a tech space so far it's been like a good experience but I feel like the thing or the few Studios that I have worked or had the privilege to work in I feel like there's not as many of me there might be some black people that do work there but it seems like it's very few so it's like I'm not sure if there needs to be more Outreach programs so that way more people know that the jobs are available or if people aren't sure of those jobs are something they actually want to take but that seems to be my experience so far in my field okay um here for this one okay cool career what is the role of an animator or digital development artist well a 2d animator usually takes a character and make it move have action and kind of like interact in the environment that it it's in and for me like I'm a junior motion designer so I take basically preexisting designs and I create stories and storyboard those characters so that way whenever there's like basically a main plot the animators have something to work off of uh Let's do let's do green inspiration uh yes honestly it's it's like 50 50. okay you got it there you go cool cool pretty nice awesome all right so green for inspiration tell us about designing a character where do you start and how do you get inspiration I like to start on who the character is where the characters from what they want kind of like already imagining them as like a real life person which sounds weird in retrospect but it's like you're trying to make this character believable to the audience so you want something that you can kind of pull from real life so if you know someone that you kind of want to like make a character design off of maybe take someone who you know personally or someone who you have you've met in your life and start there and then rough out that process start off with forms like simple shapes and from there like you go ahead and line it out and then you have your final character design oh gosh it's getting harder um I know okay that's a good one to pull in the middle oh it's trying to come out wait wait ah wait here here I'll just oh thank you for you okay okay that's childhood memories love that what are some tools that you would recommend For Young Artists now you could use storyboarding which is a good alternative for storyboard Pro if you don't want to spend that much money they're also like the regular Adobe suite programs if you do have a little bit of money saved up you can get Photoshop illustrator after effects if you're wanting another free program there's open Tunes there are definitely a wide variety of options you could choose but definitely do your research and make sure that you're using your resources so that we are not spending too much money on like the most expensive programs first right better just start small yeah yeah I keep choosing the like loosest one I mean it's working for you though inspiration tell us about your favorite artist or art piece and why they inspire you oh wowie Norman like I think he's like the Pinnacle of like animation for me because he's like basically one of the first black animators at Disney so it's almost like he paved a way for other animators or at least for other black animators to realize oh this is a career that I can actually like try out for I think really changed the game for a lot of people I think it's your turn okay oh it's getting it's getting difficult so I'm gonna try a Little Smoke up there we go honestly weed came really far like we did a really really good job well thank you so much Ariel for stopping by and playing code so Django with me today I hope you had a lot of fun I did it I did it awesome until next time foreign
