what's up brilliant coders it's your girl Jillian and I'm your host for code along in our previous videos we added animations that happen after multiple clicks of the mouse in this video I'm gonna spill the tea on how to add animations to the background like this moving ball for example all right then let's get into it come with me to the code Zone let's start learning how to animate a moving object in our background for today's purposes we'll practice this skill with a circle or ball like that so you probably remember that we can create and name our own functions to use on our canvas functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific action just like angle mode and create canvas since we want to show a ball moving in the background of our picture inside of our draw function above our afro we'll create another function called Draw ball then below our draw function let's add the following inside our draw ball function let's start with the really easy step of creating a yellow ball with the circle function the X and Y coordinates can be 50 and 350 because I want to be able to see the starting point of the ball on the canvas you can also comment out the face and afro so that you have a blank canvas now I want the ball to bounce up and down in the Y directions but I need a variable to store the position of the ball in the Y Direction Let's create a variable called Circle Y and assign its value to 350 then replace 350 in the circle function if we add the total sum operation from the previous videos then the ball should move in the y direction so add circle y equals Circle Y plus one great the ball is moving but it's moving off the canvas to where I can't see it anymore we need to set a boundary so that the ball stays on the page in previous instances that we've set a boundary like with the afro growing we reset the item to the beginning position once it reached a certain size or length but that's not going to work here in order to create a functioning boundary in this scenario we need to send the ball in the opposite direction once the ball hits one edge of a boundary so we'll want to use the edge of our canvas to set the boundaries and if the ball hits the boundary then it will return in the opposite direction so if the ycoordinates value is greater than the height of the canvas or less than zero then that means you reach the edge once you have reached the edge the ball should move in a constant negative y direction so how do we do that let's create another variable to store the speed of ycoordinate and assign a value of one now we have two variables for y Circle Y keeps track of its position and why speed stores how fast the ball will move in the opposite direction replace one in the sum total operation with Y speed let's also put a console log open parentheses Circle Y circle y y speed y speed close parentheses below are sum total operation this will allow us to see the change in the ball's position and the speed look at the console and you can see the balls starting at 350 and increasing to Infinity we can change the direction of Y speed by multiplying its current value times negative one every time Circle Y comes into contact with the edge of the canvas it will switch from positive to negative now look at the console again you can see Circle Y go from increasing to decreasing values and why speed change from positive 1 to negative one great the ball now bounces off the canvas walls now let's repeat the previous steps but for your circle's x coordinate let's add a circle X variable and set it to 50. then a x speed variable and set it to two I set the x speed value to 2 because I want the ball to move faster side to side than up and down replace 50 with circle X in the circle function and set your conditional to bounce off the left and right walls of the canvas the right wall of the canvas is the full width just like the bottom of the canvas is the full height okay fam we have come a long way we combined all that we have learned from the previous videos to create an animated background and listen I've got a little secret to let you in on see that animated ball we just coded well what if I told you that the ball is interchangeable with other shapes and words that's wild now so let's take it a step further and turn our ball into a moving message to our animated art piece I'm going to comment out our ball section and add a variable called message under X speed remember that variables can store different types of values such as numbers and text the message will say I love my hair now I want my message to be in white and size 32 but you can adjust this to your liking then replace the X and Y coordinates in the text function with circle X and circle y now we have a powerful message that bounces all over the canvas hey let's get it yes we did it we did it all right I guess we should probably get back to work now now I promise the rest of the work is just as exciting I want to add an awesome feature to the face so that when I scroll over the canvas with my mouse the face will change to show all skin tones first I will create a variable called skin tones that will store a list of skin tones this variable uses an object called an array that stores different types of values after we create the variable we will go to Google and type in skin tones hex then click on the first link go to the colors palette and select all the skin tones hex code copy and paste the hex codes inside of the skin tones array each color should be surrounded by quotes and separated by commas just like this now we have a list of skin tones we can use for the colors of our face the next step is to add skin tone to the actual face we've drawn so p5.js has a function that allows us to see every time the mouse is moved on the canvas called Mouse moved it's very similar to The X Y tool that tracks the X and the Y coordinates on the canvas so scroll all the way down to the bottom of your canvas below your draw function and add the following type in console log open parentheses I moved the mouse close parentheses move the Mouse anywhere on the drawing then look at your console we can use our object array to move through our list each skin tone in the list is represented by a number starting with zero and increases along the number line to go from one tone to the next I will need to add one to a counter every time I move the mouse so let's make a variable called counter and set its value to zero just like we said our afro size and hair height values to 380 and 160. we can set skin tones to one value using our counter go to the face section replace the current color with skin tones counter the face of the color should match that of the first tone in our list so let's add the following if the counter becomes greater or equal to the length of the list of skin tones then reset the counter to zero great now we can go through the list of tones and start over again once it reaches the end dope right okay it's your turn to add other features using the mouse mood function but before you go don't forget to save your work or share it with a friend by going to file then save or share you are a legit animator after today we created an animation that was activated by just moving the cursor across the screen be sure you come back for our last animated art video where we will create a dynamic animated art piece with pulsating animations well until next time remember to show yourself a little love and as always stay cute and stay coding thank you
