hey hey gaming family I'm your host Cheyenne and I'm so excited to welcome you back to video six in this video it's time to add some more Flair and pop to our game we'll learn how to create banners for each new level and even add sounds and background music we'll also be building out level five the return of the Wild and level six the ocean blue of our Avi first things first let's build the level 5 floor copy the floor from level four and paste it where you want your level to start rename the floor to level 5 Forest then change the color in the property screen to Green next let's build the level 6 floor copy the green floor from level five and paste it next to level five rename the floor to level 6 ocean then change the color of the floor to a deep blue even though the ocean is clean and blue let's still add a kill script if someone touches the water because the ocean is too deep to swim in all I'm going to do is copy and paste the kill script from our previously created lava spinner into our level 6 ocean hey there we go we've begun building both level five and six you're a natural at this look at you killing it now I'll add banners to our checkpoints that congratulate our games players on making it to the next level hey oh my gosh wow I definitely wasn't expecting all that we can also use our Banner to inform them about the next level it's our way of giving them a little sneak peek of what they're about to encounter next and to encourage them to keep going our game is kind of a marathon and we've made some levels extra challenging so they're gonna need all the encouragement they can get to add the banner go to the marketplace and search for text Banner let's place the banner over our level 1 checkpoint rename the object Banner one in your Explorer I'm going to change the banner color in my property screen to green and the transparency to zero foreign next I want to add text saying congrats on passing level one you are now gifted with a super jump power up you can put in your own personal message for your player this is another way to keep the player engaged in the game go to the banner one object in the Explorer and open the part then open the script change the save variable text to congrats on passing level one you're now gifted with a super jump power up or whatever your message is for the first label and you're about to enter level two the scarce Forest go over to the property screen and scroll down to the text drop down menu we can also change the font face to luckiest guy to bold text color 3 to Orange text size to 14. we ustomize the text for our Banner okay I want to add another cool feature to my banner I want the banner to be invisible at first then when the Avatar jumps on the checkpoint the banner will appear above it will be a big surprise for our player that way say look at me I could be nice let's add another script tag to Banner one and rename it to appear set your banner one object in the script to a local variable from there we can set our initial transparency and can Collide properties to one and false so the banner will be invisible and doesn't act as a wall in our previous video we made a disappear and a peer function to set and toggle the block properties this time I want to make an untouched function that detects if the Avatar touches the banner below the function I want to connect the banner to the touched event now that we have our initial properties and functions set up let's add the magic we need to determine if the Avatar has touched the banner or not there is a builtin function that searches for an object called humanoid that's the Avatar and it determines if the Avatar touches a part or an object inside of our untouched function we can use a conditional called an if statement to see if our humanoid Avatar comes in contact with the banner if an avatar comes in contact with the banner then the statement will run the code inside of it if the Avatar doesn't touch the banner the code will not trigger now it's time to add the following code do is change the transparency property to zero press play to test out the new feature the banner should be invisible at first but then visible when the Avatar runs into it didn't work didn't work I already know it worked for you I didn't even have to ask let's make the banner float above the checkpoint because we'll need our players to be able to see the banner can't have a message of positivity laying crumbled on the ground am I right like who's gonna see that search for floating script in the marketplace the floating script comes with premade code from other Roblox creators but let down we have two variables depth and speed to determine how far up or down the object moves and how fast we want the object to move to move the banner we can grab the coordinate frame from an object in the workspace it is used to rotate and position 3D objects a C frame contains Global X Y and Z coordinates replacing either of the X Y and Z will determine the new position of the object like so because we're working smarter and not harder like always you can copy the floating script code and paste it inside the if statement of our untouched function copy the depth and speed variables and paste it outside of the function now it's time to test out our new Banner press play yay it works look at you okay so now that we've added a banner let's add another awesome feature to our Obby sound sound makes the world of our video game that much more real think of watching an action movie without any sound effects weird right in video games there are usually a ton of sound effects and music that matches the vibe of the game so since we are game developers we will make sure our game is just as awesome let's start small by adding sound to an object because baby steps am I right to do that click the marketplace Tab and select audio from the menu search for the sound you want I want to add the sound of stepping through grass you can preview the sound you want to add and also change the length of it by clicking the button next to the search icon you can click insert and the sound will be added to your workspace drag the sound to your desired object I want to add the sound to my level 2 grass go to the property screen below the Explorer and make sure to click looped and playing so that your sound will run when you interact with the object now guess what I'm going to say guess what I'm going to say press play you can add sounds all throughout your game okay so go crazy pop off I mean like do you alrighty we took a baby step but now it's time to take a giant leap okay it's okay don't panic I got you let's add music to the background of our game to do that we'll go to the marketplace again and select the audio from the drop down menu select the music tab from there you can choose from various genres of music click insert and the music file will be added to your workspace make sure the music clip is added to the top level of your workspace and not inserted within an object or part also make sure to click looped and playing on your property screen guess what we're going to do now guess what we're going to do now you already know press play get it get it now let's add a banner to the checkpoints for the remaining levels level 1 the polluted city level 2 the scarce forest level 3 the contaminated ocean level 4 the city of the future level five the return of the wild and level 6 the ocean blue I know we just began our work a few videos ago but we just added banners Sound and Music to our Avi I mean it's given Advanced game design at this point I'm just saying not to toot my own horn but tutu if you can do this now imagine what you'll be able to build with more time and practice alrighty fam we've come to the end of our video but it ain't over yet please come back next time for video 7 where we will finally finish up the last levels of our Obby and learn how to make a Winner's stage it's gonna be lit so you won't want to miss it until next time game on fam thank you
