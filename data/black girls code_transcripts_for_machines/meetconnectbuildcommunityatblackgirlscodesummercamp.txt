I would totally recommend a black girl's code because you get to meet new people and on top of that you may you can say reach out of your comfort zone and learn something new that you possibly have not learned before coding can take you many places and not just working with computers it can it can take you to many different uh career paths drive with art and helping people that with Detective work so it's probably the things that you can do with coding and that's why this is important life skill and that's why you should join this camp foreign
