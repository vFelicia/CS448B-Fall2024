hi I'm kaani and I'm your host for calong if you've ever dreamed of creating your own animated story but didn't know where to start you're in the right place let's go today we're going to create a storyline for our Sprites to follow but first we need to know how to create a story a story should contain a few basic elements characters a problem a solution and a lesson learned or message what should our story be about I think I have an idea your story can be totally different but for now code along with me I want my main character to be a girl named Mia Mia's lost her laptop which has all of her unfinished coding assignments on it oh no Mia is so upset so she ask her friend Sarah to help her find it the good news is Sarah finds the laptop but the bad news is Mia and Sarah get separated now it's up to Mia to find Sarah so she can recover her laptop in time to complete her assignment go to scratch.mit.edu remember to log in now we're ready to create a new project open scratch and click file then new then we need to delete the cat Sprite sorry cat click on the X in the circle above the cat to remove it let's start by adding the different characters to our story you can click on the Sprite icon in the bottom right hand corner of the screen click on the people Tab and choose your characters I'm going to choose Avery and Danny as the two friends then rename them to Mia and Sarah next I need to choose the supporting cast of Friends which don't have to be people so let's choose a reindeer a crab Um Mermaid and Luca I'm going to call the reindeer Grace the crab Christie the mermaid Naomi and change Luca to Dawn excellent now we have our full cast of characters for our story I want all the characters except Mia and Don to be hidden to do this I can click on each character then select the hidden button in the Sprite panel the next thing to do is to pick our backdrops click on the backdrop icon in the bottom right corner let's start off by having the characters talking Outdoors then move them to another backdrop every every time they talk to someone new I'm going to choose the bench with a view Beach maliboo Mountain and underwater to let's start off the story by having Mia and Dawn talking by the bench click on Mia go to the events tab then drag the Wess Sprite click block to the Scoops area next go to to the looks Tab and add the say hello for 2 seconds block below the first Block they'll snap together like puzzle pieces then read the blocks from top to bottom when this Sprite clicked say hello for 2 seconds now click on Mia well I don't want to say hello I want to start our conversation click hello in the white circle and change it to I'm supposed to go on a trip with Sarah but she left already now I'm going to add two more sa blocks and I think H for 2 seconds block below our first set of blocks then we can add to our initial conversation I want it to read as follows when this bright clicked say I'm supposed to go on a trip with Sarah but she left already she told me she left Clues with our friends about her location hm do you know where she is great so now that we know everything Mia has to say we need to wa for Dawn to respond let's use the broadcast blocks from the events tab I want to add the broadcast message and waight block below our last say block the broadcast and weit block will make Sprite a wait until both Sprite B and Sprite C have completed the scripts before continuing with its own script now click the message in the broadcast block and add a new message change the message to talk to Don it's Dawn's turn to continue the conversation I'm going to click on Dawn then drag and drop the when I received message block to the scripts area you can click the drop menu and select the talk to Dawn message this will connect the conversation between the two characters I'm going to add a couple of sa blocks below the first block I want them to say hey Mia you missed her she was talking and moving very fast she said something about it being very cold where she's going and needed to borrow my snow boots sound like she might be visiting Grace after Dom responds we want to hide her character so I'll go back to the looks Tab and add the high block to the end of the conversation awesome so after Don responds to Mia we need to transition the next part of our story I want Mia to say thank you Don before walking over to the edge of the stage then I want the next backdrop to automatically show after the next backdrop shows I'm going to reset Mia's position back to its original place and start with our next conversation with grace to do this I'll go to the motion Tab and select the Glide 1 seconds to X and Y block first let's drag Mia to the place we want her to Glide to so we can see the coordinates in the Sprite pane below the stage add the X and Y coordinates then move her back to her original position Add a switch backdrop to next back back drop block below that add a go to X and Y block you'll see a white bubble with a number next to the X and Y add the X and Y coordinates from her current position the last thing I'm going to do is add another broadcast and weight block to the end of our block set then change the new message to talk to Grace wow that was a lot let's test it out you can follow similar steps to add dialogue to the rest of the characters in the story since we hid the rest of the characters in the beginning we need a way to show them once it's their turn to talk I'm going to click on Grace then drag and drop the when I received talk to Grace block to the scripts area I want to wait 2 seconds before I show Grace then say hey Mia long time no see you look warm and broadcast respond to Mia now you know all the steps to create a conversation between all the characters in the story to keep the story moving along but wait there's more I want to show you how we can get our characters to ask and respond to questions watch this I'm going to click on Mia then go to the sensing Tab and add the ask blank and wait block the block displays a question or a prompt that you define to the user the block then waits for the user to type in an answer and press the enter key or click on the check mark let's ask Sarah hey Sarah I've been searching all over for you have you found my laptop then go to the control Tab and add an if else block below my when I receive blank block the if block is where you place a condition if this condition is true then the code inside this section will run if the condition in the if block is false the code inside this lse section will execute instead so Sarah answers yes then Sarah will say awesome what a relief now I can finally finish my coding assignment I've been working so hard to build my own game then broadcast a final response to hide Sarah and Naomi after that I want Mia to go back to a room with her newly found laptop add the variable answer from the sensing Tab and the equals block from the operator tab then put the answer set inside the equals block and set it equal to yes next I'll drag it inside of the if statement like so the last part is to add Mia's response if Sarah says no so what should Mia say I think she would say oh no oh no what am I going to do now I'm totally going to fill my coding assignment next time I should really take better care of my things I'm going to broadcast a final response to Sarah and Naomi then switch the backdrop to her house let's review to create a story script in scratch start by using the event blocks to determine when your Story begins or when the characters get activated use the motion blocks to animate your Sprites and make them move use the control blocks to help you sequence events add pauses or introduce repetition you can also set conditional statements in your story such as if the character says yes then do this use the looks blocks to change the appearance of Sprites allow them to speak through dialogue bubbles change costumes or alter the backdrop to enrich the visual Narrative of your story lastly remember you can use sensing blocks to have your characters ask and respond to questions let's see how I combine all those elements together to make my final story if you want a closer look at my code be sure to click the project link below the last step is to save our work let's give our project the title then click save now in the top right hand corner or go to file and select save now if you want to share your wonderful story with other coders or friends then click the share button I can't wait to see how your stories turn out until next time coders
