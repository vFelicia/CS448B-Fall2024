hey everyone uh excited to kick this off uh my name is Felicia Hatcher CEO of Pharrell Williams Black admission opportunity fund I'm joined by uh the lovely ladies Madison and Amaya from um black girls code as well as the rising star of the Transformers movie uh Dominique Fishback and so we're excited to have this conversation with you today welcome thank you I'm excited to be here I'll kick it off with the first question then I'm gonna turn it over to the ladies at black girls code and so uh Dominique if you can talk to us a little bit about your character uh and Transformers rise of the Beast uh well my name is Elena Wallace shout out to Biggie Smalls in Brooklyn she's from Brooklyn East New York just like me I'm from Brooklyn East New York uh she works at a museum and when you meet her you can tell she's really smart and good at her job but her boss keeps taking credit for the work that she does and then um she meets Noah and Autobots and uh she decides to like take matters into her own hands perfect I love it I love it we're joined by two really phenomenal uh rising stars in the stem space uh Madison who's based in New York who's been with black girls code so she was in the second grade and then Amaya is also based in in San Francisco and so I'm gonna turn it over to Madison because she has a question that she wants to ask you yes hi Madison hi Dominique I'm how excited were you to work on on a Transformers movie with an AllStar cast and director um I was extremely excited I think that originally just wanting to always wanted to be an actor and then watching Even Stevens on Disney and saying uh and then watching Shia go from Eva Stevens to Transformers and being like okay so I have to do something like that and I didn't imagine that it would actually be Transformers because watching it in these franchise a lot of times the the lead actress doesn't they don't look like us and they don't come from the areas that we come from a lot of the times so it was harder to imagine that I would get to take up space in that way for this film um but it I mean dreams do come true and I love Anthony Anthony been friends before the movie and I Stephen had come to visit my set when I was doing Judas in the black Messiah and I got to know and talk to him and one of their main reasons why I wanted to be a part of the franchise is because of Steven's vision and his uh his commitment to making sure that Elena had her own storyline her own arc and that she was an individual with her own dreams and that was important to me for returning it over to you Amaya um so what was your favorite moment during production oh uh during production uh my I think my favorite moment is going to Machu Picchu and Peru and it's sacred you know sacred land and they had a shaman blessed production for being on the land and while we were in a ceremony a butterfly flew in a butterflies are really sacred to me I felt like my grandmother comes to visit me YouTube yes that's beautiful me as well yeah yeah it's awesome so you're gonna love this story so my I also felt like my grandmother comes to visit me and butterflies and let me know that I'm safe and then I'm on the right track and a butterfly came and landed in the middle of the ceremony and stayed there for the entire ceremony for like 15 minutes in that same spot after the ceremony I go and lay on the grass with the butterfly and I'm eye to eye with this butterfly and I'm laying there and then I put my finger out and it hops to another piece of grass and then I put my finger over there and after about seven minutes of me sitting like this patience is a virtue I never thought I had it but apparently I do I sat there in the butterfly I saw it the butterfly stepped one leg on my finger and then the other and I lifted it up like this and it's all on videos actually on my Instagram right now if you want to check it out but after the obviously after the interview but that was such a beautiful experience and I thought oh this is a good idea and now it's 333 on the clock and that's also a good sign so hey we in there hang in the money I love that story that was like so amazing and I relate to it so much so I like I'm definitely gonna check that out right after this my next question is who is your favorite Autobot in the movie oh in the movie in this movie or in Transformers World in this movie but then also tell us in the Transformers world because I need to know I need to know bumblebee is my favorite just all all over just from the beat the first one and his uh relationship with the humans and his sincerity and his love he's just he's like he's always going to be a fan favorite I I do believe that in this movie Mirage is just so Dynamic and Pete Davidson voice him so uh like amazing funny charismatic sincere you just love I think you look you just fall in love with Mirage um but B is always going to be B at the end of the day mmhmm all right is it me I'm asking a question yeah yeah you're the same question go ahead all right um when you're like not acting what do you do for fun like uh I like to read a lot but I read books that are like I'm reading a book called um a return to Love by Marianne Williamson she's the one with the quote uh that says our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure is I lighten out our darkness that most frightens us and I remember in 11th grade my I came into my teacher in my English teacher's classroom one day and she had that quote right above the the board and I was like oh I feel that that's special to me I didn't know it came from that book returned to love but the book is really beautiful and it's just helping me on my journey to one be more compassionate to myself and as you as I'm a compassionate myself I'm able to be more compassionate to others and see others as human as learning as growing as I am and uh yes it's been fun otherwise I I learned I love piano I've been playing piano a bit I'm learning guitar right now but I'm definitely better at piano I love spoken word and working on a poetry book uh and I want to do music so that's what I'm doing for fun uh figuring out also my femininity I feel like because I'm from New York there's always been like a like a masculine type of energy that I thought that I had and I felt I didn't have access to that soft feminine type and now I'm I was navigating how to find it how to how to have more access to it so it's been a hard journey but it's been really fun too to explore all the uh aspects of myself wow that is super interesting and I'm from I'm from New York as well and I love to read as well so you should definitely check out the lip bar 10 out of 10 would recommend it's the best place ever the lip bar yes I think I went there before actually really it's gonna be amazing yes I love it there and speaking of music what are your favorite songs featured in the movie and who are your top two favorite artists and why oh it's a hard one I know uh favorite song in the movie uh hypnotized biggie yeah just like when you hear that beat like it's just some just go crazy and then I have to say I really love Toby's song with nas um uh on my soul that's an original for the film and then my or Mama Said Knock You Out that's another one uh that's in the film that I really like and then favorite artists of all time why uh Aaliyah I love Aaliyah um and then yikes Michael Jackson like uh those were the two artists that I had on my my wall the most growing up so I have to pick them even though I love Lauren Hill as well especially her uh MTV Unplugged album I don't know if you heard that one yes that's actually my favorite my favorite song is Adam Liz in theory yeah I love I get out yeah but uh so in terms of music like I want to do something that pays homage to that album um what are like three words how would you describe Transformers in three words black uh funny endearing those are some good words yeah thank you uh Dominic steam is a huge part of the storyline and DNA of Transformers which is exciting because that's the epitome of black girls code uh how different was the role versus other characters you've played oh yes um well I've never played a scientist before artifact researcher um and that was def that was completely different from anything that I've ever done just getting a language in my mouth as well but also just making sure that that I didn't um like a assimilate like I didn't change my my voice and how I how I speak like my characters from Brooklyn she's from East New York and just because she's a scientist I didn't want to put on a voice you know be like oh you know like there's a certain way she still is like yo for real like what's up with that like what took you so long to the to the security I wanted her to be able to you know Nubian and like keep the harshness New York on her voice and show that you can there's many ways to be a woman in science in many ways to be intelligent um even though we've been told for a long time that there's a certain way that you have to speak a certain way certain things you have to wear certain way you have to look you know in order to see be seen deemed professional and I'm so glad that you know Stephen honored her natural hair the curls and like especially as you get in the jungle gets fluffier and fluffier ah and then just the lipstick that she got to wear uh you know because because also she's a she's a fly she's a fly scientist you know what I mean she got swag and lipstick and suspenders and look really cool uh yeah perfect in the last two minutes we have left Madison or Amaya do you have any last questions yes I have another question for you so I'm 15 and I'm curious on what advice you would give to your 15 year old so honestly this might sound cliche but I I would tell her that she actually has all the answers um that she has it she truly does have it inside herself and I would just say when you feel like you don't know Satan in silence and write it out just right anything that comes to your mind write it out and then by the end of writing it out maybe right for 20 minutes and by the end of writing it out you'll find that all of the egoic and uh societal pressures and ideas and ideals that are not really true to you that don't resonate that they will they will lift up for a little while and then you can grab the stuff that's underneath it so that's actually how I feel about it and you'll realize the next day that stuff will come back on and you're like oh man I gotta do it again you know I'm saying you grab the stuff that matters and slowly but surely you'll start to be like oh I don't have as much on top of what I really feel I actually can go right there and pick it out like this I don't have to scrape everything to grab I can just like it's incision and just go poop right so it starts to to get uh to get like that so I would just tell her that she has the answers inside of her when she doesn't know write it out or meditate you know uh just laying quiet and see and then after that before in 2020 I started doing this thing where uh if I had anxiety about anything I would write it down I would write first Journal Journal I always journal and she did the journey since I was 12. so um but I would journal and then I would meditate and then after I would meditate I would Journal again and I find that the things that I said before the meditation they were all about they were based in fear and fair future that doesn't have to happen you know all these things that that didn't make me feel good but when I was meditating that's the closest I got to being still and being near sauce being their God and then oh oh my god wow this is there's so much levity in how I feel now nice I love it thank you so much for that I really appreciate that I'm definitely going to take that I definitely want to start journaling more so this I feel like this was my sign yes it was thank you so much because I'm gonna send you pictures I'm like that sounds weird but I'm gonna be like weird it's not weird in fact like I just uh lines be yourself love and I had a tattoo is in my mom's hair right and be yourself love because I realize that coming into Hollywood or going into any space it can be hard sometimes to to speak how you feel to laugh how you laugh to joke how you joke and I think it's important to be yourself and be loved and I'm actually making my own journals be yourself Journal uh that's going to come out when Transformers comes out and it'll be on my Instagram so no it's and I think it is a sign and it's a sign for me to continue to like uh do other things outside of acting because you don't know who it can help or Inspire so thank you on that note be yourself love is how we're going to end this conversation thank you so much pouring into the thousands of girls that are innovators dreamers Visionaries scientists um within their Journey with black girls code thank you to Madison as well as Amaya and again thank you so much Dominique for the work that you're doing with this with this film and everything that you're doing overall thank you for your time and thank you everyone thank you for having me see you guys later bye
