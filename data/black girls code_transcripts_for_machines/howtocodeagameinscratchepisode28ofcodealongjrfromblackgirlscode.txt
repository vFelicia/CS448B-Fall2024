hi I'm kaani and I'm your host for codal along welcome to the exciting world of game development with scratch if you've ever dreamed of creating your own video game but didn't know where to start you're in the right place today we're going to take the very first steps towards creating your very own video game whether you want to design a thrilling space adventure or a puzzle that challenges the mind scratch provides all the tools you need ready let's go let's go to the scratch website go to scratch.mit.edu make sure to log into your account if you didn't create an account with me in our first video let's do that now go to the top right corner of the page and click join scratch and follow the prompts to activate your account in our last episode we learned all about the basics of creating in scratch if you need a little refresher feel free to go back and watch that episode today I'm going to create a Chase game when I think of a Chase game I know I need a few major elements a character or Sprite that chases the thing that's getting chased a cool backdrop and a sound oh and we need an area to keep score it is a game after all before I get started I want to think about what kind of Chase game I want to create H first thing that comes to mind is a catch version of the chase game that makes me think of my dog and how she's always begging me to play fetch that's it I'm going to build a game where a dog chases the ball and whenever she catches it she gets a point what kind of Chase game do you want to create it can be anything the possibilities are endless okay so now I planned out my game and have a basic idea of what I want it to be about it's time to get started the first thing I need to do is choose my Sprite I'll delete the current Sprite by clicking the X above it in the Sprite area then I click the Sprite icon choose animals and select the puppy oh my goodness this puppy looks so cute I'll name her pepper this is going to be great my dog's favorite thing to play catch with in real life is a ball so let's give this dog a ball too I'm going to select this ball and then change the size of the puppy and and the ball to 60 oh I just got the best idea my dog and I play cats everywhere in the house in the backyard and at the park so I'm going to add different levels to our game to show all the places where we play to do this I'll click the backdrop icon next to the Sprite icon I'm going to choose four different backdrops to represent four different levels each backdrop will be add added to the backdrop tab where you can change the order you want them to show remember you can choose whatever Sprites and backdrops you like for your game I want the puppy to move left to right trying to catch the ball so I'm going to add action to the left and right arrow keys select the puppy in the Sprite area then from the events tab drag and drop the when green fly click block to the scripts area next I'll go to the control Tab and add the if block the if block is a conditional statement meaning if this statement is true then run the code inside well if I press the right arrow then I want the puppy to move to the right in the sensing tab I'll add the keys space pressed to the if block change space bar to right arrow then I'll add the change X by10 from the motion tab inside the if block now press the green flag then click right arrow did the puppy move to the right no I know why it's because I forgot to add one more block I need to add a forever block from the control tab to surround the if statement without the forever block the program would only check the condition once and would likely miss most of the times the right arrow key is pressed adding a forever block around an if statement will make sure that our code runs continuously now I'll press the green flag again and then press the right arrow it worked great the puppy is moving to the right now I'll copy or duplicate the current block and change right arrow to left arrow and add a negative sign to 10 do you remember what happens when you add a negative sign before a number that's right the Sprite will move in the opposite direction now that the puppy can move left and right let's code the ball I want the ball to come from the top of the stage down towards the puppy the stage is measured along the X and Y AIS if you drag the ball from the top of the stage to the bottom you can see his ycoordinates change from 170 to 0 to 170 I'm going to add my starter blocks when green flag click block and the forever block and the if block as my instructions for the ball when the green flag is clicked I want the ball to change wide by5 this will move the ball down the screen towards the puppy but what if the puppy can't catch the ball then I need to reset the ball to the top of the stage I need two blocks to add to the if statement I'll go to the operator's Tab and add the less than block then go to the Motions Tab and add the Y position the Y position keeps track of the current y position of the Sprite if the Y position of the ball is less than 170 which is the bottom of the stage then I want to go to random position and set y to 180 which is the a area above our stage now click the green flag the ball should be moving towards the dog and resetting itself to a new position at the top of the stage once it reaches the bottom okay now I know what happens when the puppy doesn't catch the ball but what should happen when it does when my dog catches the ball in real life she gets a treat so when the virtual puppy catches the virtual ball let's give it a virtual treat AKA a point I want to add a block of code that says when the puppy touches the ball the puppy gets a point then it should play a sound to celebrate then I'll reset the ball to the top of the screen to do that first We'll add our starter block then I'll go to the sensing Tab and add the touching Mouse pointer block to the if statement I'm going to change the mouse pointer to Pepper for the puppy excellent now when the ball touches the puppy something will happen but what I know let's keep score of how many balls the puppy catches in order to keep scoring scratch we have to go to the variables Tab and click make a variable variables can be used to keep track of scores in a game store user inputs control different aspects of animation and so much more let's make a variable called score you'll see a score tracker on the top left of the stage now drag the change my variable by one block inside the if statement then select score from the drop down menu and change variable by one now I'll click the green flag and try to catch a ball to test it out hm it looks like some balls get stuck on the screen after touching the puppy I have to reset the balls after each one is counted but first I want to add a sound after each ball is caught to do this I'll go to the Sound area and drag the start sound block below the change score block click the sound tab then click the sound icon at the bottom of the page and select pop now try catching it again press the green flag then move the puppy left to right to catch the ball do you see see your score going up does each ball reset do you hear the pop great we're making so much progress in our game the last thing I want to do is move the puppy to the next level in our game every time she catches 10 balls to do this I'll need to duplicate the last scripts block I'm going to replace the touching block with an equals operator block then dragging my scores variable and set it equal to 10 now replace chain score to set score to zero I want to reset the score after each level then change to the next bath drop Let's test out our Chase game we want to make sure all of our blocks of code work together I have to double check to make sure that whenever the puppy catches the ball he gets a point and then if he gets 10 points he goes to the next level let's press the green flag and give it a try yay it worked yes okay now I want to save my work so I don't lose my awesome Chase game make sure you save your work too first we have to give our project the title then click save now in the top right corner or you can go to file and select save now I can't wait to see all the fun chase games you've made in scratch but now I think I'm going to spend some time playing catch with my dog in real life hi Cloud you want to play catch see you next time coders
