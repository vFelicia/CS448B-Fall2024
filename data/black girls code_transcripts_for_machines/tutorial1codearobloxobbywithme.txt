hey hey brilliant coders I'm Cheyenne your host for code along developing an Obby in Roblox brought to you by black girls code in this video series we will be working together to learn how to create an epic multilevel Hobby in Roblox that everybody's going to want to play I know you may just want to jump into developing the game trust me I do too but it's super important that we take the time to plan out our game like what kind of hobby are we going to build and wait what even is an Obby anyway if you are new to the world of Roblox and Abby is simply a game made of obstacle courses that you need to get through in order to win and we all want to be winners here okay I know that's right game developers normally spent hours brainstorming what will the characters the story and the design be storyboarding is a step used by most game developers and since I'm a game developer and you're a game developer let's not skip this step storyboarding your game involves creating a collection of cards or boards that tells your game's Story movie and TV directors often use storyboarding as a way to plan out their film sequences and to include important details about characters props costumes and sets storyboarding and video games are not much different similarly we can use the cards to depict your game's scenes in a logical order you can also use the storyboard to plan your game's characters plot points gameplay functionality character actions game items and much much more great now all I need is an idea okay so I know I want to build an Obby and that's pretty much all I know okay all right let me take a deep breath that was good sometimes when I want to get a good idea I do things that calm me and clear my mind maybe I should go for a walk or take a shower one time I got an idea for a winning science project in there maybe I'll scroll on social media or or play a video game playing a video game might help in this instance because I often get game ideas by thinking about what I love or would want to improve in other video games okay so BRB all right sorry I was gone for so long but I think I have it after my walk social media scroll and video game sessions I've decided that my game will be a futuristic Hobby so let's get started before I dive into storyboarding all my ideas about a futuristic hobby I want to make sure my storyboard is all prepped and ready to go for my game storyboard I am going to use canva canva is a free graphic design tool that people all over the world use okay to get started we go to www.canva.com and simply sign up for an account once you're in in the search bar simply type storyboard then a variety of templates are going to show up on the left hand side I'm going to apply the free filter because your girl is on a budget okay Queen I know you know what I'm talking about I am going to choose this template I like how it allows me to include both images and text so I can jot down my vision and notes all in one now that I'm in I can see my storyboard template to the right and a variety of tools I can use on the left to edit and make it more of my vibe I'm going to choose the second page of my storyboard template to start working in since it's more of a blank slate now we're truly ready to start building our storyboard while I was on my break I scrolled through social media and saw so many posts about the state of our world which made me overwhelmed but there were also some posts encouraging me to get involved and to help so I was also hopeful generally I was feeling a lot I mean hashtag mood am I right I decided I wanted to make an Obby that both acknowledged the problems of the present and also the hope for the future I thought it would be awesome to build an Obby that takes the player through the world of today into a better cleaner more beautiful future of tomorrow now what do you imagine the future to be is it a world full of robots and artificial intelligence then your Obby would probably have hightech robots and some awesome futuristic obstacles or perhaps you imagine a world free of violence that's filled with love and with hope then your Obby might be filled with bright colors and rainbows I picture the future to be a place where humans have worked to reverse climate change I imagine that there will be less pollution more Lush forests and cleaner oceans I mean when I dream I dream big anyway to reflect that it will be a long and sometimes difficult journey ahead to get to a better future I want the player to navigate through different levels that get harder and harder at the end of my hobby I want to celebrate the winners on a platform that displays the beauty of our new world let's start getting some of these ideas down to start I know I want my Abby to be six levels I mean I'm just starting out on this whole game development wave so I definitely don't want to overwhelm myself for level one I think I want the player to start in a very polluted city all the parts of my hobby will look dark gray and black to represent the many highrise buildings in the city as well as the smog gross for now I'm just going to name this level the polluted city I know not too creative but we'll work on the names later okay so level one is planned we've got our first addition to the storyboard period for level two I am thinking I want the player to go through a forest that has suffered from deforestation right now it's the unfortunate truth that forests are being cut down for human needs causing animals to lose their habitats I'll call this level the scarce Forest picture it as having scattered trees Fallen logs and tons of human construction tools laying around I promise it will get better we will literally code it to be moving on to level three for this level I want to address one of the biggest problems in today's world our water I imagine this level of having brownish green ocean water and melting icebergs again I know it's a little sad but just go with it for now I'll call this level the contaminated ocean now it's time to change the narrative for level four I'm going to take the player through a city again but this time the obstacles will be pedestrians and trees rather than cars and ugly City buildings I'll add a blue sky now instead of the smoggy dirty Sky of level one I'll call this level the city of the future I know I know my name conventions are just so creative and now for level five I'm going to take the player back through the forest but this time it will be a lush rainforest where the player will need to watch out for all the living species along their path I'll call this level the return of the Wild finally we are at level six where the player will Traverse the ocean except this time it will be a beautiful blue ocean with a horizon Colored Sky the obstacle course will be filled with beautiful corals and wonderful aquatic creatures for now I'll name this level the ocean blue and done I told you it was all gonna get better I did it you did it we did it together we sketched out ideas for a futuristic Obby and remember these are just initial ideas if I get any more random Sparks of Genius I'll be sure to add more to my storyboard and of course my game I can't wait for you all to join me for our next video where I'll show you how to get started in the Roblox Creator studio so you can build a basic Obby until next time game on my coding fam thank you
