foreign to introduce you to today's guest Imani larussa is a twotime emmywinning motion graphics artist nft entrepreneur and the founder of the nonprofit organization jumpstart designers welcome hi are you excited for the interview oh absolutely awesome you look great by the way thank you as our coders know we're playing Jenga with a Twist let me give you the quick rundown okay so the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer a question with that color theme so the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career greet for inspiration and blue for a challenge okay you ready oh yes absolutely okay you can go ahead and put it okay all right oh this one easy peasy nice yes okay so what are some programs that helped you develop art when you were younger and what are some tools that you would recommend For Young Artists now yes so when I think about like programs obviously I did After Effects and stuff but I think about what really helped me was video copilot uh it was a website ran by Andrew Kramer and he basically just made all these free tutorials of like really great quality like visual effects and that was a huge thing for me to be like oh I could do this type of stuff and and so that really helped me and also School of emotion they make courses that are just phenomenal cool yeah thank you for sharing yeah okay I guess it's my turn yes from the bottom I think that would like balance it out yes yes yes yes and then go oh look at that easy peasy super easy peasy so have you always been an entrepreneur um I would say uh back in the day um back when I lived in Chicago I remember this is probably like my first memory of being an entrepreneur my mom would bring home twinkies and I would sell them at school for like 50 cents so I was like I knew I was a businesswoman like I knew from that day I was like stocks money Investments so yeah okay cool okay I honestly we're doing pretty good I know um I'm gonna pick a challenge because this one's sticking out it's calling my name okay yeah oh yeah yeah that's what it was okay name as many digital art programs in 10 seconds as possible okay the program can be for any level okay ready do you want me to give you 15 seconds yeah okay go after effects blender Cinema 4D um illustrator Photoshop InDesign um Arrow uh five seconds um uh I got pressure oh you got a lot though you did say a lot that was good the last few seconds as soon as I knew there was only five seconds left I was like blank I know honestly that happens to all of us yeah let's pick from the bottom here I think I feel like this would be easy I think yeah but it's good good you're good okay so career what is your favorite nft sold or created and why my favorite piece I mean I had to go with my last piece because it was like the most time I've ever spent on a piece but it was also this thing of like I am going to invest my time into something that I think will come out good and that is the most scariest thing because you're basically just putting all your eggs in one basket and you're willing to like take the consequences of not getting paid and not selling it based on like faith in yourself and so that was like really it just felt amazing to be able to accomplish exactly what I set forth and so yeah it was a very fun project it was a long time but I think it was worth it for sure yeah okay okay um which one looks good done like not that much of I don't know I like the challenge challenge just keeps me on my toes okay oh this one's good oh yeah that one yeah yeah yeah yeah I practiced Jenga before I got here oh really wow look at you okay another challenge what is your experience being a black woman working in a tech space it's interesting because ever since I was going to film school I had realized how little black girls are involved at all I actually wanted to pursue um cinematography before like doing Motion Graphics but like being a girl being a woman color um I just face a lot of discrimination at like the school that I was going to I just had men that were intimidated or just like didn't feel like I was deserving of respect one person had said like well how do you expect to get respect when you dress like that and it was like hmm judge me on like being a bad person like judge me on being a bad worker like don't judge me on a piece of cloth like right it just doesn't make sense and so when I started like trying to pursue cinematography I realized I couldn't do this without other people like I need a crew and so it pushed me more towards doing Motion Graphics which I am so thankful for because I have such a deep love promotion Graphics but it had made me realize like it started um started Sheltering myself and I started like really putting myself like behind the scene you know where I'm like behind a computer like oh you don't need to know who I am and I realize how bad that was for me to do that like I needed to show my face because I needed other little girls that look like me to be able to see that like look like we are in this field right because before it was like oh like I can't wait to grow up and work for an animation studio and it was never this idea of like I can't wait to grow up and own my own Animation Studio I think a part of it has to do with access another part of it has to do with lack of representation if we could start changing that we could start having the conversation more not that like I want people to feel uncomfortable about having this conversation I want people to feel empowered of being like yeah like let's change this like this is totally possible and doable yeah like we could just continue having this conversation and like it could really change the lives of so many people so yeah it's interesting though I just oh no it's okay it's okay though because I still want to ask you one last question yes okay we're just gonna yeah we'll just pretend that didn't happen Okay what is one thing you want to tell us but we haven't asked you yet I guarantee you I pinky promise that you will get better at whatever it is as long as you spend an hour a day like an hour really isn't a lot and it's like if you can invest that time into yourself I wholeheartedly believe that you will become better without a doubt I agree yeah we can spend an hour on Tick Tock we can definitely spend an hour doing absolutely and that we love I'll be spending like three hours on Tick Tock so I can spend at least an hour at least an hour exactly yeah thank you to all my coding friends for chatting with me today as always stay cute and stay Cody foreign
