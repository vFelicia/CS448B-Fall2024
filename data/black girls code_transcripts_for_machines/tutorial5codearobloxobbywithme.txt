hey hey gaming family I'm your host Cheyenne and I'm so excited to have you here for video five in the previous video we focused on adding scripts to objects in order to customize the Obby and make it more unique to our taste but also more challenging and tricky to our players like this cool right I know but I'm feeling generous to our players right now we'll learn how to add helpful game elements like power ups there's a lot to get done so why don't we get started and have some fun if we look at our storyboard in level 4 we are building out a futuristic city that has a lot of tall buildings and obstacles but it's also a Greener space with more cyclists than drivers and there's also a lot less pollution since this is our optimistic view of the city of tomorrow let's get to building our futuristic city first things first we'll need to build the infrastructure of our city in the marketplace I am going to search for roads and buildings to add thank you foreign the obstacles we covered in the previous videos to make the level really difficult to pass as players move through each Obby and the levels get harder and harder it would be great to give them a little bit of help through power ups that can be a nice game developer but not too nice okay to allow them to have special abilities we can add power ups throughout the Abbey the power ups can be hidden or visible to make it easier to get through certain tough sections so the power up I want to add is the ability to run faster through obstacles to do this search for Speed in the marketplace and add the speed pad drag and drop it to a location in the workplace where speed will help the player complete the Obi faster to adjust the speed of the speed pad go to the walk speed variable and change it to how fast you want the Avatar to go once they touch the object now test out your power ups yes okay it's giving multifaceted nice job the player now has some superherolike abilities sorry but swinging like SpiderMan and flying like Wonder Woman are still off the table for now like a lot of superheroes they are tougher than the bad guys and have superhuman abilities like being Invincible to damage okay such a flex let's give our Avatar the ability to be Invincible search the marketplace for invincibility then select this option this part will give the Avatar the ability to have Max Health after it touches the part now drag and drop the new script into our part or block then press play to track your status of your health you can go to the health and Max Health properties on your avatar in the Explorer search bar type in humanoid then scroll until you see the humanoid icon under your username next look at the property screen below and scroll down to the game drop down menu you will see properties for your health and Max Health now if you run over the invincibility block then your health will turn to Infinity that's excellent now you're protected from a lot of dangerous obstacles but not all of them if you touch a spinner with a reset script or code that makes your health go instantly to zero then your avatar will still reset even though your health was at Infinity so how do you truly become invincible open the script from the Invincible block we need to attach a marker to our Avatar to let the obstacles with the instant reset script like Spinners and fire know that we cannot be harmed inside our if statement we can create a local variable that stores the Invincible marker when the Avatar touches the invincibility block the Invincible marker will be attached now go to a spinner and open the script in Explorer go to the if statement and add a second condition to check for the Invincible marker on the avatar if the if statement reached true such as the Avatar does exist and does not have an invincible marker attached then Health should be zero to be Invincible on all dangerous obstacles then you will need to add this code to all of your if statements Let's test out our new ability press play run over to the invincibility block then jump on the spinner that can identify our marker do you reset or are you invincible we have successfully given our players the ability to use powerups to become invincible get it girl we're playing you can always keep exploring the marketplace for more awesome power ups to add to your game why don't we each spend some time building out level 4 of our Obby and girl we'll link back up when you're done hey there you are no I missed you I missed you did you finish up our futuristic city I did as well here's what mine looks like now that we've completed level four go to files saved to Roblox and for working on our Avi together don't forget to come back to our next video where we will learn how to add sounds and music to our Avi as well as awesome banners to our checkpoints see you very soon gorgeous Gamers peace and as always game on
