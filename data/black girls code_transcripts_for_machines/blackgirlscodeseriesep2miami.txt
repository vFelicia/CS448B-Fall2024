we can't have like film education or dance classes or any of that stuff the only thing we have right now is banned which is porous or Shawn was shot we got PE and Nessie South Florida is one of those things where we have invisible lines and it's an invisible line that you do not cross if you're coming from a black community trying to get the opportunities that are in the white community we just have lines that we won't cross we know that it's a way out unfortunately in our communities especially in South Florida we have a lot of real schools that are underperforming and they're under serving our kids so if that's the dialog you know if you're if you're a student and you have a teacher that doesn't want to be there and it's only there because to get a paycheck well that trickles down to how a child ends up feeling about their own education now we have a system on in an educational system especially in South Florida we have the FCAT so we have a system that only teaches to the test now they're not really teaching they're not fostering creativity they're not really promoting to kids to go to college or start businesses because that's not what passes the FCAT test it's not that black children minority children aren't smart enough a lot has to go back to their school systems aren't good enough so when you come from a school system that Hillary hugs you behind when you get to college you get explained you get exposed to people with much more diverse backgrounds and you're able to kick keep up it's just harder magnet oh they're just not smart my story is you know I'm from Baltimore no inner city you know I did a lot of things that inner city you know kid does you know I initially live in inner city I hung out my friends were they that's the cool thing to do you know there's all the rappers you wanna be a drug you know that's doesn't definitely tell us there's so many factors that contribute to why students why young minority use our help back don't have the same don't have the same skills such as others but that doesn't mean that they can't get they take what they see in our children and use it and man Jamaica babies look like they are part of something that they take them and make our children look like they will not get nowhere no further than the corner this with the whole culture is people's trend oh if I do this if I'd be smart if I go to school I'm not black enough it's no such thing as being black enough you can be you can be like that why don't because we're black why do we have to knock why wouldn't I have the 19 degrees why don't we have to not do the right thing you know just because you can from Overtown you came from living city or you came from the foot bring projects they don't mean you can't make it out the hood don't mean you can't be something so I could have been a drug dealer I could have been a gang member but I chose to not do that even though I grew up around it I chose to be smart I had my whole mind so with meat having my own man I knew I'm not gonna do drugs I'm not going to Train I'm not gonna I'm not gonna talk guns around I want to be better I want to be able to take care of my family one day I want to make it out there I want to be something their life our kids our families our communities in general are dealing with so much that that's why it's important for folks like myself for other entrepreneurs that look like our kids we're technologists that look like our kids to create platforms to really engage the young people and introduce them to these concepts because the schools can't and aren't able to do everything technology sitting my life because it gave me something that I thought was cool so now my thought was interesting and it gave me a pathway to know there was something I could do after high school no you just don't know where to go you don't have a community center for if the goals that's why I love black the director of the miamidade College Carrie meek entrepreneurial education center and I'm also a board member of the miamidade Economic advocacy trust the group that's responsible for bringing black both code to Miami this is the fastest best way that we thought we could just accelerate this one we're targeting underprivileged girls a lot of them are consumers of technology where they're using popular applications such as Instagram Facebook etc however learning how to create those is something that just doesn't exist unless they're being exposed to it so today we were doing our workshop called build a game in a day and basically basically we taught the building blocks of HTML and CSS so they need to put their spin on it and bring to the environment or to the cultures the world what they see is a need Iran China like I had to make to learn how to make my own website uh yesterday it was actually fun because I was able to hike up to another website and mess up everything on purpose I love black girls code because it's a muchneeded movement to really create community as far as our young girls in particular and get them integrated with the opportunities as far as technology and the prepare them for the jobs today and tomorrow Black Rose Bowl is astronomical and influential black girls code represents a beginning you know it's almost like Alex through the looking glass it propels little girls into this world that they had no idea existed you
