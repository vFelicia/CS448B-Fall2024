I am so excited for our next guest so Shea is an artist and entrepreneur who creates bold colorful illustrations inspired by black women she not only has her own collection at Forever 21 but I loved her art so much that I had to fill the code Zone space with it with her at work and I know you probably are too so welcome Shea thank you for coming by are you excited to play Jenga I am it's been a very long time so just bear with me but yes no problem so we're gonna basically be playing it to get to know you a little better each of us will remove one block and place it at the top of the tower without making a crumble if it crumbles that round of the game is over and another one begins so as you can see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer a question from that color theme the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career green for inspiration and blue for a challenge so are you ready to get started let's go awesome I always give my guests the honors okay let's see here again bear with I mean it's been a it's been a minute so I don't have any yeah the blues are a little rough today that was easy love it okay so tell us a challenge that you've dealt with as an artist and how you overcame it when I first got out of school I thought that I wanted to be an artist and that to be my main source of income and what that ended up doing to me personally is making me create things just to sail sometimes those things I didn't like they were just things that I was focused on other people lacking enough to buy and so it starts to mess with your the way you look at yourself as an artist but now I've learned to just you create what you love and then the tribe will come like my mom used to say the people that want it will come they will find you okay let's do let's do another career let me see oh gosh it's this one looks kind of loose so yep got it what are your favorite elements to create and what are your favorite colors to use I love Line work in abstract shapes like anything with patterns multiple rip repetition I absolutely love that and I love organic shapes I've always loved abstract art my favorite color palette kind of as we see here yeah 11 oranges teals turquoise uh this hot pink is really really one of my big babies and then like a chartreuse green always love those maybe if I pull this way let's go on that's good oh gosh why do I feel like it's gonna fall let's just try it anyway if it falls then oh well and we're back okay so I'm gonna do let's uh what's some inspiration okay um oh this one's loose perfect nice okay last inspiration question so tell us what your design process is and our storyboards involved uh no I would love to say that I'm some very organized artist who has like you know a wall full of planned out art but I don't because when I used to plan out art or plan out creating something it was very necessary and forced whereas now I just literally love sitting on the couch and being like Oh get my laptop I want to make something real quick I'll come back to it I'll add to it next week or maybe never you never you know but again I just love that not having a need to finish something or pump out this art constantly you just you create when you want to create yes yes okay so tell us about partnering with Brands I think one of my favorite ones that I work with HBO on doing a mural in Atlanta and being from Atlanta and being someone who absolutely loves street art and graffiti on walls having someone say can we put some of your art on a wall with absolutely insane for a new show that they were premiering one of my favorite shows actually Fresh Prince and they were doing the reunion and I got to create a piece for that it was just an amazing experience that's been one of my highlights working with a I'm a brand or a company well congratulations on that that's lovely okay I think I want to finish up our careers okay um okay oh that was too easy I don't know what it is okay so I like this question how do you make your art profitable so I think for me not trying to be profitable has been what's been successful for me I'm just telling my story and somebody says oh I can relate to that I want to support that person and they do but if if you can don't don't aim to make make sales right because that kind of thoughtful you're working what you're creating and I think people can like sense that too right I think we're gonna finish off with a bang okay finishing up our childhood memories have you always wanted to be an artist I didn't always want to do it as a career but I've always been one like I said I wanted to be a doctor you could have never told me otherwise up until about 11th grade but I'm always just it's always been me to be a maker it's always been a part of you exactly right before I even knew it really cool well that's all of our questions today so thank you so much Shay for coming I I literally we had such a great conversation and I learned so much about you thank you I'm just I'm just a girl from Georgia so this is like oh my goodness so I love it thank you so well I'm sure our viewers will relate so thank you so much bye guys bye foreign
