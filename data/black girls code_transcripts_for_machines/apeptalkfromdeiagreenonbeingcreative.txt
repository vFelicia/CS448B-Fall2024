okay so to all the young girls out there try anything and everything creative I feel like holding on to something creative as you get older will really just help to ground you because sometimes we get stuck in this Loop of just life um and it can be hard so you need like a destressor or something where you can pour your creativeness into something that you can really be proud of and not have to worry about you know other people other people's opinions influencing it or whatever be happy be healthy don't take life too serious and just stand out to stand out in this world and you're gonna make it you're gonna be good you'll be great
