what's up my brilliant coders it's your girl Jillian and I'm here in the code zone for another surprise code Along video you thought we were done no we are just switching things up today we're doing things a little differently we're gonna mix it up with a oneonone conversation to discuss everything nft my favorite now before we jump in let's cover the basics so what is an nft well an nft is short for nonfungible token like most I was like what is nonfungible it's where we put the fun in digital you know because fun is in fungibles get it nonfungible means that there is only one of each token yep just one it's extremely unique like you and that's why so many people have become obsessed with collecting them did you ever collect Pokemon cards back in the day you could collect them and trade them with your friends people even sold them for thousands of dollars some of the rarest ones are now worth millions of dollars well nfts are basically our new age Collectibles so when an artist develops an nft they create a record of their digital or physical assets sold and traded on a specific blockchain a blockchain is an online database that is shared amongst a Cyber Network different cryptocurrencies and nft platforms use blockchains to securely share digital files and funds within their thirdparty Network think about it as your online security system so since we're talking crypto we have to cover for cryptocurrency well cryptocurrency is a digital currency it's like an alternative form of payment to our boring cash or credit card options that most people are used to it's created using encryption algorithms to transform plain text Data into ciphertext now I know that's a lot of digital talks and a lot of information but the most important takeaway is this an nft is a unique record there's only one of each and it's extremely valuable to help us chat about everything nfts today I'm so excited to introduce you to today's guest Imani larussa is a twotime emmywinning motion graphics artist nft entrepreneur and the founder of the nonprofit organization jumpstart designers welcome hi first I'd love to know your story so how did you begin developing nfts so I think it all starts from when I was like a kid and getting into digital art so I would make music videos with my sister it then spiraled into like making videos in high school like in the film program I started pursuing a bachelor's degree in digital filmmaking and then from there I started working at CBS News and while I was there I was making like digital art all the time so I would work there 40 hours a week and then an additional 20 30 hours a week on top of that just like making Motion Graphics stuff for potential like artists that I wanted to work with and that led me to working with like the biggest record labels in the world and then when nfts arrived I was like like you get paid for doing this like I've been doing it for free for like Instagram likes and so like it was it was a lot more difficult for digital artists to be able to like sell their art and when this came out I was like nobrainer like this is something that I need to do and pursue so yeah it's been a journey for sure that's awesome yeah so do you remember your very first nft sold oh my God like it was yesterday um I was still like doing a whole bunch of like music industry stuff and the thing with those deadlines is that like they need it yesterday so it's like boom boom and so in between projects I probably had like a day or two to like chill out and in that time I would try to make work that was just for my Instagram and so I made this piece with the intention of like trying to manifest getting on one of these nft platforms and I was like this is going to be the first piece that I put out and I ended up getting an invitation on foundation and I put it out and like within 45 minutes I got a bid of like fifteen hundred dollars what is absolutely crazy about it was the person who bought the piece for 3 thousand dollars was a 15 year old uh digital artist it just goes to show like it's just a crazy weird Market ah programs and tools d you use I use primarily Adobe After Effects with a little sprinkle of Cinema 4D so I am like Motion Graphics native and so after effects has just been my ride or die I don't know what I would do without After Effects and it's so funny because it's such a daunting looking program um but I wouldn't have it any other way so what platform options are there for selling nfts and what platforms do you use I always say like spend two months researching and in the space before you even think about dropping something there's things like open C open C is like for like the public and then you have Foundation which is artist invite so if I am on Foundation I have an invite and I can invite you then they have super rare which is like one of the most like prestigious nft platforms to get on so it's kind of like finding what works for you and just building from that so can you tell us how you go about setting up a profile on one of these platforms it's really easy like the big thing is like creating a metamask wallet and that basically connects to like your Google Chrome extension each platform is different but they all kind of rely on the same thing of having a wallet for it okay yeah so is the platform that you use now different from the one you used as a beginner yeah for sure when I started I used foundation and I got accepted to super rare So since that happened um I've been on there are there any platforms that are like beginner friendly that you would recommend open C is definitely the beginner friendly because you get to understand the process of how the menting goes but there's also like gaspies included so if you want to just learn how it goes like I'm sure there's tutorials out there that just shows how to do that so that you don't have to waste any money do you have any tips for viewers who want to monetize their work just being a good artist doesn't necessarily mean that your work is going to sell I think the big thing is going into it knowing that you're going to invest more time than anything else I don't want people to just quit their jobs and be like I'm gonna do nfts now like that's just it's not realistic but it's 100 has so many opportunities so a lot of people ask why are nfts so important in your opinion why do you think nfts are important I think mfts provide opportunities I feel like I've made my best work with not having the restrictions of working under a client so what advice would you give to viewers who want a career in the nft industry it is not a Sprint it is a marathon and don't quit your job invest your time into it and spend all the energy that you have to just do research and like that starts opening doors that starts bringing more inspiration and that eventually will lead you into being able to monetize it and eventually become an artist in the space it is a balance that is worth figuring it out yeah yeah I definitely agree yeah so are there any mentorships or educational programs that you would recommend for artists who want to be in the nft industry it's something that I have been really focused on especially with my nonprofit jumpstart designers so our main goal is to get computers and Adobe CC digital art programs to kids and underserved communities but not only that like we don't just want to give them the tools and be like okay like have fun like we want to be like here's the tools and here's like courses and here's mentorship I come from a background where I didn't have a whole lot of money and so my mom went to go buy me a laptop and her credit card declined and we'd like walked out emptyhanded and it was it was absolutely devastating because I'd realize like like as a kid it was like when you grow up you could be whoever you want and as long as you put your mind towards it like that's what you will become and it's like well that's not necessarily true for people who don't have money yeah like this is a like money driven field you need to have a computer you need to have the digital art program so it just made me realize that like wow I ended up being able to get that laptop and I think about like what happened to the kid that never went back and got that laptop like what happened where do they end up that's why like we have basically brought together like the top nft artists in the space and we're raising money to get computers for kids so it was awesome well congratulations thank you I don't know about you but I had so much fun today thanks for coming by to the code Zone I really hoped you enjoyed our little nft talk now you're ready to create your own collectible to trade digitally thank you to all my coding friends for chatting with me today as always stay cute and stay coding foreign
