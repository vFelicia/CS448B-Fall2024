what's up really encoders it's your girl Jillian and welcome back to the code Zone and video two of code along our first video covered how to create and draw basic shapes and add colors and borders to them in video 2 we'll use those same skills we learned to code an art piece focused on environmental justice so here's my very own art piece that I made with code to represent my support of the environmental justice movement what's that oh you want to make something just like it say less I got you because this is the art we'll be learning how to make in this video foreign so as you can see this is a simple depiction of nature using the shapes we learned about in the last video as well as a couple more advanced shapes we will learn how to draw today but before we get started just a quick reminder about working in p5.js so in the last video we talked about thinking of your canvas the same way you would a sketch pad still the same except we're gonna get a little bit more specific in this video moving forward we're going to think about our canvas like it's a piece of grid paper now on your grid paper the columns going from left to right represent your xaxis and the rows going from top to bottom represent your yaxis now there is a small difference in where the grid starts in comparison to where you normally would start your grid normally one would think that x equals 0 and Y equals zero starts at the bottom left hand side of the grid but in our canvas the default setting of The X and Y coordinates are at the top left side of our grid I know it might seem a bit confusing at first but with some effort you'll start to remember that in no time it's kind of like going to a different country and realizing that people are driving on the other side of the road it might be counterintuitive at first but you'll realize that the rules are easy to follow once you start driving now it's helpful to remember that the size of our canvas is 400 by 400. it's a square meaning it's equal lengths on all sides the number in the first spot represents the width x coordinate of the canvas and the second spot is the height the ycoordinate so if I wanted to place a shape right in the center I would enter x equals 200 and Y equals 200. got it we're ready to start drawing now okay first we'll add a light blue background to the canvas to represent the sky and what's a sky without the Sun so we'll start inside our draw function and add our sun to the background but I want it centered on the top left side of the canvas to do this I'm going to label first Sun then determine the X and Y coordinates to add a comment or label the parts of your drawing type backslash backslash and then the name of the part you're drawing now let's set the position of the circle to the top left of our canvas we'll make the X and Y values 100 and I want to make the perfect circle so the width and height will also be 100. okay so we'll want to color the sun now so let's change the color of the circle from white to yellow and you know we want the sun to pop a little bit so we'll add a border around the circle to be orange with the thickness of two okay the sun is looking fire pun intended next we're going to add some clouds uh not those kind of clouds that's more like it okay so I'm going to label clouds below my sun and I'm going to make three of them I'm going to make the first one white so ellipse 60 200 150. I'm going to make the second light gray ellipse 100 230 180 and I'll make the third Cloud Gray you can do whatever you'd like though I just colored mine differently to practice color variation ellipse 140 200 40 and 50. I'm going to skip the border on the clouds for now and just like that we have a sun and three clouds below with a light blue background hmm that feels so nice oh yeah yeah perfect day to enjoy an ecofriendly Music Festival don't you think so in the reference art we looked at together earlier there's a Center Line we're now going to create that Center Line to do that we'll go below my background function and label Center Line I want the border to be beige and the thickness to be two the line function looks like this line X1 y1 X2 Y2 since the width of the canvas is 400 my X1 will be 200 and y1 will be zero the second point will be at the bottom of the canvas so X2 is 200 and Y2 will be the height of the page which is 400. now we have our first line on our canvas that splits the page in half now remember if you ever forget the arguments you need for the line or any of the shapes and coloring skills we learned just check the cheat sheet now let's take it a step further and create a tree top but first let me introduce you to the mother of trees wangari matai wangari was a Kenyan environmentalist who founded the green belt movement a mass reforestation effort that placed as much emphasis on the environment as it did women's rights and Community Development she was an amazing example of an intersectional environmentalist and one the Noble Peace Prize for her work I mean she was truly the goat rest in powerwangari let's go back to trying to create our Treetop now I want the tree to have four levels so let's do this together step by step we'll represent the tree using triangles and the placement of the points on a triangle goes in circle motion whether it is clockwise or counterclockwise let's label Treetop below clouds now I'm going to make it a green triangle with no border but feel free to experiment with borders here now we're going to place the triangle in the middle of the right hand side of the canvas of the triangle will be at X1 equals 300 and y1 equals 200. then the second Point X2 equals 250 and Y2 equals 250 and the last point of the triangle will be at X3 equals 350 and Y3 equals 250. yes you did that we now have a green triangle let's add some more top layers and once we do it'll look like those tall ponderosa pine trees in Yosemite National Park now I'm going to copy the treetop section from my code and paste it below the first one and I will paste two more copies below the current copies so that I will have a total of three copies of my Treetop section since I want to add to the top part of the tree I will have to change the Y values in our triangle function now I still want the Treetops to touch in the middle so I will adjust the Y values by subtracting 25. that will move each Tree Top up creating our Treetops okay so now we have a four level Tree Top but no tree trunk so it's looking a lot like a bunch of floating UFO bushes hanging out in the sky right now don't sweat it we can fix it by drawing a tree trunk so to add a trunk to our tree we'll use a rectangle let's label trunk after our last Treetop copy I'm going to make the trunk brown with a dark brown border and the thickness will be two but you can try out different shades of brown and Border thickness if you like I want the trunk to be aligned with the center of the Treetops but the top of the trunk to be below the last treetop we can use an X of 290 and a y of 250 which will put the trunk right below our last Treetop I also want the width of the trunk to be 20 and the height to be 150 because 150 is the remaining space between the bottom of the treetop and the bottom of the canvas let's also try rounding the corners at two nice it's looking more like a tree now so that's an improvement now for the final touches I want to add two more features to our drawing using the rectangle function I want to put our grass on the bottom of the canvas but on the right hand side just below my tree I'm going to label grass below my trunk drawing it will be green with no border and have a height of 10. we now have grass below our tree also can I just say hi key you are doing a great job yes okay now the last thing I want to do is change the background color of the right side of the canvas let's go to the space in our code above our Treetop and add our rect function here I want to fill half of the space but from the center line all the way to the edge of the right hand side of the canvas great okay now we have used the rect function to add a trunk create grass and even change half of the background to our canvas and you thought rectangles weren't going to be important didn't you now the last thing I want to add to our art piece is text with an environmental justice message so to add text to the canvas you can use a function called text text is very similar to the other functions you have used so far instead it allows us to pass in variables variables are pieces of code that store data the name of the variable tells you what type of information it is variables start with let or const followed by an equal sign then the information you want to store since we are writing text the message has to be within quotations just like when we write in what colors we want for the shapes and background now I want to store a caption for the air above on the left side of the canvas so I will call my variable error message and write in the message that I want I'm gonna write nurture nature for all but feel free to write a message that's important to you I want the text color to be white so I can use fill now to write the text on the canvas the first value for the text function is the message you want to write so I will paste in error message the next four values represent the location width and height of the text area now once you've written your environmental justice message the last thing you have to do is sit back and admire your hard work oh my gosh it looks so good okay so that was a marathon well a mental Marathon I don't actually like running I'm more of a walk slowly and enjoy the views kind of gal if you know you know but regardless of how you connect with nature it's important to remember that we all hold a responsibility to making sure that the environment is safe for each and every one of us for generations to come black girls code continues to build Pathways for young women of color in the tech industry through free workshops and summer coding camps I am so hyped to introduce you to two black girls code students who attended the 2022 black art through JavaScript summer camp in black art through JavaScript young girls spent a few days learning how to code digital art and websites it's the summer camp of a coder's dream yes it's actually a camp and there's plenty of fun involved let's talk to them hey sonay and Alyssa Hi so I would love to learn a little bit more about you both so introduce yourself tell us your age and how long you've been a part of black girls code hi I'm Melissa I'm 15 years old and I've been with black girls code for one year hi my name is sonay and I am 17 years old and I have been in Black Rose Cove for two years so so nay um I actually got to take a look at your art so tell me what inspired it well for my selfportrait it inspired me because of how I am mixed and it took a few times to find my right skin color and when I made my face it was super unique because I have like a cutie mark and it was super hard to make that and the background yeah so I noticed that your background was very bright so are there like specific colors you like to use for your art um I I like to use purples some neon yellows definitely blue nice well thank you so much I honestly really loved your art so great job okay so Alyssa so again I got to see your art as well so tell me what inspired yours I had just so much ideas and then I looked around and everyone else's was just you know unique that is what it started me I use maroon I use a different color for my background I had a blue shirt on that day it's beautiful well I loved your art as well so coders there are so many resources for Tech lovers like us so would you both have any recommendations you'd like to tell just make friends have fun and pay attention you're like your question yeah questions that you have because it would definitely help you don't want to be shy and say oh I just want to hide in the back of this corner like the teachers want you to ask questions because that's what they're there for and most of all have fun well thank you guys so much for stopping by and again I loved your art great job on these and I can't wait to see what you do next thank you bye to find more opportunities to learn how to code visit the black girls code website until next time stay cute and stay coding
