one thing lesson that I've learned that I want to share is that you can do both so I think there's this thing where you have to be either a starving artist or you have to you know have a career first off you can love your day job right obviously you would want to you don't want to just have a job but you can have a career you can have the security that it brings and not have to worry about oh you know maybe I didn't sell a piece this week or maybe I didn't you know I haven't I haven't made anything that's profitable because at the end of the day that shouldn't be the goal you should just want to create and then when you're off from that job you can create like you I feel like there's a lot of stigma about like I said Gee you got to devote to either one and if you if you're career driven you're giving up on your dreams and if you just want to be a starving artist you know you're risking that you know maybe you don't you're not successful but I found that doing both it's completely doable and um I find joy in doing both and sometimes people at my job you're like why are you still working I'm just like I I enjoy still doing this and doing the other one I don't feel like I'm sacrificing my business to do you know to have a job a career
