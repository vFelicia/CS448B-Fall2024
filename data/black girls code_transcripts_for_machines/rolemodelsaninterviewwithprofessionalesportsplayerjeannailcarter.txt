I just graduated college and um the last four years she's taught me about being a businesswoman negotiating for myself never taking less than always knowing what I'm worth having resources to help me become a better player which meant hiring a coach for me and um advocating for myself Emily has mentored me for quite some time and without that mentorship I would not have understood what brand Building looks like or what uh knowing my worth was was like that's beautiful that you can learn from another woman how to know your worth in the industry so what's some advice you would give young girls who are interested in being a gamer find communities of people and women like you that you can bond with through playing these games because when you find them then you all enjoy the same game there's sometimes a lot of other things that you enjoy too outside of the game being a part of a community can make gaming or entering into that world less daunting all right guys you hear that there is a lot of different ways you can get involved in the gaming world thank you for that alrighty this one's a fun one ready list as many female game characters as possible you have 10 seconds ready okay let's start right now go okay uh Lara Croft nariko uh Vicki Green uh it's not fighting game once great job great job that was awesome alrighty give us five tips inspiring entrepreneurs should know okay so five tips I think Gamers and entrepreneurs should know is uh What uh being on different forms of social media is very important exposure discoverability it doesn't just happen on one platform it happens across many uh two uh having the LinkedIn is very very important it helps with reach you get to connect with a lot of Professionals in your industry that way three study the people who are doing what you want to do I know people sometimes reference that as like shadowing or like maybe you study them more like you work beside them or maybe an internship or something like that uh for get a coach uh there's tons of different coaches for different Industries depending on your profession getting a coach can really help with understanding perspective maybe they see certain things that you don't yeah five having a fluid like organic brand a brand that is authentic to you be authentic be unapologetically you people gravitate towards that I love that we should definitely encourage people to be more authentic absolutely and I think authenticity you can't replace just like you said so that was great alrighty how does selfcare impact your gaming anything that's affecting you outside of the game will affect you inside of the game because it's clouded by maybe negativity or a weight that is uh bogging you down so or even like anxiety performance nerves any of that doubts because everybody has them and having that selfcare whether it's therapy having coaches multiple performance coaches anything they are there to help you wash those doubts away they're there to help help you gain that confidence but you have to put in the work right which means you do the exercises you do the deep breathing you do the journal you do the meditation right do you take on better nutrition because all that stuff outside the game makes your body well prepared and it feels healthy um it makes you ready to play a tournament because these are like marathons you're running when you when you play a tournament long hours it's two to three days so you need to make sure you're being the best version of yourself that you can be and selfcare is such an essential part of that absolutely I think that selfcare is the basis of any successful career so I'm glad that you said that all right Janelle thank you so much for answering our questions I know I will definitely be jotting down this information and I hope you guys at home are taking notes on this information too okay all right guys I'm gonna see you next time until then game on coding fam foreign
