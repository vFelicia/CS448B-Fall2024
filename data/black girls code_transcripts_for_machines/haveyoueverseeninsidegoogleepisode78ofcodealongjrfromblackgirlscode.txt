hey coders and welcome to not the code Zone today we're at the Google office on a field trip we'll be seeing a real life Tech professional so let's go see her let's go hey hey kaani how are you I'm good how are you doing so well it's great to see you isn't it great to like be here I love working here I'm really excited to show you more and tell you a little bit more about what I do you want to come and check it out yeah of course all right let's go let's go so how did you end up at Google funny story I applied to Google when I first graduated from college but I actually did not get accepted um so it was kind of sad but you know what it taught me a lesson just to keep going and keep trying and maybe there's a place you have to start um a little bit smaller so I kept applying to some smaller advertising uh companies and got my start there in digital advertising and I always kept thinking about what about Google what can I do so I kept applying and finally one day I actually got an email from a Google recruiter reaching out to me and I finally got my acceptance at Google that's great you know I think it really taught me just to never give up but to you know work on what can you bring to a company right that's awesome yeah so it was really cool to get here yeah that's fantastic so what do you like most about working in Tech I really like all of the smart and cool people and new inventions we can really build cool things for everyone so I think Tech allows us to connect the pieces and honestly interact with more people I'm from Nigeria originally and a lot of my family is still there so I can use social media to connect with them or we can use Google search to find things to like that we like to do together yeah that's great so what's your job yeah I'm actually a global product Solutions lead which is a handful but what it really means is I sit between our Market which would be our advertisers and our sales teams and between the engineer teams so if our advertisers have some feedback or product suggestions I can take all of that in and then share it back with our engineers and our product teams to see if we could build those features for them so are you a coder like me you know I actually am not but I do work with a bunch of coders and engineer teams our engineer teams and en coders will build features and scripts to help our search campaign serve better and so if they build new features and want to know if it's actually going to work or be useful to our customers I'll then take some of those ideas that they have to our customers and get their feedback to see like if it's helpful and if they really like it or if it's not helpful how can we improve it so that it would be helpful for you so what kind of skills do you need for your job my job is actually more about relationship building building relationships with my Engineers with my product managers and my advertisers um and these relationships are really key to make sure we're hearing from everyone we want to hear from our advertisers about what they like about our products and we also want to hear from our Eng teams and really figure out what are they trying to build so when I hear from both parties I bring these conversations together yeah it's not as technical as you would think but it's really important to have good relationship management and building skills so you can you know work and collaborate efficiently thank you so much for telling me about your job it was my pleasure so I actually have a really fun activity for us today um would you like to check it out yes of course so let's go what we're going to do is actually redesign Google's logo using these crafts and supplies from there we're going to take our two designs to our googlers and beta test to see which one they like better cool let's get started with an AB test we're taking two fairly similar things they might just be slightly different and seeing which one drives better performance you really want your logo to be attractive and inviting so people click on your name and actually want to figure out like what services you do we then look to see which one is actually performing better and then we launch one completely in the market okay let's put the finishing touches are you done with your design I am oh okay that's cute how's mine yours is cute too okay well how about we get the googlers in here and see which one they like better and do our beta test okay cool right hello everyone Hi and welcome to my beta test thank you so much for attending so I have two logos and I'm going to put both up and see which ones you like okay great we have these two thank you now got it uh one more time we have our clear winner I hope you guys also enjoyed the Google office as much as I did I was able to have so much fun and learn so many things especially about being able to create and run a beta test I'll see you guys all in the next episode bye
