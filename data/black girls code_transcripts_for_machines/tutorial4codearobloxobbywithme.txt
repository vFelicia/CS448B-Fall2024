hey hey gaming family I'm your host Cheyenne and I'm excited to welcome you back to video 4 of code along in this video we'll be learning how to add and edit scripts to objects which will allow us to customize actions and effects in our game we will also be building level 3 of our Obby the contaminated ocean so let's dive into Roblox well maybe not dive because you know get it dirty ocean water closed out of Roblox studio and need to find your hobby then go to file open from Roblox and choose your game in the previous videos we added objects from our Marketplace to our Avi each object was unique because of scripts written into the object allow the Creator to add custom actions and effects let's learn how to customize our objects through scripts first I will need to build out level three a bit to make it look like the contaminated ocean here's the vision I was going for to represent our ocean today let's copy our floor from level two and paste it side by side to create level three rename the floor in the Explorer to the polluted ocean I'm going to change the color in the property screen to a reddish brown to show that the water is dirty but you can choose any color you'd like so how are we going to pass from Level 3 to level four oh I know let's add a secret pathway that we can navigate through and since we have an unhealthy ocean we're not going to show any animals here why don't we instead design it so that the player has to jump from trash pile to trash pile to cross let's start simple with a single block part then make it more complex in the later levels select the block part and rename it to secret block one I want the trash pile to appear then disappear if it appears then we should be able to jump on it but as soon as it disappears we'll fall into the ocean like that floor is lava game you know we're like don't touch the floor but the ocean right now let's add our script if you hover over the object a plus sign will appear next to the name click the plus sign and a drop down menu will appear type in script and choose the first option you should now see a script icon under secret block one also when you create a new script a script tab will open next to your base plate the new script will have a default code saying prints parentheses hello world parentheses oh well that's nice but I have to delete it sadly okay hi bye now let's rename our script to fade block because we want the block to fade in and out it's time to start writing our code inside the fade block script I want to create a variable in Roblox variables are names associated with values think of it this way we have a filing cabinet in here you know that big clinky heavy metal drawer your parents probably have in their office in our virtual filing cabinet each drawer would be a variable that can hold various things such as text numbers and objects the name or label outside each drawer tells you what's inside the drawer or what the variable contains because we're working on the first secret block or secret block 1 we'll name the variable or the folder in our filing cabinet example secret block now this will store the object the script is located in as its value in our case the script is located in the secret block 1 object doing this will allow us to select and edit the object and local means we want to use the variable only on this script now that we can edit the secret block one object let's add the action to make the block disappear I'll use a function which declares an action on the object this means it will give instructions on what action we want to happen to the object the action we want is to make the block disappear each function name is followed by a parenthesis and the function stops at the end let's give our function instructions on what we want to disappear inside of your function let's grab the transparency property from the secret block 1 object the properties of the objects are located below the Explorer it is currently set to zero transparency which means we can see it transparency is on a scale from zero to one with one being invisible to start the action we created we'll write it below the initial function except without the words local function let's see if our disappearing function worked go ahead and press play whoa wait wait wait wait wait wait wait am I disappearing hold on wait what's going on hold on wait I don't like this I don't like this where where are my toes if it worked then the block will be invisible if you walk over to where the block should be it's still there you can't see it but you can still run into it hey you did that okay looks like the script worked because the block turns invisible let's write another function called appear below the disappear function I'm going to select and change the transparency property back to zero great now the block is visible then select the can Collide property which controls whether or not the player can collide with or touch an object we can set it to false when the block disappears and true when it reappears that means the player is able to collide with the block when it appears allowing them to jump on it but if it's not there then they will fall into the ocean and game over not over over you know they'll restart at the last checkpoint The Disappearing block is cool and all but I want to make it even more challenging I want to set a timer that will determine how long the block stays visible so I'll control when the block appears and disappears I know it's so evil to do this let's set a timer we can use something called a while loop a while loop Loops through a block of code as long as its specified condition is true we will also use a builtin weight function which takes a number representing how many seconds you want to wait before you go to the next function so I want to Loop over the disappear and appear functions so while my for Loop is true I'll do this wait for five seconds make the block disappear then wait another five seconds and it reappears that's it now press play look at that we created a disappearing secret trash block trash block maybe I shouldn't be as excited for that as I am now that we have one secret Block it's time to create a pathway across the ocean you can make some of the blocks invisible but make it so you can still jump on them you can also make other blocks visible but you'll fall through this makes it super super tricky for our player they will never know what they're gonna get the level of trickiness is up to you excellent we've added our own custom script to an object but what if we wanted to add a script already created by someone else actually make the process even easier let's try it by adding a kill script to the ocean floor I know I know the name is not as PG friendly as we would all like but it's just what it's called if the player falls into the contaminated ocean then game over not over over as you already know go back to the marketplace then search for the kill script and select the first option foreign go to the Explorer and rename the script to kill script then drag and drop it into the polluted Ocean Park now press play and test out whether you can cross the ocean or not boom it's just that easy you see that it worked again I hope you're starting to recognize you are a real game developer okay because I see you now guys before we wrap up here's a quick reminder be sure to add a checkpoint at the end of your level so the player has a place to respond this is going to be so necessary because we keep making our Obby harder and harder with each passing level alright Gamers you have learned so much in this video like you quite literally really understood the assignment okay before we talk about what's next I wanted to remind you that you can go back to levels one and two and change the scripts in our various parts and objects and continue to build out level three that way your game can be truly unique just like you um now that you've completed level three go to file save to Roblox this option will save the Obi in Roblox studio and on your online account please come back for video 5 where we will learn how to add power ups to our Avi we've been making our hobby harder and harder now let's see how we can give our game players some advantages bye for now and until next time game on family thank you
