if you're a parent or um just researching black girls code I would definitely recommend black girls code I will say that when you send them there they are in good hands the people that are surrounding them they really care and they really want the students to really be engaged and learn the material and I feel that black girls coat is just another organization that will help steer our future generation in the right direction thank you
