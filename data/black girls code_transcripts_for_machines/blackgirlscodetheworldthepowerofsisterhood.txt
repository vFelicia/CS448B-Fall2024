hi my name is madison and i had first started with black girls code in the second grade when my technology teacher had cohosted an event there at my school and i was just so in love with it all that i went home and i told my mom how excited i was and how much i loved it and she signed me up for more and she really motivated me to keep going and black girls code has helped me build so many friendships that i like to say it's like a mini coding family and you know it's nice to have someone to relate to and if i need help in any of my coding problems i can just to ask a friend and they know exactly what i'm talking about um the code that i live by is so be it see to it and basically that means if you think you can you can actually do it and you just have to believe in yourself so that's how i that's a code that i live by and live with every day of my life um and what it means to me to be a black girl who codes is strong independent smart and courageous because you have to be able to have the right mindset to be a black girl that codes and i just feel that you know it gets hard but you can always always find your way through it and that would be some advice that i would give a young girl that's interested in stem that it gets hard but you are powerful and amazing and you can do it no matter what anyone says and black girls code has impacted my life so much with different places i've been to teaching me new things and one particular thing that black cross code has um brought event that they brought me to was the new york stock exchange and honestly that was a breathtaking moment and it's just it was so amazing to be able to say i rang about the new york stock exchange and it's just a great feeling to be able to say that because not many people can say they have done that and um i just want to another thing i would tell someone that's a young girl that's interested especially a young black girl that's interested in some is believe in yourself and don't get discouraged everyone makes mistakes and just know that you are amazing and enjoy every moment of it
