oh my God you're already back wait did you knock oh my gosh you weren't supposed to see that uh okay just act surprised when I tell you this is the art we'll be making today I don't want any spoilers all right be right back it's okay all right then what's up my brilliant coders it's your girl Jillian and I'll be your host as we learn how to code digital art in this series from black girls code now in this video we'll continue to learn how to create new shapes in p5.js and make a second piece of artwork which you've never ever seen before which I'll reveal right now ready ah we love a reveal when I designed this digital art I wanted to Channel all the great artwork with empowering social justice messages that I've seen before so in my own artwork I chose purple to draw in the viewer's eye I also included three fists as symbols of empowerment and unity and I decided to put a cell phone in the center of the image because in the digital age our phones are one of the most powerful tools we can use to let our voice be heard and advocate for causes that matter to us next I drew a microphone to represent the power of using our voices and last but not least I drew a pencil and brush to represent how our writing and art can be powerful tools of protest advocacy and activism as well so I hope that the art we create in these videos can inspire you to continue to use your various crafts and talents to make our world a better place feeling inspired to get started all right then let's get into it here at the code zone so as you probably remember we'll first need to set up our canvas in your text editor we are going to change the default canvas values from 400 to 600. so now it is 600 by 600. this will give us a little more space for our shapes then change the background color in the draw function to purple this looks good but I'd like a lighter color purple in order to do that I'll click on the small box next to my color and change it to anyone on the gradient and voila we have a light purple background okay so now I'm gonna let you in on a life hack an actual useful one in order to make things easier for us today we're going to use the X Y tool as we create our artwork p5.js has many builtin functions to help you draw if you want to find the exact coordinates of an object or an area you want to place an object then you can use the XY tool p5js uses Mouse X and mouse y to track the horizontal and vertical position of the mouse when it hovers over the canvas you can use the console to see the values from your mouse X and Y coordinates we didn't cover that did we let's rewind for a second the console is the area right below our text editor it allows us to input commands as well as show values from our text editor so now let's add console log X Plus Mouse X plus y plus Mouse y to the bottom of our draw function now our canvas will update and we can hover over the canvas with our Mouse you should be able to see different X and Y coordinates in the console now that we've learned how to find X Y coordinates faster let's put it to the test I'm going to use it as we create the top of our fingers for the fist on the left side I'll choose a shape that best represents a fist which would be a rectangle but if I use a rectangle function then I won't be able to change each point around the rectangle thankfully p5.js has a function that allows us to connect the Four Points of a square or rectangle independently the quad function allows us to set each point in a quad to create many different shapes quad means four in Latin and it is considered a freestyle foursided shape it's similar to how the triangle function works you choose your starting position in X1 and y1 then you can move in either a clockwise or counterclockwise position setting the rest of your points X2 Y2 X3 Y3 X4 y4 let's add the first finger using a quad below background I'm going to label left fist now let's start adding our coordinates to quad the simplest way is to hover to a place on the canvas where you want each point to go then type it into your shape now rinse and repeat I want the first point to be at 45 100 then the next a 60 100 the third point at 65 131 and the last point at 50 134 okay that was a lot like a lot a lot as a reminder you can always take a snack break or a power nap or simply sit still deep breath in deep breath out I was definitely meditating and not sleeping okay shall we continue I can copy and paste the second finger below the first then find my coordinates after you have found the coordinates for the second finger repeat the process for the third and the fourth foreign look at you you did that oops I forgot these speaking of which we have the top four fingers but we still need to add a thumb to that hand don't we and we also need to add the Palm below the fingers to complete the fist below left fist label thumb for the left fist thumb we are going to use a rectangle for symmetry okay I'm gonna break down the thumb into two parts the top of the thumb going across the fingers and the bottom part that connects to the palm the top part of the thumb should overlap parts of the finger to show that it is gripping an object which we'll put in later and the bottom part will connect at the end of the thumb and push down from there we can also use the X Y tool to find the coordinates now below the thumb let's make a label Palm the color scheme will be the same as above and to create the unique shape of the Palm we'll continue using quads now I'm going to break the Palm down into two parts the right side of the Palm that is connected to the thumb and the left side that connects to the rest of the hand I want the first point of the Quad to be a little offcenter from the start of the thumb and also leave a gap so that we can add our mic later so I'm going to go below the thumb on the canvas and find the exact point x e equals 100 and Y equals 170 looks like a good starting point 0.2 will be at the outer lower edge of the thumb then we'll create the angle from the thumb to the wrist the last point will also be slightly offcentered creating the angle of the thumb now we'll use the same process to create the left side of the Palm okay we've completed our first fist for the drawing next we will create the fifth in the middle of the canvas but before we do that I thought you might find this interesting have you ever wondered how the image of the raised fist we are drawing now turned into an iconic symbol for standing up against Injustice in America the raised fist has been used by many types of people from different parts of the world throughout history to represent Revolution solidarity and fighting the good fight in the 1960s the Black Panther Party adopted the raised fist as a representation of Black Liberation but everything changed when two black American athletes raised their fist on the Winner's podium in protest at the 1968 Olympics for the first time ever the raised fist became internationally synonymous with the struggles that people of color faced in America one of the athletes Tommy Smith said that he saw it as a human rights salute and today that sentiment still Rings true so I hope that's a reminder to you that one person well two in this case can change history now let's jump back into making our digital art so that you can start changing the world so we left off at drawing the middle fist now as you can see it's also a little bit bigger and slightly different than the first fist but you'll still use the same steps in logic to create another fist so let's first start creating the brown middle fist while we're at it I will also go ahead and start working on the fist on the right as well why don't we both work on it and link up here when we're done foreign foreign it's really coming along so far we have created three different colored fists on our canvas and now it's time for a pop quiz when setting your points for the quad function what directions can you move in yes that's right clockwise and counterclockwise I asked that question because we are about to learn how to make another Advanced shape an arc and the direction we move is really important an arc is part of a circle not the full circle just a piece so in a circle there are 360 Degrees zero starts in the middle of the right hand side and the degrees increase as you move clockwise around the circle so if we want to draw an arc like the ones in our picture that surround our fists you have to tell the canvas by using degrees to draw our arcs to do that we'll go to the setup function and type angle mode degrees four values act the same as an ellipse but the fifth and sixth values determine where the arc starts and stops let's take a look at an example of an arc if I wanted to draw a smile using an arc then I can start at zero and end at 180 degrees and because I know you can't get enough of my pop quizzes I've got another question for you ready of course you are now suppose I was sad because my friends got Boba without me when I specifically asked them to get me some and I wanted to draw a frown then which degrees would I start and end at did you say 180 zero that's the right answer the last value in an arc determines how the arc is drawn you have three options to choose open cord and Pie open looks like a sliced orange with the Border going around the edge peel cord looks like a moon with the Border going around all sides and Pi looks just like it sounds now we're ready to add the arcs to our background I want the first Arc to be purple with a border thickness of eight it will be in the top left corner of the canvas and look like a half smile the width and height will be the same as 600. in our example we started at zero and moved to 180 to make a smile so for a half smile we will start at zero and stop at 90. now we'll add the second Arc to the bottom right hand corner the width and height of the second Arc will be the same as the first Arc and will start at 180 and stop at 270. okay time to color our second Arc we'll make the color a light purple now to do that we can click on the purple box color and change the Color Picker to a lighter color on the bottom Arc I don't want a border so we don't need to code that in now as you can see we're about halfway done in our next video I'll show you how to make a background so we can finish building our art piece but for now why don't we take a break to rest our brains scroll on Tick Tock and stretch our bodies and feed our tummies but before we do that we have to save your artwork go to file at the top of the page at the left hand side and select save awesome done and done okay that's all for now thanks for rocking with me today and until next time live your best life and as always stay cute and stay coding
