foreign who was on the fence about going to Camp I would definitely say um just take a leap and go if you're nervous about it I say just go it's a really enriching experience I've learned a lot I've learned a lot about programming that I didn't think I was going to learn no matter where you're starting and programming or if you know a lot if you don't know a lot so I think it's really important for black girls to get into that so I think definitely just jump into it thank you
