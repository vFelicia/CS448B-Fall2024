this question means so much to me because whenever I do anything or make any decisions in my life I always think of younger Ella looking up at me and hoping that the the mistakes and amazing things that I've done have all sort of built together to make the person that I am really proud to be today and it's basically me saying like it's okay to maybe not know exactly what it is you want to do right now or if you want to try something new that you've never tried before and you're not sure what other people will think you live your life for you and anything that you want to do as long as it makes you happy is the most important thing nothing can stop you you are absolutely incredible and I'm excited to see what you guys are going to achieve
