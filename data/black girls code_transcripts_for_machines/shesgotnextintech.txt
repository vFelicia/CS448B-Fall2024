through the tireless work of modern pioneers in truly the superpower working on in the fields of pure science to reveal more of the mysteries of the universe on the surfaces it's exactly what it says which is black girls code they're learning how to code web pages and code programs for robots so it's that in a literal sense but figuratively is i think it's a way that we move forward into the future with how we do things how we innovate how we bring our essence back to dominant culture because right now our narrative is kind of left out of the story just to say the word black girls is revolutionary in and of itself so for kimberly to step out to open up that particular industry to girls at such a young age i mean the sky is the limit for what they can bring to society as a whole so it's very innovative the mind is the most powerful machine that we possess as human beings i founded black girls code because i noticed there was a huge need in terms of girls of color and introducing them to computer programming and technology we're feeding the mind of the next generation so far we went to ibm we made the robot that we had to program but we had to debug it and that was hard the robot really is a piece of equipment that humans program so the question is can you do you want to play a role in in the future in terms of technology the lack of people of color in the technology field a lot of it stems from education we see an underrepresentation in that area from all minorities ethnic backgrounds and also people of color and i think it's a tremendous program in how it reaches out to young girls and introduces them very early to the concept of new technology this is silicon valley this is like the center of technology so when the girls go to those organizations to those companies to do handson activities that's how all education should be but just to see them flourish and grow in selfconfidence and their sense of self their identity that's all part of the elements that we try to build into our program it shapes their soul and their self esteem and their self worth by saying look this is what i did you can see their little spirits changing and empowerment black girls code can help little girls if we have a black girls code when we grow up we might become people in technology
