bottom left corner so let us know if you have any issues uh for the best viewing experience we suggest using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge as your browser and now it's my pleasure to introduce you to the speakers as I said I'm Samantha but we have Joanne Hill Leah Castleberry and Dr Patrice Johnson here so let's get started so let's talk about the journey and the vision so this conversation is grounded in our visual visual our vision of radical change in Tech so we're going to start with giving you the opportunity to learn about our panel so to the panel tell us about your journey why Tech what made you choose the roles that you got into and what was the what was guiding you in your journey to Tech and through Tech I guess I'm gonna go first yes thank you I I will break the ice Samantha um so I am Dr Patrice and I work with the amazing wonderful organization that is hosting this Summit black girls code I serve as the chief programs officer for black girls code and this is my first role squarely in the tech industry and the only reason why I chose to come to black girls code was because it is not like any other Tech organization it's sole purpose is not just a center black girls in their genius but it is an organization that seeks to disrupt so I was not necessarily interested in Tech before BGC what piqued my interest was that Tech was just one of the tools used to talk about disruptive Innovations utilizing Tech and looking at centering social inequity and considering what it looks like to liberate black girls and what that looks like to liberate everybody so that is one of the reasons why um I took this path um even the name or name black girl's code is disruptive it's disruptive um if you look at our founding and our history we were challenged on that name why are black girls cold right there's something different to say I'm gonna Center black girls in what other space do we unapologetically since are black girls and so Tech was just the icing on the cake for me but understanding that technology as an industry has always been here we're going back to the way we got our electricity right like these these inventions and how we plug up our phones and how we you know Iron our clothes and the way that you get stop lights all of that is technology but in this day and age I think technology um is Shifting us in a way that we can use it as a tool to change the way race and gender in class are experienced in our country so I think that that's to answer your questions Samantha to be the brave first person to go because now I'm going to tease Leah and Joanne um that is why uh I've chosen this work that is wonderful it's wonderful let's keep the conversation oh okay go sorry Joanne um hi everyone I'm so happy to be here thank you Samantha for this great introduction and thank you to the black girls coorganization for having us for the alumni Summit um so much of my career up to this point has been at the intersection of business technology and policy so I studied um international business at Howard University for undergrad and uh I'm very much and have always been very passionate about history culture and people and so as I approached my journey in studying business I didn't necessarily want to just go the corporate route but wanted to do something that had more meaning and impact in my daytoday work um so I did different opportunities Fellowship programs internship programs that allow me to explore those other areas like the ppia public policy and international Affairs fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University which was my first introduction to Tech policy and turned at the state department but ultimately I ended up going the corporate route and I started my career as a business consultant at IBM Global business services and at that time they were really building out the Watson division the Artificial Intelligence Division as a solution for IBM's other corporate clients and I joined that team and I began studying I was immediately so intrigued by Watson and by Ai and the potential that it had but because of the lens that I see through the world as a black woman in my my lived experience I had a lot of questions about what we were doing to make sure that we were centering different types of lived experiences different cultures my International my international business background tapped in there and I started asking those questions and I decided to go back to school I went to grad school at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy because I thought public policy might be a way that we can address some of these questions so a lot of what I did there centered on public policy and the question of how in a radical way in a disruptive way how can we think about Innovative Technologies and an opportunity to dismantle as opposed to perpetuate systematic oppression so how can we think about not just making things Equitable but tearing down historical barriers that have existed for different people currently I am back in the back in the private sector and really thinking about products so how do we really Center those experiences in the ways that different people from different communities different experiences engage with both hardware and software products that is wonderful wonderful all right and so as Patrice said she kicked it off so I'm ending it'll get the introduction but that is so appropriate because uh she mentioned definitely dived into Innovation and I work for IBM we're one of the most Innovative companies and Leah I did not realize you know also so this is this is really great I actually attended an HBCU I got my computer science degree from Mississippi Valley State University so my journey actually started I'd say pretty much College I actually my first semester I I chose accounting as my major but then with then after the first semester I switched to computer science so my journey has been long as in Tech I pretty much started with computer science and then I interned with IBM uh the summer before I graduated and I've been with IBM so I'm still with IBM and I know but with that I've been in so many different roles because it has afforded me the opportunity too I worked in Global Services which is Consulting now I started in Hardware in uh in Upstate New York so that's that was that that uh you know my initial introduction as a programmer and then a few years into that I wanted to also just maybe get a little bit closer to the customers just to see how the technology was working so I started or was able to do a shadow somewhat of a systems engineer at the time and that was a way of me being able to continue my technology uh you know uh expertise and experience along with working with clients and becoming clientfacing and so I've been in I've been project management product management technology manager just uh ran the gamut IBM also has supported me I eventually also got my Master's in software engineering and uh in my master certificate in project management so I continue to learn and that's one thing that I would love the um you know the black girls alumni to understand constant learning when we talk about Innovation you have to keep learning and seeing what's happening you know uh in the world and just just to finish up as far as where I'm working now it's a really cool initiative is within IBM called call for code and that is a way of I work with uh clients and then there are students involved where we invite developers and problem solvers at a global scale to work on Solutions somewhat in a hackathon fashion a competition but working on real world problems working on solutions to real world problems because we don't want to just identify problems we want to work on solutions to problems so uh so very glad to be here uh not I can't speak for IBM but uh very very much uh you know big big proponent and it there are a lot of opportunities and we have a lot of Technology AI as Leah mentioned so yes a lot of a lot of technology in order to uh to disrupt thank you Samantha just a shout out to IBM IBM's team is with our team in South Africa as we speak uh bringing back our South Africa chapter so we I appreciate IBM as well yes so we're here in the U.S doing this but we got a team in South Africa teaching about 55 girls in Johannesburg right now with IBM so we appreciate you yes yeah Yolanda raver and who's really really uh pulling that together so thank you I I saw the photos on social this morning they were beautiful I'm so excited for those students and their experience on to the next question thank you so much for telling us about yourselves and connecting these dots uh but we want to talk about the tech ecosystem as an interconnected and independent pipeline of entities such as K12 education postsecondary Tech Pathways the workforce and Entrepreneurship forward slash Venture Capital within your field in the tech ecosystem what does an inclusive and Equitable future look like to you what steps are you taking in your role career to build towards this vision and I want to start with Leah sure I'm happy to kick it off um what does an inclusive and Equitable Tech future look like for me um I think we are and people that I work with um are really working towards how do we mitigate proactively as opposed to reactively when it comes to building the technological future um in an inclusive way so how do we make sure that on the front end and as I'm sure many folks in this room know it is so much easier to build something proactively and address it as opposed to going back and fixing something particularly in the product space retroactively once it's already been done we know that you know Hardware product roadmaps for example can be five years six years or longer you know software is a little bit easier but when it when it comes to trying to address um ensuring that everyone has an inclusive experience we have to make sure we're asking the right questions and taking the extra time that it takes to address uh those those things in mind so how how are we thinking about all of the possible users who will come in contact with this product right how do how do people who are differently abled engage with products how do people with big hair wear VR glasses right how do we think about these things to make sure that everyone is having an inclusive and Equitable experience we know that also in the regulatory space we do anticipate that there will be some government regulation that will require big Tech to address these things but we know that that may be some time off and we can't wait we can't wait to start thinking about these things that has to be done now it's not an option so for me um thinking about how we build an inclusive text future and what that looks like we're addressing these things and thinking about and and doing our due diligence to address issues on the front end before they actually arise yes yes thank you let's move on to Dr Patrice I'm just soaking it all and I'm learning from Leah and Joanne on this call this is good I would I gotta concur with what Leah is saying and for me and I think for an organization like BGC it's it's building the space and the opportunity for those who have been historically distant disadvantaged or disenfranchised the space to build and to innovate because the way you think about the big hair or braids or the way you think about the lighting on our darker skin tones you have to have a person of color in the room and are we giving those are we giving people that look like a space to innovate and to create and so I think we have been ostracized from a lot of different Industries and I think we're in this intersection where technology really needs to consider how they support and invite black folks in right um so we think about we are the answer to our to our issues right like you think about the gentleman who created the cop stop app right so we know that technology can be a solution for social issues but the only way we do that is if we allow us to be the folks that are doing that and I think not only do we need to be supported with mentorship but we got to start give us the money can I just let out say I want all the money and shout out to the CEO Sophia because I always say to her just give me the money right I'm always asking for the money and I think it is true for uh black creators and black Founders and black folks who are being Innovative and creating apps and um experiencing technology in new ways they need the money and the resources to build we need the same resources good brother Mark Zuckerberg had I want the same resource okay um so I think that is how we become more inclusive we need the space to create and we need the money and the resources to create yes yes um last but not least let's move on keep the conversation going let's add some some more volume Joanne okay yeah and and pretty much uh Leah and Patrice had you know said it and described it the only additional thing that I can add is uh volunteerism and Patrice mentioned mentorship of course so and that is a big thing that I truly believe in and and I do and in order you for various organizations you have to be in the room you know as as Patrice mentioned that's got that's very key so we've got to be there um and I know it can be hard sometimes you know if you're the only one in the room but you you have to you have to continue um you know being a part of the back to my what I said earlier you got to be a part of the solution you know not just uh you know identifying problems so that's the only way is uh we just gotta make room find find the space find a chair you know some where in the room in whatever organization within your company wherever you can in order uh you know to to be included and to be insured to be sure that that we're all especially black women you know are are included can I make one addition before we move on to the next question of course thanks Samantha um so in terms of uh career opportunities and thinking about different ways to address this question so as you know Samantha teed up for this question in particular the the technological ecosystem is made up of many different components and so there are opportunities in all of those different areas whether it be the educational sector the nonprofit sector the entrepreneurial sector so think about which from which angle you would like to contribute and then also think about um going into the policy space so in order to make sure we're equally dividing those resources and making giving access to resources like Dr Patrice mentioned we have to make sure that we have the right folks in those in those policy rooms and in the in on the hill and in different governmental spaces to be the voice and to Advocate to make sure that our communities are represented and we're making sure that there's Equitable access for for example for computer science programs funding for computer science as programs in public school systems and historically marginalized communities access to different resources for entrepreneurs Etc yes yes so true let's keep the conversation going and let's talk about challenges and realities um let's delve into a little bit the current challenges and how we can disrupt these uh systems of Oppression so with this first question so the effects of tech Innovation are immeasurable it significantly impacts our democracy our economy our society yet not all communities are benefiting equally from this Innovation we recently saw during this pandemic which spotlighted the Stark economic health education inequities um you know virtual learning for instance we saw instances where some communities had to I don't know go to to local uh open areas just to find WiFi just to be able to be a part of the the shift in learning we saw that a lot of infrastructures and cities didn't have anything available to make sure that all the students could equitably access anything the tech whether it's technology whether the hardware at home to the broader technology that they needed to connect with um what does it look like to innovate with accessibility and equity in mind what steps can we take to intentionally Center historically disadvantaged communities and we're going to start off with with Dr Patrice Johnson on that one so I love this question and I think it it what Leah has led us to in her last response definitely talks about it and I love that response Leah um I would say what gives me Paul's um is the infrastructure even if you look at the last week Jackson ain't got no water here in Detroit we had power outage for about four days so how can we say that we can equitably allow people to engage in technology when our infrastructure we are still like living in 1945 in some of our community we I mean we talk about basic water right now we ain't even talking about we ain't even talking about WiFi can I get good water can I get lights right um so so that's what right now kind of gives me pause to to think that our infrastructure primarily in urban communities has not been addressed so we're you're right and say the pandemic just exposed to the larger Community these um grave disadvantages right where kids who who are in urban cores don't have iPads and laptops like when you go to for example in Detroit is West Bloomfield they already have MacBooks at home in fact their parents had to buy the MacBook for them to start the class right that was post that was prepandemic so we are already Gravely behind right so I I think my vision or what I would love to see is can we start utilizing technology to give give me the basic things right now I don't think Jack I don't think folks in Jackson Mississippi really care about me giving them an iPad so that they can they can code or they can hack they need water and that's what just gives me great pause because it's not just Jack said it was Flint 10 years ago I mean so I don't know if I can adequately answer that question Samantha because I think the way I feel if I'm being authentic right now is I'm angry that my folks ain't got basic stuff so how can we innovate when the best creators don't even have water right now and and I you're gonna have to tag Lee and Joanne I can't even answer that yeah points were made yeah well I I can jump in with with something that we're doing at least with an IBL uh for two weeks but it's so interesting it's following you because um I'm from Mississippi my family is in Jackson so definitely you know they've been um impacted you know by the water situation just as you know across the others are are impacted as well but one thing and I think I mentioned earlier that I'm working on a team called call for code and so it definitely it takes it's not not IBM alone it's partnership with other you know other companies everybody needs to to um jump in and work on Solutions but with our call for code that is the overall idea it's open source working on some open source Solutions and that's pulling in like I said experience uh you know technologists uh designers people from Global all over the world to work on some of those Solutions and ironically for this year that the thief is sustainability so that really you know dives into the uh you know the the water you know issues the disparities education gaps um I would say back to to answer I think at the top of the question uh Leah had already covered it too I mean it's going to take legislative changes you know policy changes to really make a difference but I will say I mean the technology is there just the base technology I mean you got the software you got the hardware but it just takes uh a lot of us it's going to take everyone uh to really I think impact you know the the main issue I'm I'm with you I I get very angry as well because it's like yes we're doing things and you know others are doing things but the problem's still you know still remain and you can't you just can't affect it for everyone all at the same time it's moving you know too slowly for sure um but um you know together we can start making some impacts Leo that's great I totally agree um I I've also been thinking a lot about about Jackson and and what I can do to play my role to support the communities there um and it it really just gets to the Maslow's hierarchy of needs right so if you're very foundational needs as an individual are not being met as a community are not being met how can you get to that point of living in this ideal state where you can be your most creative your most Innovative if you don't have the basic necessities for life so that is something that we definitely need to think about but I will also say the other side of that is when things like this have happened people have come up with creative ideas of how do we filter the water to you know make it drinkable and different technologies that have come about as a as a result of kind of these um very uh impactful and devastating scenarios so um you know I think we all are thinking through kind of what we can do to support and and and thinking through what new Innovations might different scenarios Spark I I would add if that's okay Samantha I would add that one of the beautiful components of the work that we're doing is when you get uh for summer camp for example 50 girls in a room and they have that space again to create and we had a hackathon this year too uh it's a beautiful it's a beautiful experience it's the impact is it will floor you right because all of a sudden uh black girls are forming their own Community uh they're centering themselves around joy and they're creating these amazing apps that are that can solve real issues right so so I would say um although and I love your theoretical component Leah with Maslow's hierarchy of me but I think um although it does look dire there there are moments of Hope right that we can hold on to and for me I can reflect on those girls being at camp and the smiles on their faces and the way that they light up when they figured out how to do some stuff that I can't do um our education team will see they try to teach us how to code this art last week and I and my I had a stick figure right where our girls were creating these beautiful art images and so um there there is space for us to Hope right but I think we've got to put some pressure on the entire ecosystem from the legislators to these big companies to say we got to do some Grassroots basic stuff yeah so very true I think you've kind of answered this but we did have a question from the audience uh as someone who was breaking through barriers that's why it is so hard to get into the sector how does one find a breakthrough I think that this is going towards a breakthrough into career opportunities I believe that's what this is speaking towards I'll answer it from that lens um for me and it is not easy we know that things can often be more difficult for people who look like us even when we have the same credentials um my strategy I'll speak to my personal experience and my personal strategy my personal experience I've really honed in on something actually that Joanne mentioned earlier was being a constant learner how can I make sure that I am continuing to increase my heart skills my soft skills right so hard skills for this for this particular group would be things like making sure you're learning new coding languages if you can continuing to you know improve your skills those technical skills are so valuable in the industry maybe it's studying project management getting a project management certification um thinking and studying usercentered design user experiences design thinking those types of Prudential soft skills like public speaking um writing different things of relationship building um also networking and mentoring when we talked about mentoring earlier networking and building mutually beneficial relationships making sure that you're building relationships that aren't just meant to be transactional and seeking to get something out of it but also what can you give to the relationship how can it be something that's long term where you can support one another whether that's up here or maybe that's someone who is more experienced than you or has more knowledge so for me those have been ways that I have uh tried to continue to build on my resume but also open different doors to Opportunities and break down some of those barriers anyone would like to add well I think Leah has covered it but I mean Network attending events like this uh you know networking uh it's it's it's all about continuous learning you know as Leah um mentioned as well uh that's the way to if you're talking about breaking into different Industries or just breaking into anything Tech I will say I mean technology it runs the gamut so I mean whether it's in education uh you know it's in healthcare I mean government it's technology is everywhere so it's not really essentially breaking into technology but you do have to learn you know certain skills if it takes uh back to being you know data scientists you know python or R learning things like that um so that you just have to start you got Network you got to reach out uh use all the you know all the social media you know connections that that you can and just show up you know at events um and just ask for help and and you know it can happen thank you and also join those digital communities whether they're on Facebook or elsewhere um there are a lot of opportunities that are presented there are a lot of people that are willing to crowd uh Source resources answer your questions to support you in any way I know I've been an online uh communities like sister Circle black women in Tech where someone says I've just lost my job or I'm having this issue or I'm navigating this difficult conversation with my boss and folks are happily are willing to share their their expertise their experiences their connections so I think being in community can be a major way in which we break through these barriers let's keep it going um next question a reality of tech is that it can be used for good or bad we've seen Tech amplify social justice movements and help us utilize our Collective agency via social media we've also seen how racial and algorithmic biases in Tech can have negatively impacted specific communities via surveillance so surveillance or facial recognition software and even in in ways we're employed as we work toward Innovation how can future innovators intentionally keep the moral and ethical consequences of tech at the Forefront of their work whether it's government regulation or accountability policies let's start with you Joanne okay not to sound like a repeat record this is your broken record but I think Leah covered it you know already and we've talked about it it's essentially you you have to be in the room you need to be part of you know part of the solution uh put I would say one key thing is um taking the initiative to understand uh kind of see through the lens of those in disadvantaged areas or economically disadvantaged that that is going to be key in order to really make a difference and understand how to utilize the technology so technology can you know as as you say it can be it could be used for good for bad but it could be it's used for good mostly so but awareness is very key about like what is it really doing what what are the intended you know outcome and I know especially when you start talking about you know AI you know artificial intelligence I think that gets some people a real you know a little bit of free because it's like okay the you know robots are going to take over or whatever but you know behind those computers behind the robots they're humans so that's why it's very important that you have a diverse uh you know set of people in the room that's working on Solutions so if there's an opportunity for you to be a product manager you know that is very very key because you can really provide a lot of input in how that product is going to you know be developed and how it will eventually uh you know be deployed so so I would say that's key uh we do of course need more you know diverse uh people at the top because those are the ones that are making the decisions uh but so just continue back once again back to learning you know figuring out you know the various angles uh where you can can be in the room or you know at the table table even if you're not at the table you know once again just somewhere but making a contribution uh you know to the solution that I think that would that would be that's one of the key things that I think what what Joanne just said is so powerful because she gave us I will say this what we've seen with technology over the last 10 years um the ability to utilize social media as a form of activism right I believe I believe that a couple days after George Floyd was murdered it was like eight million tweets that use the hashtag black lives matter right so to be able to utilize social media in a way that can Galvanize folks and build a communication system across the globe right is immensely powerful I mean you think if they would have had that in in 68 right uh I think my My Hope has been how do you take that massive engagement and shift it from uh the social space to actual uh material change and I think what Joanne just said is exactly that I think she's saying for us to really utilize technology as a solution to some of the social experiences that we have how do we put our folks in a position like a product manager that could tell Apple don't you put out that phone and you know good and well the facial recognition is biased right it does not adequately see my skin tone and or um you have these new vehicles that are supposed to be selfdriving and you hitting black folks right because you don't recognize us um and I'm smiling but it's also it's it's not it's you know um so I love the fact that connecting both what Leah and Joanna is saying they are really diving on to Solutions right which which I adore um so how do we move from that matter massive way we can benefit from technology in the social space and engaging socially to the material change the material change and using technology as a solution for an app like cop stop or you know identifying as Leah said proactively the ways Tech can potentially be biased but solving those problems by having the right people in the spaces to make those decisions I totally agree I was going to mention product management I'm so glad that both of you already brought it up um I think particularly in this room that is specially curated for black women and girls it's important that we think about these types of careers where yes we are underrepresented however we bring a unique lens and unique experience to these types of roles right for a product manager or a technical program manager for example so in these types of positions you have a significant level of influence over the entire product development process from start to finish right you have the skill set to be able to understand and speak the language of the engineers and the technical folks working on the product while also translating for the people in the business who are driving um towards the you know the the business goals right and and you're the person who bridges that Gap and makes sure that along the way the right questions are being asked you know you're considering for all of the different factors that need to come into account and as black women we have a unique land through which we look at the world right and so and and you know we have that in common but we also have unique experiences right so what are your unique experiences that allow you to think about um how different people might engage with a product and ensuring that you you can be a voice in the room that say we need to diversify the the the data set and make sure we're including more users who of of X background right and making sure that all of that is considered along the way so definitely do consider um careers and in either you know technical program management or product management because as having that black girls cold technical Foundation is a great differentiator um even if you don't desire to be an engineer there are other opportunities and and um career paths that will allow you to still utilize that skill set and and uh you know kind of different differentiate you um amongst the the applicant pool for such roles yes yes um also if if anyone's interested in kind of learning more about this topic I'm in the middle of reading uh race after technology by ruha Benjamin um where they discussed abolitionist tools for the new gym code um and it goes into historical context current realities and future outlook um there's a lot of really good information in there that we can kind of equip ourselves to come to these tables and talk about these things utilizing broader data research and and just knowing the language to use as we discuss these things because these are ageold issues um that are now connected to farreaching Technologies so there's there's a lot of work to be done and I think all of us equipping ourselves being aware and not being afraid to adjust these Topics in any place in which we hold any amount of power or influence is important uh in the name of the book again because someone just asked is race after technology by ruha ruha treatment all right so let's keep the conversation moving let's talk about the progress and call to action circling back on your journey how have you seen progress in your sector what legacies Will Young innovators be building on and let's start with Leo sure um I think when I think about the Legacy um we've already touched on the fact that none of this is new our ancestors were extremely Innovative and creative people and we are products of their genius and keeping that in mind is one of the things that keeps me going um there's a a concept African concept of Sankofa you know understanding the past so that you can best forward and and drive towards the future um knowing our history and the shoulders upon which we stand uh is really important and also it keeps it keeps me going because this work is hard right if you choose to actually take a stand and be a person who wants to speak up and be that Agent of Change it can be challenging so along the way it's really important that we take care of ourselves right make sure that we're pouring into ourselves and that if we're not you know prioritizing our our Wellness physically mentally emotionally spiritually we can't do this work and so I really try to hone in on that um folks like Dr Benjamin who Samantha mentioned um there are just so many folks who are continuing to drive this work forward continue to study and read those books and think about um Dr Charlton McGowan has a book who talks about the black history and Technology you have to forgive me because I don't remember the name of the book but if you look up Dr Charles Charlton mcgillin it will come up um but just keep that in mind and that and that's something that keeps me grounded and keeps me going along this journey so that Legacy is very much important I think uh for me looking at the progress in the sector and what legacies we think young people will build on I go back to my experience with the girls over this summer we had technically six summer camps that uh I jokingly tell the team we were in it we don't know what happened with the rest of the world for those five camps five six camps but I will tell you um uh even though we might have been physically tired we were emotionally full because we we could see firsthand after not having inperson camps for two years or so because of covet you can see the way when a young lady gets it right when she's figured it out when she is able to um create something uh I mean we had girls at the Atlanta Camp during lunch time doing races with each other so I would say when we talk about their ability to innovate and the Legacy the legacy is um really about whole person development it is not only about the technology it is also about experiencing Joy it is about their leadership Journey right it is about community and then lastly as we like to say is also about economic Mobility right and and changing our material reality so for me that's what I see as the legacy of us continuing to encourage the girls that are on this call watching this session the uh you know five thousand ten thousand girls that will reach in a year those girls being able to form Community where they feel safe to create to experience their joy and and to to have the life that they want to live and and I'll just finish up uh Leah and Patrice you know have pretty much covered it as well um once again you know continuous learning I I would say the um the Advent of of there are so many ways of getting um getting upskilled getting educated you know getting a certifications getting badges just learning there's you know I don't want to advertise for different companies but you know like Coursera courses seeing a lot of precourses just a lot of online courses IBM by the way actually has a lot has a platform as well where continuous learning so definitely take advantage of all of those you know opportunities I think that is something that has progressed you know especially during my career I mean just so easy to to learn I mean we have a lot of internal learning but you know there are there are multiple uh external uh vehicles to learn from so I would say just incur urge just to continue uh continuous learning because that is going to to be key uh to the Future for the future innovators um the other thing is um wherever you are if there I mean if you are working or you know when you do start working uh there are various groups I think Leah touched on some there are different groups within companies you know the Affinity groups or the uh business resource groups uh that is very very key uh that wasn't available many many years ago so utilize those um you know vehicles uh you know to continue to innovate and learn as well I think that's that's the only additional uh thing I can can say I'll just add one last thing in terms of progress I do think that we have made tremendous progress even this is a very nascent space still when you think about inclusive technology or Equitable technology and conversations and resources around this um and so I think that there is tremendous opportunity to continue building and only amplify uh the work that has already been done so if I do want I did want to just circle back and acknowledge that I do think that um particularly in the last Maybe five or ten years there's been a lot of evolution growth and progress um and you know as Joanne mentioned that continuous learning allows you to kind of stay abreast and on the front curve of this ever evolving uh still growing and nascent uh space that we're in yeah I would agree with that yeah because technology as they say you know it doesn't stand still you know so it's continuing continuing to evolve yes I'd have to agree I would think what what's so beautiful is when you see just folks finding each other because they've been able to use different technology different platforms social media to find corners of the internet with people that they can relate to on multiple levels and start building together so in the way that um these inequalities the systemic issues exist you see so many individuals or even smaller Collective groups having even greater impact for their communities because they can leverage these Technologies they can leverage these tools they can selfeducate they can mobilize they can immediately respond they can get to the heart of these issues and have the conversation you don't need to feel alone you don't need to wonder if you're the only one thinking or wanting or creating you can find someone to create with across the street or across the world and as many issues as there are in this world there's individual Minds with a willingness to try to tackle them and no matter how niched or or how broad that is so like as we talk about progress and call to action a big part of what we're seeing now and what we saw during the pandemic and we when we saw we've seen in recent social justice movements as people being able to selfidentify uh mobilize and do the work wherever they are and that makes it more inclusive that makes it um uh more fast acting and that is something that I think will continue to be a powerful tool for further Generations even as you get into the metaverse even even as you think about how you're going to operationalize Future technology so get taking your seat at whatever table you can create not necessarily always having to um try to fight for a seat at someone else's table so so let's keep the conversation going what opportunities roles exist that uh to affect change in the tech space What should Young stemmists be doing now to build their way towards these impactful roles and what resources have been helpful in your journey yeah I'll jump in um I think we've touched touched a lot of different um areas of opportunity in the space whether that be in the private sector um in product technical program management project management um a user user experience design um engineering there there are so many um ways to address it in the private sector in the public sector there are opportunities at all level of government whether that and I know I mentioned the hill earlier but I will be remiss not to mention the importance of state and local government as well in ensuring access and advocacy um and access to resources for marginalized communities um there the the opportunities are are endless so it's really a matter of carving out the space and and figuring out what area you want to tackle and and also recognizing that you can change so I have done so many different things over the course of my relatively short career already because I've been trying to figure out and act that question of which way is the best path to address these very critical questions is it through the government is it through uh policy in the nonprofit sector is it actually being at the at the table or trying to pull up my own chair at the table in the private sector and in big Tech um so you know think about what what you might want to uh do and that uh breadth of experience also is very much a selling point when you come into any of those spaces being able to say well I've thought about it from this angle and I have experience that I can bring to the table from each of those different areas that's really important and that continuous Learning Journey definitely helps along the way with that yeah and and that very well said Leah and and I'll just add because I know we talked about you know product management project but any of those areas you know should be a focused data analyst just wherever you feel comfortable comfortable um and then from an industry uh as Leah I mean with the even though I've been with IBM but within there I've had uh opportunity to be exposed to various Industries within IBM so you know government Healthcare one of my favorites and you know Healthcare there are so many changes are so there are plenty of opportunity for some Innovation there uh with regard to health care just as with others but government insurance uh banking I mean there are the lots of of Industries in which you can apply you know those skills so I would say definitely just you know pick up the the key skills I mean uh Leah had started off earlier saying you know so you got the hard skills but you know the soft skills talk with get get an opportunity or learn to to work with with clients and partners and you know just it even within your community as I mentioned very big on volunteering so that is a way to get involved with your schools I mean that definitely they would really love you to go in and just talk you can learn a lot from the kids and from the teachers find out what they need help with as well so just just pick up the hard skills and you know definitely focus on the the soft skills and and you'll you'll be fine and I I would say to wrap it up um BGC alumni our alumni uh you got a portal that we have launched that will have tons of resources for you to dive into you have a team dedicated to servicing you and helping you identify uh any of the tools that you might need and so I would just say a action item for you is to stay connected to BGC as a community that wants you to do well and wants you to reach
