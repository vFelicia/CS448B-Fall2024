okay if you want to be an artist just trust me on this you have what it takes to pursue the art medium the art style that you want to pursue there's going to be people where you think oh they do it just like me so why would I need to do but there's only one you no one has your style the way you do things no one has your story where you come from what brought you to where you are in life and no one has your sphere of influence the people that you're surrounded by in your community who would never know your work if you didn't share it so whatever you think oh I don't have what it takes and other people are doing it better just remember those are three things that you have that no one else does
