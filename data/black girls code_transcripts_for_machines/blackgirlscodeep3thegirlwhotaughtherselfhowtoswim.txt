we love black girls so 4 years old I wanted to learn how to swim I beg my parents parents please let me take some lessons let me do it he said no you're too little you're too young way to older so then one day my little cousin who was three at the time fell into the pool at the other side and not even thinking I jumped into the water doggy pedal my little way over to her heard my aunt screaming and wailing in the background and I pulled her to the side of the pool so from that moment I became known to my family as the girl who taught herself how to swim and I used use that story because it's parallel to my career because each step that I've taken I've either been the only black person the only woman and and in this case um I am a black woman that works in Tech here in San Francisco right now in the Silicon Valley in the tech industry you only have 5% of people of color who are founders and in many companies that are popular Facebook to Google to LinkedIn you only have one % who are uh people of color that work in Tech so that's one sense of urgency you have these fields where there is a great NE need for employment um but yet we don't have enough people who know how to do the job I believe that if you Empower a girl you have the potential to change her community and to change her future and when you teach her the skills and you give her the tools and the technology to share that story you have the opportunity to change the world today we built our Lego robot called Bella but my team called it Isabella and we learned how to use the computer to program it and um show it what ways to go like what direction and it always say it says stuff like it says hooray hooray thank you and goodbye um I liked how we got to um work on computers and we got to actually build the robot it's pretty awesome and it can roar and S in terms of women of color and Engineering I think that strides have been made but there's still this enormous Gap in terms of having women and especially women of color in the field of engineering and I say Engineering in general because there are inner like subcategories of engineering but across the board there are few women of color in positions of authority in in the field in general my name is ALU I'm doing a PhD here in computer science and education with Alice's group and I'm almost done with my PhD to Summers AG go thank to Summers AG go I taught a middle school computer science class at Stanford University for Middle School Earth and in that class we actually had the students on a whim design robotics excellent so it's the same exact you see it's the same exact similar similar robot that you're using in here so you guys have actually learned some of the things that we take to build as an aspect of this and I hope is that as you guys have handson Project work that black do code is creating for you you get a more intuitive sense of what you can actually do with computation I think for the first time these girls are began to see that oh I can do this too I think that's literally what it is like oh there's a space for me here and oh I can actually do this and this is fun I want to do this to me I think that's probably the core of black girl good and I think more importantly not just the girls the parents the parents are beginning to understand that this is important that their daughters love it and they want to empower their daughters to be ready for the 21st century so I really think it's more evangelizing to the parents because children don't have any limitations in them they don't know any better they just want to do whatever they have no sense of limitation it is the parents the adults in their lives that have those kinds of limitations or they haven't seen those images um the presence of having women of color is so important because I think that it would encourage more um children both male and female of children of color to see someone that looks like them to see somebody that they can strive to be like because it it helps to have somebody to look up to have somebody to say hey I could be like that person black girls code gives girls the opportunity to own their story to own their Brilliance and then share it with their communities with their families and then hopefully with the world if they so decide to take u a career path in technology in the future I hope that there is no need for a black girls code because I hope that black black girls will be dominating these Tech spaces that there no longer will be a need to create a safe space because we're already there that enough of us have already showed up that when girls come behind us they feel comfortable they see a mirror to themselves and they know that this is something that they can do
