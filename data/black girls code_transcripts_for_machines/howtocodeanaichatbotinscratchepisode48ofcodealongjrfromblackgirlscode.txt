what's up future programmers I'm kaani and I'm your host for COD along scratch is a platform made for kids that allows you to build games animations and interactive stories without needing to write complex code woo but today it's all about AI we're going to make our very own chat bot using scratch and when we're finished you have a cool new buddy to talk to are you ready get started let's go go to scratch.mit.edu if you don't have one already create an account so that we can save and share our projects now I'm going to create a new project you can do this by clicking on file then new before we start let's use our imagination imagine your chatbot is a character is it a funny robot a wise robot or a weird alien from outer space giving our robot a character or personality will help make our chatot experience even more fun are you ready to make a super cool AI robot as I build my robot you can build an identical one or let your imagination run wild and build your own if you need a refresher on how to navigate scratch go check my intro to scratch video to learn all about how to use the basic scratch blocks all right time to get coding first off look at that scratch cat on your screen that's your Sprite or your little robot buddy if you're thinking of getting a different robot friend just click on this cat or Sprite icon in the bottom right corner and select a new Sprite I'm going to choose this robot I'm going to delete delete the cap for now and leave the robot once you've got your Sprite it's time to give it a stage to stand on click on the mountain icon to pick any backdrop you like I'm going to choose this awesome spaceship now for the fun part make sure to click on your Sprite so that it's glowing blue to create my robot I need to create its brain to store and answer questions then I need to teach the robot what questions to check for and finally I need to teach it how to respond to start I'll head over to the events category and pull in the when green flag click block to keep our chat going use a forever loop from the control category inside that Loop let's place an Ask block from the sensing section and type in say something or ask me a question our robot has to remember stuff right so let's create its break bra is anyone else starting to feel like a mad scientist head to the variable section and click make a variable create one named found and another called prompt location these variables will let me know if I found the answer and the location of the answer to the question next create two more variables called prompts for questions and resp responses for the robot's answers before we get into the heavy coding let's set some things up I want the robot to ask say something or ask me a question to start if the robot does not find the answer to the question then I'm going to set the found variable to false then change the prompt location variable to one because we're going to add a new question now let's go on a little robot search mission take a repeat loop from the control Tab and set it to go through the length of the prompts list control blocks tell the other blocks what to do and when to make a choice inside this Loop you can use an if else block combined with the contains option from the operator tab to check if our robot already knows the answer operator blocks are like many puzzle solvers on your project they help Sprites figure things out make choices and create surprises but what if our robot only kind of knows the answer but not exactly it's teaching time inside the loop you can use the if not and contains block to make it check if our robot doesn't know the exact wording of the question use the add to blocks to teach it when our robot does know the answer let's have it shouted out loud to to do this we'll use the say block from looks next we'll change the found variable to true then I want to search each item in the prompt list and return the response that matches my question all right let's tell the robot to grab the answer and say it out loud just in case our robot doesn't recognize the question let's teach it to move on to the next item use the change by one block for this the change by one block will add a new space for the question you want the robot to learn what if our robot finishes its list and still looks confused well we need to teach it more let's ask our user sorry I don't know that what should I say next time then we'll save that answer so our robot knows what to say in the future let's review to be sure you understand what each chunk of code is doing in this section we had the robot ask us for a prompt then wait for our response in the next section we had the robot search our list of prompts to see if what we asked was already already in its list of prompts and if it was then the robot will give us a response or answer in the last section we had the robot do add new prompts to its list that it did not know then asked us what the answer or response should be to the new prompt wo that was a lot of code for our robot now that we truly understand our code Let's test this out I want to clean up the screen a little bit by hiding the prompt and responses variables by right clicking on them then selecting hide everybody come on that looks so much better everybody come on everybody mbody come onbody and there you go you've just built a smart AI robot the coolest part the more you chat with it the smarter it becomes if you want a closer look at my code be sure to click the project link below let's make sure to save all of our hard work give your project the title then click save now in the top right hand corner or go to file and select save now if you want to share your robot with friends for them to test it out then click the share button have fun chatting with your new robot buddy and keep coding
