my name is isis miller and i am the community and events manager for black girls code it is my absolute pleasure to host this conversation about the power of imagination and the magic of stem with the filmmakers behind jingle jangle a christmas journey the new holiday film from netflix david i'm going to start with you can you talk to us about how the idea for jingle jangle came to life when did your vision first appear 22 years ago uh started writing this and um because i grew up on all of the uh um big holi big holiday classics big fantasy classics and uh and i was getting um i didn't want to grow up really i wanted to stay because who wants to grow up what is there that right so i invented this guy right here that was the first that was the first one in buddy uh buddy 3000 and um and then it kind of evolved we kept we were going to do it as a broadway musical and then when our son was born then when our son was born elias i started seeing life through the eyes of a child again and it awakened my inner child and my wonder and my imagination and and everything was just like a burst of of of everything and that's when i said it was time to to really bring this to light and lim said why don't we do it as a movie instead of uh play and i went to netflix and told them and here we are lynn you're the producer and you supervise every detail of jingle jangle can you tell us what were the most challenging and how you basically coded the impossible to ensure that these things came to life um i would say that the most challenging was kind of keeping myself together because you know i always felt like you know we'll figure it out we can figure it out and you push through to figure out but it's how are you moving through it you know it can be very stressful it's a lot of responsibility and you want to make sure that you get it right and that's what matters you know there was nothing about this that was easy at all but it was rewarding and it was fulfilling and that's what mattered so that code that whole formula of square root of possible that was my mantra throughout and that is what i was using all along to push through all of the barriers to get to where we are now brad let's talk visual effects i heard you actually brought a clip for us to kind of demonstrate how you brought these things to life i i did so what you're seeing is uh don juan coming to life and there are little pictures in picture there and you can see that the animation team is um actually referencing the movements that they're going to do for don juan so through a series of tools and techniques that incorporate lots of science and technology and engineering and coding um we're able to translate the movements of the animators moving to making don juan dance if you guys ever need like another dancing model i've got some sweet moves for you so i'm just gonna volunteer that lin you really created an entire world out of out of your imagination and that's exactly what we tell our girls all the time is that they literally can create their own worlds and today we have our girls in the room our black girls code ambassadors and they have some questions for y'all is there a character in jingle jingle that you most relate to or learn something from i would say journey because she's like i'm gonna make it happen come hella high water i'm gonna push through and i'm gonna have a great attitude about it you know i'm gonna come out with a smile i'm gonna put my heart you know on my sleeve and if i get hurt it's okay but i i'm gonna keep going we happened to notice that there was a wakanda sticker on jeronicus's luggage it was so cool to see that tribute and shout out to black panther are there any other hidden gems that we might have missed maybe buddy's made out of vibranium i don't know maybe that's what's helpful but another easter egg is on the buddy buddy 3000 around his eyes my son's name elias around his eyes it says elias 260. and elias is my son's name our son's name and 260 is the address of my greatgrandmother so i wanted to have this this connection of this magic flowing the real life magic of me flowing through the magic of buddy how would you tell young creators to continue to follow their imagination while working well i think the important thing is is to follow your imagination and not give up i i'd say one of the one of the big things that keeps any of us from uh realizing our dreams is giving up before we start um things can seem impossible like they did for journey but she figured things out right and i think we can all do that too so i think it's so easy to um to just feel like second guess yourself and feel like you know what i don't know enough yet or i'm not good enough to do this or i don't have the resources to do this well if you do a little bit of digging um you might be able to find the resources and you might be able to begin that journey of creating whatever it is that you're imagining talk about imagination oh my gosh i went and showed uh a early little sketch of buddy to my son and he went back and and came back and showed me this this was his drawing of the buddy 3 000. oh my gosh the original the original original buddy nobody yeah yeah the blueprint for buddy yeah yeah so you know it's just that's the beauty of imagination and for me to be able to lend it out to be able to work on this film when our son was five when we started and just awaken his imagination and if your imagination is is being sparked at this age my god uh my god world look out exactly right so thank you for taking something from your imagination from 20 plus years ago and bringing it to life exactly when the world needed it most of course be sure to watch jingle jangle a christmas journey on netflix if you haven't already and have a safe healthy magical holiday season we're gonna wave by to our audience thank you guys so much for being here today
