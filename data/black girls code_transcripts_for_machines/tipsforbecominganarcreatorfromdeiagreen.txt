for those that want to know how to become an AR creator I would recommend to play around with lens Studio which is Snapchat's AR platform effects house which is tick tocks AR platform or spark AR which is metas AR platform and then once you get good footing in those programs there's also actual Creator programs that you can join with those companies you don't need to know how to code to be in Tech there's other careers that you can do within the technology Fields there's ux designer like myself where I just design there's also a UI which is user interface there's visual designers and then on on the more data side there's data analytics there's data science you can even be an accountant you can do anything in in Tech
