well good afternoon everyone and thank you so much for being here my name is isis miller and i'm the community and events manager for black girls code it's obviously my absolute pleasure to be hosting this intimate conversation with the dynamic cast of a babysitter's guide to monster hunting at black girls code we know just how important representation is for young women especially girls of color so we of course were thrilled to see a cast of brilliant brave funny diverse characters that our girls could look up to so i'm gonna jump right into it today i am joined by the stars of the film tamara smart luna lawrence troy leanne johnson and lynne masaka chang what were some of the underlying themes that you sort of hoped would resonate with the kids who would be watching the film and una i'll let you start with that one i mean one of the big ones is owning your unique skills and talents and um just be being unabashedly yourself um i think you can see that in kelly's arc um she's accepts herself by like truly accepts herself by the end of the movie and i think just also like the power of young people like the babysitters are able to protect their charges and fight against evil monsters and keep the secret society like under wraps completely like and only teenagers and i think that's just so cool and that's exactly what we need in this world today actually speaking of bad guys and monster hunting how do you slay the villains and monsters in your own life like selfdoubt or insecurity or having someone underestimate you because you're a kid or because of your your girl or because you are black or brown like how do you defeat those monsters in your life i think it can be really really hard especially we all sort of started in this industry really really young so we sort of went through those teenage years and they're still going through them where we're constantly changing and finding out what we believe in and i think it can become really hectic when you also have those voices in your head telling you that you're not good enough if you know what you love which is acting you can sort of replace all of those thoughts with the positive ones of you know being your own you know creative person and working on new projects and having a social media account can also help you know highlight things that you believe in things like the black lives matter movement you can you know teach other people how to educate themselves absolutely i'm going to start with one of our ambassadors and if is going to ask you all a question who are some other people whose work you admire or who have inspired you i mean for me my sole inspiration is mindy kaling she's brought so much poc representation on screen to hollywood to comedy she showed me that there's it's possible for asian people people of color to be portrayed on screen without it being a stereotyper so i think that was really inspiring to kind of see that and to see myself represented on screen i absolutely love issa rae um i think that she's someone else who brings a lot of representation into this industry she just does it all and she's so talented and i fell in love with her series awkward black girl because it's like i am an awkward black girl and i'd never seen like someone who looks like me represented in a way that i could relate to that much so i just love her so so much fame oh my gosh i'm such an issa stan awkward black girl i was like oh my god it's me shout out for all the awkward black girls so next i'm going to call samaya one of our favorite bgc ambassadors uh samaya go ahead with your question so i noticed that all of the babysitters were skilled in stem but i also saw there are a lot of like the performing arts incorporated and i think it really just shows that arts feel creativity like everything we do from monster printing to any other daily task so what i feel is the importance of incorporating art in stem i mean the arts requires so much imagination and creativity and so does stem i mean like all the technology that you see coming out requires you literally thinking of something that hasn't been done before and um so i think you can't really separate the two doing anything involving stem just takes so much creativity like when you think of the people who invented like instagram or like invented netflix it's like yes that took having skills in stem and it took having a lot of creativity and being able to use your imagination and it's kind of like what i said earlier like we wouldn't even have the film industry i don't think if it weren't for mixing art and creativity and stem we know that at bgc we we want our girls to be wellrounded so while stem is important we can't forget the a and we can't forget the arts and i know that samaya especially as an don't you do acting as well samaya acting singing and dancing so we seeing these ladies very soon on the silver screen elizabeth has a question alyssa go ahead um my question is even though you are a celebrity and you have many responsibilities do you still get the opportunity to just be a kid and have fun yeah of course there are many you know responsibilities and things to do on set but i can tell you when we weren't on set we were causing some mischief weren't we girls um we were definitely we definitely got a chance to be kids and run around and you know sort of you know be immature but in the best way when you aren't acting and when we aren't you know doing all the serious stuff we're just running around and having fun so my question is if you weren't an actor what would you want to be i love talking so i think i would want to be like a public speaker of some kind or a journalist because i love writing so probably those two kamara you want to go ahead and ask your question what advice do you have for kids that are worried about being bullied or teased for being smart or different being different is being special try and keep away from the negative people and try and keep positive thoughts and yeah always keep that uniqueness in you don't change for other people don't let like some negative lost person take away from you like what makes you special i think the main thing is to just remember to stay true to yourself and that other people's negative thoughts don't matter because you're amazing and you're unique and you're beautiful and if you just remember that everything's going to be fine thank you ladies so so much for answering our questions and hanging out with us today and just being your really cool beautiful selves girls if we could just give away to the to everyone in the cast and say thanks bye everyone thank you so much
