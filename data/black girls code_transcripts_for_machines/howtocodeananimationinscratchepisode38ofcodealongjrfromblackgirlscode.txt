hi I'm kaani and I'm your host for COD along we're back with episode three of our series do you love art and all things animation I know I do are you ready to see your name come alive on the screen well today we'll be making each letter of our name dance around as if they've got a mind of their own I'll be animating my name kaani and by the end of this video you'll know how to animate ready let's do this go to scratch.mit.edu remember to log in now we're ready to create a new project open scratch and click file then new then we need to delete the cat Sprite since all of our Sprites for this project will be the letters of our name sorry cat click on the X in the circle above the cat to remove it next we need to make our project look a bit more interesting we need to choose a backdrop click on the backdrop icon in the bottom right corner I'm going to choose a colorful City you can make your backdrop whatever you want it to be now we can finally start adding the letters of our name to do this click on the choose a sprite from library button below the stage area I'm going to choose letters and choosing the first letter in my name k repeat the step for each letter in your name now I'm going to add blocks of code to each letter to animate them and make it fun for the letter K I think it would be really awesome if it could turn and circles again and again have a weird whirl effect let's click on the first letter and add an event block event blocks tell scratch when to start running the program by setting a triggering moment from the blocks palette go to events drag and drop the one green flag click block to the scripts area I'll add the turn right 15Â° block under the wind green flag click block turn blocks change the spites direction by a certain degree there are two turn blocks turn right and turn left let's also add a change color effect by 10 block under the first block then change the effect from color to wh if you keep clicking the green flag the letter will keep turning and transforming so I'm going to make it turn on its own add a repeat block from the control tab then put it around the chain and turn blocks add a weit point1 seconds block above the change and turn blocks the weight block will control the speed of the turns I want the block to repeat a 100 times then clear graphic effects in scratch you can also make Sprites communicate when a message is broadcasted by one Sprite then the other Sprite or Sprites can receive the broadcasted message and perform a set of actions I'm also going to add a when the Sprite clicked and broadcast message and weight blocks to the scripts area you can add a special message to the broadcast block click on the message and then create new message I'm going to call it start letter A1 next I'm ready to program the letter A I want my letter A to kind of look like it's bouncing or gliding up and down when it receives a message from K I also want a to activate or tag the letter L which will then activate or tag the second letter a and so forth for the rest of my name it'll be like a chain of animations K tags a then a starts L then L starts the second a then n then I you get it to code this I'll click on the letter A in the Sprite pane then drag and drop when I receive my my message to the script area click on the message and a dropdown menu will show then select start letter A1 now let's make the first a move to make our Sprites or letters move we'll always go to the Motions tab on the Block palette we can use motion blocks to make our Sprite move turn Glide and change directions since I want my letter A to Glide I'll drag and drop two Glide 1 seconds to X and Y and place them under under the first block I'm going to drag the a to the bottom of the stage then change the X and Y coordinance in the top block to match the ones in the Sprite pane I want the a to move up and down 20 times so I'm going to wrap it in a repeat 20 times block okay now for the Finishing Touch getting letter A to start the animation for letter f this means just like we did for letter K to letter A I also need to add broadcast blocks that lets letter a talk to letter L to do this I'll drag and drop the when the Sprite click block to letter A in the Sprite Pane and change the message to start letter L then I'm going to drag and drop the when I received message block to the letter L below change the message to start letter L click the green flag and click letter K the letter K should whirl around like in a blender and when you click k a should move up and down 20 times now I need to think of what action or animation I want to add to the letter s L I think I want the letter L to change colors and say L is For Love in L drag the when I received message block to the script area and change the message to start letter L in the control tab I'm going to add repeat five under the first block then drag and drop wait 3 seconds inside the repeat block so I can slow the speed of that Loop now I want to add change color effect by 25 then add the say hello for 2 seconds block change hello to L is For Love Now test out L by clicking the first a that's cool but I want the L to do more than change colors I want to change the backdrop click on the backdrop icon in the bottom right corner and select five different backdrops when we click a l will change colors and the backdrops will change for the second a in my name I want to take it a step further and add sound I want a to turn into a mosaic while playing a sound but first I want the letter L to talk to or activate the second a so I'll have to add a broadcast block to the end of L so let's click on the letter L and then add a broadcast message and weight block below the first block now create a new message to start letter A2 now that the second a is ready to automatically play let's add some sound on a I'm going to add a repeat 10 block because I want my sound to play over and over again next I'll drag in the start sound block found in the sounds tab to change or add a new sound to the block click the sound tab at the top of the screen go to the bottom of the page and click on the sound icon hover over the play icon to preview the sound choose a sound and it'll be added it's your sound block I want to choose the sound low gliss tbla Let's test it wait that sounds weird I'm going to add a weight 1 second block to slow down the tempo so it sounds more normal now I want to add the Mosaic effect I'm going to go to the looks Tab and select the change color effect by 25 and change it to Mosaic at the end of this code I want to add the clear graphic effects block so that the letter A doesn't stay a mosaic forever I do want it to go back to looking like a normal letter A let's test it now click the first a both l and a will start okay now we can add the finishing touches to the last two letters of my name n and I I want n to disappear and reappear 10 times then go back to normal add the following code inside n I want the I to go to 10 random places on the stage then add the following code inside I okay we're done now I want to test out all the letters of my name to make sure it works just how I like it thank you for coding along with me but remember for your project you can give the animations any style you want get creative and play around with the Motions looks and sound blocks if you want a closer look at my project be sure to click the project link below I'll see you back in the codes Zone next time coders bye
