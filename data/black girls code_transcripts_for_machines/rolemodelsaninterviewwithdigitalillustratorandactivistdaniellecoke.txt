foreign work of our next guest across social media and I can't wait to introduce her Danielle Koch is an illustrator and activist during the height of the pandemic her art provoked much needed conversations around equal rights and justice for black people in America she has not only impacted the world through her work but also launched her own collection at Target I mean she is complete gold so Danny thank you so much for coming by of course thank you for having me of course and welcome to the code Zone oh yeah it looks so good in here I know it's so cute so yeah so today we're gonna be uh getting to play Jenga to get to know you better so basically each of us will remove one block and place it at the top of the tower without making it collapse and if it collapses then that round of the game is over and then another one begins so as you can see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer a question from that color themes the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career green for inspiration and blue for a challenge sounds pretty easy right sounds good to me okay so are you ready to get started let's do it here I go huh I know the first one's always like kind of tough there we go good one okay and then when you're done you can put out the top oh my gosh not me forgetting no that's okay okay so inspiration to start us off so what's your design process our storyboards involved most people might start out with storyboards but I start out with writing because my art is very content heavy sometimes very information heavy I deal with topics like justice and race I do a lot of research ahead of time but then I also enjoy writing my thoughts out and so I'll write them out after researching and then I'll split it maybe into four steps or three ways or two takeaways something tangible and digestible and then I will draw based on that information let's do what's to some career questions we haven't gotten to Korea yet okay um I don't know this is risky to pick all the way at the bottom but we'll see okay so our next question so tell us what you do as an artist give us a glimpse of your daytoday I like to give myself maybe like an hour or two to just do some dreaming and getting ideas down on paper because I realized the faster I go the less time I dedicate to dreaming and coming up with creative new ideas which is so important to the process and then I read reading for me is very very important to the work I read a lot for fun when I was younger but now I'm reading to like take in information so I'm like reading a testament of Hope by Dr King and I'm reading a collection of poems by Maya Angelou like things that can feed into the heart behind the art I'm going to do another challenge okay blue up here I go again I don't know what it is like I don't even like look around that long I just like take it out you're killing it okay so tell us a challenge that you've dealt with as an artist and how you overcame it a challenge for me as an artist that does the kind of art that I do was making enough space to grieve and hold space for the real processing that comes with these really horrible tragedies while then also translating it for people to digest and understand it I think another difficulty that a lot of people can probably relate to would be feeling whether I'm worthy of the title of an artist but at first I was like I'm an imposter this is an art yeah yeah I think a lot of artists go through that phase though right you're killing it so thank you of course so sweet okay I think it's your turn me again okay I think I know where I'm going this time oh yeah and you see when like some pops out when it moves that's the one you gotta get oh see look at that I didn't realize I was this good at Jacob I thought it was over or maybe I'm just like really average I don't know okay career what is your favorite piece of art sold or created and why okay I love this question so there are some pieces that are super popular that I probably wouldn't consider my absolute favorite but there is one it's called the good work poem and so it started out as just me writing this encouragement to people who were in the thick of fighting for justice and it basically says like you were created to do good work and this work is hard you know it's meant to change things it's meant to destroy certain things and it's meant to soften Hearts like that kind of work is difficult but it's also good that's probably one of my favorite pieces okay uh I think it's my turn so let's see this one looks loose oh yeah should I do okay last challenge question okay what is one thing you want to tell us but we haven't asked you yet one thing that I used to always say is that Perfection is not a prerequisite to participation just show up authentically and be honest be factual but also be true to yourself be true to your style and you don't have to be perfect to get going I don't know about this one oh you got it oh that's it oh wow I'm I don't know I don't know what it is like I really don't know what it is okay perfect another career question so how do you make your art profitable I started producing art prints and then I converted things to stickers and bookmarks notepads and so I created a whole collection of products around the artwork that I had made and that was successful well I think that's all that's all for us today thank you so much for coming by I literally I learned so much about you it was lovely talking to you and thank you again thank you for having me this was so fun all right we'll see you later guys bye foreign
