okay guys I know my gamers are going to love this next guest the Sola alugbin is a software engineer for the content support team on the game valorent day in and day out she is troubleshooting issues to make sure your gaming experience continues to be top tier how are you good how are you I'm great thank you so we're going to play Jenga to get to know you better today basically each one of us will remove one block from the tower and place it on top of the tower if it collapses then that round of the game is over and we'll start again as you can see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme so when you pull a specific colored block you have to answer the question from that color theme the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career green for inspiration and blue for a challenge are you ready to get started yeah let's go go for a tough one here so that was amazing you have to play professional Jenga is that a thing I don't mean to brag yes oh my gosh okay purple childhood memories describe how you became a game developer did you go to college or a university what major did you study and why did you choose that major as a kid my dad one day brought home an N64 for me and my older sister and said um here you go here's some games so we started to play those we played a lot of multiplayer games we'd go to our friends houses and play those too and I always thought games are really cool I would like to do that in the future I went to the University of Pennsylvania and I was originally an electrical engineer and I thought you know what lightsabers are so cool I would like to build one of those one day and then I thought you know what would be really cool and also maybe more immediately attainable in the near future would be to work on a game with lights and so uh I actually switched to computer science I minored in Fine Art so I could get sort of a background about how artists do things and so a lot of my career has been helping build tools so that artists can do what they need to do to to work on a commercial or create a movie or where I am now which is create a lot of cool new content new characters for Valor oh nope wow oh my god well there we go all right guys we are back after I knocked the tower down but I'm Gonna Let You Go though because I'm traumatized from that last night I'll give it my best shot yeah I trust you yes yeah alrighty career okay what is a software engineer so as a software engineer especially in the content support team we have a a lot of different features that we might want to build out for the content developers so let's say in one case um they might ask how do we make a uh a sound that we play sort of uh have a visualization on uh the gun skin that we have the answer might be well we don't know yet but let's figure it out and so for that part of that is me saying okay well I'm going to go into the code and I'm going to grab those values from our sound engine and I'm going to make sure that there's that's something that a designer might be able to use to drive a visualization within the game that they need so there's bugs but sometimes there's features that we need to build out and sometimes a bug is a feature and uh there's there's just a large scope of things that pop up there when it comes to programming you you discover that there was just a whole underlying part of the code base that you you you take a new look at and you go well maybe we can change this or um fix it or optimize it make it run better or faster than it was before and just in general sort of uh update things so that uh the players can experience the game the best possible way wow that's interesting sometimes you go you go to something and you think you're going to fix one thing and then you end up fixing a bunch of things absolutely I know that all too well alrighty oh man I'm scared okay I'm just gonna do it I'm just gonna do it I'm just gonna do it oh you did it okay childhood memories what are some programs that helped you develop games when you were younger and what are some tools that you would recommend today when I was a kid me and my older sister would always use RPG Maker to make some small games there and what's cool about RPG Maker is that it can sort of help you learn how to code and that it'll give you little logic statements like if this then that and you can start to build really cool and smart systems by just saying if this then that or for each of these things do that and that's a really cool way to get started and RPG Maker still exists today Unity is out there and it's freely available I hear that people are making very cool things in Roblox and in Minecraft I would totally recommend those unreal is also free it's a little more complicated kid but I think it's also cool because you can hop into it and use blueprints to move and create new content that way you can also start to learn how to program and then build larger systems based off of that too RPG Maker is a great start it still exists and things like a game maker were around when I was a kid and are really still being used today so those are also awesome as well oh okay oh it's your turn oh I will talk forever no it's okay that last career oh that's a great choice wow wow so smooth that was very smooth wow all righty do you use code to create games and what are the programs you use on a daily basis I do use code to create games the cool thing about code and programming is that once you learn one thing you sort of got the basics for a lot of different uh programming languages on a daytoday basis I use C plus plus and I'm using visual studio but you can use a different Editor to be able to edit your code I also on occasion might use Python because we built some tools out uh for a modeling program Maya for a lot of the animators or the modelers all of this sort of feeds back into unreal which is what valorent is built in there's just a lot of different programs that people can can take a look at and learn find Opportunities like on a YouTube or or different places to learn how to um a code there's a lot of different resources that people can look into no I love that that's great yeah and you heard what she said resources so remember to watch our videos okay cool ah okay I'm gonna take a look I'm just gonna go for it I'm just gonna go for it oh my God I knew that was gonna happen miss you have been such a pleasure thank you so much for all the information that you've provided us and just thank you for being you and doing what you do and Making Waves in the industry thank you so much for having me all right guys that's all we have for you guys today thank you so much for watching and have a good one thank you
