hi I'm kaani and I'm your host for code along a scratch video series brought to you by black girls code in this series we'll use scratch to code a game a song an animation a story and even an AI powered bot we have a lot to do but don't worry today's video is going to be a short introductory video all about the scratch platform so that no matter what you decide to code you'll have the skills and the confidence to build it ready let's jump in okay first things first what is scratch well scratch is like a Digital Playground where you can bring your ideas to life using Code it was created by the MIT media lab and it's a super fun and easy way to make your own computer games animations and stories when you code in scratch you use blocks that fit together kind of like digital Legos to make your characters move tuck and even dance on your computer screen in scratch those little characters are called Sprites let's start off by exploring the scratch website go to scratch.mit.edu at the top of the page you'll see a menu with options to create explore or if you need help getting started there's the tab for ideas scratch has a great library of premade projects that you can interact with let's create an account so that we can save and share our product go to the top right hand corner of the page and click join scratch create a fun and unique username as well as a password that you won't forget then follow the prompts to activate your account once you're logged in you can check out some of the amazing projects made by other coders on the platform go to featured projects and click the left left and right arrows to explore different types of projects you can make when you see one you like select the project and start interacting with it you can also click on the remix button to change the project however you like want to add your own Sprite or change the background remix just like you can remix a song to make a new you can remix a project the remix button will save a copy of the current project and add it to the my stuff folder but since we're true creatives and amazing coders let's learn how to make our own on scratch project from scratch to do this click the create button at the top of the page if you ever realize you need help while creating in scratch you can go to the really helpful tutorial section found at the top of the page feel free to explore the different categories or search using the search bar there are loads of tutorials on how to make animations art music games and stories so let your ideas run W I love to create a dancing ballerina animation on the stage now let's explore the different areas on the screen on the left side you'll see your blocks palette this is kind of like your toy box full of different kinds of coding blocks each type of block can do something different some blocks can move your Sprites some can make them talk and some can even make them think you can drag and drop your blocks from the toy box to your scripts area the blocks snap together like puzzle pieces or like those digital Legos I talked about earlier click on the blue motion tab on the left side and then drag and drop the move 10 steps blocks to the middle of the play area then I'm going to click the yellow events tab event blocks or yellow blocks tell scratch when to start running the program by setting a triggering moment next drag and drop the when space key is pressed on top of the Blue Block you should see them snap together you read the blocks from top to bottom like this when space key pressed move 10 steps so press the space bar below did you see the cat move if not then press it again and again awesome look at him go the character on the right is called a Sprite these are your actors they can be anything a cat a person a car a tree or even a shap you can pick any Sprite you like or even draw your own the area that the Sprite is moving in is called the stage think of it like a theater stage this is where your ideas come together and the Sprites perform the actions from the blocks you create not a cat person no problem let's change your Sprite go to the bottom of the page and click on the purple icon that looks like a cat you'll see options to choose a Sprite paint your own Sprite if you're creative and be surprised by a random Sprite or upload your own Sprite click on choose a Sprite now you should see a page with a lot of options you can search for a Sprite name or choose a category I'm going to click on the people tabs and choose a ballerina to represent me dancing on stage now we have a ballerina and a cat to switch between the characters look below the stage and select which one you want to add blocks to each new Sprite will have a blank play area it's up to you to add code and actions you can copy and paste blocks from one play area to the next or you can drag and drop them into the Sprite area below the stage I'm going to delete the C for now and leave the ballerina did you notice that every time you press the space bar the character moves and the numbers in the area labeled X go up by 10 the X represents the x axis that's anything moving from left to right the box next to it represents the Y AIS moving from top to bottom when both boxes are set to zero your Sprite will be in the center of the stage to the left of the X and Y AIS boxes you can also change the name of your Sprite let's change the name from ballerina to your name below the Sprite name is the area where you can make the Sprite visible or invisible click the ey on the left to show the Sprite or the one on the right to make it invisible you can also change the size of your Sprite to make it bigger or smaller by changing the values inside the size input below your stage to change the direction your Sprite is facing on the stage click the number in the middle to show a circle with a purple Arrow the circle represents 360Â° and the arrow tells you which direction your Sprite is facing grab the arrow and move it around the circle now I'm going to change my coat a bit and add more actions From the Block palette notice that the Blue Block has the number 10 inside a white circle you can select and change the value inside any white circle I'm going to click on 10 and change it to 15 the Yellow Block also has a dropdown menu which allows you to change which key you want to use to start the action you can click space then select right arrow so now every time we press the right arrow our character will move 15 Steps to the right but what if I want to make my Sprite do more than move to the right that's easy I'm going to make a copy of my block so I can change or add to them right click on a block and select duplicate when you move your mouse you'll see a duplicate of your current block go to another place in the scripts area and drop your new block now I want the Sprite to move backwards so I'm going to change the right arrow to left arrow and add a negative sign to 10 wait a negative sign to 10 yes when you add a negative sign to the number the direction is reversed so if 10 makes your Sprite go 10 steps to the right 10 makes your Sprite go 10 steps to the left next I want my ballerina to talk she's supposed to be just like me after all and you should know by now that I love to talk to make my ballerina talk I I need to go to the looks tab I'm going to go to the looks tab on the Block palette and adding the say hello block under the move 15 Steps block look blocks determine how the Sprite will look and what it can say or think I'm going to go back to the first block and snap in the think h under the move 1 steps block remember the blocks read from top to bottom so the order you put them in makes a big difference now test out the code press the right arrow to go forward and the back arrow to go backwards the ballerina is now walking talking and thinking oh my gosh so cool now let's take a look at our stage right now it's pretty basic let's change it go to the bottom right corner and click on the purple button with the picture and select choose backdrop there's so many options I'm going to choose a concert backdrop now I'm going to make the ballerina Glide all over the stage with the following code to test it I'll click on the green flag then click on the stage where I want the ballerina to go awesome now we have a moving talking thinking ballerina performing on an amazing stage we don't want to lose all of our hard work do we I'm going to save my progress save yours too click the save Now button in the top right corner or we can go to file then select save now we've learned so much today about what it takes to create a scratch project I don't know about you but I think I might need a little brain break make sure you practice what we worked on today if you want a closer look at my code be sure to click the project link below I can't wait for you to join me for the next episode of cold along along see you soon
