I'm kodalong we cover the basics of creating a game in Roblox but what if you had someone to teach you the ins and outs of Roblox what works and what doesn't work and that's exactly what this guest does Genevieve Johnson is a senior instructional designer at ROBLOX she helps game developers like you create the game of their dreams hey Genevieve hey welcome to the code zone I'm so glad to be here we're going to play Jenga to get to know you better each of us will remove one of these blocks and place it at the top of the tower making it crumble if it crumbles that round of the game is over and another one begins as you see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer the question from that color theme the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career green for inspiration and blue for a challenge let's get started alright let's go all right yeah this one is calling me we did that so smoothly thank you let me put it on top right now okay don't forget okay inspiration our storyboards involved in the game design process or do developers work with a storyboard artist yes so much anytime that you're making something in a 3D virtual or Digital World you have to know like what are you actually making what does the world look like what are the story beats and that could be as simple as stick figures you know like I know plenty people they're not great artists but they're really good storytellers so their storyboard might literally be text of stories we work with story artists all the time and storyboards are so important to making any sort of like video game or digital experience okay this one's calling my name though got it you got this yeah there we go okay top there cool inspiration for Roblox game creators how should they get their games to the top of the charts you know this is kind of tough to hear you you almost can't concentrate that on that and again if you keep making games the more that you're going to learn and if you keep making like new types of digital experiences like your skills are going to grow you're going to learn more about like how to keep your audience happy in the long run and that is going to lead to better retention and getting you towards the top of the chart right but you really just got to concentrate like is it something that you yourself want to go and spend time in and then worry about that first yeah I love that it's definitely a marathon not a race yeah exactly definitely all right beautiful here all right um getting a little crazy it is getting crazy that's the whole point of Jenga I changed my mind okay you have 10 seconds again all right list careers of those interested in gaming and Tech so we got all kinds of different engineers get ux designers you got people who are making the back ends you got people who are matchmaking getting people together you got artists you got artists or you're making sounds you've got people who are working on accessibility to make sure everyone can play it and that's 10 seconds so okay that was so many though that was so good wow there's there's careers for everybody in game design I love that and that in itself is a story all right oh okay I keep going for the ones on the opposite side and I know you're so brave I can't I can't give up oh gosh that was scary it's getting scarier okay this one is a career card okay ready what'd you go all right tell us about the process of creating a game in Roblox so the first thing that we do is we really figure out what what's it all about what do we want people to come away with it could be something like we want them to understand like how to make a variable or it could be if you're making a spooky game you want them to come away with that feeling of like you know like fear and tension or you want them to have happiness and like be stress relief you're gonna go farm something right so you kind of figure out like what is that that feeling and what the story that you want to make and then from there we start just like spitballing like okay what could it look like so really kind of like figuring out what's the setting and what we want people to come away with and then we start storyboarding things we start drawing it on paper to reference what we want things to look like and then you're gonna make sure that you're getting people to take a look at it getting people to play it you want to make sure like if they were actually getting what you want out of it and you need to get that from a wide audience it's just so that's a big screen we can play like a mini Jenga we're back with the new tower We're Not Gonna knock it down this time we will eventually we probably will but okay all right um okay all right all right almost I was I was so scared I was very no I didn't want to I didn't want to talk oh right okay remix what is the biggest challenge you have as a woman in this evolving gaming entertainment space how have you overcome it and you have to sort of like balance like being a woman in the game industry and being a role model and really trying to respect the communities and the people who held open doors for you so now you have to go hold open doors for people behind you and that that took me a while to understand because I just wanted to come in and make things I didn't want to be asked about it I just wanted to like do the thing and then I I started thinking about like all those people who came before me and I I wouldn't be here without that and so I think like it's so important for me to do things like this to come and talk to you and like come and like do these experiences so people can see like what an amazing job and career this could be but it can be a lot to sometimes have to balance being a role model and like supporting your community and supporting your family while trying to make the things that you want to make your choice I keep going to go I'm gonna go for the the oh nope put right in the center wiggled good oh okay oh yeah okay beautiful all righty oh this is childhood memories by the way guys okay what tools would you recommend to younger viewers wanting to create their own game there's there's so much it's really whatever tools you have you can use there's obviously like software I mentioned Maya if you have access to things like Roblox Studio obviously I'm super biased and I think everyone should make Roblox games because you make whatever you want and it's you know free but if you if you have access to Minecraft or scratch or unreal or if you have access to paper and pencil like you can make really cool like pen paper like board games actually professionally when you go to school for video game design a lot of times the first thing they have you do is literally make paper and pencil games yeah so they like take a step back from the computer and see what you can do in real life the important thing is just start making things yeah so are we done um yeah that's all the questions I have for you okay I was like scared I think this part of it is still like no you can't knock it out it's like all right no give it one more push one more good push you got it there we go okay okay oh my goodness what a pleasure it was to have you thank you so much that's all we have for today thank you guys so much for watching
