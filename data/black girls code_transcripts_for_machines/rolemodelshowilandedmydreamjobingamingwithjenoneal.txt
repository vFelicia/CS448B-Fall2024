all right guys today's guest is a game industry Legend Jen O'Neill is a video game industry executive Jen has produced some of your favorite games such as Tony Hawk Skylanders and Crash Bandicoot hey Jen hi how are you I'm doing well we're going to be playing Jenga to get to know you better today basically each of us will remove one block and place it at the top of the tower without making it crumble if it crumbles that round of the game is over and another one begins as you can see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer a question of that theme the color themes include purple for childhood memories red for career green for inspiration and blue for challenge let's get started all right okay alrighty challenge question all right all right oh we're starting crazy all right all right list as many female game characters as possible you have 10 seconds so Princess Peach from Mario Coco and tana for Crash Bandicoot um Tales From Sonic ikora and Anna Bray from Destiny Cortana from Halo um it shouldn't be that hard but awesome it's my turn Okay um let's see we got a blue and a green let's try oh let's try an orange here oh yes this Jenga is tricky I know oh there we go beautiful do I I'm gonna get like that there we go all right perfect okay career tell us what you do as a game producer give us your day to day you can think of a game producer as kind of like air traffic control so you have a team that could be very large and they're all making different parts of the game and you have to make sure that things are coming together at the right time so the game producer is essentially managing the schedule making sure that there if there's any barriers to any of the developers that they're removing them they're managing the budget they're managing the scope of the game the timeline wow I love it so you're like the glue that holds everything together pretty much it's it's hard when you know the developers are so talented and sometimes they can get so just narrowly focused on the thing that they're working on where the producer has to be zoomed out and looking at the entirety of the game and making sure that the pieces fit together right oh my gosh see I knew I should good job all right okay another career question so who do you usually work with to develop a game so there's a lot of people involved in making a game you'll have some concept artists there's designers and there's all manner of designers you can have designers that are focused on level design how does the space feel how is it laid out what's the user experience as they travel through it they're systems designers there's combat designers how does this character move and react there's all manners of artists you have animators you have 2D artists who do the user interface of the game 3D artists could be character artists or environment artists of course lots of programmers and again many flavors of that there are people who work directly on the game these are gameplay engineers and then there's people that work on all the stuff underneath so tools Engineers for example they're they're building the stuff that allows the designers to create the creative experience that you have there's Network Engineers people who are focused on making sure that you can play online with your friends and that you're connecting with each other and of course there's the production team that as I as I mentioned earlier is kind of the glue that brings it all together interesting alrighty um oh it's your turn oh yeah okay it's gonna pick another block all right let's see um challenge myself oh I'm scared look it it's wobbling can I do it can I do it can I do it that was amazing wow okay name a misconception people have about the gaming industry one misconception that people can have is just sort of they have this old school idea of what a gamer looks like and what a person who is in the industry looks like and it's really off quite frankly half of the gamers out there are women I won't say that the industry matches that demographic yet but we need to get closer for sure and we've got an audience that needs to be represented appropriately in the industry itself yeah absolutely representation is key absolutely okay I'm gonna go for a purple one okay oh very good you've got to push through the middle down I learned it from you alrighty okay what do you know now that would have made an impact on your life when you were younger anyone can code and anyone who wants to should you know I I brought up stardew Valley as one of my favorite games and this one person was able to create this labor of love because they had the tool set to do so and that's the thing when you want to create you've got to you've got to do the labor of understanding your craft oh man I wow let me think of what color I want to pick I'm gonna do yeah all right I knew that was interesting smooth nice all right okay if you could create a game with no restrictions at all what would it be describe it for us I I have two is that okay so I love jrpgs um these are Japanese RPGs and I love life simulations like Animal Crossing something that blends the two I think would be really fun and cool to make one other game that I've just been Milling around in my head forever is I used to be a dancer I was a ballet dancer and I've always wanted to do some kind of dance game not Dance Dance Revolution where it's just kind of following steps but something that's more allows you to be more creative I mean if you could choreograph your own Show musical production or something given the right set of tools yeah I mean I don't know how many people would want to play that but I would love to make it I would I would play that oh my God my God oh my goodness I can't even do purple all right there we go what is one thing you want to tell us but we haven't asked you yet one thing I would love to say especially to this audience is we really need you I mean we we need uh young women women of color to come in to this industry and help us create these games there's no way that we can truly authentically represent the wide range of characters that we need to to represent if we don't have diversity in our in our ranks we need people sitting at the creative table making those decisions and so you know please consider it we we need you and I think that you'll really love it there's no there's no other industry like that like this that brings together technology and creativity all in one place yeah you guys hear that we need you we need you in the field absolutely yeah it was fun yeah thank you Legend So I knew we weren't going to lose this game I knew it all right guys thank you so much for watching I hoped you learned a bunch of stuff I know I did bye foreign
