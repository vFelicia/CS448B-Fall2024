so something that I would encourage you to do if you're interested in video gaming at all try playing lots of games and play them with a little bit of a critical eye take a look at how those games function how it feels for a new player to come on board and learn the new mechanics of the game break it down look at it very analytically and with that those skills you'll be able to take into this industry as you think about it in the future
