to hand it back over to Yasmin so she can introduce our amazing speakers yes now it's my pleasure to introduce you to our speakers Melissa Henderson Shauna Douglas engineer Jasmine burnson Okay so we can get started with the Q and A and my first question for you guys is what is your web 3 orange Story how did you get into this space okay well I'll go first hi Flacco's code my name is Melissa Henderson I got into web3 from the content and the marketing side I was a journalist for 10 years I worked for Al Vogue Huffington Post and then I also did strategy so helping to drive revenue for a lot of the media businesses and I was really into Innovative technology so during the pandemic it was a platform called Clubhouse which I was an early adopter which means I was one of the first two 10 000 people on the app and I met it with a lot of Bitcoin Maxis as well as nft and ethereum developers and the rest is history I started my career really writing about tech in the intersection of Lifestyle um urban communities and the way it affects our lives and since then I have a crypto in a city column and I'm also the founder of the Violet burst which is a compilation of everything that I've uh ever wanted was ownership in my content as well as a Sleek interface and a way to interact with cryptocurrencies in a decentralized way I'll go next uh Hey everybody my name is Jasmine Brunson I'm a data scientist a DJ a Founder uh my my web3 origin story came from the movie dope so those of you out there who've seen that movie by shamik Moore I'm telling you I I just resonated with his character because I was a nerd in the hood you know growing up in the hood XYZ and at the time it was really hard to kind of teach people about certain things that I do python C plus plus people just thought I was just like weird you know in high school so um all this to say is I really resonated with his character and the segment that he spoke uh with his mom about Bitcoin and the way she just like asked the question she was like so we're going to be buying and selling things with math equations that just like struck me and ever since I went down a rabbit hole went to Virtual conferences in 2017 my first ever inperson conference was a black blockchain summit um and you know it's actually coming up at the end of this this month but my whole origin story into crypto has been doing the culture hello my name is Shayna I am a mechanical engineer by trade I work in Global Supply management so going overseas finding vendors I was at Microsoft making surface the tablets the touch display modules and then I transitioned over to Jewel managing a bunch of different components negotiating costs checking the factories making sure things are running smoothly um and then I met my now husband who was into blockchain nfts he was making digital Collectibles he had a token gated community that was giving each other support in terms of finding the right projects to invest in in communities um and he turned to me and he was like you're a woman in Tech like we need more of those um in the nft space and so it was just a prime opportunity this is about the last year I've been in um this space where I just dove in he started taking me to all the con conferences which is huge right when you get to meet people in the community behind the screens I met Jasmine through my travels I've seen Melissa speak I think at nft NYC so it's actually smaller than you would expect but um I ended up starting my own organization called nft CLT standing for Charlotte because that's where I'm living because one thing I'm I'm you know have been working in strategy for my whole career and the first thing I noticed is that um one of these events weren't happening in um you know the the in cities outside of the major hubs like Miami and New York so I knew that we needed in real life you know community building and education and some smaller markets and the other thing is you know I saw these conferences weren't catering towards Collegiate to gen Z to the folks who are going to be using this so we've been consistently we're coming up on our year anniversary we've had been consistently putting out programming and education and we're so excited for our y3k takeover tour that's happening January 23rd kicking off in Charlotte so if you are a Collegiate you have a free ticket to come earn nfts do workshops you have a web D Expo Gallery is going to be a great time and you can redeem those nfts for Merch and for our concert so celebration at the end of the conference so I love the space I will end with blockchain can solve so many problems in this world and that's what keeps me passionate about um staying active in this community hi everyone my name is oliinka odender and I am the founder of black women blockchain Council um I come to you by way of over 20 years in the financial industry I did transition into cyber security and I actually my origin story started when a friend told me about Bitcoin back in 2015 because I was in the financial industry I didn't really tap into the digital asset at that time however I did my research and I found out about blockchain and it was the technology that I actually gravitated towards because I saw that there were so many different opportunities for us as people with the technology there's so many use cases that could be built off of the technology and wanted to make sure that our people tap in uh so I created bwbc simply to educate our community about blockchain to raise awareness about it as well as to promote black women in this space I'm really excited to see all these wonderful speakers on this stage right now and the things that we're about to bring to you guys there's several opportunities that we're creating we're also creating courses to make sure that our women get to tap in not only as consumers but also developers so we have blockchain related courses education and also ability for you guys to build smart contracts which is another phase of the technology where you're able to build so many different projects I'm really excited to be here thank you all for sharing it's so important and really inspiring to hear about how you all got to where you are so hopefully our participants can ask a lot of questions because I want to know everything um but I think our next question is many of us are just finding out about web3 and wondering what the big deal is what do you say to people who ask why should women of color be pivoting into web 3 and why is it important that I get involved now I'll take this because I really love that question um crypto allows all of us to participate it doesn't care about your background it doesn't care about all the things that we had to nefariously deal with in the traditional Finance system whether it's through predatory lending it's through bad banking High appraisal rates because of this the color of your skin or your origin I feel like with Bitcoin it allows us to all participate and the beautiful thing about the space is the technology is inclusive the technology is inclusive we might not see all the inclusivity from the industry side but everyone can participate and I feel like a lot of the women in this stage can agree at the end of the day black women in this space women of color need to come to this space and kill it we're killing it in this game despite all of the obstacles we're killing it and I think the beautiful thing about decentralization the centralization in my context and from the things I've read is a matriarchal concept this decentralization in itself means that we all work together it's an all voluntary style of thinking enough and Technology we've been working in this space in terms of centralized you know uh identities and centralized structures like you talk about centralized storage and all these other things a lot of the power structures that play the big bosses the big businesses are you know pillaging people at the bottom decentralization and crypto and blockchain allows all of us to have ownership that's what web3 is it's the ownership economy and I think it's it's now or never when it comes to this phase and I'm saying I'm not saying it as in this is Alas and be all I'm saying it as in let's be urgent let's be urgent if you need help finding resources about Bitcoin and blockchain there's some amazing books out there one of my favorite books by Isaiah Jackson Bitcoin and Black America another book I really love blockchain the next everything by Stephen Williams there's tons of books out there there's tons of excerpts and it's amazing people in this space Facebook will sit down with you and go oneonone about the origin of money why Fiat money is not that good XYZ so find your resources to find your niche yeah just to piggyback on um Jasmine's um the wonderful things that she said you know it really lie relies on ownership and it's important for us to show up in this space you know when the whole internet started we had web one and web one was all about reading all you could do was just read you could read your emails and I would say you couldn't really contribute as much web 2 allowed us to now contribute we were able to write and some of you may remember my space where it really epitomized the whole concept of what two we were able to write and create on there now web3 the whole concept of what three is ownership now that we're able to write we can own what we write right and we could take that data or that information and put it anywhere that we choose to put it and at the same time we can make money so it's all about being able to control your data and it's important for us as black women to be able to do that as you all know when it comes to trends when it comes to Consumer ship we stand as number one we spend a lot of money on other people's uh expenses right and so this is our time to actually bring back that money to benefit us as people so it's very important for us to tap in thank you for those amazing amazing answers it's definitely inspiring to me in order to get into it through and my next question for you guys is how do you see web 360 appearing the innovation in the future particularly for marginal age communities I love to take this one um you know we talk about data ownership a lot in web 3 right and what data ownership is allowing is for wealth transfer because if you think about the big tech companies um and we talked about a little bit about web one right if you think about the internet what really makes the internet is the hardware right it's the cables wires routers data centers right that are built up and support the infrastructure for us to be able to connect on the internet so we think about Innovation what does that look like with web3 cut to web3 where you can start to own your data right you're making your own digital currency that is attached to that data and assets that are living on this decentralized internet now that we have the wealth I think the the opportunity that is at hand or you know is that wealth transfer but what do we do with it and it kind of goes as circular it goes back to that web one what we're going to have to figure figure out is how can we use those resources we've generated in web 3 and translate that into real world ownership so you know part of decentralization is that you could set up your own computer to mine currency and to be a part of the infrastructure how do we do that as a community now right to generate wealth because you can't generate wealth by yourself that's a misconception it takes a community in order to do that and so when we think about the future we really should be thinking about okay I'm into space I own my data I have Assets Now real world who am I going to partner with to bring back manufacturing to bring back land ownership for our people right there's a Time the US was free so all of those um you know problems that we see in America particularly but all over the world right you know let's be timely think about the Queen's death there's a lot of talk about colonialism and the you know effects of what that did generationally this is a tool we have start to solve some of those problems and connect and reunite together I also wanted to add that with like Innovation you with web3 we're still building it so you can dream whatever you want to dream um there are hackathons that you can go to for free I'm happy to share those resources afterwards where you can say hey I want to build um a game on the blockchain and have it interact with my friends and you could have a team to collaborate with you build something like an actual prototype and get paid for it so Innovation is really borderless and it's it's all encompassing and so you could really think of the craziest idea go to hackathon go to a Meetup you know maybe write on the Reddit board and see who else is excited about your idea and that's how I kind of got into space as well and met all these amazing women and and people of color because I just wanted to innovate I was really tired rate of you know writing like five shoes you should wear you know to the concert like or corresponding with New York Fashion Week which is great but it wasn't really Innovative and if you want to challenge I think web3 is the perfect challenge because we're still building it the smart contracts might not be as robust right now but you could just help lend a hand and people you could actually get paid for it so that's one thing that I've also noticed too I got a developer Grant to um build my own platform and it was literally just filling out four questions and putting in the craziest ideas and they're like okay let's do it because it hasn't been done before so I think that's like the power of it and I think with black women we are intrinsically creative and there's a lot of people in the space that really uh really uh our our our our values are really heard in the space and even if they don't look like us they're really willing to help so you could be Innovative in web 3 because we're still building it uh short short answer thank you um thank you for sharing how important it is one for us to get involved and also all of the amazing opportunities there are for us in this space on the other side of that if we don't get involved what do you think are the implications of web3 on communities of color as it becomes more mainstream I'll I'll answer that I think the implication is that we repeat the same historical barriers that have always been in place um as you've heard from the ladies that this is an opportunity for us to jump in from the getgo right and be able to carve out a space for ourselves as well as carve out some protocols that benefit us as people so it's important for us to jump in but if we don't we stand the unfortunate you know um circumstances of repeating some of the barriers and issues that we've historically have encountered uh we know Silicon Valley right there was a time where they said that there was no black people that was interested in Tech right and so they use that model to basically keep us out and do gatekeeping um but now this is our opportunity to say no we're here and this is the way that we want to see it built um because if it's left to others they're going to build it to the way that it benefits them and not necessarily think on a global scale when we come in we get to add a little a lot more to it and start to get them to think outside of the box outside of their comfort zone and be able to actually cater this whole Space to everyone and it's important for it to be inclusive um and not divisive and just to piggyback off of that right um you know this opportunity right now to Melissa's point and olincas it's like we're so early in this space that there's a lot of room for Innovation we're not fully regulated that means you can get creative with problem solving and getting around you know Financial issues you know issues that were in the financial industry and all these different Industries music with ownership art with ownership um and so it's imperative um to ask Jasmine was saying that you see the urgency of the time right things happen in Cycles so you're not gonna see things the energy moving the same way you know come come the next time and web one experience well one used to be fairly decentralized and then governments started coming together institutions they created Frameworks and structures and to her point a lot of us were left out in that conversation this time around especially your age you have so much power you grew up with social media so we start thinking about social tokens branding yourself people investing in you and your skills personally and you managing your own funds and not need like it's a whole paradigm shift that's happening um but the reality is there are actors and players who don't want that paradigm shift to happen because that eats into their business that eats into their lunch and so um it's it's really critical I don't want to stress it too much but it is critical that you just start thinking what your interests are the industries that you want it to be in even if it's fashion Tech whatnot and think about how blockchain can transform those Industries okay oh I also wanted to add to that blockchain is a digital Ledger and so that means that we have the ability to like copyright everything that we have and really verify on the blockchain so my mission has always been to document the spirit and personality of urban creators on chain when you think about some of the your textbooks that you've read some of that history was probably left out from the Native Americans from some maybe your family history was left out that's because they didn't think it was relevant to have that type of information in your textbooks but now with blockchain and web3 we could have like for example my decentralized application which is called adapt I'm able to document creators all over the world because I think their story is necessary and it's on a blockchain called flow that is used by the NBA Top Shot so they can't erase this history because you can't erase anything on the blockchain another thing is web3 is about community building and a lot of us if you're nontechnical you can get into the space through community building which is essentially building Community having events making sure people that look like you feel welcome to come in and that's that's what kind of gravitated me to the industry to things like Clubhouse because people were excited that someone that looked like me me was on the stages and they felt comfortable to talk and things so I think when we're left out of the conversation or the boardroom our ideologies and people that look like us aren't in the board rooms either because why because it's like assumed that because we're not there we don't care so you know getting as early as possible follow crypto Twitter follow um tell download telegram I know like 16 year olds that have their own social tokens and have made a lot of money off of nfts you don't need to with a bank account you probably need your mom's signature with a metamask wallet you don't need anything so if you haven't met a mask wallet DM me and I'll send you some ease but only for the people that are here so we'll have to figure out how to verify that yeah if I can add some more you know as as women right we live our life in in a way that you know we're always thinking of innovation right and ways to improve things and I know you guys probably have you know thought of some process that you thought was ridiculous it could have been easy or simple or more effective right these are all the thought process that we need in this space if we need it from people that look like you um it's really important because there's certain things that you know we gravitate towards and you know certain things that we know can be improved on uh that we can lend our voices to also about our community because you've heard that word so many times there is this thing called decentralized autonomous organization right um doubts uh and so Dows you know allows us to now participate as a group as a community in order to improve something um you guys remember coops you know how the coops are able to come together collectively be able to vote on something and also improve that environment that that Coop regulates is the same thing a dow is the same thing it's it's a it's a more um upgrade version of a coop uh as a community we can vote on governance we can vote on the way that we maneuver and we structure ourselves you may recall uh what is it constitutional down it was a big frenzy that happened last year when a part of the well not a part but one of the Constitution a copy of the Constitution came up for auction there was a group of people all over the world collectively who came together to create the Constitutional dial and also give people across the globe an opportunity to tap into that in order to purchase the Constitution and unfortunately they weren't successful but they were able to collectively bring a group of people from all over the place with an intended purpose of owning that Dow now they're pivoting and trying to find other means to to work with that group but something like that could definitely benefit your community your block it could benefit you know your country it could benefit so many different even schools that you go to um so it's something like that that you need to start thinking of how you can show up how we as people can benefit from stuff like that imagine if someone created a dow for your block simply to improve the block to keep the crimes down uh to keep you know to keep deserts food deserts away and and implements Gardens these are things that people can feel like they're having a hand in building and improving the community and because of that they get like a token they get their voices heard they get to give their input and they get to feel like they're actually contributing to the community so blockchain is bringing all of that is bringing a way for us to show up and be represented thank you for those beautiful answers I know for me I was telling a lot of people that Tech cannot be inclusive if you're not inclusive within Tech and I think a lot is important for us black women especially to get involved in technology but my other question for you guys is web 3 is a safe space for all of us whether you're an artist a Storyteller or an engineer can you steer some career entrepreneurial opportunities that exist in the spaces for the masses and especially for black women as well I was going to say um this is black girls coat so I'm gonna assume everybody's coding everyone's a coder add solidity to your text tag add solidity at Russ at go um and and tap into creating smart contracts I think it was Melissa who said it earlier we're very early in this in this space and just to add those languages to your Tech stack is going to help you get more jobs and opportunities into crypto and then be around the ecosystem have your job literally pay for you to go to conferences and learn I think that's the next big thing for us to go ahead and like you know penetrate this this um this industry because a lot of these folks don't even know how to do smart contracts smart contracts yet and we're still early um and I think for me uh I just wanted to say like we we all agree that this space is inclusive and it's just a matter of taking that step to educate yourself right so already dropped a few books there's a couple um there's a couple radio shows podcasts uh YouTube videos out there I watch the gentleman of crypto um every week um and then I have a friend named crypto Kenzie who has his own podcast he did videos back in the day talking about tornado cash like you know what I mean so it's just a matter of finding like that need that Niche and someone said earlier that Twitter uh like uh crypto Twitter is a good Avenue too there's a there's some um there's some good value from that also crypto Twitter can be little iffy like a lot of maximalism is in there too so watch yourself with that but just make sure you ground yourself watch YouTube videos and um also I think that the I like the future of crypto in itself lies in the hands of the people like it's different from like all these other industries that we participated in this lies in the hands of the people who participate and the people who actually generate and and create content um olienka she said it earlier right web 2 was user generated content web3 is ownership economy so the the content that we create whether you're a podcast creator a designer a Enthusiast you like to sell like lemonade it doesn't matter put that on the blockchain create an nft sell it to your community give them rewards make them feel like hey like I want to stay here and I want to support XYZ person that's how we create that peertopeer that that uh producer to Consumer um uh interaction in architecture back like in web 2 we were literally subjugated to the Instagrams the metas the you know meta AKA Facebook I'm gonna call it Facebook because mama called it Facebook but like that's the thing like all these big data tycoons are literally leveraging our data just to create digital identities of us called Data doubles and that digital identity does not have anything anything they do about who you are and what you stand for it talks about per se your your proclivities online what keystrokes you have um what do you purchase what seasons do you do you do manic purchasing it's actually very very invasive and so um the three main applications for data mining always tell people is like uh targeted Marketing Online advertisements and recommendations for crossselling that all involves one thing money and that money goes to the big businesses web 3 allows us to directly um uh serve our communities and serve our consumers awesome go ahead oh I just wanted to add to Jasmine in regard to data so there's a data uh platform called Dune analytics and you can go on chain and look at different blockchains like ethereum or or Arbitron so I think with what three careers like if you can demonstrate that you have an interest by if you're a data scientist and you know a new Python and writing queries check out doing analytics and put that on your resume if you're a writer start writing about crypto in a blog so anytime there's an nft collection out you be the goto person as long as you can demonstrate that you have an interest in web 3 people are gonna love you another thing is like for me how I got into web create through my VR site so it wasn't like my education yes it was my education background but the founder to work in a startup was like oh I really like your VR site and I really love your crypto in a city blog so just having those ex having those uh examples on your resume is going to go far and just adding I work with a python developer framework called ape works so we have academy.apeworks.il so we're teaching you how to deploy smart contracts onto ethereum and other blockchains it's totally free and the video I mean if you spend about two hours a week with it you'll be able and you you know python or maybe you might not know python a lot of things just copying and paste just to save so um you know get a group together and start learning it start deploying your own contract and then you'll see and you'll see that a lot of opportunities are going to come to you because you're women in the space and there's no guys and the guys know that they're like okay we need to get women like who who can we connect to so there's a huge opportunity to build your career and make sure you have those those examples on your resume on your resume or your Twitter uh bio or your Instagram your bio so yeah yeah so I kind of want to touch from a different angle you know this space is about empowerment and giving you the tools you need to succeed and own your own data and Be Your Own Boss and um a lot of you I'm sure like active in nesby nationality of black Engineers I was president of my chapter all four years went hardcore and the thing nesby did for me was giving me my first opportunities right and career my first internship um was with visa and then Microsoft was um the next year and one thing I would encourage you you're you're in a unique time they call it like the the workers economy right this great resignation where people are leading traditional corporate jobs right they want more of a balance they want to the thing about you know I think traditional roles too they kind of pigeonholed you sometimes you you could be a multifaceted Creator right you're not just the coder um and so but oftentimes in certain job roles you're seen as that so I would encourage you as you're maybe going to these conferences and talking to company who are coming on campus ask them you know where's blockchain on their roadmap are they looking at implementing soon I think about the banks Bank of America owns a bunch of patents in blockchain and they're trying to figure out how to implement now this is where you start to critically think okay so y'all are centralized entity this is a decentralized tool where do I really want to play what do I really stand for right in my career do I want to start on this side there's a ton of web 3 companies right marketplaces the actual people who are developing uh dapps to centralize apps on the blockchain people who are doing a lot of things with token economics right so that kind of like you guys are doing with the gamification but making that just an integral part of your internet experience so there's all these opportunities and you are really blessed to kind of be able to choose which world or if you want to do both I live in both I'm a Global Supply manager making products in a centralized world and I'm really passionate to have my own business in a decentralized world um that was able to be successful just because we're in this time where people do want women people are looking for um people who have technical expertise and can break down these Concepts very simply but definitely don't be afraid to ask the questions and really you know um get an understanding of how blockchain is going to affect the companies that you're looking at or the industries that you're expecting and then also I'll plug y3k takeover um the like I said the problem with a lot of these conferences is we have so many wonderful young adults in our community 1819 who maybe didn't even go to college but who code who couldn't come to nft NYC with us who couldn't come to these places because it's heavy drinking 21 plus um so why 3K takeover uh like I said we're kicking off January 23 in Charlotte North Carolina we will have a web 3 Expo so if you want to get in front of web3 comp companies and web 3 organizations and communities looking for support and people you know to hire and bring on that's definitely something that you should check out yeah if I may add a little bit more to this um you know there are so many different resources uh nowadays compared to previously when I first started um as Jasmine mentioned you know learning solidity is very important because that's really the basis of all smart contract um and especially with the ethereum blockchain uh the ethereum blockchain is very famous you know everybody knows about it and one thing that we've done is we've partnered up with consensus which is part of the ethereum foundation to increase the number of black women blockchain devs it's very important um right now there's less than 0.001 of us that are black women who are developers in this space and there's a need for us as you guys have heard throughout this conference right now there's a need for us to show up and be represented so what we're doing is we're creating Pathways we have uh two courses that are going to be release and one is a nontechnical course which will allow you just to understand what is blockchain like why is this important and also be able to apply it to certain aspects of your life and you know certain jobs as well because you don't always need a blockchain for everything but there are things that are being built with blockchain we want y'all to tap into why the other side is the Smart contract side we want you to roll up your sleeves and actually get to coding because once you start coding and understanding what goes into every line of code is very important you know the security aspect of the blockchain within itself the technology is secure but when humans interact with it that's when the security issues then to show up right so we want to make sure that you guys know that you don't have to copy and paste sorry Melissa but you could actually build it from scratch and when you're starting to build it from scratch you guys are going to start to think of different ways to improve the smart contract which is very important because there's a need to prove it but at the same time you will identify issues that have historically embedded into these open source smart contracts that always leads to issues and you will be able to address it and also a lot of projects are looking for smart contract Auditors and because you're able to build it from scratch you now know how to identify issues from other previous smart contract it's very important for us to tap in and we're creating that pathway with the subject matter experts that created a smart contract we want y'all to tap into that as well um other things are you know we are creating an international woman of blockchain conference and this blockchain conference is really to highlight women who are in the space because you guys don't know but people still assume it's a tech bro space and it's not there's a lot of women that are in the space that are building that are creating that are adding to this blockchain ecosystem system that we're creating and we want to feature them this past um March we did 31 days of womenled speakers women speakers offer all 31 days three and a half hours a day for the entire week entire 31 days we feature women who are in this space from all walks of life over 20 countries just to show representation and that we're here we're taking that concept and actually bringing it to the DC area for one week in March we will go ahead and feature all women speakers again we're inviting all sorts of companies within this space we're going to have networking opportunities job fair opportunities and we're also tapping into the metaverse because the menavers don't want to leave that out is very important in this whole ecosystem that we're building and our people it's important for us to show up and be able to represent and also be able to either find jobs or create and get the right type of funding so we want y'all to tap into that and you can go to um bwbc.io to find out more information you're talking about code each blockchain has its own language programming language so ethereum is possible but we're you know I'm sorry it's the most popular but there's opportunities to decentralized space so if there's a language that you're comfortable with like I've sat in and learning how JavaScript can be you know a programming language on blockchain too Solana has its own flow has its own so that's just something to be mindful as well you have um different ecosystems to play in yeah for sure for sure I wanted to add really quick so um going off what you were saying earlier there is a network called the the blockchain education Network I was a part of when I was at University of Maryland I think anybody who's a high schooler or a college student or what have you joined the blockchain education Network connect with them uh great Gods I've been with them since I think it was like 2019 they they flew us out to the North American Bitcoin conference so that's a good way to kind of merge yourself into the conferences that go go around and also get your you know your flight paid or also get your conference ticket paid and then also just to go off of Ola yinka what she was saying so I'm a Founder in the webview security space I wanted to push you all as you learn your smart contracts as you learn those languages also learn how to audit there's a couple of spaces bug Bounty programs out of out here it's kind of similar to like a hackathon where whereas you're not going to be pitching an app you're going to be more so finding bugs and code so it's called code Farina check it out code for arena I'm gonna put it in the chat and also immunify that's a great way to learn how to like Buck find bugs and code and also get paid and then they also will put you on the leaderboard and you get that exposure from the community and once you get once you get that exposure that proves your validity in the space so definitely work on finding the bugs and Coke because we've lost a lot of money in in other sectors of crypto such as decentralized finance and not decentralized Finance is traditional Financial Services put on a blockchain like uh exchanges funding derivatives XYZ there's a lot of opportunity we lost 16 billion dollars in the past two years so those of you who are going down that rabbit hole learning solidity and everything like that also touching auditing and I'm here to support you let me know if you ever need any any um any type of mentorship I'm here to support you thank you so much um I know that that was a lot of information and that you all have been dropping these incredible gems of advice and resources for all of our participants here today um I think we're going to do one more question before we move on to the Q a portion um and that is just what is a final piece of advice you have for someone looking to get started and if you could share a resource that was imperative to your success moving from web 2 to web 3. sorry um I was gonna say that you know um this space is all about not sitting on the sideline but jumping in you know a lot of people have the assumption that they really need to know everything about the space before they even show up and participate and that's wrong um when you're sitting from the sidelines and you're looking in it kind of looks chaotic but when you jump in and actually get your feet wet you start to realize oh wow okay now I understand this I understand what people are saying about decentralization I understand what people are saying about communities and there's a lot of resources we've already dropped some of them right now but there's a lot of resources that you can tap into and get that solid foundation uh one more thing that I like to plug is crypto zombies if you want to know what solidity is or you know what exactly you know this whole word that we're talking about is and how it fits into you as coders I'll go ahead and look up crypto zombies and I'll put it in the chat um but it's a way to identified way of introducing you to solidity introducing you to what goes into it what exactly is it so that that way that fear that you have about I don't know this may not be for me you can really start to understand oh this isn't that hard you know I can do this you know and get that confident that you need and that way you can start jumping in and getting a little bit more information there's a wealth of information out there but as you've seen from these ladies and myself we have communities that are waiting to assist you in your journey so tap into it can you asked a question again I forgot no worries just could you give a one final piece of advice to anyone who's looking to get started or any resources that were really helpful to you in this space oh yeah um how to get started how to get started um research on your own because a lot of these institutions don't really like academic institutions They Don't Really teach crypto and if they do you have to have like your prerequisite for comp sign and some people who don't even study compsite who want to learn more about blockchain if you are like on campus and everything like that see if there's a blockchain club in your school and if there's not start be the Pioneer start it even if you're still learning start it because you're going to attract so many people that's going to support you and then you can join the blockchain education Network and get you guys's uh your your expenses paid when you go to conferences um and then in terms of resources YouTube University that's how I learned my city smart contracts that's how I learned like YouTube University I'm telling you it's so it's so rich the information there and then also just going like step by step of why smart contracts exist x y z all you need that context I actually like understand that you know as as you're building you as a builder have value I think we've kind of lost that sometimes in business it's like sometimes developers aren't even seen as like the the gods that we are like you know what I mean like it's always a Biz Dev people and the people who bring in the money but at the end of the day if you don't have the developers if you're not if you don't have the coders what's being built what's the product so uh YouTube University for sure and um and then also just like just reach out and find your community I feel I feel like it's like that's a very interesting thing to say but like once you have your community you have like that one set of crypto friends you're bouncing from conference to conference with before you know it you're going to be like relatively renowned and known in this space and and also you know mingle with people so that's my that's my tidbit I'll go um so you may have heard of the term white papers um so when you're getting into this space and you're looking at blockchains and you're looking at tokens they're gonna be there's some mini names white green they've kind of iterated the biz Dev people took over what used to be very technical papers that explain the mechanism behind the blockchain and why it worked and how it was validating transaction kind of got has gotten watered down in the process so just the tip you know as you're evaluating projects you may want to invest in or projects you want to invest in I.E communities you want to join right because that's a huge component the reason why nft projects are accessible or the reason why people believe in a certain cryptocurrency is because of the community that's behind it um check the credentials check the Carfax you don't have to understand everything but it should read technical right I think about the people who are doing like Progressive work in nfts smart contracts um the developers I know they take it very seriously right what type of tokenomics mechanisms they're implementing and they make it clear like for their Community how they're doing it it's not just a bunch of marketing tool you're not just going to hear like oh um shark like there's some key words um I think there's another one um yeah that just people it's like a lot of fluff right a little staking more money yeah a lot of Shilling a lot of fluff so just I guess what I'm saying is get your third eye open this space there is not a lot of safety nets right um and we're dealing with finances we're dealing with data we're dealing with your assets uh so make sure that you are very clear on your kind of intuition get get into like does this feel right does this community seem like they have real resources is this you know a technical piece of work that um has a strong Foundation um and that I think will serve you well as you're navigating the space yeah I like to say crypto question everything like just questioned everything everyone is a suspect to me until prove it innocent especially online because a lot of people are synonymous so just question everything and go go into it with a curious sense and a curious lens and you'll succeed amazing thank you so much um this was really insightful and I know that our participants have so much information and resources that they can take with them after this session I we have a couple questions but first I wanted just to ask you all if you could drop any of the books or the resources that you shared during this session into the chat so that our students have them and then we have uh time for two questions before we move on to our closing um so first could you tell us what surprised you most about web3 or blockchain as you are entering the space and this uh question comes from Diana um I think for me as a writer what surprised me is that Engineers are creators and they are writers as well so I come at it from kind of a nontechnical angle but I really felt I really feel like storytelling has a huge part of web3 and it's something that is missing because there's a there was a lot of misconceptions about crypto prior to women get involved in the space because we are a natural Storyteller so that was like really surprising talking to um the devs a lot of the team I'm pretty much the only female on the team only writers so they really lean on me for copyrighting for storytelling for translating their their code into something that's applicable and is a use case so I was really surprised that I could add value in that sense was the question what surprised Us in the space yes um I think what surprised me honestly was like you know I think as a builder in this space or someone who is active in the community I don't think we think about y'all generation and uh gen Z and younger like it blows my mind like even when we talk about metaphors and things like that I just feel like it's a little bit out of touch and not culturally relevant but y'all went through covid trying to navigate school you know ending your senior years trying to navigate your first years of college like behind the screen so you know in terms of folks that we need to be when we talk about inclusion we have such a lack of inclusion in terms of like a younger generation and it's definitely a generational Gap so that's something that shook me and I'm trying to fix I have a 17 year old brother so I've been onboarding him into this space and man y'all pick it up quicker than us we we on board when the tick tockers our local like social media influencer gave them 50 bucks in each this man flipped it overnight into 500 like just doing a little after you know doing a session with him and taking some back of the notes so um I really hope to see like you guys get more active and build your own communities in safe spaces and I look forward to supporting that I would say for me what surprised me is the variance in the spaces like in terms of the groups that there are there could be like people who are just artists it could be people who are devs crypto Bros it's communities for everyone even if you feel like the the industry isn't like that inclusive you're gonna find your Niche you're gonna find your group of people that you rock with I think that's what surprised me and then also how unorthodox crypto is I went to a conference uh not so long ago by storage Institute and it was for uh Founders young Founders in this space young VCS XYZ and it was in Minnesota and when I tell you that was the most unconventional conventional crypto conference I've ever been to I mean we broke out the conference and did yoga in the in the forest just randomly I'm like man I didn't know I needed this I'm all healed up I hear I heard the sound of the didgeridoo my all my skin is popping all this stuff crypto is so beautiful when you find the right people I feel like it's about finding the right people and I think Melissa said it sifting through the madness sifting through the chaos there's some Bad actors in this space you have to do your due diligence and do your own research but the best additive to doing your own research is knowing somebody who actually knows what they're talking about they'll they'll be able to guide you through the chaos The Madness by Dogecoin buy Dogecoin is going to the Moon they'll be able to help you with that because there's a lot of Bad actors in this space whether it's the institutions or individual uh uh individual players you got to watch yourself and always remember you want to accumulate crypto in the sense of like accumulating Bitcoin with a a Bitcoin forward mindset all the other cryptos I mean you got to do your research to figure out what's what what's good for you uh polygon uh ethereum XYZ tezos but Bitcoin you want to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible because it's only going to be 21 million ever 21 million we gotta we're in a rush so that's my last tipit for you guys for me I would say initially what surprised me was the fact that this wasn't just um allocated to the U.S this is a global uh movement that's happening right now we call it Revolution uh we're shifting people's mind we're Shifting the way that we think and the way that we operate and do things in this space um I would say the same thing continues to surprise me because now we got the government coming in right they're creating their own Central Bank digital currency we have all kinds of industry in this space and soon enough the whole entire world will be operating um some way of fashion through blockchain and um you know I want we want our people to tap into that so it's just the quickness of how things move you know um we we say we're still we're still new we're still young things are still you know in the early stages and it really is still in the early stages but just by tapping in and being involved you're realizing that they've moved in warp speed um and the things that you thought you knew is now different things are changing now we have what is it so bound nfts which basically companies are looking at creating a selfidentity a selfsovereignty identity ID such as a driver's license you may have your driver's license as an nft and so bound nft just means you can't transfer it to anyone so it stays with you forever so things like that continues to surprise me in this space thank you for all your insights so I'm gonna ask the best way for our participants to stay in touch with you guys and thank you all for attending also before you go here so you can get the last two codes for the session first fill up the survey you can find the link in the section description box below let us know what you want to see more of and watch the roll call that will come up on the screen when the session ends for the last code also make sure you follow black girls code on the socials and join the alumni mailing list and stay up to date with events and more scholarships and internships we'll have covered development scholarships sponsor alumni trips at afrotech this November um for our panelists feel free to drop it in the chat as well but thank you everyone for coming I truly enjoyed all your Insight and I learned even more about my web3 and I'm very excited to get started yeah and stick around for session three um where you can learn even more and hear from even more incredible speakers peace thank you so much thank you ladies see you on in the metaverse thank you all thank you this was fantastic
