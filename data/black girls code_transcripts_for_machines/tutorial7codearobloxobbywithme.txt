hey hey gaming family I'm your host Cheyenne and you've made it all the way to video 7 of our series you'll remember that in our last video we built out levels five and six of our Obby and in level six we made a blue floor to represent our ocean but what if I told you there was a better way to add a realistic ocean to our Avi it would be great if our game could be as realistic and immersive as possible so let's get started thank you to make our ocean more believable we can use a tool called terrain it has a lot of great options to choose from so that you can create an ocean as well as Islands click on the terrain tab in your navigation or selection bar you should see a new screen below the toolbox called terrain editor in the create tab we can press generate to make our first ocean you will see a light blue clearish box that represents your default area you want to cover you can adjust the size the same way you would a block part you can also change the depth of the Box by expanding along the yaxis or downward in the materials and settings drop down menu you can choose which type of biomes you want to include let's select water and dunes to create Islands but don't worry our player won't be vacationing here this is not the Bahamas it's still going to be a very challenging game next click generate and you will have a beautiful blue ocean let's change the ocean color to a deep sea ocean blue go over to your Explorer and select Terrain in your workspace then go to the property screen below and change the watercolor to a navy blue color Islands to the water select the edit Tab and click add go to the area where you want to put the island then drag and hold to create your shape you can drag in any direction now the Ocean looks amazing and healthy let's add our remaining obstacles to make it across the ocean once we have added all the extra features we want to our Obby the last thing we do is add an area where you go once you win I mean of course right let's look for a winners area in the marketplace there are many options to choose from some objects in the winners area have many different types of features that the Avatar can interact with but I want to choose one we can make our own understand we got to be different choose the option then drag and drop it to where you want the winners area to be I want to add it after the last Obstacle of level six rename the model in the Explorer to Winners area I want to add a disco floor that changes color when we enter the winners area like this hit it hey hello to the flow let it go oh let's start with one square block as our template then copy and paste many blocks together to create our floor in the Explorer rename it to disco block let's add a script to the Disco block and call it change color let's connect the script to the block part add a local variable called disco block we want the color to change to a random color every second we can grab the brick color property and then use another builtin function called random and set its initial argument to three if you remember from our previous video we used a while loop to Loop over our appear and disappear functions while the condition is true the loop will continue to run until it turns false then we use the builtin function called weight to set every time the block appeared and disappeared let's use the while loop to continuously Loop over the block and assign it a random color every turn I want to wait one second before the next color is chosen Let's test it out press play now that we have one block let's make many more put them together and make our floor after you're done getting your boogie down on the Disco floor let's add a rainbow sky for when the winner crosses the Finish Line go to the Disco block then add another script called start rainbow inside of the start rainbow I am going to grab the lighting property from our Explorer the lighting service controls the Environmental Lighting in a game it includes a range of adjustable properties that can be used to change how lighting appears and interacts with other objects next I will add my untouched function and set my conditional to when the Avatar comes in contact with the block next hover over the lighting option below workspace and click the plus sign on the side the sky object is an object that when placed inside lighting will change the appearance of the game's Sky the Sky Box is composed of six sides much like that of a cube after the Avatar touches the block I want to grab the Skybox properties from the appearance drop down menu and reassign them to the following code play then jump in the winners area the last thing we need to do is congratulate the character on winning the game I mean come on they need their props we added a banner to each checkpoint but I want to add something a little different let's give the Avatar a new hat and clothes I mean there's nothing like looking good and winning you know what I mean to do this let's search the marketplace for hat Giver inside the giver script it uses the untouched function to attach a new part to the player I want to choose the Yellow Hat with the smiley face I'm going to drag and drop the Hat onto my disco floor then rename the hat in the Explorer to Winners hat next I'm going to search the marketplace for clothes Giver drag and drop the clothes onto the dance floor I don't know about you but I want to choose from a wardrobe okay like I need a whole closet you can change the row of clothes to surround the area instead of being in the aisle select and open the clothes model then go to the edit section click the drop down menu on group and then select ungroup now you can move each individual clothes model to the position you want now we can choose from many different options we have come a long way to complete our Obby I mean does your shoulders off okay coders we are officially at the moment that we have been waiting for we are done with our
