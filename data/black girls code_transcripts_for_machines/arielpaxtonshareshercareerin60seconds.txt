hi my name is Ariel Paxton I'm excited to share my journey and I'm from Noggin I do storyboarding so I really enjoy the storytelling side of Noggin not gonna exist on an app so I do a lot of the storytelling for their interactive games and for their short form content I work with producers and directors to try to come up with the concept that's already premade and basically from their script I go ahead and create the content that way Follow Your Passion a lot of times you don't know where to start but I've always felt like whenever you're drawing something that you like the most that's always a good basis so that way whenever you keep going towards that you already have a foundation to keep pulling your art from
