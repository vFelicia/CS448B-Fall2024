okay guys I'm a huge fan of our next guest and I know that other Gamers out there are two Bree Williams otherwise known as story mode Bay is a popular gamer and twitch Ambassador she has turned her passion into a fulltime career now she's not only a gamer but an entrepreneur and business woman hey Bree hey how you doing I'm good welcome to the code Zone thank you for being oh my God thank you for having me this is so cute I'm obsessed I want to stay here forever we'll make a place okay right here okay so we're going to be playing Jenga to get to know you better each of us will remove one block and place it at the top of the tower until it crumbles if it crumbles that run of the game is over and we'll do another round as you see the tower has four different colors each color represents a theme when you pull a specific colored block you will have to answer the question from that color theme the color themes include purple for childhood memory red for career green for inspiration and blue for a challenge are you ready to get started oh I think so let's do it we got this so I'm gonna let you go first oh my God the pressure okay so it has been some years since I played Jenga but I feel like if I hit the middle oh God it's gonna fall already oh that's the one okay okay okay beautiful so far so good Okay cool so good girl okay what kind of differences have you seen games make in your life I think one of the coolest things that video games has done for me I mean it kind of took me to uh Japan last year I was able to host uh for twitch for the Tokyo Olympics which was really cool I was able to not only interview guests I was also able to play with different athletes and like NBC correspondence and like sitting there being able to play uh Tony Hawk which was one of my favorite games of all time it's like a full blown full circle moment so that's really cool okay beautiful I'm gonna pick the next no pressure no pressure I just have my eye oh you pull from the side okay well you know what but I'm gonna pull this I'm not that bold there we go oh okay okay give you a little challenge okay so name a misconception people have about the streaming industry it's not as easy as just like sitting down and playing video games and you instant only get get money for it it's hard it's hard work it's kind of more than a nine to five I feel like because it's like it's your passion and it's your fullblown career but it never stops too so like even when I'm done streaming I'm still working so it's almost like a 24 7 job like sometimes I'll be tired but I love it though I wouldn't trade for anything I hear that okay girl next Black is you okay let's see if we could do green that's why I like having long nails because I could like yeah I'm out a little bit hey that was like yeah perfect perfect okay inspiration advice you would give young girls interested in being a gamer I remember being younger and I don't know I felt like I always hung out with the guys because like gaming was seen as such like a guy thing to do and everyone would kind of like tease me for like loving to play video games and I never understood like okay well why can't girls play video games too even like this being my career I see that still happening and it you know it's getting better over the years but a lot of the gaming industry is very much like a boys club so to the young girls out there I just say keep gaming you know uh keep doing what you enjoy doing uh regardless of what anyone thinks about it yeah absolutely so that we can get more women like you in the industry you know the more okay okay yes you gotta be the change you want to see okay okay um okay I know I'm nervous I really like this block right here oh you come out for me but does it like you right no it doesn't oh it doesn't it doesn't you always know like yeah let me put it back it's okay okay there we go there we go there we go there we go and I felt it I melt it and that's okay I knew that was gonna happen oh my God that's okay all right guys we're back with round two I'm nervous yeah you got this I'm gonna use your strategy oh no no see oh that wasn't the one I'm already I'm already missing it there you go okay go with what you know that's okay that's been really doing me great all right okay tell us about partnering with friends I feel like when you do have the opportunity to partner with a brand you have to see if that brand aligns with what you believe in um also knowing your worth too um you know with any industry or partnership like there's always going to be companies that try to you know try to figure out what they can pull from you you know and so you really have to know your worth and stand firm in what you believe in and what you believe you're worth too so I also think that's really important yeah for sure hmm okay nope nope oh those Nails yes yes I came in with the game plan yeah it's gonna fall I light I lied oh God can I leave it I think two are gonna come out okay they were just that one the other one's like halfway out okay beautiful if you could create a game what would it be describe it for us I would do a story based open world game I would let you customize your character I would give you more hairstyle options than just an afro and braids first things first I would give you proper skin tones um open world where you can go out and explore the lay of the land and kind of get lost in it I'm also really big on like Choice based games like um telltale's like The Walking Dead and things like that where it's like you play the game and what you do in the game affects the rest of it like your choices matter so I also feel like that's really important and that's all I got so far I [Laughter] oh this one yes okay that's the one easy one that's the one yes okay childhood memories by the way did you always want to be a gamer if not what inspired you to change careers I always loved video games but I didn't know that it could be a fullblown career once I graduated I knew I didn't want to be at my restaurant job anymore I couldn't really find a teaching job and I wasn't really excited about subbing either and so I had the conversation with my husband and my mom and I was like hey you know um I know I got this degree but like I don't I don't know like I just need a year I felt like I needed a year to like figure it out and just I just need a minute it's weird because the pandemic hit during that time so like I went full time streaming in February of 2020 that's also when I quit my restaurant job during that first year like I was able to host my own show like I was able to really get into my gaming bag and like my Creative Bag and kind of figure out what Lane I wanted to go in so I feel like I got lucky but it was a really really good first year and it just kind of took off from there wow I love that okay cool beautiful let me I'm really gonna try to get this blue that's a good one there we go it's beautiful you got it okay list as many female game characters as possible Jews have 10 seconds and go Lifeline Laura Croft Clementine Michonne Jill Valentine Mirage oh God oh God Bella goth I guess um who else who else oh and and because I know and now it's like the pressure and I'm drawing bling that's okay that's not good okay at least five six okay that was pretty good I had it and then my mind just the 10 seconds goes so quick it's like you know yes yes it does okay okay go ahead okay um okay here we go beautiful I'm just gonna push on this okay yay okay cool last childhood memories questions what do you know now that would have made an impact on your life when you were younger that I don't have to be a people pleaser and it's okay to just be me I feel like as a kid like I knew who I was but I was always kind of uncomfortable with who I was too and you know sometimes the coolest thing is just like being yourself and like owning the skin that you're in and owning who you are and it also makes life a lot easier too I feel like I'm always like my biggest critic and I put the most unnecessary pressure on myself and it doesn't need to be like that just own who you are and life is just so much easier oh God that was a good one okay what oh okay okay you called it and I think you jinxed it because you said you said that would be the one and it was it was standing perfectly fine until I said that was like never mind no well I am so glad to have been able to talk to you you are amazing and have provided us with so much great information I hope you had fun I had so much fun and you're amazing thank you for being an incredible host okay guys we're gonna say goodbye to Brie and we're gonna wrap it up for the day thank you guys so much for watching bye
