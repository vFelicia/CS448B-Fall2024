hi my name is cadence I'm a black girls code student ambassador and I'm here at Adobe's black people create Black History Month event I'm really excited to speak about my experience with black hos code and my passion for art and technology hey thank you so much for having me Black Hills code is a nonprofit organization founded in 2011 by Kimberly Bryant and their mission is to increase the number of women in tech to Train 1 million girls by 2040 and basically to empower the next generation of young girls of color with the tools and resources they need the way that black hos code empowers it was like me is so so important usually young girls or people of color looking at such like a white male dominated space or things like that can seem discouraging but with black holes code you are surrounded by peers who have the same passion as you or have the same motivation as you and that I feel so accepted and empowered and motivated and like it makes me hopeful when I go there and I see my friends and we're all learning about these new things and exploring these new careers it makes me really happy hi my name is Shaun Ian Butterfield Iowa student ambassador for black girls code and I'm on the panel for the New Jersey Black History Month event it means kind of a lot to me because I get to make connections with people who are also on the panel and who else is in the industry and I get to connect with the audience I'm a little nervous but I'm also excited at the same time I can't wait to see who else is on the panel and I can't wait to hear their side of the story Charmy is our youngest panelist we have sorry to put you on the spot but she's in the tenth grade and she we found luck girls code right when it first started so I've been with them for seven years now microcode is a nonprofit organization that teaches girls from seven to seventeen how to get into tech by teaching the workshops from app development game development website development I remember the first program I day was something called code ooh would you like to like this little game thing or has like little 3d models you put them around do you like can make them move around like little basic programming things mostly for like kindergarteners I think but it fascinated me so much like wow I can make this little car move but yeah that was my first interest in tech and just skyrocketed so yeah hi my name is Bella reader I am 12 years old and I'm currently a middle schooler at head boy school I'm here as a part of black girls code an organization that helps young girls of color learn about tech if our current generation knows how tech is relevant and how it how it will heavily impact our future then more people will gravitate towards it and more people will become a part of it I think the biggest challenge for our generation is that nobody knows what tech is we don't know it we can't use it you can't turn it into a career we can do anything with it except for watches everybody else creates things with it and we can only sit there on the sidelines thinking man I wish I could do that I wish I had those skills I wish I learned this when I was younger the worst thing to do is regret in life if you can try to see the light at the end of the tunnel and you try to reach for that light I think a lot of great things can happen from it even if you don't reach it you
