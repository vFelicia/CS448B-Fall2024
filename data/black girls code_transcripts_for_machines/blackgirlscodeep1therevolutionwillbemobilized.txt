we love black girls C I think black girls code empowers all of us you wouldn't learn coding web design or app designing on a regular day and it just gives you a chance to get a glimpse of what you can do and it gives them a chance to feel like oh I'm all that what I really love about the black girls code movement is that they see the potential the great vast potential in these young black girls and not only do they see the potential they're actually acting on it by making sure that they're serving these girls this week the girls have been learning about entrepreneurship and business planning for mobile app development and they have been creating ideas for a mobile app that they would love to bring to Market so during the week of the camp we've been learning about App Inventor and all aspects of Entrepreneurship and Business Development the girls broke up up into teams and they've been brainstorming ideas and working on prototypes paper prototypes for their apps sometimes if you're on a page and if you want to go back to a page sometimes when you press this it actually brings you back to the home page uh we put a back button at the top right there and instead of having the name right there we were going to put it at the top so then it doesn't have to before I started with black girls code I didn't even know what HTML was let alone had a code in it I didn't really know how to make a game like the components of games I didn't know what a Sprite was what they're teaching us is like really good to know so if I ever want to make like my own mobile app it'll be easier it's a little bit difficult and it's very tiring but we're doing a good job and we're learning about the field of marketing what the people were trying to get to want so far I've made an app prototype made like three tutorial apps I was about to design an a website I think one of the big problems with inclusion is that I think our community is underestimated and the importance of having that adverse perspectives in the room to build solutions to talk about solutions to take action to change the world um if you don't have these different perspectives in the room and these different experiences then you're not going to build the best place so I think it's really important and awesome the black girls code is here today and we have so many young women here today at Facebook with the opportunity to meet people who work at Facebook work meet Engineers meet people who work on our product as well as just walk around campus and see what it looks like to work here I know when I was their age I wish I had the same type of opportunity and access to visit companies like this to really open my eyes to understand what is possible and it's also really cool because we're working with the Bay Area chapter of black girls code and so we're literally in their backyard and it's awesome to be able to provide access to these young women to come here and just get to meet us and see what's possible for them in a few years I got into programming actually not that long ago last summer um because I come from a lowincome family so my family actually couldn't afford to have our own computer at home until I was a freshman in high school and my public school did not offer any computer science classes so I was never actually to get into uh programming as early as all of you guys so you guys actually have a head start on me and it's also very equalizing in a way because I didn't I mean I only started last summer and I'm already interning at Facebook so I think that it's definitely something that anyone can do and anyone can get behind and it's just a very empowering um area not only for you who are learning to program but also the impact you can have on other people as well it's absolutely imperative that we as a company do all that we can to figure out how we can make technology uh more accessible to all the communities out there the biggest thing that the girls got out of this week was a confidence in presentation and really owning the work that they did so we decided to make an app called get green my team we're making an app called summertime fun our app is about cleaning basically it will tell you what to clean your room with um so our app is about Recycling and how to keep the earth clean which that flower is basically you could scan or take a photo of a flower and the definition will pop up and if if it's edible like to eat and if it's harmful I've done a lot of work and I'm continuing to do a lot of work on women and the fact that women and men do not have equal positions in our society yet because again technical fields are where a lot of our leaders come from technical fields are much better paid and the percentage of women graduating from computer science right now in this country is 13% 13% for every 100 people graduating with a computer science degree 13 of them are women but these are jobs where you really make a difference you build technology you build something like Facebook and then the whole world can use it and so I think on any level whether it's future Financial Security for your families whether it's future just fun for you or future meaning for the work you do having technical degree technical background is so important we know that the women who make it through the girls who make it through they are just as good at this as bu is they always were they just don't get the same encouragement and they don't see the same role models so you can do this because you have this amazing opportunity and you do it not just for yourself but you do it and you become the role model so I hope you're taking full advantage of this great opportunity I'm thrilled we're able to do Facebook they're working with these girls they're they're teaching them these skills and they're they're allowing them to build amazing things I want to reach everyone aahah
