pleasure of introducing Lexi B Diana Tate as well as Alex Kennedy so thank you all for taking the time to be here today I know that we'll be enjoying all the gems that y'all are dropping soon so let's get started um my first question we can start off with Lexi um could you tell us about your journey in Tech and what led you to your current role my journey in Tech has been a myriad of emotion and complexities and underground railroading and figuring out who's who and ups and downs this is a very this is a very intense question I think the biggest overarching theme of my journey in Tech is understanding always never forgetting who I am and my my personal values and how I manipulate the situation to so to show my personal values and to fight and advocate for the equity of everyone in the tech industry but especially black women I always think black first um when I'm in rooms I'm currently the chief of staff to the highest ranking engineer at Twitter so I do a lot of operations work a lot of strategy work I tell people that if a strategy leader and a program manager and a bodyguard had a baby that's basically the job um that I do and I've also worked at companies like Facebook Airbnb and NetApp doing a whole bunch of stuff that really comes down to being in rooms with people where things need to happen a very quickly so yeah no thank you for sharing that I love your analogy too um so Alex do you want to share absolutely so one thing I pride myself on is keeping a really strong pulse on culture and seeing how the world and culture is evolving and so what was clear to me over 10 years ago was that Tech was disrupting every industry and that every company was becoming a tech company the term iot was like a buzz phrase of the time that some people didn't actually know what that meant but was always saying it and so for me in my just general kind of approach to life is how do I future proof my own career so that I will always like be relevant and have a unique kind of value prop and knowing that Tech was this disrupter I'm like how do I gain a fluency in Tech so a Headhunter called me and talked to me about a role at Twitter and what better way than to don't like develop a fluency than to put yourself in the belly of the beast in the bay in a established tech company you know previously I was working at Under Armor and it was Tech adjacent I actually helped that company in corporate strategy develop its kind of approach to the digital space and then helped with M A and integration of tech companies but there's nothing like actually being in a tech company to develop that fluency my current role is a director um leading one of a portion of our retail and travel business so my role actually helps retail and travel companies connect with their target consumer utilizing the Twitter platform um previous to this role I was the global director of strategy and operations overseeing our Partnerships business so that allowed me to help really grow a business Drive strategy and operational rigor and tell you that the last four years being in the belly of the Beast it has been an absolute gift and I encourage it for everybody no I love that thank you so much for sharing so Diana I love to hear your journey as well thank you so my journey actually started in middle school with just a basic web page um that's really how my my curiosity around technology started was um you know back in the 90s we had a whole a whole room in our house dedicated to the computer the computer room I know a lot of students don't really know about that nowadays since you have that in your pocket but essentially this is where I hung out after school every day so I would come home from school get online play games but I also stumbled upon basic sites that help you build basic websites using HTML and JavaScript and it limited the number of characters so you had to be very very efficient with how you were designing your web page what kind of content you wanted to put on there and that was really how um that fire inside of me around technology was lit and so I continued all throughout High School to create Myspace pages and different layouts and designs in that space um and initially wanting to go into an art career so being able to really tap into more from like the visual arts side of my interests with technology and when my mom came to me and talked to me about what I would major in in College art was positioned as you know you're not going to make money in art so you might as well go into technology which is basically the verge of everything that's about to happen in the future and so I did end up studying computer science in college and starting off my career at Goldman Sachs as a full stack developer and working in our platforms area so working on Big Data infrastructure and after working in that space for about two years I was also super involved with some of our Affinity networks and diversity and inclusion networks where I was really able to build out my network build up some additional skills outside of just coding so planning strategy being very organized working in other Realms such as marketing and blogging and Technical Communications and that's how I landed in my current role which for the past four years I've been working as a chief of staff like Lexi which we also affectionately call the chief of Step because it's very true that you end up dealing with a lot of things that are not in your job description when you're a chief of staff um but I think from this perspective it's really given me an opportunity to be very involved with technology but from an organizational and strategic planning side of things and that's just one of those careers that um I know Middle School me was definitely not expecting for me to land in a chief of staff position but I think just knowing all the different careers that are out there and just being able to kind of follow your interests will really take you to where you need to be in different points in your life so that's how I ended up as a chief of staff at Goldman Sachs for engineering yoke congratulations on your role and I come from a software engineering background and I'm an artist too so like I love hearing that you know you're an artist too and especially for a younger audience I think it's super inspiring that you have that drive and passion for Tech in Middle School especially as a lot of the girls are in our summer camps or just like in the workshops overall so that's really cool um I I'm sure the audience wants to know so if anyone can answer what are some you know top two resources or tools networks anything that helps you be successful and Excel in your career today let's start off with Alex okay well let me start by saying there's a lot a lot a lot of free resources that you can use to excel in your career when I need a boost of confidence I'll turn to Bene Brown's um Ted Talk on power vulnerability if I need General career advice Carla Harris's Pearls of Wisdom is incredibly helpful um I also turned to Twitter you can join communities on Twitter focused on startups marketing VCS whatever you're interested in and there's so many experts that will just drop gems of information that you can take advantage of um so that was the free stuff on the paid stuff there's a podcast called strategory that I highly recommend that will give you good to Tech Business Insider information in a really thoughtful way I also am a huge fan of Black Enterprise and the pal um the women of power Summit I actually am a huge proponent of that if you have an opportunity to go really kind of like fills your cup so those are resources but here's one thing what was really imperative to my success was probably not reading or listening to anything it was developing healthy habits so learning how to be proactive and to follow up and to speak up and to just be consistent in how I show up every single day those things those kind of character traits are arguably um the most important thing that you can nurture and develop if you really want to be successful in this industry no I completely agree the emphasis on advocating for yourself and advocating for others especially being like a black woman in Tech and in this space is super super crucial um so let's go on with Diana so I think um I don't want to piggyback too early in our conversation but um as Alex mentioned really some of those soft skills around just like communication being able to follow up be proactive are some of the most important things I think when it comes down to really making sure that you're prepared for whatever situation you get into um and another big piece of that is your network and so um something that I've been realizing just from you know going through the career going through ups and downs is when folks say it's really not about what you know but who you know you really do need to take that not with a small grain of salt but with the biggest bag of salt um that you can get to because those connections even um in places when you don't think that you'll be able to relate to people or nobody looks like you if you're able to find those one little spark of connection between the right person they really can't open up any opportunities that you're interested in put you in contact with the right people put you into the right tables there right rooms the right seats and so I really encourage you all to just get out there and find different interests things that you can talk about things that are true to who you are but things that are also something that you could leverage to connect with other people so for me I like to bake in my free time I also like to read a lot of books and so when I'm meeting new people in New spaces oftentimes I'll bring up anything I've recently baked and pretty much everybody loves sugar for the most part so that's something that I can connect with people about and that continues to be something that's memorable like when they think about Diana she's not only working at Goldman Sachs in engineering but she also likes to bake and maybe that's something that we can talk about outside of just our daytoday work because when you think about it whether you're going through college the college work the tests and everything is going to be there when you're working in a professional environment the work will always be there but once those things are gone you really want to be able to savor those connections just for not only opening up doors in your career but also just for your peace of mind so that you can come to school every day you can come to work every day and enjoy the people that you work with and be able to have those um those strong connections that speak truly to yourself but also help you advance so um there's an abundance of great Technical Resources out there I definitely encourage you guys to look into things like code Academy Khan Academy one of my favorites for technical practice is code signal because it does do a lot of gamification where you can connect it to social media you can compete with friends on coding challenges and those are really great things to be able to keep your technical skills sharp but also you know take some time just to invest into your your nontechnical interests so that you can find ways to connect to people outside of the work no I definitely agree like pursuing your passions outside of tech and after this I'll definitely message you for like a recipe or two um and so now uh Lexi the stage is yours thank you so all those things were great I think that because we are in black girls code we just gonna keep it real with all these beautiful black women of every spectrum and every diaspora and whatever food your mama made you we knew it was seasoned so here's the deal adulting is hard period and so it's not only how do you succeed in Tech it's how do you learn how to become an adult because you don't know how to become an adult um you have been in school all of this time and then they give you a piece of paper and possibly some student loans and they say go figure it out and so when I first started my first job at 22 I was working at NetApp as a technical program manager and there were two pieces of advice that were given to me my dad on my first day he called me and he said never have lunch alone and every day or almost every day in my first year I would never have lunch alone and whether it was the person sitting next to me whether it was another new college grad in my program whether it was a VP that I somehow like got him to come to lunch with me whatever whether it was the the chef in the cafeteria because precovered the people who owned the company were the people who cook the food the assistance and the security guards okay I never ate lunch alone and the amounts of information the amount of feedback the amount of tips and tricks like don't don't tell that person stuff because your business going to be out here right the amount of people saying hey that person has the sexiest title in the room but the person who has the most power is this person because for whatever reason that title actually cares what this person says so if this person they trust most says the sky is purple then understand Lexi in this room the sky is purple and we're just going to go with that narrative and so I highly recommend that your network is your net worth like Diana said um and to add to that it's how in which you build that now that we're in a world of coven from people working remotely I would say um I actually started my job at Twitter when when the pandemic shut down and what I did was is that I contacted a few people who I knew I worked at Twitter and I said send me intro emails to three people that you think I should meet for whatever reason in my first six months of Twitter I had coffee chats every single day to the point that at one point I actually had coffee with Jack Dorsey himself because someone connected me to someone I highly recommend that if you are working remotely you use the same attitude to ask people to meet when you add when you meet with them ask them about themselves people love talking about themselves okay ask them tips and tricks on how to network ask them can you introduce me to three people that you think that I should connect with building your network at this company is very important because one it allows you to figure out how to navigate this company because what they tell you is actually false white supremacy one on 101 number two at some point these people that you're talking to and building relationships with will go to other companies so that actually secures your bag okay the second quick piece of advice that I received was from a black woman in the old stages of my career she was this you know in her 50s about to leave in HR and she always said Lexi always be the baby in the room and I would say what what does that mean I don't want people to think that I'm young and she laughed and said no no allow them to think you're young because you can ask questions and no one's going to fault you for them and I used that in the first four years of my career I'd be like well I I'm a new college grad can someone answer this I'm a new college grad can I just go with you to the meeting I just want to watch and so and honestly nine times out of ten nobody would turn me down so at a very young age in my career I would literally sit in rooms with csuite members because I would just say can I just come and sit there and what I learned in those rooms was how power is actually shifted what words to use when I want something how to professionally cuss somebody out without using cuss words how to check people without actually checking them I learned who actually runs stuff at this company and who doesn't but for whatever reason is getting paid for it and that's what I started learning how I use my words in rooms because again nine times out of ten whatever job you do it's how you communicate what you want so that's what I would say no thank you for all that I graduated in May and I started my first big girl job right now so definitely taking all those gems that you drop thank you for that um so to everyone thank you so much for sharing your Journeys with us um so quick question if you can go back in time to the beginning of your Tech Career what advice or affirmation would you give yourself um and let's start off with Diana um so for me I know that I'm really reserved I am a person who likes to be very choosy about my words especially when I'm in a corporate setting um because you know you might not be able to to tap into what code switching looks like um when you're in school but when you're in a professional environment you definitely feel that um especially for me I went to an HBCU and so um being able to have like that really transformative experience in my early 20s um I think helped me really tap into just a lot of cultural things that I I really cherish and really take with me and some of those things I know that I have to be just very conscious of when I'm in a professional environment so using certain phrases that um you know your friends might understand but you know your coworkers want being sure to like edit those out when you're explaining things or asking for different things um and being able to just pop into a conversation like Lexi like Lexi said um being able to really speak up and make sure that your opinions and your perspectives are known um that was something that I wasn't really used to in a professional environment coming from college and being able to say it and deliver it in the right ways and so oftentimes I would kind of sit back in meetings and I would I would really think about okay is this a good question is this a good way to phrase it are people going to get what I'm saying and feeling like there's so many corporate terms and acronyms being thrown around that maybe I need to keep this question or this comment to myself so the advice that I would give to um my baby engineer self is just say it just spit it out like whatever it is um you know take two seconds to maybe think about how you want to phrase it but if you do have like the right manager in your corner and the right teammates in your corner they'll be able to ask followup questions um to really show that they're listening and they're trying to help you and give you feedback or respond to your question or they'll be able to pull you aside after the meeting and say hey either this didn't really land the way that but um I think you expected it to but here's some great advice on how to like kind of polish that up for the next meeting but um being able to really just be comfortable speaking up in those meetings will help you get connections because people will say oh Deanna said this in the meeting and I'm kind of curious about that too so maybe I'll ask her about that afterwards and we're both confused but we can figure it out later or um you know responses afterwards like hey Diana is thinking about this this problem that nobody else is thinking about maybe I should follow up with her about that and even if you're not 100 percent spot on with whatever it is that you mentioned or whatever it is that you asked the fact that you actually spoke up um lets people know that you're engaged with the work and that you're engaged with the conversation so um even if it's just small comments around feedback whether it's positive or constructive um just speak up and spit it out because those can be the things that really help drive like further conversations more opportunities just more um understanding and connectivity with the folks that you're working with no I completely agree so thank you for sharing that um and let's go on to Lexi I think if I had to look back at little Lexi I would tell her to ask ask the right questions in the room earlier and um take your pins out here's here's the right question you are graded at work based on solving people's problems you are not graded based on the rubric you are not graded on what other people say your job is you are graded on making your manager's life easier and solving other people's problems and so if I could go back what I would have done on the first day as you know you meet people because your manager gives you that orientation packet and says go talk to these four people and when I went to go talk to them somewhere in that conversation I would say what is your biggest issue right now with your work and how do you think I could help solve it I'm not I'm not telling you to do other people's work because that's a no and then we have to have a whole conversation about reparations and like black women not getting paid and that's a whole separate poll which is important we're not talking about that today but how do you help people solve their problem because the people that your manager asks you to go meet in your first 60 90 days of work those are the people that are going to be giving you the grade to your manager on your performance review so every company does performance review is a little bit different but do understand that if your manager gives you four to five names and say I want you to meet with this person all that means is that when it's time to decide if you're going to get more money if you're going to get promoted if you're going to get more opportunity is if those people say that you're cool so you need to figure out how they Define cool um so that's what I yeah that's what I would tell myself we're literally going back to kindergarten playground rules but those are the rules and a lot of time in capitalism which basically is a method of white supremacy is that we don't tell you that that directly we say other things but this is what's going on go on the playground and say how can I how can I help you with that and if you help them with that then they'll tell the teacher you're cool and if the teacher says you're cool you get more money you get more opportunities you get a title change and that influenced the trajectory of your career in your 20s okay preach preach those were gems gems gems gems from Diana and Lex and so I'm going to summarize their gems and then add one more um plus one to Lexi's um add value find a way to add value to everyone you encounter um to be on as a point I that's where I was actually gonna originally go which is speak up you'll be so shocked by just raising your hand ideally in a public setting and asking a question a thoughtful provocative question it will put people on notice that you're like oh this person's a force they don't have fear they're ready to dive in these are the subtle indicators that like show that you are ready and probably have a maturity Beyond your years um one way to test yourself with this I say if you're in a meeting force yourself to say something in every meeting um if you don't have a thoughtful point to add which you should but that's not the point but like let's ask a thoughtful question ask somebody to further explain the point they just made um that way your voice is being like is contributing to the room and the conversation you should never sit in any room mute period even if you are the person responsible for taking notes in the meeting ask something um Johnny made a really good point where said X Johnny can you explain this or Susie can you explain that you should say something to make sure that your voice is clear here's what I'll also add um don't just put your head down and work that's not going to be acceptable that's not what's going to make you thrive that's not how you're going to win I think in the black community our parents with great intent um let's say just keep your head down and work hard wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong um you have to shine a light on your contribution and you need to do it in a nonselfserving way but just in a way that helps people realize that you were adding value to the larger initiative at hand so for example send your manager um I saw you made an excellent point in this meeting here's a report of key insights that I actually pulled together um to Aid you know you in the next round of conversations make sure people understand exactly what you're doing never let there be a question of what your contribution is so you have to speak up you have to Advocate you have to be proud present in slack channels on emails don't let a day go by where your name isn't coming across somebody's screen no 10 out of 10 one plus everything you just said amazing um so let's switch gears right here um so we all know the importance of having mentors especially in our Tech professional spaces how did you all go about finding your Tech Mentor or just building that type Community um so let's start off this question with Lexi um how I found Tech mentors was again I was very fortunate I'm very big on checking privilege my first job um I was the only black person in my new college grad class of 300 and um I was one of 10 people that were not actually software engineers and again this is free covid so we had to go to work and I saw this black woman in the cafeteria one day and she just came over and she was like I'm gonna make sure you're good and she worked in finance and over a year she and she she I call her my fairy Godmother she introduced me to my other professional fairy godmothers of four other black women who were at NetApp in different parts of the business and even though they weren't in engineering they of course to knew people so I could go to them I could cry I could go to them there were many times I would just go to their desk and they'd be in a meeting and they would stop what they were doing and handle it they would love on me they would yell at me they would get me together all the time and that really started my mentorship and then what happened was I left that app went to Airbnb this right like really cool sexy startup and there were all these black people um and so when I went to Airbnb was about 2 000 people and they were about maybe 200 black people which was huge compared to what I went to and I realized very quickly that like it's so great to go to an ERG meeting it's so good to be like hey girl hey in the hallway but I was the only black person in legal um and there were moments where I was put in positions where I had to work with the leadership of the company which is a great opportunity for for me but to have to sit in a room with the c staff and tell them that they're wrong is a hard opportunity for a darkskinned 20something black girl with usually very big curly hair so I actually started a community um to find black women to teach me how to be authoritative in a room without white people assuming that I'm being aggressive um how to make my point across how to be able to talk to the csuite and then also talk to the intern and get my job done because that was my job and it's called sister Circle black women in Tech um so I started in 2017 really just to meet some black women and have some brunch and now it's over 14 000 people around the world so I think the important thing is I always tell folks that like I don't have any mentors that aren't black women because how I Define a mentor is that you understand me as a human not as a professional I have a lot of people in my life who are sponsors and who are support systems and who I can go to for professional help I call them my professional friends I actually only have black women mentors in my life because those are the women that I can actually go to and talk about do I take this job because I'm about to get married and like do I want to move across the country and I can have a holistic conversation about me as a person and not just my professional career but if you are a new college person if you're like you know new to adulting the first thing would be is to join communities like sister Circle or other communities there's a lot of other black women communities in there that are free that you can join and just start meeting people and again be the baby in the room I have never not responded to a black woman who said can I have a chat the chat may be in six months because I'm busy y'all okay white supremacy keeps me busy but I have never said no to a black woman and I don't know many black women who have never said no to a black woman especially a new black woman in Tech and have not carved out time to say how can I help you and if you let me I'm gonna love on you but that love is also going to look like hard love I'm also going to tell you when you're wrong because I want you to be better why don't I I'll go next because first of all let me just say if you haven't joined sister Circle shame on you you need to join it immediately it is full of amazing resources there's a newsletter um that Lexi has created um what she has built team is truly remarkable and is uplifting the entire community so like let's just like take a moment to give some kudos to truly paying it forward um to build on your point because you mentioned mentors and sponsors I want to acknowledge those both of those things are important they are different um and you need to understand the difference because if you don't understand the difference that will not go in your favor and Mentor you can tell your full life story too you can be your full self you can share the good Bad and the Ugly your sponsor it's only the good good the great how great you are and why they should advocate for you um so those are different relationships and so be thoughtful and understanding of what role what person plays but specifically when trying to find a mentor you will be so shocked by how open and willing people are to give their perspective and that is just human nature um in general like selfcenteredness people love to give advice and be looked to for feedback so the key for you is to figure out how to do it in a digestible way sometimes when somebody says will you be my mentor a person a busy person like Lexi like all of us on this channel it's like like what type of time expectation are you expecting because we know our time is incredibly limited and we want to give you the best experience but if you ask something like hi I've watched your career or if you saw you do X I was really impressed by this when you're flattering the person would you mind if I found 20 minutes on your calendar to get your advice on this people will say yes to that and then once you're in that conversation towards the close of it wow this was so insightful thank you so much for your time do you mind if we do this again in two months or three months like or once a quarter now you're gaining a mentor without necessarily using the word and you've developed that followup and now it's the key after you've done all of that to come prepared to put it on the calendar it is your job when you are asking for advice to own the scheduling of that meeting and it is your job to follow up and if they don't respond the first and second time follow up again because many times if we don't respond fast enough it's not out of lack of like desire it's because people are really busy so it is your job to stay on people's Radars um so that you can get that opportunity no a huge key in that is just intentionality being very intentional with who your mentors are and how you approach them and how you also continue the conversation because those conversations can open up so many doors that you've never known before um so let's go move on to Diana so um Lexi and Alex I think covered most of the things that I had in the in my mind to say um and I do just want to put extra emphasis on the being prepared part um because when you're first coming out of college and you're going into a job if you study computer science oftentimes that is a software developer role and so if you're not really sure of maybe where you want to go next what you want to do next what you want to learn I think it's a good time to take a weekend take a Saturday take a half day to just sit back and think about all the things that you've learned up to this point whether it be in school on your own and look at some of the interests that you have further down the line so if you you know have a dream of being a tech founder or if you have a dream of starting a company or being involved with a specific company really take stock in that and kind of list down um some of the positions that you're interested in the industries you're interested in and look at where you're at currently and see where you currently are what kind of industry you're in what kind of position you're in what kind of skills you're learning and see if there's some kind of Gap there so that you can know when you meet someone at a networking event or in the break room or in a meeting if they raise a topic or something that Sparks your interest you know immediately that you need to follow with that follow up with that person and have coffee with them or have lunch with them but you won't know that until you take like stock and inventory of your own life um and I and I really realized that when I took a step back and thought about my career like okay I'm not really happy in this current role where I'm at like what do I want to do next and the the next question or the next answer was like I don't even know so in order for me to really be able to kind of figure out what I wanted to do next I really needed to take stock of you know what were my goals a few years ago when I started in this role and I've achieved those goals now what's next um because even if it's something that maybe is not ultimately going to make you happy you need to be shooting for a Target so that's the that's where the intention piece comes in even if this is not like the forever stop for you or the thing that like really lights you up you have to kind of be going in a certain direction you have to know where you're going and it's always okay to make a different choice or to change past but you have to know um and when you're meeting new people who could potentially be your mentors you need to be able to communicate that to them to say you know I'm currently in a chief of staff role and I know further down the line I want to be a chief operating officer and you're in a chief operating officer role in this department or this area I'd really love to meet with you and hear about what you're working on and some of the things that you've picked up along the way um and so to that point of being able to know what you want to talk to your mentor about and what you might want to learn from them you also need to be very selfaware about what you can bring to the table as well because um your Mentor if there's someone who is very senior within their position they are going to have a very packed schedule so you want to make sure that um you know what your skill set is that you can bring to them and um be very conscious and not downplay your yourself or your skills even if you're very Junior and early in your career because over you know 12 years of school and four plus years of college you've picked up things that you can share with someone who's more experienced in your field whether it's something like music or current events that you stay up on or even just be being able to give them updates about the business that you're working in or the team that you're working in if you can find a way to make that connection to be able to give back then your Mentor is going to be a lot more willing to be able to spend that time with you just because they know that even though they're in part imparting certain pieces of wisdom on you you're also able to give back and they're able to learn from you as well so um that's one of the things you know when you're when you're fairly early in your career and you feel like you might not have a ton of skills that you can share or teach with somebody else like just squash that because there is and you just need to to hone in on what that is so that you know you're building mutually beneficial relationships can I add to that real quick since we're talking about mentorship I also want to make it known that how I Define mentor sponsor professional buddy however you want to Define it it is someone that can give you something you don't have I don't care how old you are someone's going to come to you with something you don't have and so since we're in this Sacred Space I believe that every space that has black women in it is a Divine and Sacred Space you have a Divine expectation back from the ancestors and to your future children that you can also be a mentor to someone else and I do not care how old they are all this word means is you're going to something someone that has information you do not have and whether that's a strategic plan whether that's a whole job whether that's telling you where the bathrooms are and you can do the same thing and I'm I'm I'm sick and tired and sick and tired of sometimes black people acting like skin folk and not Kinfolk and so we need to squash that right now I do not care how old you are on this on this Summit I do not care what grade you are in school I do not care if you're a new college grad or you are a VP or a CEO of the Fortune 500 company you are also in the Divine position to be a mentor to someone else and it doesn't matter how old they are how much experience they have because you have information that someone may need and you need to remember that do not be in these Tech streets or any corporate Street asking people to give you information and you will not sit there and also do the same thing for someone else that's all I can say to that completely agree so there's a question right here in the chat so thank you there's a lot of questions rolling in I appreciate everyone's questions um this was a question that I wanted to ask too so how do you balance your mental health and wellness especially being like maybe one of the only or feeling underrepresented in these Tech spaces um and let's start off with Alex so I'll start with saying there's a level of mental resilience that you just need to learn to develop because being in any sort of like career is going to is going to try you and you're going to need to find a way to rest and recover because that's part of the resistance so for sure this is an important question so I approach it in two ways the first is one you need to be a whole person even outside of work because that will fill your cup so don't let your job your career become your whole person because that is a recipe for Burnout and lack of satisfaction so make sure to find something fun for yourself every every day every weekend like don't be just your job um second within the office space who was that Coalition that you can build of other likeminded people who can fill you when you aren't as confident or when you are having a harder day or when somebody's Wilding you're like oh my gosh like get that group of people that is just one text away that will jump on a call with you and you can just talk something out I find I have a number of those kind of groups within Twitter and I find that one they put me on many times but they also give me perspective and a great thought partners and that helps me not have any sort of like mental burnout or at least kind of resolves it faster the last piece is I'm gonna flip the premise of the question and I think it actually relates to what Lexi just said if you find yourself as an only which again we're all working to make that not the case but let's be clear black people are like 12 of the population so there's going to be many times you earn only you like this means your perspective is even more valuable because you're fundamentally sitting there with a perspective in a way of looking at a situation that others in the room fundamentally do not have and so instead of being defeated by that kind of concept that you're sitting there and no one else looks like you like own that power and say for my people for the community I am going to be my best and Thrive and make my perspectives known because that is my responsibility like in greatness as being a strong black woman and like really lean into that as your superpower because that is a differentiator um and so that is so so powerful and I actually find that when you lean in um and own with confidence um your black Womanhood um you don't you stopped feeling burnt out by being an only no I couldn't agree more um so let's go on to Diana so um one of one of my tactics for this is trying to think ahead to Future me who might want to commit to a bunch of meetings or might want to commit to going to a bunch of events at work and knowing that um oftentimes the chief of staff space and I'm sure in pretty much any role in Corporate America as well when there's a lot of moving Parts is that you could have your whole day planned out and say okay I'm going to work on these three things today and that is the only thing that I'm working on anybody else is getting you know the shutdown for me and there's always going to be something that comes up that's what they call a fire drill which when you think about those words those don't make any sense but you know it's that one thing that comes up in your day where it basically blows everything out of the water that's the top priority you have to figure out a way to fix this thing today fix this thing before the end of the day it takes all of your focus and your plan for the day whether you planned it weeks ahead months ahead that morning um could just be completely pushed to the side and so one of the things that I've started doing is just building in like a five minute or ten minute meditation break into my day or um during quarantine my excuse was hey I got a puppy now I need to go take my puppy outside and sometimes just those really quick breaks of getting away from your desk um sitting down not looking at your screen just breathing taking a mental pause can really help you um just level set and get yourself kind of hyped up and ready for the next part of the craziness of your day and so those are things that I think um it's a small enough piece of time where you can build it into your day far ahead and say you know this is adjustable even it's five or ten minutes in between any of the meetings that I have and I can just block that out so no one else can block a meeting there and this is time that I'm taking for myself in the middle of a crazy work day so you can go take a walk um outside of the office to the break room go into something that we have in the office at Goldman is focus rooms where you can go in and it's just kind of like a one room with one desk and one computer and you can sit there and you can focus and I usually don't work in those rooms I'll usually just sit in there and sit back and like put on a meditation for five minutes and just like clear my mind and that's one of the ways where um it's really just helped me to recharge in the day because things can get so crazy that you go through and you're not eating lunch you're not taking breaks you're not getting away from your desk those things are not good for your body they're not good for your mind and they're not good for you actually like feeling good about your day feeling productive or feeling like you're making an impact so um just find ways to um build in breaks into your work time into your work day and that will really just help with being able to continue going for the long run which you can kind of expect certain things are going to be a long run type of day or type of job um so yeah just take breaks build that in think ahead no completely agree um and Lexi um we're gonna make this play one um I am a strong proponent of blaming my puppy for everything so I see you Diana and I do it all the time um to um find your why on my desk um at home I have a little piece of paper that I printed out on a printer it's I think fancy and I went to Michael's in the 75 off sale got a little frame for it to make it look cute and on the piece of paper it tells me what I wrote to myself a year ago of why I am in the corporate space what is my why I want to make it very clear that um 99 of people in the world actually don't want to be csuite members they say they do because they've been ingrained to think that um most people don't want to put in the work that it takes to be a csuite member and not only get there but sustain it and that's not a bad thing and so what I always tell people especially black women is that because of white supremacy we've been kidnapped from dreaming and so what does it look like while you're in your corporate Tech world to start dreaming about what you actually want to do with your life and it is completely okay if what you're doing now is what not what you don't want to do at 40 so start thinking about your why and so every time that I'm having a really bad day at work or I'm just mentally not there I look at this little sheet of paper that literally tells me you know Lexi be a year and a half ago said the reason why I'm at Twitter right now is for x and it really calms me it grounds me a little bit and it sometimes gives me that resilience that I can to keep going because it's not about them and I had to learn that late in my career my life and my career in my happiness and my joy is not about anyone but me so it's not about you know Uncle Rufus at the Christmas dinner talking about how you work at XYZ company it's not about him and it's not about someone else in your life saying things like well you travel too much it's not about them sis it's about you you work for a purpose and the first purpose is to make money and so you always want to think about what am I doing with this money what is my why why am I here and I hope and pray that all of you really start figuring out your why whether it's a shortterm why or a longterm why and focus on that that's what you need to do to be successful and and Define yourself for for you and no one else so I just want to be conscientious of time so I'm going to take like one or two more questions from my viewers so one question here is what are some tips for networking successfully especially for introverts or if you have little experience doing it I'll start as I've thought about this because I had an introvert on my team and what well I've had many servers on my team what I challenge this person to do is make it digestible you know break down the goal into something that is actually achievable because that means you'll be more likely to do it so instead of just saying oh my goodness I have to go to a networking event or go to some social happy hour from my company I'm freaking out instead say okay I'm gonna go and I'm gonna talk to three people three people once I do that I'm giving myself permission to leave and that way you are like giving yourself an attainable goal and you know how like okay I've done one I've done these have to be meaningful conversations you can't just go say hi and leave that's not the point but like giving yourself an attainable goal in your networking efforts after a networking event I think will help you get out of your box a little bit because you've gamified it um you've made it kind of a goal based initiative and I think that will be incredibly helpful also find like have like one or two strong opening lines or questions prethought out so that way you don't feel the need to always just be thinking on your feet if that's not your strong suit so like come to the event again preparedness with like here's like the two three questions I want to ask to these two or three people and then work the room that way that's one way to get out of your own way thank you and um just to follow up on that as a introvert myself I don't like going to networking events but um one of the big things as a chief of staff that you do is end up just talking to a lot of different people from a lot of different areas because you have to so um for me um if I'm feeling a little bit discouraged or feeling like I don't necessarily want to sit here and you know meet a bunch of new people and try and figure out new ways to connect I have a goto a couple goto coworkers where I'll ask them to tag along with me and oftentimes um I'll tell them you know hey I want to go to this networking event and this is my goal and so they're not necessarily there to you know dominate conversations and kind of carry the carry things along but it's more of like a little bit of a social cushion um someone that I'm comfortable with someone who I know can help play a conversation off of um someone who if I feel like I'm getting back into my introvert bubble I know that having them there even if they're just kind of standing by and they're mingling on their own that's something that just is like a little bit of a safety net for me so um that's something that works for me but you kind of just have to figure out ways that work for you whether it's preparing a few questions preparing a few things that have happened recently in your life things that you've achieved that you can mention or having someone there who you know will help make you comfortable in those conversations and just going and doing it because at the end of the day you still do have to go out and have to meet new people make those connections learn from people be able to contribute to conversations and different things it's really imperative for your career so um brainstorm different ways that you can do it based on what your personality type is like and what you're comfortable with and what you know will push you but at the end of the day you just have to find a way to get it done no I completely agree so just being conscientious of time we heard a lot today a lot of gems were dropped from okay how do we Network how do we advocate for ourselves how do we get to that bag most importantly um so thank you all for your time today and participating I know I personally learned a lot and I'm sure everyone in the audience did as well um so going forward what is the best way to stay in touch with you and also let's see how do the girls access the sister Circle um sister circle is very easy if you go to the website www.sista Circle um sista and then Circle bwit.com you can find information there or also on Facebook and Linkedin I will say the Facebook group is popping it's hilarious so I'd highly recommend joining that if you want midday Chuckles um and then how do you find me if you actually look me up on LinkedIn at Lexi B you will you will find me I think I'm the only Lexi be on LinkedIn that's the goal um or at least the only black one which is even a bigger goal um and then I'm also on Twitter and Instagram at Lexi B speaks but please if you reach out and you ask for a coffee I will give it to you I can't speak for Alex and Diana I'm not gonna clear up you know pack their schedules that's rude but I I make it a point to connect with black women because I think it's very very very important so if you reach out I will find time to talk to you that is a promise um for me um you can find me on LinkedIn Diana Tate I am definitely the only Diana and definitely the only Deanna Tate so um you feel free to message me and I'll most likely move things to email because uh trying to answer too many things from email and Instagram and Linkedin and any other platform is a little overwhelming for me so um do feel free to reach out or get connected um I post a lot about Goldman Sachs and black girls codes so you know I look forward to speaking with you more I I love that and I think we all would reach we would have a conversation with people just for the record um best way to reach me is on Twitter at Alex kennedy44 there are other Alex Kennedys on LinkedIn um you I'm Alexandra Kennedy on LinkedIn send me a message if you you know on LinkedIn or again the DMS are open on Twitter Alex Kennedy 44. just using that like I swear to you what's unique about the Twitter platform is people shockingly respond to DM messages on Twitter so use that as a networking vehicle because when you are adding a CEO or messaging just a random celebrity or Tech Enthusiast they actually respond um it is a communication and connection vehicle so make sure you're using your social media wisely no so thank you for sharing and just in case anyone didn't catch those their Twitters or linkedins everything will be linked on our virtual platform as well um so I know I started off this session talking about prizes right so I said there's three codes the first one was gems hashtag gems um but how do you access the other one you can fill out the survey we really appreciate that um it's linked at the description box of the session um you can also get the other code by watching the post Roll video that will come to screen once the session ends making sure that you follow black girls code and all of our social media platforms Instagram Twitter everything um and join the alumni mailing session if you haven't um in terms of our next event it will be in October where we're just discussing okay how do we Network effectively efficiently in being intentional um and word on the street you can get a sponsorship to afrotech so if that doesn't incentivize you enough more details are to come and thank you so much for everyone all the attendees all the participants just for making the space you know so great and dropping all these gems so thank you so much
