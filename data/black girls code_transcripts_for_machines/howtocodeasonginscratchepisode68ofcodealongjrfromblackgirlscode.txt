hi I'm kaani and I'm your host for calong today we're going to dive into something super fun making our very own music in scratch that's right by the end of this session we'll have our own unique piece of music remember if you need a refresher make sure to check out the first video in the series where I teach the basics of coding and scratch let's go coders for my music piece today I want to create a hiphop style beat coming from a boom box and a speaker my favorite place to dance with my friends is on the playground at recess let's build that together you can code along with me and build the same project as I do or build your very own piece of music I'm going to change my background to the playground and delete the cat Sprite since there's no cats allowed in school of course next I'm going to add two instruments a boom box and a speaker I'll drag and drop the one green flag click block to the scripts area of the boom box then the play sound until done block from The Sound tab this will make sure that as soon as my project begins music will play to start building my music p piece I'll need to click on the sound tab I'll click choose the sound at the bottom of the page then I can choose from different categories on the navigation bar I'm going to choose a sound from Loops sounds from the loops category repeats a sound a couple times unlike other sounds that play once I'll choose the dance slowmo sound but feel free to play around with all the different sounds before choosing your own there are so many cool ones to choose from I'm going to choose trombone from the drop down menu then click the green flag excellent I want the sound to keep playing forever so I'll add the forever block from the control tab now that I've created my Baseline sound I can add other sounds to it I'm going to broadcast another block to start a different sound once I click the green flag in scratch we can make Sprites communicate when a message is broadcasted by one Sprite then the other Sprite or Sprites can receive the broadcasted message and perform a set of actions I can add the broadcast message block from the events tab then add a start second sound message next I'll click on the speaker and add the when I reive message block to the scripts area select the message from the drop down menu and add another play sound drum funky until done underneath sounds kind of funny to read all out loud but remember we read the code from top to bottom now I'll click the green flag and hear how it sounds wow that actually sounds terrible I'm going to choose another song for the tempo let's try this one out I'll change drum funky to crowd laugh now I'll add the forever block to keep the tempo going great that sounds better much better in scratch you can also add more actions to your music by downloading the music extension below a new music tab will appear in the block palette the music extension includes blocks that let you play different musical instruments set the tempo play notes or drums for a certain beat and create more complex musical patterns the possibilities are endless in the speaker Sprite I'm going to add the play drum bass drum for .1 beats block under under the play sound block change the drum to open high hat and point one to one this will make my beat sound even cooler okay now I feel good about how my speaker sounds I want to add some beats to the radio Sprite on the radio Sprite I want to add a wait for 1 second block this will add a pause to the beat before it starts again I want to signal for the beat to start again with a side stick sound so I'm going to add a rest for 25 beats block followed by another play drum for 25 seconds I'll try changing drum to side stick and 25 to one remember you can play around with all the options you want to find the sound you like best now I'll press the green flag and listen to what I created okay I like it scratch is so awesome because it gives us so many ways to customize our sounds watch this in the sounds tab I'm going to click on the crowd laugh sound then play around with the different effects you'll see a purple box appear and you can change its width I'm going to select the first portion of the sound and click louder a few times from the options below then I'll test out the new sounds in the scripts area that sounds all I think I should play with the sound some more I'm going to select the whole sound then reverse it to make the middle section a little louder wow that sounds interesting but I like it let's take it a step further and create a beat with the music blocks I think adding a piano to the playground will be just the right touch I think I want the piano to make a familiar sound so I'll make the tempo sound like a nursery rhyme let's add some starter blocks when I click the piano I want to start my first tune on Loop then add a snare like tune on top of my Loop to do this I'll add the following blocks when this Sprite clicked broadcast to start tuned forever now I'll add four play out 60 for 25 beats each number refers to a sound frequency and each frequency is assigned to a note on the piano I'm going to click on 60 from the second block you should see a small piano click the top arrows to move up and down the piano to find higher or lower notes you can also change how many times the notes play per turn currently the first block is at 25 so I'm going to change it to5 and I'll change the second block to 0.1 let's repeat the same pattern for our last two blocks okay time to test out what we have so far by clicking on the piano you can press the stop sign on the top of the stage to stop and reset the sound now I'm going to choose my snarelike sound to play with my Keynotes add don't when I receive my message and a forever block to the script area I'm going to play another instrument so let's add play drum open high hat for One Beat Let's test it out by clicking on the keyboard wow now we have two different ways of creating our own music we can choose from different blocks of the sound Tab and put the various sounds on a loop we can also use the music extension to add different instruments and notes to create Unique Sounds let's play this all together how awesome does that sound we're true music producers the next step is to save our work we have to give our project the title and click save now in the top right hand corner or go to and select save now if you want to share your music and you absolutely should then click the share button if you want a closer look at my project be sure to click the project link below this is kaani signing off from the code zone until next time coders
