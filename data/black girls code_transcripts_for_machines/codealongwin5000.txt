hello everyone I'm Jillian and I want to welcome you to the code Zone where each week we learn how to code the coolest projects together so today I have a very special announcement to make but before I do if you're new here allow me to humbly brag about all the incredible art we've coded together over the past several weeks and now I want to challenge you to take these skills we've learned together and apply them to making your very own digital art for a chance to win drum roll please um sorry hang on just a moment there's someone at the door BRB Mackenzie oh my gosh everyone this is so exciting we have a stem Superstar with us in the code Zone please meet my girl Mackenzie Mackenzie what are you doing here um you asked me to come help you with the big announcement oh yeah okay so can I spill it by all means today we are announcing that we are giving away thousands of dollars in scholarship money to you catching and all you need to do is code a piece of digital art and share it with us for a chance to win all the information you need to enter is right here at this link and all the skills you need to make your own digital art are available to you for free in our coding digital art with meaning in p5js series on YouTube so I just want to chat with you a little bit Mackenzie about this opportunity and what it means for high schoolers like you first please take a moment to introduce yourself to our viewers hi everyone I'm Mackenzie and I'm a 10th grader from South Carolina I love coding in anything Sim related for example I love robotics I've been participating in competing in robotics since third grade I started as one of the team Builders and then I eventually became a programmer I've done Lego robotics and tetric robots through several stem camps I attended I fell in love with coding well McKenzie is basically a stem celebrity I mean she was chosen as a rising star to represent her home state of South Carolina as part of the million girls moonshot flight crew tell us a little bit about that so Milling girls moonshot is a youth program whose mission is to amplify the power of using after school and stem learning to engage 1 million more girls in stem I'm so honored they chose me and I'm hoping I can share my love coding to inspire more girls to get into Tech okay so Mackenzie what would you say to our viewers out there who are thinking about coding a piece of art to get some of this scholarship money but are maybe too nervous or aren't sure about it what would your advice be coding seemed really intimidating to me at first when I went to my first robotics meeting they were only boys and it was a very scary experience for me but I am so glad that I stuck with it because there are so many amazing things you can build with code it's kind of like learning a new language it takes practice and hard work but the great thing is you don't have to do it alone you can code with your friends or you can even cut along with Jillian she's an amazing teacher give coding a try it opened up so many doors for me and I know it can do the same for you too amazing okay everybody you heard it from Mackenzie give this a try we can't wait to see what you create and we can't wait to give away this scholarship money to you our brilliant code visit this link to get all the info you need to submit your digital art thanks so much for watching and remember stay cute and stay coding foreign
