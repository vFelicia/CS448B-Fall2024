as a software engineer at write games I usually start by waking up either going into the office or starting at home and then I'll start with the stand up so we can discuss what we were doing the previous day any blockers that we need to go through and any tasks that we're going to take on that day then we move on to those tasks and sometimes we work independently or sometimes you work individually on a task you know when I wrap up a task I can have someone else on the team or some content developers on the team validate it moving into done and then you continue on to the next task and you get a really nice overview of a lot of different things in my particular area but you know there's different teams that you can work on in engineering and it's all just really fun to work with a lot of different people
