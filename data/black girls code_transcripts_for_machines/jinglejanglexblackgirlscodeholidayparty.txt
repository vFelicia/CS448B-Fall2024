now when i rewatch the film that's all i'm gonna see i know guys can you sing it for us for a bonus point oh okay we bout to have some fun right now good afternoon everyone my name is isis miller and i'm the community and events manager for black girls code it truly warms my heart to welcome you amazing girls to our jingle jangle a christmas journey holiday party you're already making my spirit bright with your festive sweaters and your beautiful faces today we are honored to have lynn's sister talbert the producer of jingle jangle and diana bob nikova who played young jessica lynn and diana meet our student ambassadors for black girls code all of whom have worked so hard this year to empower girls to pursue their passion for stem so let's jump right into it so we're gonna play a little holiday trivia game this is how it's gonna work i'll ask a question related to the holidays like what is a gingerbread house made out of and if you know the answer obviously it's gingerbread you'll raise your hand i'll call on you and then you can unmute yourself and you'll be able to ask our cast some questions you ready to play some trivia okay sweet we're gonna complete the sentence oh the weather outside is frightful alyssa i saw your hand first go for it but the fire is so delightful delightful indeed yes girl all right so do you have a question for lynn or diana what was your favorite part of the film i really love to watch the tunnel scene when they're going through the tunnel saving buddy and it's like a roller coaster ride because it's so intense you're just like you know everything comes so close to when they're about to hit something you're like so i kind of like that i really like that scene as well okay next trivia question what famous holiday drink is called milk punch oh camille your hand went right up okay i believe it's eggnog fantastic nailed it i wouldn't have known that like milk punch grubs was there any um humorous behind the scenes that any of the cast had there was a moment where we had to do a very serious scene but i just couldn't stop laughing um when don juan gets stolen by mouse we have to run up being really really sad but i just went out and started laughing thank god i could hide my face into her coat so i was like i know it really looked like she was just crying her eyes out but she was high it was something sad i was supposed to be crying you didn't say which way that's right that was perfect i love hearing the bloopers because now when i rewatch the film that's all i'm gonna see were you ever nervous or like at a scene or in a park yeah that there was some parts i was nervous but i didn't take nerves as a bad thing i take it as something to drive me through the scene so i take it as it means that i actually care about it so then if i'm nervous i just use that to embrace the character more that's some really good advice i wish you were there to help me talk me through my moments of nervousness where i'm just like profusely sweating like i am right now misty glow on my face so next question this is probably my favorite all i want for christmas is you is the biggest selling holiday song of all time by a female artist can you name that singer camilla i saw you girl i see you go for it um by mariah carey yes can you sing it for us for a bonus point um okay i won't do that to you that's mariah too much range so i rewatched it multiple times and kind of on each run i noticed something new about it so on the second run i started noticing kind of like the instrumentals and the music that was being played do you have any like insight on explaining some of the instrumental or music choices so we had an amazing composer named john debney who did the score for the film you know music is very important in a film because it takes you in all different directions and you don't even realize it if you watch dialogue in a film or you're watching you know two actors engage you may be sitting there you're feeling one way when you're watching it and you're like okay and then as soon as they lay a bed of music on it it takes you somewhere else completely music will always help with that just like when you're watching and you hear you see that snowball scene and you hear the music that boom boom boom you like oh okay we bout to have some fun right now you know but then when you hear the music when they are just now bringing buddy after they've taken him from gustafson's to put him back together it's like oh you know it's heartwrenching all right well we're gonna wrap it up because that's all the time that we have for today of course thank you all for making this holiday party so fun and merry and bright thank you lynn thank you diana for joining us and of course for making
