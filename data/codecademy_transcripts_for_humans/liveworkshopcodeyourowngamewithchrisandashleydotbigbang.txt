00:06 - community manager for D big bank and
00:08 - Ashley if you want to say hello hi I'm
00:10 - Ashley um I'm a community engineer for
00:13 - do Bing So today we're going to chat to
00:17 - you about a really exciting project that
00:20 - will be exceptionally relevant to
00:22 - everybody in here so okay I say everyone
00:26 - in here my assumption is that everybody
00:28 - here is from the typescript um courses
00:32 - and is interested in in typescript um so
00:37 - let me
00:38 - just paste this in chat right now if you
00:42 - click on that
00:44 - link you will go to.big bang.com so for
00:47 - those of you who might be watching this
00:51 - later I am going to screen share so then
00:55 - people can
00:56 - see um I've got my notes on there if I'm
01:00 - looking over there you know why so what
01:03 - we're going to do today is we're going
01:05 - to take a look at do big
01:07 - bang we're gonna have a look at all the
01:09 - cool
01:10 - features uh and we're going to
01:13 - demonstrate why Big Bang is an excellent
01:18 - playground for you typescript people uh
01:21 - typescript Learners um to make games
01:24 - it's a great platform for that so first
01:27 - of all uh Ashley could you post the link
01:31 - to the login and sign up for me
01:36 - so on Big Bang you can see we've got all
01:39 - sorts of games on the front page and
01:42 - we've got lots of um feature content
01:44 - we've got uh all sorts of awesome games
01:49 - and objects that people have
01:51 - made um you can just click on any of
01:55 - these and just jump straight in you
01:56 - don't need an account or anything if you
01:59 - click on log in and you
02:03 - actually I click the right one thank you
02:06 - uh if you sign up for an account then
02:09 - what you'll be able to do is make stuff
02:11 - and it'll all be
02:13 - saved in your avatar in your profile on
02:16 - the top right so here is everything that
02:19 - I've ever made here is all the objects
02:23 - so like I can type in wac which I always
02:26 - tag my objects for weekly art challenge
02:28 - so this is just
02:30 - objects that I've made using the voxal
02:32 - object editor in the browser and then
02:34 - the games that I've
02:36 - made they're all like little prototypes
02:38 - and messing about and stuff like that
02:42 - um so I'm going to customize my
02:46 - avatar
02:48 - uh this is actually incredibly bad
02:51 - because I have a custom
02:54 - avatar um so like you can change your
02:57 - face but I've just realized
03:00 - my custom avatar gets overridden by the
03:02 - default character so if we if we pretend
03:05 - that I'm not a wizard none of this blue
03:07 - wizard stuff exists I can
03:10 - like change my avatar
03:13 - Parts um and I can be a clown with some

06:25 - congregate when we want to try something
06:28 - new I think it's because I'm screen
06:30 - sharing to be
06:32 - honest when are we building our own
06:34 - RuneScape Chris I've actually done that
06:38 - F I've actually been prototyping like a
06:41 - Skills game so Ashley could you do me a
06:44 - favor uh and post a link to chase heroes
06:49 - yes oh yes it's definitely just a few
06:52 - lines of
06:54 - C uh we'll get into coding and stuff
06:57 - later um Ash asley has now posted a link
07:00 - to chase Heroes if people want to come
07:03 - join us so this game is super super easy
07:07 - hey Jamie welcome this game is super
07:10 - super easy to understand it's an obacle
07:13 - course um this was actually showcased
07:15 - from GDC um fairly
07:19 - recently whoa that is L give me one
07:25 - second there we go oh it's Ashley hello
07:29 - so
07:29 - you can actually see on my oh my screen
07:32 - share
07:35 - stopped there we go so we can see that
07:40 - the all the Shadows have been disabled
07:42 - on my on my game because my laptop
07:46 - struggling a little bit with all the
07:47 - windows opening the screen share it's
07:49 - automatically being more performant I
07:52 - can screen share on my computer too I'm
07:55 - working on a a big monstrous gaming
07:58 - computer you want to do that that is
08:00 - totally up to you yeah that's right uh
08:04 - NY Alco
08:08 - so oh I guess I'm going
08:11 - [Laughter]
08:13 - over
08:15 - uh so yeah all of the games that you see
08:19 - on D bang on the front page in the hub
08:23 - have been made using the inine TS so we
08:28 - have scripting
08:29 - we have um our Vox object editor we have
08:34 - our game editor and all of those are
08:39 - free um oh oh no oh I've been squished
08:43 - no it's a
08:47 - disaster um
08:50 - and I realize I'm concentrating more on
08:52 - the game than I am talking to
08:55 - everybody so like you'll notice that
08:57 - everybody's just running around doing
08:59 - their own thing playing the game and
09:01 - it's all Network this is by
09:04 - default um so it makes making
09:07 - multiplayer games super super easy as
09:10 - you saw with me just send with Ashley
09:12 - just sending a link sharing the games
09:16 - that you make and getting testers in and
09:19 - that sort of thing super super easy to
09:21 - do it's it's rudimentary at this point
09:25 - um and you don't have to do
09:27 - anything that's like one of the mo one
09:31 - of the things that Drew Drew me to this
09:34 - because I was actually just a
09:37 - user uh a couple of years ago and I got
09:40 - really excited about the project
09:43 - started um learning how to script and
09:48 - making stuff and it's super super
09:51 - cool and now we're here with you
09:55 - guys uh you should be able to click your
09:58 - car ah I just read the comment
10:02 - actually so yeah
10:08 - uh oh no how's everybody else doing oh I
10:11 - can see you behind me
10:13 - Ashley
10:15 - hello I've only played this game a few
10:21 - times I know right it's incredible don't
10:24 - forget if you have any questions at all
10:27 - for us throughout this feel free to post
10:29 - them in chat and uh and we'll get around
10:32 - to go one sure we answer your questions
10:36 - uh so we have a whole bunch of creators
10:39 - on the platform some make boxel objects
10:44 - some script some make call
10:48 - games all of that's just available for
10:52 - you I forgot to mention that also if
10:58 - you're if you can access chromium on
11:01 - your device so be it a tablet or phone
11:04 - or
11:07 - whatever I made it yeah
11:10 - sorry uh dot Big Bang runs in any
11:13 - Chromium browser it also runs in Safari
11:16 - and all sorts of other things as well uh
11:19 - but it it works best on Chrome um and
11:22 - there's a couple reasons for that uh
11:24 - such as the console uh the dev tools
11:27 - right so that's it for a quick
11:30 - demonstration uh in terms of the
11:33 - platform uh sorry in terms of um play
11:38 - players perspective what I'm going to
11:40 - quickly do I've just looked at the time
11:42 - I'm a little behind but so we'll try and
11:44 - catch up I'm going to quickly do is I'm
11:46 - G to make a voxal
11:48 - object H so um if we are in our profile
11:53 - we've got create new voxal object or
11:56 - we've got a hamburger menu on the top
11:58 - right to create an object and then it
12:00 - will give us some start stuff that we
12:02 - can choose from so I'm just going to
12:05 - pick a blank one so uh we have our
12:09 - little Color
12:10 - Picker and then I can just left click
12:13 - because I'm adding a
12:15 - voxel uh or I can get rid of them now
12:20 - what I'm going to do is use some super
12:24 - super simple
12:26 - shapes and I'm going to make like a
12:28 - little plat form and then what Ashley's
12:30 - going to do she's going to do some cool
12:32 - stuff with
12:34 - that uh
12:40 - [Music]
12:42 - so Chris I don't know if you mentioned
12:44 - this um is this a collaborative sandbox
12:48 - could both of you be working on the same
12:50 - project that is exactly what we will be
12:53 - doing later so um the
12:57 - actual
12:59 - the end the way the engine's buildt
13:01 - means
13:03 - that in a minute in in a few minutes
13:05 - everybody will be able we'll send a link
13:08 - out and everybody will be building
13:11 - together there's no um build time if you
13:16 - change a variable the effect of it is
13:19 - instant it's all it basically it's like
13:21 - Google
13:22 - Docs and do you have do you have
13:25 - permissions where people can see but not
13:27 - edit yes so if I come up here um let's
13:30 - just do uh random
13:33 - platform code
13:36 - academy uh Capital C please friend right
13:39 - so we can see published usable by others
13:42 - and remixable published means that
13:43 - anybody can see it uh usable by others
13:46 - means that people can use it in their
13:48 - projects and remixable means that they
13:51 - can somebody can make a copy own copy
13:54 - and edit it freely and the same is true
13:57 - for gains as well
14:00 - um I don't
14:04 - know bear with me one
14:06 - second I had a plan in mind
14:12 - uh that's not it
14:15 - [Music]
14:18 - oh do you know what this will
14:21 - do so I'm just going to use the fill
14:24 - tool now come down here add a
14:30 - and I'm just going to
14:33 - do something that doesn't look terrible
14:39 - hopefully uh I'm going
14:41 - [Music]
14:44 - to oh my goodness this is terrible it's
14:47 - fine this is a speed build and I'm not
14:50 - an artist as such so this is totally
14:53 - fine
14:56 - uh what is this ashle I don't know what
14:59 - this is I think it's
15:03 - awesome I don't know what it is either
15:05 - but
15:06 - I
15:08 - cookie I think uh I'm I'm rushing too
15:12 - much rather than enjoying the
15:14 - process are you trying to make a
15:17 - coin
15:19 - uh I'm attempting to make a
15:22 - platform that Ashley can then use will a
15:25 - coin work for you as well
15:27 - Ashley yeah coin would work we can make
15:30 - a coin pick up all right
15:33 - so
15:36 - uh so I'm that's it we're done we're
15:40 - done we made a coin it's got a see on it
15:42 - it's the Chris
15:46 - coin so I'm just going to rotate the
15:48 - front this way and make
15:51 - sure the origin fine right I've saved it
15:54 - that's it
15:55 - done so there are tons of tools in the
15:58 - Vox object editor um we've made a coin
16:02 - it's a bit rubbish but that's totally
16:04 - fine because we can change that later on
16:07 - so Ashley would you like to do something
16:11 - cool with this coin that I've made sure
16:15 - um first I'm gonna could I would you
16:18 - mind stopping okay you stopped sharing
16:19 - your screen so I'm going to take over
16:21 - before I do anything I'm just going to
16:24 - do a grand tour of making a game um
16:29 - so that people know how to start that
16:32 - process
16:33 - Etc um so sharing my
16:38 - screen do big bang There we go so you've
16:42 - seen it before here it is not B bang.com
16:46 - um so you can just go so that was create
16:48 - objects that was making voxal objects
16:50 - that's where you'd make all your art for
16:54 - your games um and then if you click
16:57 - build games you're going to get this
16:59 - screen that gives you a bunch of
17:01 - examples to start from so there's an
17:03 - empty game we have like some templates
17:06 - for starter games uh if you want to have
17:09 - something already there to work with so
17:11 - we've got like an Obby an FPS um this
17:14 - intro to Magic just kind of shows you
17:15 - the basics of scripting um like how to
17:17 - move something how to make a door open
17:21 - uh how to send events uh then this other
17:23 - scripting examples shows like a lot more
17:26 - advanced stuff um and then some
17:29 - environment design examples so you can
17:30 - pick whatever you want as a starter I
17:32 - usually go for the empty game um and
17:36 - then you're in here and you're ready to
17:37 - start editing but I'm actually going to
17:40 - edit a game that is uh that we can all
17:44 - edit together in a little bit uh that I
17:46 - prepared for this so oh let me reload
17:50 - this um so I'm just going to give a tour
17:54 - of what our game editor looks like if
17:56 - you've used any other game engines uh
17:59 - some of the stuff might be familiar but
18:01 - you don't need to have any experience
18:03 - with um making games to jump in um so
18:06 - you're just going to click edit Ashley
18:09 - you're no longer screen sharing oh no
18:12 - wrong tab there we go I closed the other
18:14 - one here we go we're in a game I press
18:17 - edit button and there we are so you're
18:19 - going to see a couple things on the
18:22 - screen I'm going to just start with one
18:24 - part at a time at the bottom of the
18:26 - screen um you'll see
18:29 - resources that you can drag into your
18:33 - game so at first we have all the
18:35 - resources the voxal objects that are
18:37 - being used in this game so we have all
18:40 - these arms and butterflies and stuff so
18:44 - if I wanted to add something else I can
18:46 - just drag it in from the bottom um you
18:49 - can also look at all voxal objects that
18:51 - have been made by other creators that
18:53 - have been made public so I can look
18:55 - through these are kind of like some of
18:57 - our featured objects
18:59 - can look through these and drag them in
19:02 - this is like a crazy dragon that
19:06 - someone that Veria
19:09 - made um which is a really cool
19:12 - detailed voxal object um so you can look
19:16 - through ones that other people have made
19:18 - you can filter by your own objects
19:21 - here's a cat on a pogo stick that I made
19:23 - about a week ago um so that's pretty
19:26 - pretty cool
19:29 - and um and then you can search by term
19:34 - so Chris what was your coin called that
19:36 - you just
19:39 - made it it's
19:42 - called
19:44 - Uh oh it's currently saving oh it's
19:47 - called in fact just type in code academy
19:51 - it's code academy coin
19:54 - Cod Academy coin there we go so I
19:57 - actually can just uh drag in this coin
20:02 - that Chris made like moments ago and now
20:05 - it's in my game so it's really great for
20:06 - like work when you're working with an
20:07 - artist on a game as they're making art
20:10 - you'll have it available um immediately
20:14 - as soon as they save it um and then in
20:17 - terms of extensive knowledge of
20:19 - typescript um I mean I had never used
20:22 - typescript when I first started using
20:24 - doig bang I kind of learned as I went so
20:28 - definitely wouldn't say you need
20:29 - extensive knowledge of typescript
20:31 - there's so much example code which
20:32 - you'll see in a bit um and so much to
20:35 - look at and learn from um that I think
20:40 - you can definitely start with not very
20:42 - much knowledge of typescript and still
20:44 - be able to get the hang of it um it's
20:46 - more about like game development
20:48 - principles than language specific
20:51 - typescript stuff um yeah so that's
20:54 - dragging in voxal objects um which you
20:57 - can do from this panel but there's other
20:59 - tabs you can also drag in scripts from
21:01 - the bottom so we have some featured
21:03 - scripts um that you can just drag on to
21:07 - your object so I'm going to drag this
21:10 - scale script and now my cat
21:14 - is scaling
21:18 - um we've got which one do I like I'll do
21:24 - uh actually I'm going to take the scale
21:26 - script off of this
21:29 - scale this down oh I didn't even show
21:31 - off the transform tool so once you put
21:34 - an object into your game um we've got
21:37 - just some transform gizmos you can move
21:41 - it around in space scale it have it
21:44 - stick to a surface of something um
21:46 - there's also just a move tool rotate
21:48 - tool a scale tool things that you wouldd
21:50 - expect from a game engine
21:53 - um and I can add like this p script to
21:59 - this cat and now this cat is going to
22:02 - follow around the player um you can also
22:06 - search these are just the the featured
22:09 - scripts we have ones that we think
22:10 - people will want to use a lot in their
22:13 - game but you can search any scripts I
22:15 - can filter by my own scripts none of
22:18 - these are going to be very helpful
22:19 - they're all pretty specific but I can
22:21 - filter by the scripts that I've written
22:23 - um and then just every script that
22:27 - anyone's written
22:28 - um kind of search by a keyword and find
22:33 - something and so that's what you can do
22:35 - in the scripts panel and then there's
22:37 - also one more panel which is templates
22:40 - um templates are my favorite sorry my
22:43 - favorite one out of all tabs yeah so
22:46 - this one is really exciting it's just um
22:49 - entities which is what we call like the
22:51 - objects in the game are called entities
22:54 - in Big Bang um and these are just
22:56 - entities that already have different
22:59 - components attached to them and
23:00 - different behaviors attached to them so
23:03 - I can drag in this toxic
23:08 - Barrel template and now if I go near the
23:11 - barrel it's going to do damage to me
23:13 - within its radius you can see the
23:15 - collider on the barrel when you click on
23:17 - it it's a big radius where it can do
23:20 - damage there's all sorts of stuff in
23:22 - here there's so many fun templates
23:24 - there's a boom box there's a swimming
23:26 - pool which I think actually just got
23:29 - added um does this
23:32 - work I didn't even know we had this
23:35 - let's find
23:37 - out guess it's a swimming pool I only
23:41 - have one heart of Health oh okay there
23:43 - we go and now I'm swimming in a pool so
23:46 - you can just drag this into your game
23:47 - like I haven't even opened the code I
23:50 - haven't even like looked at the entity
23:53 - panel and I've already got a swimming
23:54 - pool with a bouncy diving board so
23:56 - that's pretty cool if I die while
23:59 - editing it um there we go I blew up and
24:03 - I respawned in the pool it's not a bad
24:06 - place to respawn if I died I would not
24:09 - mind respawning in a pool um so there's
24:16 - all sorts of stuff in here Launchpad
24:18 - there's a lot of stuff that's like great
24:19 - for making an obstacle course this
24:22 - Launchpad is a
24:23 - classic um trampoline another classic
24:29 - where am I oh my spawn point is inside
24:31 - of the Dragon I believe and the pool
24:34 - let's move
24:36 - these
24:38 - and
24:41 - so so you can see how some of these
24:43 - templates work
24:46 - um and yeah that was just it just drag
24:50 - dropped them in you can also make your
24:52 - own
24:53 - templates um and save them and then you
24:56 - have access to them so so let's say I
25:00 - we'll get into that as I show the next
25:02 - segment which is the entity panel so
25:06 - I've only just been dragging these
25:09 - entities and voxal objects into the game
25:11 - but if you want to edit them and change
25:13 - their behavior and change in detail how
25:16 - they work you're going to want to look
25:18 - over at this panel on the left side of
25:20 - the screen which we call the entity
25:21 - panel and this will have your object
25:24 - your entity and all of the different
25:26 - components that make it what it is so
25:29 - we'll take a look at this
25:31 - trampoline uh so the entity is
25:34 - trampoline this first component will
25:36 - just tell you what its name is if it has
25:39 - any tags on it which tags could be used
25:41 - for sending events and communicating or
25:43 - just organizing your scene um and if it
25:47 - is a
25:48 - template um you'll have some information
25:50 - about that template
25:52 - um and then the transform will show you
25:56 - its position it scale can see this
25:59 - changing as I move the trampoline around
26:02 - it's
26:03 - rotation um and you can also parent it
26:06 - to another entity so let's say I
26:09 - parented the trampoline to the player
26:13 - which would be really strange thing to
26:16 - do if I did that now the trampoline is
26:20 - uh attached to the player and we'll move
26:23 - around with the player um going to click
26:27 - that out though cuz I don't I don't
26:29 - think I want that in my game um you've
26:33 - also got the Collision component um so
26:35 - there's number of different shapes of
26:36 - colliders right now it's using the voxal
26:39 - object itself as the shape of the
26:41 - collider so when you collide with what
26:43 - you see on the voxal object um that's
26:47 - that's where the Collision is going to
26:48 - exist but you can also make a box a
26:51 - capsule sphere Etc um like you saw with
26:55 - this um toxic Barrel this has a sphere
26:58 - collider a big trigger on it so when you
27:01 - enter that sphere then you take damage
27:05 - um and you can also set it to none but
27:07 - I'm going to keep it at the voxal object
27:10 - Collision um you have your voxal object
27:12 - component so let's say I like this
27:14 - trampoline that I dragged in um but I
27:17 - don't like this foxal object you can
27:19 - change it on the component I can look up
27:23 - other
27:26 - trampolines and
27:28 - oh there's a green
27:30 - one so now I have a different voxal
27:33 - object on my trampoline but everything
27:35 - else stayed the same on the entity so
27:37 - it's still going to behave just the
27:41 - same
27:44 - and then you have the script the
27:46 - trampoline script it's got a description
27:48 - on it so some of our like Dev D Big Bang
27:52 - Dev sanction scripts will have
27:54 - descriptions or ones that other people
27:56 - make so you can read about it um which
27:58 - will help for usability of other people
28:01 - and then I've got all of these exposed
28:03 - properties on the script that I can
28:05 - change so still without having jumped
28:07 - into the code yet there's still a lot I
28:09 - can do to customize my the behavior on
28:13 - this object so I could make the impulse
28:15 - like 1,200 and not require jump
28:20 - and uh I'll just change those and now
28:24 - right when I collide with it I get shot
28:26 - super high to the
28:28 - Skye
28:31 - um so there's also a number of other
28:34 - components that you can add these were
28:36 - just the ones that happen to already be
28:37 - on the trampoline but you can add a text
28:41 - component
28:43 - and change the color of the text change
28:46 - what it
28:48 - says
28:50 - um font anything you would expect from
28:54 - text
28:55 - component I don't even know if that's
28:58 - yeah that's how you spell trampoline
29:00 - right I think so
29:05 - um and what if you lost one of your
29:09 - entities while you're making I don't
29:11 - know what you mean by lost like deleted
29:14 - it on it's gone somewhere oh I can't
29:17 - find it okay so I look it over here and
29:20 - I don't know where my entity went so um
29:24 - you can just search up the entity in the
29:27 - upper right hand panel there's an entity
29:31 - search um search bar so I can search I
29:34 - found my trampoline and then if I press
29:37 - the F hot key it'll focus on it and now
29:41 - I'm looking back at it um so you don't
29:44 - have to you can navigate everything
29:46 - that's in your scene
29:48 - um and
29:50 - on the entity there's also we have
29:53 - particles sounds cameras so there's all
29:56 - sorts of different types of uh
29:59 - components you can add a particle effect
30:01 - now there's like
30:03 - particles coming out of the trampoline
30:05 - and you can edit all of this um with
30:09 - code and so if I wanted to make this an
30:11 - invisible object what I would do I'm
30:13 - going to take off the text and the
30:15 - particle component I would go to the Vox
30:17 - object component and I can actually um
30:20 - edit the opacity if I wanted to make it
30:23 - kind of see through or I could just go
30:25 - to the visible property on the Vox
30:28 - object component turn it off and now
30:31 - it's
30:32 - invisible um and if I wanted like right
30:35 - now I can still collide with it but if I
30:38 - wanted it to have I could even just
30:40 - delete the voxal object component in its
30:43 - entirety and not have an voxal object
30:50 - component
30:52 - um to search up other people's create uh
30:56 - created entities so I did that at the
30:59 - bottom if you go to foxal objects on the
31:03 - bottom panel uh make sure you're looking
31:06 - at all instead of this game in that drop
31:09 - down on the right um and then you can
31:12 - search up if you're only looking at this
31:15 - game or mine then um You probably won't
31:19 - be able to find anything but if you make
31:21 - sure you're in the all dropdown you can
31:24 - search anything anyone's made make
31:26 - another that's a cool dragon I actually
31:28 - haven't seen that one
31:30 - before
31:33 - um so other things let's see just making
31:37 - sure I get everything out a little list
31:40 - yes so that was the entity comp panel
31:41 - that the entity panel that's how you um
31:45 - edit your entity and then um up in the
31:50 - upper right corner we've got some other
31:52 - properties that's where you found the
31:54 - search in your game um you can search by
31:58 - all sorts of different things so you
31:59 - don't just have to know the name like I
32:02 - know that these birds have the script
32:04 - called flocking on them so if I want
32:06 - everything that has the flocking script
32:08 - I can search by that script name and
32:10 - it's going to show me the birds and the
32:13 - butterflies and everything with that
32:15 - script on it
32:17 - um you can search by tag there's a bunch
32:20 - of things tag no Ray cast which just
32:22 - means that the ray casts are um ignored
32:27 - by it you can search by anything um you
32:32 - need
32:34 - to and you search by things that have a
32:36 - voxal object
32:38 - component I don't know if you can do
32:41 - that click on the advanced tab I've
32:45 - never done that oh my goodness okay so
32:49 - if I want to look for particle effects I
32:51 - can search by particle effects I can
32:53 - search by text components I guess if
32:55 - only the player has a text component
32:58 - scripts all sorts of things wow I can't
33:00 - believe I didn't know that um that's
33:04 - cool um and then we've also
33:07 - got render settings as well so right now
33:11 - we've got this nice mood going
33:13 - on um and um actually before I get into
33:18 - that I haven't even explained what I'm
33:20 - doing with the camera when you start a
33:22 - game the camera is going to be following
33:24 - the player or whatever custom camera you
33:25 - have set up but you have different
33:28 - camera settings in here so you can while
33:31 - you're editing the game look through the
33:32 - game camera um to see what the game will
33:36 - be rendering there's also a fly camera
33:38 - that you can control with WD you can
33:40 - hold down shift to make it go faster so
33:43 - that's letting me kind of zip around
33:44 - this level really fast um and then
33:47 - there's an orbit camera where you can um
33:50 - click with the r right Mouse button and
33:53 - then orbit with the middle Mouse button
33:56 - um um I like the fly
33:58 - camera and yeah you can change the
34:01 - render settings so I'm going to actually
34:03 - press G to enter the game camera so I
34:05 - can see the fog and everything that's
34:07 - being rendered and then I can kind of
34:09 - just click on these different presets
34:11 - there's a couple different presets in
34:13 - here I think I want oh that one's pretty
34:17 - moody I liked the original one so I'm
34:21 - going to go back until I get the
34:24 - original one back but there's all sorts
34:26 - of different um settings you can change
34:29 - fog
34:30 - Bloom um vignette all sorts so much
34:35 - stuff to explore there's advanced
34:36 - settings with shadows and lights and
34:39 - things that I have an artist typically
34:42 - do cuz it's not really my wheelhouse
34:46 - um
34:47 - and then besides
34:50 - that um oh you can also there's some
34:53 - transform settings too so if you were
34:54 - making a grid or like a tile based game
34:57 - and you don't want to be able to freely
34:58 - move things around um you can hold down
35:03 - shift and it'll move by a set transform
35:05 - amount and you can change that step um
35:09 - to whatever the size so if you made a
35:10 - voxal object that was like 50 by 50 Vox
35:13 - holes and you want to make sure that you
35:15 - make your grid based game um all fit
35:19 - into that without any like
35:20 - free motion you could set your
35:23 - translation step to 50 boxal and then
35:26 - place your grid objects um along that
35:31 - grid and besides that there's just save
35:35 - you save your game up at the top um you
35:39 - can change out your player template here
35:41 - so if you made a custom player with
35:44 - custom scripts you can set your player
35:45 - template here so you can make a 2d game
35:48 - with a custom 2D camera and a custom 2D
35:51 - player so this is what the default
35:53 - player looks like and the default camera
35:55 - looks like but you're not stuck with
35:57 - that you can make a game in first person
36:00 - you can make a top down game um all of
36:03 - that can be customized we just have a
36:05 - default default settings that are easy
36:07 - to work with so people can jump in and
36:09 - not have to worry about getting their
36:10 - movement set up getting their camera
36:12 - Road patient setup and all of that kind
36:14 - of stuff um and then you can also set
36:19 - um
36:21 - oh additional game options yeah so you
36:25 - can set
36:27 - whether the player uses the Avatar or if
36:29 - it uses like a voxal object um and we do
36:34 - have an
36:35 - FPS game
36:37 - um that people can play and remix we
36:40 - have a really good starter kit so if you
36:42 - wanted to make an FPS we have a really
36:44 - good kit for that
36:47 - um yeah this is the the kind of basics
36:50 - of
36:52 - what how to navigate the editor and then
36:56 - for script
36:58 - let me just
37:01 - make something I'm going to make a
37:03 - script that does something just so we
37:05 - can all see it's going to involve this
37:07 - dragon and this thing um so we can see
37:13 - how that scripting looks so I'm just
37:15 - going to make a new script here really
37:17 - quick um see we got 20 minutes left do I
37:19 - have enough time to do this go really
37:22 - fast like speed round of scripting um so
37:26 - I'm going to make a new script up here
37:28 - press
37:29 - new um I'm going to zoom in a bunch of
37:32 - times CU I always forget to do
37:34 - that
37:37 - uh
37:40 - zoom
37:45 - zoom and then now you can see here we
37:49 - are we have our class um so there's a
37:52 - start function that's called um whenever
37:56 - this
37:58 - object starts to exist um so either at
38:01 - the beginning of the game or when it
38:02 - spawned in and then a tick which happens
38:05 - every frame um there's a bunch of
38:07 - builtin functions into our API um and
38:11 - I'm going to use on trigger enter you'll
38:14 - see it's starting to autofill that for
38:16 - me this one takes an entity which is the
38:20 - other entity that collided that
38:22 - triggered with this object um and just
38:26 - going to say if the other entity or if
38:31 - other has the
38:33 - tag player on
38:37 - it um other do send
38:41 - event um I'm going to send an event
38:43 - called
38:46 - enable so I'm also going to uh
38:52 - console.log
38:55 - hit so if we open the console since this
39:00 - is in the web this is in your browser
39:02 - you can just open the like developer
39:05 - tools the chro like I opened the Chrome
39:07 - developer tools and now we have a
39:09 - console that will actually work for
39:11 - debugging our
39:13 - game so what I'm going to do
39:17 - is walk over to my hey Ashley we can't
39:22 - see that currently
39:24 - oh that's
39:27 - um I don't know how to make that
39:30 - work um I guess it's just not part of
39:35 - the screen
39:36 - share but you can use Chrome developer
39:39 - tools um I don't know how to get it to
39:42 - like show up as part of the window in
39:45 - the screen share thing um
39:49 - but I promise I just saw the message in
39:54 - my
39:55 - console um
39:57 - but just to show so we can see something
40:00 - visually
40:03 - um sample trigger
40:06 - script I didn't name the script so I'm I
40:09 - sent that event
40:11 - enable um oh wait I don't want to send
40:14 - it to other I'm going to send it
40:16 - to I'm going to do this. entity do get
40:21 - component by
40:24 - type component type so I'm going to grab
40:27 - a component off of this
40:30 - entity
40:32 - um
40:34 - and I'm going to set it
40:38 - to Invisible when I collide with
40:43 - this
40:45 - um thing so I'm going to collide with
40:48 - this and then I'm going to turn
40:52 - invisible there we go we made something
40:55 - happen not very exciting but
40:59 - um we were able to make something happen
41:02 - very quickly um and so what we wanted to
41:06 - do I would love to spend more time
41:08 - coding um but what we're going to do is
41:13 - show off the multiplayer editing which
41:15 - is one of the most powerful parts of Doc
41:17 - big bang and we haven't even shown you
41:20 - yet
41:21 - um is that we can all edit this game
41:25 - together in real time um I have all this
41:29 - random stuff in here and there's going
41:31 - to be a lot more random stuff added but
41:33 - I'm going to share this link and anyone
41:36 - can jump in here and we can all edit
41:37 - this game together um you can drag
41:40 - objects in you can drag scripts on to
41:42 - objects um and drag in templates we can
41:47 - do all sorts of stuff so got that link
41:51 - shared don't want to get in let me
41:55 - in
41:58 - and uh yes the editor yeah the script
42:01 - editor is super similar to VSS code if
42:03 - you're familiar with that um you can use
42:06 - the console for
42:08 - debugging
42:11 - and um it all runs in typescript it's
42:13 - got really good autofill um and I'm not
42:17 - sure if yeah Chris shared our API
42:20 - documentation so there's tons of example
42:23 - games that'll show
42:24 - you um more more about scripting and do
42:27 - big bang and also you can access scripts
42:31 - that other people have made um at any
42:33 - point in time so if I wanted to to drag
42:37 - in a
42:39 - door here
42:41 - is that's a nice
42:44 - door
42:46 - um they didn't think so though um and if
42:53 - I add if I just open I clicked on the
42:58 - script component and press open and I
43:01 - can search
43:02 - door and let's see dbb door that sounds
43:06 - like a good
43:08 - script and now if I walk over we'll see
43:12 - how it works you can look at the
43:14 - properties but I've got this door that
43:17 - turns to
43:19 - open and you can take a look at the
43:21 - script um I can't edit this cuz it was
43:25 - made by someone else but I can look
43:27 - through and read their code and try to
43:30 - piece together what was going wrong or
43:31 - what was going on I can also remix their
43:34 - script um so you can remix scripts that
43:37 - were made by other people so I can say I
43:39 - really liked this door script that
43:41 - someone made but I wish that it behaved
43:44 - a little bit differently I'm going to go
43:46 - ahead and remix it add my edits to the
43:48 - code and then I'll have my own version
43:50 - of it but I already had a base to start
43:52 - off of um so as long as someone had
43:56 - their script public and they've marked
43:58 - it as remixable then you can remix it um
44:02 - in your game and then it will
44:05 - um and you can make whatever edits you
44:08 - want to
44:11 - it see we've got some coins floating
44:15 - about what do I want to add oh I know
44:18 - what I'm going to add um I'm going to
44:21 - add a really fun template we
44:23 - have where is it
44:35 - uh we have a Jeep
44:38 - template
44:41 - so the console is
44:44 - there I
44:46 - promise oh you press F12 in Chrome oh
44:51 - someone can jump on the back of this
44:52 - Jeep too and again like this Jeep is we
44:56 - have a video oh I wish I had the link on
44:58 - him it would take a second to find it
45:00 - but this Jeep is totally remixable and
45:03 - we even have like detailed documentation
45:05 - and videos of how to reskin the Jeep and
45:09 - add your own art onto it and change the
45:12 - speed and the settings and all sorts of
45:15 - things so lot of uh sharing of knowledge
45:21 - um and it's really easy to to
45:26 - learn things when you have so many
45:28 - resources available to you all the
45:33 - time yeah let us know if anyone has any
45:36 - questions about making games in do bang
45:40 - about how our types scripts and
45:43 - scripting works or anything else you
45:46 - might
45:48 - have I have a question uh Ashley when do
45:52 - you feel what would be your advice for
45:55 - somebody learning to code or learning
45:57 - types script right now in terms of
45:59 - coming here and trying things out do you
46:00 - think that is should be hand in hand
46:02 - like the moment you start learning you
46:04 - should start trying things out or do you
46:06 - think that there's like a natural
46:08 - progression point where people become
46:10 - more uh I guess comfortable using what
46:13 - they know to start building things I
46:16 - think that the best thing you can do is
46:19 - just to like get your hand dirdy and
46:22 - just like jump in I think not being
46:24 - scared to write Cod not like I think
46:27 - it's great to
46:28 - have all of these like resources that
46:31 - you can use but I also think that like
46:34 - just like saying I'm just going to write
46:36 - something and see what happens and just
46:39 - if it doesn't work it doesn't work just
46:41 - like trial and error and just jumping in
46:43 - head first is the best thing that you
46:45 - can do especially think on our platform
46:47 - there's so many so much you can look at
46:50 - so much you can read and like so many
46:52 - things you can see
46:54 - working that there's no harm and just
46:57 - trying to like do it yourself like
46:59 - seeing okay I see this Launchpad I'm
47:01 - going to read through this and then I'm
47:02 - just going to try to write something
47:04 - from scratch like and just see what
47:06 - happens I think that's the best way to
47:08 - start is just not be scared of trying
47:12 - anything and not being scared of
47:13 - breaking
47:19 - things also um at Co Academy we teach
47:22 - typescript more in the context of web
47:24 - development which is a little different
47:26 - than gave Dem mop um do you have you
47:29 - seen in the past some sort of shortfalls
47:32 - or differences where somebody might be
47:34 - used to writing typescript one way
47:37 - coming into something like do big band
47:38 - say oh wow I'm I'm super lost I really
47:40 - don't know because they're just kind of
47:42 - train to expect to use types script in a
47:45 - specific
47:47 - way um yeah I actually haven't talk to a
47:51 - lot of typescript like web developers
47:53 - who've moved to dot Big Bang I think it
47:56 - is very different and it kind of feels
47:59 - different the whole time um that um I
48:04 - haven't seen people really get like
48:06 - tripped up over over like trying to do
48:09 - things one way for web I think that
48:12 - there's kind of a general like a big
48:14 - difference in game development and web
48:17 - development that becomes really obvious
48:19 - like as you're using it um and I think
48:23 - that using typescript for Big Bang will
48:26 - not only make you better at typescript
48:28 - but also will just make you a better
48:30 - game developer in general and then
48:32 - you'll have less trouble next time you
48:34 - try if you ever try a different game
48:36 - engine um you'll learn kind of to move
48:40 - away from like the web development
48:41 - thinking into a game development
48:43 - thinking which I think is just very
48:45 - different and very
48:46 - distinct um so it feels different when
48:48 - you're even if you're using the same
48:50 - language it feels like a very different
48:53 - interface um the um also see the
48:56 - question from Maria what is the most
48:58 - intimidating experience you had coding I
49:01 - think something that intimidates me the
49:04 - most is uh coding 3D
49:08 - physics is um I like using quaternion is
49:14 - how rotation is handled in in 3D space
49:19 - in games and I often that was one of the
49:23 - things that I was always like
49:26 - I'm not going to touch that I'm just
49:28 - going to let it I'll take my time
49:31 - figuring out how that works um and
49:34 - having to just dive in I ended up
49:37 - working on a project that was really
49:38 - physics based and I just dove in and um
49:41 - messed up a bunch and things were
49:44 - rotating all ways that I didn't even
49:46 - know they could rotate and jumping
49:49 - around the screen and eventually after
49:52 - like just struggling and seeing things
49:54 - blow up over and over um I was able to
49:58 - start figuring out how to get it work
50:00 - but um yeah it was definitely really
50:03 - intimidating but I'm glad that I tackled
50:05 - that cuz now I'm not as scared of
50:08 - physics
50:19 - anymore but I will say that one of my
50:22 - favorite things about coding and Dot Big
50:24 - Bang is just having
50:26 - um so many references and like so much
50:29 - material to look at and such a big
50:31 - community of people um we have a big
50:34 - community in Discord where we um the
50:37 - devs are helping out with um people who
50:41 - are making games adop big bang and we
50:42 - help troubleshoot their problems and um
50:45 - since the start I've had my co-workers
50:48 - helping me learn the engine and we're
50:51 - all just working together and remixing
50:54 - each other's code
50:56 - and like learning from each other so
50:58 - it's
50:59 - been uh really nice to get to know the
51:03 - engine and typescript with the help of
51:04 - so many
51:06 - people I'm I'm inclined to agree as well
51:10 - I'm I've done software engineering in
51:13 - the past but not like on a serious level
51:16 - and I found it really
51:18 - straightforward coming to do big bang
51:21 - and learning
51:22 - typescript uh I wouldn't say that I make
51:25 - triaa quality games but I definitely
51:27 - have a a fundamental grasp on um on
51:32 - typescript and how the engine works and
51:34 - I
51:36 - think anybody coming into do big bang
51:39 - with a little
51:40 - experience is just gonna have such an
51:43 - easy time saying right here's a game
51:45 - idea I've had give me 10 minutes and
51:48 - just coming up with something that's
51:51 - really good and really fun and it like
51:55 - said like there's a ton of support um we
51:58 - have people at ashy in the Discord all
52:00 - the time just ready to to help out if
52:04 - you have any questions or anything and
52:07 - we also have a lot of experienced
52:08 - community members as well who who are
52:10 - there for you so it's it's dead easy to
52:14 - get started yeah I also think that like
52:18 - since typescript and JavaScript are
52:21 - widely used languages um and they are
52:24 - less complic ated than some of the other
52:26 - languages that are used in game
52:28 - development like C++ for example um it's
52:33 - uh do gang is a really good place to
52:34 - start your game development Journey just
52:37 - because you're more likely to be
52:38 - familiar with these languages and even
52:40 - if you aren't I think they're a little
52:42 - easier to pick up than some of the other
52:45 - common game engine languages and also if
52:48 - you're making games uh in typescript and
52:50 - big bang you're also learning a coding
52:52 - language that is widely used for we
52:55 - development and all sorts of other
52:56 - applications so it has some nice
52:59 - crossover um which I think is really
53:01 - cool and it's also a nice place to get
53:04 - started in game development if you're
53:05 - coming from web development cuz you kind
53:07 - of already have a lot of that work
53:10 - already
53:20 - done um I have a question in terms of
53:22 - the crossover that you were talking
53:24 - about and learning other languages uh
53:26 - how that helps uh there's always people
53:29 - that come to Cod Academy because they're
53:30 - looking at uh getting a career in Tech
53:34 - or switching careers into Tech
53:36 - so how do you in terms of like writing
53:39 - code adop ban and sharing it outside
53:42 - this is like an easy way to Showcase
53:45 - this in portfolios let's say on your
53:47 - GitHub or things like that is there like
53:49 - a way that you can export this code you
53:51 - just have to copy and paste it is there
53:53 - an easy way for somebody that never useb
53:56 - ban to come in into someone's profile
53:58 - and see what they've build
54:01 - codewise yeah so it isn't it is just
54:04 - kept within the platform the code so you
54:07 - could copy and paste it but also because
54:10 - um everything is public and immediate
54:13 - like you can send a link and someone can
54:15 - play it immediately so if you're trying
54:17 - to build up something for your portfolio
54:19 - you could show off your game that you
54:21 - made instantly without having to take
54:24 - videos it or have like a download link
54:27 - on itch or something like that you could
54:29 - just say like hey here's a link to what
54:31 - I made if they wanted to look at the
54:33 - code you could copy and paste it and put
54:35 - it into GitHub or you could um if they
54:38 - had an account they could look through
54:40 - your game and see the code that you've
54:43 - that you made um but right right now
54:46 - there isn't like a site where you can go
54:49 - like externally look at just the code
54:52 - part like how you would use GitHub but I
54:54 - do think at least sending a link to your
54:57 - game and being able to immediately show
54:59 - someone what you made um can be really
55:01 - helpful to show what you've been able to
55:04 - create

Cleaned transcript:

I think we're recording now yeah we're good hello everyone I'm Chris I'm a community manager for D big bank and Ashley if you want to say hello hi I'm Ashley um I'm a community engineer for do Bing So today we're going to chat to you about a really exciting project that will be exceptionally relevant to everybody in here so okay I say everyone in here my assumption is that everybody here is from the typescript um courses and is interested in in typescript um so let me just paste this in chat right now if you click on that link you will go to.big bang.com so for those of you who might be watching this later I am going to screen share so then people can see um I've got my notes on there if I'm looking over there you know why so what we're going to do today is we're going to take a look at do big bang we're gonna have a look at all the cool features uh and we're going to demonstrate why Big Bang is an excellent playground for you typescript people uh typescript Learners um to make games it's a great platform for that so first of all uh Ashley could you post the link to the login and sign up for me so on Big Bang you can see we've got all sorts of games on the front page and we've got lots of um feature content we've got uh all sorts of awesome games and objects that people have made um you can just click on any of these and just jump straight in you don't need an account or anything if you click on log in and you actually I click the right one thank you uh if you sign up for an account then what you'll be able to do is make stuff and it'll all be saved in your avatar in your profile on the top right so here is everything that I've ever made here is all the objects so like I can type in wac which I always tag my objects for weekly art challenge so this is just objects that I've made using the voxal object editor in the browser and then the games that I've made they're all like little prototypes and messing about and stuff like that um so I'm going to customize my avatar uh this is actually incredibly bad because I have a custom avatar um so like you can change your face but I've just realized my custom avatar gets overridden by the default character so if we if we pretend that I'm not a wizard none of this blue wizard stuff exists I can like change my avatar Parts um and I can be a clown with some stuff this looks really bad apologies and then you can like save it and like add accessories and those kinds of things right so that's part of the user experience what I'm going to do next now for anybody who signed up what we're going to do is we're going to join the Hub right so an incredible thing about W bang is we're completely web based all of our tools and all of our games are on your browser so I'm going to send you this link and what you're able to do is you're able to just join me no download no nonsense and we'll see if we can get a few people together uh anything you'd like to add anything I've forgotten Ashley if you don't have an account as well you just won't have so interesting okay we're in cool so all of this oh R hello it's you it's Ashley so everything in do big bang can easily be so asy doing emotes me doing emotes jumping anything related to automatically yes that's right press Escape if you w to get your hello people hello so this is our H world don't tell anybody but we're we're we're doing a new one it's amazing have you seen it yet actually excited that's really cool I can't wait yay I can see wacko from the chat or wo hello so you can press any of the uh one to nine and you can do little emotes so just have a Wonder round so we got like lots of um games that you can play in here in the Coliseum things like pocket Garden Ashley are you noticing what I'm noticing what you have the top Fisher thing I noticed that no the The Walking oh I didn't I didn't know this so yeah Ashley and I are just going to chill fishing for it a little bit oh that is really strange what is going on there um oh my God so yeah we've got like you can fish and then you can sell your pets and then you can sell your pets sell your fish um grab some pets and they can follow you around and we've got like quests and this is just just the whole world where we all kind of congregate when we want to try something new I think it's because I'm screen sharing to be honest when are we building our own RuneScape Chris I've actually done that F I've actually been prototyping like a Skills game so Ashley could you do me a favor uh and post a link to chase heroes yes oh yes it's definitely just a few lines of C uh we'll get into coding and stuff later um Ash asley has now posted a link to chase Heroes if people want to come join us so this game is super super easy hey Jamie welcome this game is super super easy to understand it's an obacle course um this was actually showcased from GDC um fairly recently whoa that is L give me one second there we go oh it's Ashley hello so you can actually see on my oh my screen share stopped there we go so we can see that the all the Shadows have been disabled on my on my game because my laptop struggling a little bit with all the windows opening the screen share it's automatically being more performant I can screen share on my computer too I'm working on a a big monstrous gaming computer you want to do that that is totally up to you yeah that's right uh NY Alco so oh I guess I'm going [Laughter] over uh so yeah all of the games that you see on D bang on the front page in the hub have been made using the inine TS so we have scripting we have um our Vox object editor we have our game editor and all of those are free um oh oh no oh I've been squished no it's a disaster um and I realize I'm concentrating more on the game than I am talking to everybody so like you'll notice that everybody's just running around doing their own thing playing the game and it's all Network this is by default um so it makes making multiplayer games super super easy as you saw with me just send with Ashley just sending a link sharing the games that you make and getting testers in and that sort of thing super super easy to do it's it's rudimentary at this point um and you don't have to do anything that's like one of the mo one of the things that Drew Drew me to this because I was actually just a user uh a couple of years ago and I got really excited about the project started um learning how to script and making stuff and it's super super cool and now we're here with you guys uh you should be able to click your car ah I just read the comment actually so yeah uh oh no how's everybody else doing oh I can see you behind me Ashley hello I've only played this game a few times I know right it's incredible don't forget if you have any questions at all for us throughout this feel free to post them in chat and uh and we'll get around to go one sure we answer your questions uh so we have a whole bunch of creators on the platform some make boxel objects some script some make call games all of that's just available for you I forgot to mention that also if you're if you can access chromium on your device so be it a tablet or phone or whatever I made it yeah sorry uh dot Big Bang runs in any Chromium browser it also runs in Safari and all sorts of other things as well uh but it it works best on Chrome um and there's a couple reasons for that uh such as the console uh the dev tools right so that's it for a quick demonstration uh in terms of the platform uh sorry in terms of um play players perspective what I'm going to quickly do I've just looked at the time I'm a little behind but so we'll try and catch up I'm going to quickly do is I'm G to make a voxal object H so um if we are in our profile we've got create new voxal object or we've got a hamburger menu on the top right to create an object and then it will give us some start stuff that we can choose from so I'm just going to pick a blank one so uh we have our little Color Picker and then I can just left click because I'm adding a voxel uh or I can get rid of them now what I'm going to do is use some super super simple shapes and I'm going to make like a little plat form and then what Ashley's going to do she's going to do some cool stuff with that uh so Chris I don't know if you mentioned this um is this a collaborative sandbox could both of you be working on the same project that is exactly what we will be doing later so um the actual the end the way the engine's buildt means that in a minute in in a few minutes everybody will be able we'll send a link out and everybody will be building together there's no um build time if you change a variable the effect of it is instant it's all it basically it's like Google Docs and do you have do you have permissions where people can see but not edit yes so if I come up here um let's just do uh random platform code academy uh Capital C please friend right so we can see published usable by others and remixable published means that anybody can see it uh usable by others means that people can use it in their projects and remixable means that they can somebody can make a copy own copy and edit it freely and the same is true for gains as well um I don't know bear with me one second I had a plan in mind uh that's not it oh do you know what this will do so I'm just going to use the fill tool now come down here add a and I'm just going to do something that doesn't look terrible hopefully uh I'm going to oh my goodness this is terrible it's fine this is a speed build and I'm not an artist as such so this is totally fine uh what is this ashle I don't know what this is I think it's awesome I don't know what it is either but I cookie I think uh I'm I'm rushing too much rather than enjoying the process are you trying to make a coin uh I'm attempting to make a platform that Ashley can then use will a coin work for you as well Ashley yeah coin would work we can make a coin pick up all right so uh so I'm that's it we're done we're done we made a coin it's got a see on it it's the Chris coin so I'm just going to rotate the front this way and make sure the origin fine right I've saved it that's it done so there are tons of tools in the Vox object editor um we've made a coin it's a bit rubbish but that's totally fine because we can change that later on so Ashley would you like to do something cool with this coin that I've made sure um first I'm gonna could I would you mind stopping okay you stopped sharing your screen so I'm going to take over before I do anything I'm just going to do a grand tour of making a game um so that people know how to start that process Etc um so sharing my screen do big bang There we go so you've seen it before here it is not B bang.com um so you can just go so that was create objects that was making voxal objects that's where you'd make all your art for your games um and then if you click build games you're going to get this screen that gives you a bunch of examples to start from so there's an empty game we have like some templates for starter games uh if you want to have something already there to work with so we've got like an Obby an FPS um this intro to Magic just kind of shows you the basics of scripting um like how to move something how to make a door open uh how to send events uh then this other scripting examples shows like a lot more advanced stuff um and then some environment design examples so you can pick whatever you want as a starter I usually go for the empty game um and then you're in here and you're ready to start editing but I'm actually going to edit a game that is uh that we can all edit together in a little bit uh that I prepared for this so oh let me reload this um so I'm just going to give a tour of what our game editor looks like if you've used any other game engines uh some of the stuff might be familiar but you don't need to have any experience with um making games to jump in um so you're just going to click edit Ashley you're no longer screen sharing oh no wrong tab there we go I closed the other one here we go we're in a game I press edit button and there we are so you're going to see a couple things on the screen I'm going to just start with one part at a time at the bottom of the screen um you'll see resources that you can drag into your game so at first we have all the resources the voxal objects that are being used in this game so we have all these arms and butterflies and stuff so if I wanted to add something else I can just drag it in from the bottom um you can also look at all voxal objects that have been made by other creators that have been made public so I can look through these are kind of like some of our featured objects can look through these and drag them in this is like a crazy dragon that someone that Veria made um which is a really cool detailed voxal object um so you can look through ones that other people have made you can filter by your own objects here's a cat on a pogo stick that I made about a week ago um so that's pretty pretty cool and um and then you can search by term so Chris what was your coin called that you just made it it's called Uh oh it's currently saving oh it's called in fact just type in code academy it's code academy coin Cod Academy coin there we go so I actually can just uh drag in this coin that Chris made like moments ago and now it's in my game so it's really great for like work when you're working with an artist on a game as they're making art you'll have it available um immediately as soon as they save it um and then in terms of extensive knowledge of typescript um I mean I had never used typescript when I first started using doig bang I kind of learned as I went so definitely wouldn't say you need extensive knowledge of typescript there's so much example code which you'll see in a bit um and so much to look at and learn from um that I think you can definitely start with not very much knowledge of typescript and still be able to get the hang of it um it's more about like game development principles than language specific typescript stuff um yeah so that's dragging in voxal objects um which you can do from this panel but there's other tabs you can also drag in scripts from the bottom so we have some featured scripts um that you can just drag on to your object so I'm going to drag this scale script and now my cat is scaling um we've got which one do I like I'll do uh actually I'm going to take the scale script off of this scale this down oh I didn't even show off the transform tool so once you put an object into your game um we've got just some transform gizmos you can move it around in space scale it have it stick to a surface of something um there's also just a move tool rotate tool a scale tool things that you wouldd expect from a game engine um and I can add like this p script to this cat and now this cat is going to follow around the player um you can also search these are just the the featured scripts we have ones that we think people will want to use a lot in their game but you can search any scripts I can filter by my own scripts none of these are going to be very helpful they're all pretty specific but I can filter by the scripts that I've written um and then just every script that anyone's written um kind of search by a keyword and find something and so that's what you can do in the scripts panel and then there's also one more panel which is templates um templates are my favorite sorry my favorite one out of all tabs yeah so this one is really exciting it's just um entities which is what we call like the objects in the game are called entities in Big Bang um and these are just entities that already have different components attached to them and different behaviors attached to them so I can drag in this toxic Barrel template and now if I go near the barrel it's going to do damage to me within its radius you can see the collider on the barrel when you click on it it's a big radius where it can do damage there's all sorts of stuff in here there's so many fun templates there's a boom box there's a swimming pool which I think actually just got added um does this work I didn't even know we had this let's find out guess it's a swimming pool I only have one heart of Health oh okay there we go and now I'm swimming in a pool so you can just drag this into your game like I haven't even opened the code I haven't even like looked at the entity panel and I've already got a swimming pool with a bouncy diving board so that's pretty cool if I die while editing it um there we go I blew up and I respawned in the pool it's not a bad place to respawn if I died I would not mind respawning in a pool um so there's all sorts of stuff in here Launchpad there's a lot of stuff that's like great for making an obstacle course this Launchpad is a classic um trampoline another classic where am I oh my spawn point is inside of the Dragon I believe and the pool let's move these and so so you can see how some of these templates work um and yeah that was just it just drag dropped them in you can also make your own templates um and save them and then you have access to them so so let's say I we'll get into that as I show the next segment which is the entity panel so I've only just been dragging these entities and voxal objects into the game but if you want to edit them and change their behavior and change in detail how they work you're going to want to look over at this panel on the left side of the screen which we call the entity panel and this will have your object your entity and all of the different components that make it what it is so we'll take a look at this trampoline uh so the entity is trampoline this first component will just tell you what its name is if it has any tags on it which tags could be used for sending events and communicating or just organizing your scene um and if it is a template um you'll have some information about that template um and then the transform will show you its position it scale can see this changing as I move the trampoline around it's rotation um and you can also parent it to another entity so let's say I parented the trampoline to the player which would be really strange thing to do if I did that now the trampoline is uh attached to the player and we'll move around with the player um going to click that out though cuz I don't I don't think I want that in my game um you've also got the Collision component um so there's number of different shapes of colliders right now it's using the voxal object itself as the shape of the collider so when you collide with what you see on the voxal object um that's that's where the Collision is going to exist but you can also make a box a capsule sphere Etc um like you saw with this um toxic Barrel this has a sphere collider a big trigger on it so when you enter that sphere then you take damage um and you can also set it to none but I'm going to keep it at the voxal object Collision um you have your voxal object component so let's say I like this trampoline that I dragged in um but I don't like this foxal object you can change it on the component I can look up other trampolines and oh there's a green one so now I have a different voxal object on my trampoline but everything else stayed the same on the entity so it's still going to behave just the same and then you have the script the trampoline script it's got a description on it so some of our like Dev D Big Bang Dev sanction scripts will have descriptions or ones that other people make so you can read about it um which will help for usability of other people and then I've got all of these exposed properties on the script that I can change so still without having jumped into the code yet there's still a lot I can do to customize my the behavior on this object so I could make the impulse like 1,200 and not require jump and uh I'll just change those and now right when I collide with it I get shot super high to the Skye um so there's also a number of other components that you can add these were just the ones that happen to already be on the trampoline but you can add a text component and change the color of the text change what it says um font anything you would expect from text component I don't even know if that's yeah that's how you spell trampoline right I think so um and what if you lost one of your entities while you're making I don't know what you mean by lost like deleted it on it's gone somewhere oh I can't find it okay so I look it over here and I don't know where my entity went so um you can just search up the entity in the upper right hand panel there's an entity search um search bar so I can search I found my trampoline and then if I press the F hot key it'll focus on it and now I'm looking back at it um so you don't have to you can navigate everything that's in your scene um and on the entity there's also we have particles sounds cameras so there's all sorts of different types of uh components you can add a particle effect now there's like particles coming out of the trampoline and you can edit all of this um with code and so if I wanted to make this an invisible object what I would do I'm going to take off the text and the particle component I would go to the Vox object component and I can actually um edit the opacity if I wanted to make it kind of see through or I could just go to the visible property on the Vox object component turn it off and now it's invisible um and if I wanted like right now I can still collide with it but if I wanted it to have I could even just delete the voxal object component in its entirety and not have an voxal object component um to search up other people's create uh created entities so I did that at the bottom if you go to foxal objects on the bottom panel uh make sure you're looking at all instead of this game in that drop down on the right um and then you can search up if you're only looking at this game or mine then um You probably won't be able to find anything but if you make sure you're in the all dropdown you can search anything anyone's made make another that's a cool dragon I actually haven't seen that one before um so other things let's see just making sure I get everything out a little list yes so that was the entity comp panel that the entity panel that's how you um edit your entity and then um up in the upper right corner we've got some other properties that's where you found the search in your game um you can search by all sorts of different things so you don't just have to know the name like I know that these birds have the script called flocking on them so if I want everything that has the flocking script I can search by that script name and it's going to show me the birds and the butterflies and everything with that script on it um you can search by tag there's a bunch of things tag no Ray cast which just means that the ray casts are um ignored by it you can search by anything um you need to and you search by things that have a voxal object component I don't know if you can do that click on the advanced tab I've never done that oh my goodness okay so if I want to look for particle effects I can search by particle effects I can search by text components I guess if only the player has a text component scripts all sorts of things wow I can't believe I didn't know that um that's cool um and then we've also got render settings as well so right now we've got this nice mood going on um and um actually before I get into that I haven't even explained what I'm doing with the camera when you start a game the camera is going to be following the player or whatever custom camera you have set up but you have different camera settings in here so you can while you're editing the game look through the game camera um to see what the game will be rendering there's also a fly camera that you can control with WD you can hold down shift to make it go faster so that's letting me kind of zip around this level really fast um and then there's an orbit camera where you can um click with the r right Mouse button and then orbit with the middle Mouse button um um I like the fly camera and yeah you can change the render settings so I'm going to actually press G to enter the game camera so I can see the fog and everything that's being rendered and then I can kind of just click on these different presets there's a couple different presets in here I think I want oh that one's pretty moody I liked the original one so I'm going to go back until I get the original one back but there's all sorts of different um settings you can change fog Bloom um vignette all sorts so much stuff to explore there's advanced settings with shadows and lights and things that I have an artist typically do cuz it's not really my wheelhouse um and then besides that um oh you can also there's some transform settings too so if you were making a grid or like a tile based game and you don't want to be able to freely move things around um you can hold down shift and it'll move by a set transform amount and you can change that step um to whatever the size so if you made a voxal object that was like 50 by 50 Vox holes and you want to make sure that you make your grid based game um all fit into that without any like free motion you could set your translation step to 50 boxal and then place your grid objects um along that grid and besides that there's just save you save your game up at the top um you can change out your player template here so if you made a custom player with custom scripts you can set your player template here so you can make a 2d game with a custom 2D camera and a custom 2D player so this is what the default player looks like and the default camera looks like but you're not stuck with that you can make a game in first person you can make a top down game um all of that can be customized we just have a default default settings that are easy to work with so people can jump in and not have to worry about getting their movement set up getting their camera Road patient setup and all of that kind of stuff um and then you can also set um oh additional game options yeah so you can set whether the player uses the Avatar or if it uses like a voxal object um and we do have an FPS game um that people can play and remix we have a really good starter kit so if you wanted to make an FPS we have a really good kit for that um yeah this is the the kind of basics of what how to navigate the editor and then for script let me just make something I'm going to make a script that does something just so we can all see it's going to involve this dragon and this thing um so we can see how that scripting looks so I'm just going to make a new script here really quick um see we got 20 minutes left do I have enough time to do this go really fast like speed round of scripting um so I'm going to make a new script up here press new um I'm going to zoom in a bunch of times CU I always forget to do that uh zoom zoom and then now you can see here we are we have our class um so there's a start function that's called um whenever this object starts to exist um so either at the beginning of the game or when it spawned in and then a tick which happens every frame um there's a bunch of builtin functions into our API um and I'm going to use on trigger enter you'll see it's starting to autofill that for me this one takes an entity which is the other entity that collided that triggered with this object um and just going to say if the other entity or if other has the tag player on it um other do send event um I'm going to send an event called enable so I'm also going to uh console.log hit so if we open the console since this is in the web this is in your browser you can just open the like developer tools the chro like I opened the Chrome developer tools and now we have a console that will actually work for debugging our game so what I'm going to do is walk over to my hey Ashley we can't see that currently oh that's um I don't know how to make that work um I guess it's just not part of the screen share but you can use Chrome developer tools um I don't know how to get it to like show up as part of the window in the screen share thing um but I promise I just saw the message in my console um but just to show so we can see something visually um sample trigger script I didn't name the script so I'm I sent that event enable um oh wait I don't want to send it to other I'm going to send it to I'm going to do this. entity do get component by type component type so I'm going to grab a component off of this entity um and I'm going to set it to Invisible when I collide with this um thing so I'm going to collide with this and then I'm going to turn invisible there we go we made something happen not very exciting but um we were able to make something happen very quickly um and so what we wanted to do I would love to spend more time coding um but what we're going to do is show off the multiplayer editing which is one of the most powerful parts of Doc big bang and we haven't even shown you yet um is that we can all edit this game together in real time um I have all this random stuff in here and there's going to be a lot more random stuff added but I'm going to share this link and anyone can jump in here and we can all edit this game together um you can drag objects in you can drag scripts on to objects um and drag in templates we can do all sorts of stuff so got that link shared don't want to get in let me in and uh yes the editor yeah the script editor is super similar to VSS code if you're familiar with that um you can use the console for debugging and um it all runs in typescript it's got really good autofill um and I'm not sure if yeah Chris shared our API documentation so there's tons of example games that'll show you um more more about scripting and do big bang and also you can access scripts that other people have made um at any point in time so if I wanted to to drag in a door here is that's a nice door um they didn't think so though um and if I add if I just open I clicked on the script component and press open and I can search door and let's see dbb door that sounds like a good script and now if I walk over we'll see how it works you can look at the properties but I've got this door that turns to open and you can take a look at the script um I can't edit this cuz it was made by someone else but I can look through and read their code and try to piece together what was going wrong or what was going on I can also remix their script um so you can remix scripts that were made by other people so I can say I really liked this door script that someone made but I wish that it behaved a little bit differently I'm going to go ahead and remix it add my edits to the code and then I'll have my own version of it but I already had a base to start off of um so as long as someone had their script public and they've marked it as remixable then you can remix it um in your game and then it will um and you can make whatever edits you want to it see we've got some coins floating about what do I want to add oh I know what I'm going to add um I'm going to add a really fun template we have where is it uh we have a Jeep template so the console is there I promise oh you press F12 in Chrome oh someone can jump on the back of this Jeep too and again like this Jeep is we have a video oh I wish I had the link on him it would take a second to find it but this Jeep is totally remixable and we even have like detailed documentation and videos of how to reskin the Jeep and add your own art onto it and change the speed and the settings and all sorts of things so lot of uh sharing of knowledge um and it's really easy to to learn things when you have so many resources available to you all the time yeah let us know if anyone has any questions about making games in do bang about how our types scripts and scripting works or anything else you might have I have a question uh Ashley when do you feel what would be your advice for somebody learning to code or learning types script right now in terms of coming here and trying things out do you think that is should be hand in hand like the moment you start learning you should start trying things out or do you think that there's like a natural progression point where people become more uh I guess comfortable using what they know to start building things I think that the best thing you can do is just to like get your hand dirdy and just like jump in I think not being scared to write Cod not like I think it's great to have all of these like resources that you can use but I also think that like just like saying I'm just going to write something and see what happens and just if it doesn't work it doesn't work just like trial and error and just jumping in head first is the best thing that you can do especially think on our platform there's so many so much you can look at so much you can read and like so many things you can see working that there's no harm and just trying to like do it yourself like seeing okay I see this Launchpad I'm going to read through this and then I'm just going to try to write something from scratch like and just see what happens I think that's the best way to start is just not be scared of trying anything and not being scared of breaking things also um at Co Academy we teach typescript more in the context of web development which is a little different than gave Dem mop um do you have you seen in the past some sort of shortfalls or differences where somebody might be used to writing typescript one way coming into something like do big band say oh wow I'm I'm super lost I really don't know because they're just kind of train to expect to use types script in a specific way um yeah I actually haven't talk to a lot of typescript like web developers who've moved to dot Big Bang I think it is very different and it kind of feels different the whole time um that um I haven't seen people really get like tripped up over over like trying to do things one way for web I think that there's kind of a general like a big difference in game development and web development that becomes really obvious like as you're using it um and I think that using typescript for Big Bang will not only make you better at typescript but also will just make you a better game developer in general and then you'll have less trouble next time you try if you ever try a different game engine um you'll learn kind of to move away from like the web development thinking into a game development thinking which I think is just very different and very distinct um so it feels different when you're even if you're using the same language it feels like a very different interface um the um also see the question from Maria what is the most intimidating experience you had coding I think something that intimidates me the most is uh coding 3D physics is um I like using quaternion is how rotation is handled in in 3D space in games and I often that was one of the things that I was always like I'm not going to touch that I'm just going to let it I'll take my time figuring out how that works um and having to just dive in I ended up working on a project that was really physics based and I just dove in and um messed up a bunch and things were rotating all ways that I didn't even know they could rotate and jumping around the screen and eventually after like just struggling and seeing things blow up over and over um I was able to start figuring out how to get it work but um yeah it was definitely really intimidating but I'm glad that I tackled that cuz now I'm not as scared of physics anymore but I will say that one of my favorite things about coding and Dot Big Bang is just having um so many references and like so much material to look at and such a big community of people um we have a big community in Discord where we um the devs are helping out with um people who are making games adop big bang and we help troubleshoot their problems and um since the start I've had my coworkers helping me learn the engine and we're all just working together and remixing each other's code and like learning from each other so it's been uh really nice to get to know the engine and typescript with the help of so many people I'm I'm inclined to agree as well I'm I've done software engineering in the past but not like on a serious level and I found it really straightforward coming to do big bang and learning typescript uh I wouldn't say that I make triaa quality games but I definitely have a a fundamental grasp on um on typescript and how the engine works and I think anybody coming into do big bang with a little experience is just gonna have such an easy time saying right here's a game idea I've had give me 10 minutes and just coming up with something that's really good and really fun and it like said like there's a ton of support um we have people at ashy in the Discord all the time just ready to to help out if you have any questions or anything and we also have a lot of experienced community members as well who who are there for you so it's it's dead easy to get started yeah I also think that like since typescript and JavaScript are widely used languages um and they are less complic ated than some of the other languages that are used in game development like C++ for example um it's uh do gang is a really good place to start your game development Journey just because you're more likely to be familiar with these languages and even if you aren't I think they're a little easier to pick up than some of the other common game engine languages and also if you're making games uh in typescript and big bang you're also learning a coding language that is widely used for we development and all sorts of other applications so it has some nice crossover um which I think is really cool and it's also a nice place to get started in game development if you're coming from web development cuz you kind of already have a lot of that work already done um I have a question in terms of the crossover that you were talking about and learning other languages uh how that helps uh there's always people that come to Cod Academy because they're looking at uh getting a career in Tech or switching careers into Tech so how do you in terms of like writing code adop ban and sharing it outside this is like an easy way to Showcase this in portfolios let's say on your GitHub or things like that is there like a way that you can export this code you just have to copy and paste it is there an easy way for somebody that never useb ban to come in into someone's profile and see what they've build codewise yeah so it isn't it is just kept within the platform the code so you could copy and paste it but also because um everything is public and immediate like you can send a link and someone can play it immediately so if you're trying to build up something for your portfolio you could show off your game that you made instantly without having to take videos it or have like a download link on itch or something like that you could just say like hey here's a link to what I made if they wanted to look at the code you could copy and paste it and put it into GitHub or you could um if they had an account they could look through your game and see the code that you've that you made um but right right now there isn't like a site where you can go like externally look at just the code part like how you would use GitHub but I do think at least sending a link to your game and being able to immediately show someone what you made um can be really helpful to show what you've been able to create
