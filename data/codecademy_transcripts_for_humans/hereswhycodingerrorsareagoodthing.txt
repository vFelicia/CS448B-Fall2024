00:00 - um another question here is about
00:02 - getting discouraged by errors and I
00:05 - think that this is probably very common
00:06 - in data especially because you run into
00:08 - a lot of trial and errors it's so
00:10 - frustrating so first of all I just want
00:11 - to say like I'm going to give like a
00:13 - very nice answer and all this sort of
00:14 - stuff but also just know that I've sat
00:16 - there with my vs code or Jupiter
00:19 - notebook open trying to turn my hair out
00:21 - um so I understand the the cliche is
00:23 - it's always an opportunity to learn um
00:25 - but it's really true so if there's an
00:27 - error and you don't know why it's
00:29 - happening right what that means is
00:30 - there's something you don't understand
00:31 - maybe it's something you don't
00:33 - understand about the data set right so
00:35 - maybe it's not a syntax error maybe it's
00:36 - just something that's not coming out
00:38 - correctly that means that's that's a
00:40 - sign right you don't know something
00:41 - about the data set or you don't know
00:43 - something about one of the methods that
00:44 - you're using and as data scientists
00:46 - right it's our responsibility to make
00:48 - sure that we know what's going on it's
00:52 - super frustrating but the errors are
00:54 - there to help us understand like I need
00:56 - to like learn a little bit more about
00:57 - this or I need to look into it a little
00:59 - bit more deeply
