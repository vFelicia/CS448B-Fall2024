00:00 - hey my name is Mike in this video I want
00:01 - to walk you through a very important
00:03 - concepts as you continue on your
00:04 - programming journey which is working
00:06 - with code that other people have written
00:08 - a lot of times when you're first
00:10 - starting out as a developer you're
00:12 - generally working by yourself you're
00:14 - working on programs that only you have
00:16 - written but a big milestone in becoming
00:18 - a developer is working with code that
00:20 - other people have also worked on so
00:22 - whether that's other members of a
00:23 - software development team that you're on
00:25 - other members of the open-source
00:27 - community there's a lot of little
00:29 - roadblocks and potential things to be
00:31 - aware of as you make this next step and
00:34 - so I want to talk you through all of
00:35 - them and I'm gonna help you to have a
00:37 - smooth transition when working with code
00:39 - written by other people so let's get
00:41 - into it and start talking about going
00:43 - from a solo developer to a team player
00:46 - to someone that works with code that
00:48 - other people have written and generally
00:50 - when you're first learning to code you
00:51 - write all of your programs solo and by
00:54 - writing all the code yourself you really
00:55 - get a chance to dial in on the core
00:57 - concepts and to understand each and
00:59 - every part of the program which is
01:00 - really important but as you got into the
01:02 - industry or the open source community
01:04 - one of the biggest transition pain
01:06 - points for newer developers is learning
01:08 - how to work with pre-existing code that
01:10 - you didn't write yourself but it was
01:12 - written by other people so a lot of
01:14 - times if you're working with code bases
01:16 - at a company or on an open-source
01:18 - project there will be one developer that
01:20 - contributes some code another developer
01:22 - that contributes other code or in fact
01:24 - there might be 30 or 40 developers that
01:26 - are contributing code and then you want
01:28 - to come in and contribute some code of
01:30 - your own all of a sudden you're looking
01:33 - at foreign code it might be messy and
01:34 - would be complicated and it might use
01:36 - design patterns and data structures that
01:38 - you have little to no experience with
01:39 - because after all you didn't write it
01:41 - and so for many new developers diving
01:44 - into an established code base can be
01:45 - very intimidating so how can we make
01:48 - this transition a little bit easier in
01:50 - order to do that I'm gonna give you ten
01:52 - tips for working with someone else's
01:54 - code so anytime you encounter code that
01:56 - was written by someone else that you
01:57 - didn't write yourself just follow these
01:59 - ten tips and you should be on a nice
02:01 - path to making a difference in the code
02:03 - base step one is that it's only code as
02:06 - intimidating and overwhelming as the
02:08 - code may look understand that it's just
02:10 - code it's not a foreign language or some
02:12 - mysterious hieroglyph
02:13 - it's code and if you're tasked with
02:15 - working on the project then you probably
02:17 - already know the language it's written
02:18 - in and you need to trust in your
02:20 - abilities now with that being said a lot
02:22 - of times especially in big projects or
02:24 - legacy code that hasn't been updated in
02:25 - a while there may be dependencies or
02:28 - external libraries and api's that you're
02:30 - not familiar with so a good place to
02:32 - start when diving in to code is to
02:35 - figure out any libraries api's or
02:37 - frameworks that the project is using
02:39 - step two is to set up your environment
02:40 - and this is in my opinion the most
02:43 - important part and also the most
02:45 - annoying part especially if you're
02:47 - dealing with some complicated code bases
02:48 - and the whole idea here is that most
02:50 - projects in the real world require the
02:52 - environment on your local machine to be
02:54 - configured in a very specific way for
02:57 - them to work as intended so it could be
02:59 - things like modifying your computer's
03:00 - host file which is used for redirecting
03:02 - URLs hosting a local web server setting
03:05 - up and populating a local instance of a
03:07 - database downloading installing and
03:09 - running external programs utilizing
03:11 - special IDs or text editors logging into
03:14 - a VPN changing the version of a program
03:16 - on your computer there's a lot of these
03:19 - different things that you're gonna have
03:21 - to do and all of them are gonna depend
03:22 - on the specific project so there's
03:24 - really no simple guide to setting up an
03:27 - environment for programming the third
03:29 - tip is to run the tests another
03:31 - transition that can be very difficult
03:33 - for new developers is working with tests
03:35 - a lot of programming tutorials and
03:37 - courses neglect to cover writing tests
03:40 - that's because tests can be annoying to
03:41 - write they can also be kind of tedious
03:43 - but any code base or that salt should
03:46 - have some form of testing in place and
03:49 - tests are great because they give you an
03:51 - easy way to make sure the code is doing
03:52 - what it's supposed to do generally if
03:54 - you're going to be fixing bugs or adding
03:55 - features to the code base you'll be
03:57 - responsible for writing or modifying the
03:59 - appropriate tests and so it's important
04:01 - that you get these tests set up
04:02 - correctly and you get them passing step
04:05 - four is to follow the style guide so as
04:07 - you've learned to write code on your own
04:08 - you may have adopted a particular style
04:10 - maybe you indent with two spaces instead
04:13 - of tabs maybe you always leave a space
04:15 - before a curly bracket
04:16 - maybe you pack as much code onto a
04:17 - single line as possible just like you've
04:20 - developed your own personal syntax style
04:22 - most likely so has the code base that
04:24 - you're working on in an effort to keep
04:26 - things clean and consist
04:27 - many large code bases will have specific
04:29 - rules for how code should be written and
04:31 - how things are to be formatted also be
04:33 - aware of any design standards like
04:35 - colors fonts margins etc this is very
04:37 - important if you're doing like front-end
04:39 - web development you want to make sure
04:41 - that you're using the specific colors
04:42 - that are set aside for that project or
04:45 - you're using things like fonts and
04:47 - margins and spaces appropriately keep in
04:50 - mind though that many code bases will
04:51 - have scripts in place to automatically
04:53 - format the code for you and fix any easy
04:56 - formatting mistakes these are often
04:57 - times called linters so if you're on a
05:00 - project and someone's talking about
05:01 - running the linter they're probably
05:03 - talking about running some sort of a
05:04 - script that will format the code
05:07 - consistently with the rest of the code
05:08 - in the codebase alright number 5 is code
05:11 - like everybody's watching any developer
05:14 - who's been around long enough has had
05:15 - the experience of working with code
05:16 - that's difficult to read is poorly
05:19 - written and is almost impossible to
05:21 - extend and add to when you are adding
05:23 - code into the codebase write it with the
05:25 - assumption that other developers will
05:26 - eventually be using it and potentially
05:29 - modifying it and part of that means
05:30 - documenting things correctly a
05:33 - documentation could happen in the form
05:35 - of a comment it can also happen in the
05:37 - form of tests like unit tests that you
05:39 - write and it could just be a formal
05:41 - documentation document that the project
05:43 - has set up it's also important to keep
05:45 - the code consistent so try to model your
05:47 - code after the code that's already been
05:49 - written this ensures that all the code
05:51 - in the codebase stays consistent uses
05:53 - the same types of design patterns and
05:55 - ensures that you don't have to reinvent
05:56 - the wheel number 6 is to make use of
05:59 - good patterns as programming evolves
06:01 - certain best practices and patterns for
06:03 - doing things have emerged a lot of times
06:06 - you'll hear people call these design
06:07 - patterns and these are ways of writing
06:09 - code so that it doesn't repeat itself so
06:11 - that it's extensible and it's structured
06:13 - for maximum security and efficiency
06:15 - these patterns can vary depending on the
06:17 - language of the framework you're using
06:19 - but places like code Academy for example
06:21 - and online forms like Stack Overflow can
06:24 - give good insights into how to write
06:25 - code in this optimal way and utilize
06:28 - these good patterns number seven is to
06:30 - ask questions this is something that I
06:33 - think new developers don't do enough
06:35 - maybe because they're a little shy
06:37 - they're a little timid or maybe they're
06:38 - just intimidated but what
06:40 - in doubt ask someone if it's not your
06:42 - code then it's someone else's so don't
06:45 - be afraid to go out of your way to ask
06:46 - any questions you might have
06:48 - now obviously you want to be respectful
06:50 - when you're asking questions but you
06:51 - also don't want to be too timid if you
06:53 - have a question about something and it's
06:55 - blocking you from doing your work you
06:57 - got to get the answer and so make sure
06:58 - that you're proactive in asking people
07:00 - so for the last three tips these are
07:02 - going to be specific for legacy code
07:05 - bases so all the tips before this could
07:07 - be applied to any code bases whether
07:09 - their legacy whether they're being
07:11 - actively developed whatever it is but
07:13 - these three are specific for legacy code
07:14 - bases so number eight is to stay
07:16 - positive a lot of times if you're
07:18 - working with legacy code bases it's very
07:20 - easy to become bitter and negative
07:21 - towards the developers who wrote it so
07:23 - it's always important to just stay
07:24 - positive understand that it's not the
07:27 - end of the world if the code is poorly
07:29 - written and you can actually make quite
07:30 - a difference in a code base if you take
07:32 - the time to maybe fix some of the
07:35 - mistakes number nine is to know the code
07:37 - this is especially important for legacy
07:39 - code bases before you go chopping things
07:41 - up and changing things around be sure
07:42 - that you have a good idea of how
07:44 - everything is connected and how it works
07:46 - especially if there are no tests written
07:49 - this is super important if there's not
07:51 - tests this is really common when you're
07:53 - dealing with large code bases a lot of
07:55 - times the architecture and the structure
07:57 - of the app can be very sporadic and so
07:59 - one thing might connect to another thing
08:01 - another thing connects to another thing
08:02 - and so if you change one little thing
08:04 - that could set off some sort of a chain
08:06 - reaction that would cause errors in the
08:08 - project so make sure that you know
08:09 - what's going on in the code you don't
08:11 - have to know everything but know at
08:12 - least the repercussions of any changes
08:15 - that you're making and then finally the
08:17 - last tip here is to keep changes small
08:19 - keep in mind that especially legacy code
08:21 - bases are generally established and
08:23 - there's probably a lot going on so
08:25 - resist the temptation to try and
08:27 - refactor or fix every small problem that
08:29 - you see you might be reading through the
08:31 - code and you're thinking oh man I could
08:32 - rewrite that function so much better or
08:34 - these variables have horrible names let
08:37 - me just rename them while I'm in here
08:38 - the truth is though that unless those
08:40 - changes directly relate to the change
08:42 - you're making
08:43 - leave them alone there could be
08:44 - unintended consequences to making
08:46 - changes like this and it can easily
08:48 - snowball out of control but if there are
08:50 - small fixable problems in the code that
08:53 - you have to modify anyway feel free to
08:55 - slowly but surely make the codebase
08:57 - better over time with enough small
08:59 - changes a legacy codebase can have some
09:02 - new life breathed into it
09:04 - so the last section here I want to go
09:05 - over is how to gain experience so we
09:07 - talked about some ways that you can make
09:09 - it easy on yourself when working with a
09:11 - codebase that was written by someone
09:13 - else now we're gonna talk about how you
09:15 - can gain experience doing that so the
09:17 - first and probably the easiest way is
09:18 - just to work on some open source
09:20 - projects there's a lot of open source
09:22 - projects on github that allow anyone to
09:24 - come in and fix up little bugs maybe
09:26 - tweak the documentation the next way
09:28 - would be doing some sort of an
09:30 - internship or maybe even some unpaid
09:32 - work in my personal experience when I
09:34 - was in college I did three different
09:35 - internships and it was a really good way
09:37 - to get experience working with actual
09:40 - you know real live code bases that were
09:43 - being used in companies if you can't get
09:45 - an internship you also might reach out
09:46 - to a company and ask them if you can do
09:48 - some unpaid work maybe they'll send you
09:50 - the code base and you can set it up and
09:52 - do some little tasks for free just to
09:54 - come and get some experience finally you
09:56 - can also just build things with your
09:57 - friends if you have an idea for a
09:59 - project or an app or a website and maybe
10:01 - have some friends who are also
10:02 - developers get together and get a
10:04 - codebase up on github and you guys can
10:06 - start contributing to it it'll give you
10:07 - experience working with the code that
10:09 - they are writing and they can get
10:10 - experience working with the code that
10:11 - you're writing and just be a really
10:13 - beneficial experience for everyone

Cleaned transcript:

hey my name is Mike in this video I want to walk you through a very important concepts as you continue on your programming journey which is working with code that other people have written a lot of times when you're first starting out as a developer you're generally working by yourself you're working on programs that only you have written but a big milestone in becoming a developer is working with code that other people have also worked on so whether that's other members of a software development team that you're on other members of the opensource community there's a lot of little roadblocks and potential things to be aware of as you make this next step and so I want to talk you through all of them and I'm gonna help you to have a smooth transition when working with code written by other people so let's get into it and start talking about going from a solo developer to a team player to someone that works with code that other people have written and generally when you're first learning to code you write all of your programs solo and by writing all the code yourself you really get a chance to dial in on the core concepts and to understand each and every part of the program which is really important but as you got into the industry or the open source community one of the biggest transition pain points for newer developers is learning how to work with preexisting code that you didn't write yourself but it was written by other people so a lot of times if you're working with code bases at a company or on an opensource project there will be one developer that contributes some code another developer that contributes other code or in fact there might be 30 or 40 developers that are contributing code and then you want to come in and contribute some code of your own all of a sudden you're looking at foreign code it might be messy and would be complicated and it might use design patterns and data structures that you have little to no experience with because after all you didn't write it and so for many new developers diving into an established code base can be very intimidating so how can we make this transition a little bit easier in order to do that I'm gonna give you ten tips for working with someone else's code so anytime you encounter code that was written by someone else that you didn't write yourself just follow these ten tips and you should be on a nice path to making a difference in the code base step one is that it's only code as intimidating and overwhelming as the code may look understand that it's just code it's not a foreign language or some mysterious hieroglyph it's code and if you're tasked with working on the project then you probably already know the language it's written in and you need to trust in your abilities now with that being said a lot of times especially in big projects or legacy code that hasn't been updated in a while there may be dependencies or external libraries and api's that you're not familiar with so a good place to start when diving in to code is to figure out any libraries api's or frameworks that the project is using step two is to set up your environment and this is in my opinion the most important part and also the most annoying part especially if you're dealing with some complicated code bases and the whole idea here is that most projects in the real world require the environment on your local machine to be configured in a very specific way for them to work as intended so it could be things like modifying your computer's host file which is used for redirecting URLs hosting a local web server setting up and populating a local instance of a database downloading installing and running external programs utilizing special IDs or text editors logging into a VPN changing the version of a program on your computer there's a lot of these different things that you're gonna have to do and all of them are gonna depend on the specific project so there's really no simple guide to setting up an environment for programming the third tip is to run the tests another transition that can be very difficult for new developers is working with tests a lot of programming tutorials and courses neglect to cover writing tests that's because tests can be annoying to write they can also be kind of tedious but any code base or that salt should have some form of testing in place and tests are great because they give you an easy way to make sure the code is doing what it's supposed to do generally if you're going to be fixing bugs or adding features to
