00:00 - hi everyone my name is Carlos I'm a web
00:02 - developer based in Boca New York and
00:04 - today I want to talk about mark down
00:06 - what is markdown why do we use it and
00:08 - how does it actually work so let's go
00:11 - ahead and jump right in so what exactly
00:13 - is marked down why do we use it and how
00:15 - do we use it well in simple terms from
00:17 - markdown is a text to HTML conversion
00:20 - tool for web writers so markdown allows
00:22 - us to read using it easier to read
00:23 - easier to write plain text format and
00:25 - then convert it structurally to valid
00:27 - HTML with this definition markdown is
00:30 - essentially two things one it's a plain
00:33 - text formatting syntax and two it's a
00:36 - software tool that was written in Perl
00:37 - that converts plain text formatting to
00:40 - HTML the overall design goal for
00:43 - markdowns formatting syntax is to make
00:45 - it as readable as possible so that
00:47 - allows us to create text that looks like
00:48 - this and transform it into this kind of
00:51 - output now many of us have used
00:53 - different tools that allows us to format
00:56 - text in various different ways so
00:58 - Microsoft Word is a great example for
01:00 - that let's look at how I would write
01:02 - some simple content using Microsoft Word
01:04 - now Microsoft Word is very useful in
01:07 - providing us with various tools to
01:09 - actually format and edit our text but a
01:11 - lot of times it may be overdoing it
01:13 - perhaps you just want to bold some text
01:15 - or make a simple list and maybe you
01:17 - don't even want to open Microsoft Word
01:18 - to format a text that you're gonna send
01:21 - as an email another tool that's used a
01:23 - lot and it's the way web pages and email
01:25 - templates are coded so that text is
01:27 - formatted is HTML so let's see how we
01:30 - would write the same content using HTML
01:33 - now hTML is pretty much used everywhere
01:36 - in the Internet it's also more
01:38 - expressive and can actually achieve some
01:40 - specific effects that may be difficult
01:42 - or impossible in markdown however
01:44 - there's a learning curve to HTML and
01:46 - similarly to Microsoft Word its benefits
01:49 - really depend on what you're using it
01:51 - for you can see in this example you have
01:53 - to actually keep into account and
01:55 - various different tacks that HTML
01:56 - provides and we make sure that they're
01:58 - all being closed properly now this might
02:01 - be easy if you're experienced but if
02:03 - you're a beginner and you just want to
02:04 - format a text like an email or certain
02:06 - documentation it might be overboard and
02:08 - unnecessary to learn so let's see how we
02:11 - would write the content from the
02:12 - previous
02:13 - examples using markdown as you can see
02:16 - markdown syntax is comprised entirely of
02:18 - punctuation characters which have been
02:20 - chosen carefully to look like what they
02:22 - mean so asterisk around the word kind of
02:25 - represent emphasis which pulls the text
02:27 - markdown lists look like well lists now
02:31 - markdown is not a replacement for HTML
02:33 - or even close to it it syntax is very
02:36 - small and it only corresponds to a very
02:38 - small subset of HTML tags but the idea
02:40 - is not to create a syntax that makes it
02:42 - easier to insert HTML tags
02:44 - the idea for markdown is to make it easy
02:47 - to read write and edit pros due to this
02:50 - markdowns formatting syntax only
02:52 - addresses issues that can be conveyed in
02:54 - a plain text so let's take a look at how
02:57 - we actually use markdown to format and
02:59 - edit our text for headings we usually
03:02 - use a hash tag to represent what kind of
03:03 - heading we're going to be using to
03:05 - create a heading we usually add a hash
03:07 - in front of a word or phrase and the
03:09 - number of hashes you use should
03:10 - correspond to the heading level so if we
03:12 - want to create a heading level 3 we use
03:15 - 3 hashes for different types of emphasis
03:18 - will use other punctuation marks if you
03:21 - want to italicize your text you simply
03:23 - add an asterisk before and after the
03:24 - word in order to bold in it you add two
03:27 - asterisks before and after the word and
03:28 - if you want to have some strikethrough
03:30 - text you simply wrap the text until this
03:33 - for list honors we also have quite
03:36 - simple syntax we can use to create an
03:38 - unordered list you're given the option
03:40 - of using dashes asterisk or plus signs
03:43 - to put them in front of line items and
03:45 - this will create a bulleted list for
03:47 - ordered lists all we need to do is
03:49 - simply add line items with numbers
03:50 - followed by periods now the numbers
03:53 - don't have to be in numerical order but
03:55 - the list should start with a number one
03:56 - and dessert create a numbered list so
03:59 - now that we have an idea of how markdown
04:01 - is composed listing in the little deeper
04:03 - in figure out how exactly it works now
04:06 - Mark done is basically plain text so it
04:08 - can be used pretty much anywhere but in
04:10 - this case let's assume you wrote a file
04:12 - that has some markdown syntax from there
04:14 - you're gonna make sure that you save it
04:15 - with an extension called markdown or dot
04:17 - MD going from there once you have your
04:20 - markdown file from there you actually
04:23 - need a markdown application that's
04:25 - capable of processing the
04:27 - don't file now markdown applications use
04:29 - something called a markdown processor
04:31 - also commonly referred to as a parser or
04:34 - an implementation that basically take
04:36 - the markdown formatted text and now put
04:38 - it to HTML format now at that point your
04:41 - document can be viewed in a web browser
04:43 - or combined with a stylesheet and print
04:45 - it and if you simply want to just
04:47 - experiment with markdown there's a bunch
04:49 - of markdown editors online that you can
04:51 - simply look up and use markdown with so
04:54 - why should we use Martin well there are
04:56 - a few reasons for that one of them is
04:58 - accessibility markdown is very
05:01 - accessible to someone who doesn't know
05:02 - the first thing about HTML so let's look
05:05 - at an example where HTML can get quite
05:07 - nested and complex as you can see here
05:11 - there's a lot of boilerplate that we
05:12 - actually have to create before we even
05:14 - start writing the content of our text
05:16 - using HTML moreover if we have a lot of
05:19 - content it can get quite nested and can
05:22 - be very hard to read especially if
05:23 - you're not really familiar with HTML
05:25 - this leaves us with a lot of room for
05:28 - error
05:28 - HTML basically begs for typos so even
05:31 - the smallest typo or mistake can
05:33 - completely alter and change the way our
05:35 - content looks one of the other reasons
05:37 - we should use markdown is that due to
05:40 - the way it's written we can pretty much
05:41 - use it everywhere for example is used
05:44 - widely and software documentation
05:45 - particularly open source because it
05:48 - enables rich or formatting than plain
05:50 - text alone certain applications also
05:53 - support markdown so you can even format
05:55 - your text us markdown within the
05:56 - application itself
05:58 - Martin has become so popular in common
06:00 - that even applications that you probably
06:02 - are familiar with use markdown
06:04 - themselves it's become the default or
06:06 - the standard for for many certain types
06:07 - of text so let's look in a few more
06:10 - examples as to where exactly markdown is
06:12 - applicable for starters we can use it on
06:15 - websites markdown was assigned for the
06:17 - web so it should come as no surprise
06:18 - that there are plenty of applications
06:20 - specifically designed for creating
06:22 - website content now although there are
06:24 - limitations for markdown if you're
06:26 - intending to write something with
06:27 - straightforward text like a blog then
06:29 - markdown might save you some time
06:31 - now while markdown doesn't have all the
06:34 - bells and whistles of word processors
06:36 - like Microsoft Word it's very useful to
06:38 - creating documents and know
06:40 - and it's still very readable that you
06:42 - can actually copy and paste it elsewhere
06:44 - and still be able to format it as
06:46 - markdown now if you send a lot of emails
06:48 - and you're tired of the formatting
06:50 - controls available on most email
06:51 - provider websites you'll be happy to
06:53 - know that there's a bunch of tools
06:54 - online that allow you to actually
06:56 - implement markdown inside your email
06:58 - making it very easy and readable to send
07:01 - my emails with formatted text
07:02 - lastly markdown is a natural fit for
07:05 - technical documentation companies like
07:07 - github are increasingly switching to
07:09 - markdown for their documentation due to
07:11 - its ease of writing and reading the
07:13 - actual documents so hopefully this video
07:16 - gave you a better understanding of what
07:17 - is markdown and how it's actually used
07:19 - anyway thank you all for watching join
