With timestamps:

00:00 - so hello everyone my name is Alex Koontz
00:03 - I'm a curriculum developer here at Koch
00:06 - Adam II and I'm here with these that we
00:07 - hey everyone I'm Zoe
00:09 - I'm a curriculum product manager here at
00:11 - GoDaddy and so what today is the first
00:15 - in hopefully a long series of events
00:16 - where we are going to be doing some
00:18 - coding with you every single week so
00:21 - we're calling this as of right now well
00:23 - first of all all of you in chat your
00:25 - your your the early adopters right first
00:28 - time ever really kind of trying this
00:30 - this larger series and so there will be
00:34 - I'm sure many many things to talk about
00:37 - and things that will change over time
00:40 - but good for all of you in the chat for
00:42 - being here and being the first ones to
00:45 - check out this series Zoe do you kind of
00:48 - want to describe what is Koch Adam II
00:51 - live what are we doing here yeah so code
00:53 - County live is a new series that we're
00:55 - doing if you've been a code Academy
00:57 - learner with us in the past you may have
00:59 - seen previous live streams with the
01:01 - curriculum team so like Alex and I have
01:03 - both done live streams before but now
01:06 - we're going to start off doing a
01:08 - dedicated series to walk through some
01:12 - code Academy content we're starting off
01:14 - with the data visualization Python skill
01:16 - path so we'll be doing a session every
01:19 - week we're figuring out the times and
01:23 - the days correct
01:24 - Alex yeah I think right now we're
01:27 - planning we're doing this on Wednesday
01:28 - obviously yeah I think in the future
01:30 - we're planning on doing our stream on
01:33 - Tuesdays but again all this is kind of
01:36 - up in the air
01:36 - we'll be relying on feedback from you
01:38 - all to try to help us figure out best
01:41 - way to do this yeah so we are planning
01:43 - on walking through a skill path from the
01:48 - very beginning all the way to the very
01:49 - end and learning a lot along the way
01:52 - yeah and if you folks are new to code
01:55 - Academy basically a skill path is a
01:58 - combination of different content
02:00 - different courses that we have on this
02:01 - site and it's meant to get you to learn
02:04 - a specific skill hence the name scope at
02:07 - us and as the name of the scope acts
02:10 - we're going to be learning data
02:11 - visualization with the Python
02:13 - programming language you can learn data
02:16 - visualization with a couple of different
02:17 - languages but we're doing the Python one
02:21 - specifically this time cool all right
02:23 - let's go ahead and jump right into it
02:26 - I'm gonna share my screen and so today's
02:39 - lesson is going to probably be a little
02:41 - bit different than a traditional lesson
02:44 - where we're gonna be walking through the
02:48 - first lesson in data visualization which
02:51 - is really kind of why are we doing any
02:53 - of this so I think this lesson is gonna
02:55 - be slightly less coding focused we're
02:58 - really we're not gonna go through a ton
03:00 - of syntax will go into this lesson and
03:03 - play around with it a little bit but I
03:04 - think this particular one is going to be
03:06 - a bit more discussion based about what
03:09 - is data visualization why do we care
03:11 - about it what are some cool examples in
03:13 - the past really kind of setting up what
03:15 - we're doing here and why we're doing it
03:17 - and then the following weeks we'll get
03:19 - into the Python syntax Python functions
03:21 - you know all of all of these things that
03:23 - we eventually teach you in this path but
03:26 - this one we're just kind of setting up
03:27 - so again this is the visualized data
03:31 - with Python path it is it is one of our
03:37 - one of our many paths I suppose I won't
03:38 - show you how to navigate there if you
03:40 - want to code along with us we think that
03:41 - that would be you know a fun thing for
03:44 - you to be able to do again we don't
03:46 - really know how manageable that is with
03:48 - if you have a YouTube window and you've
03:50 - the chat open and you have Koch Athenee
03:51 - right so give us feedback on whether or
03:54 - not you're able to code along with us
03:56 - and if that's something that you're
03:57 - actively doing or if it's more fun for
04:00 - you to just kind of watch me and so we
04:01 - go through this are gonna be recorded so
04:05 - if you find that you're not able to pay
04:08 - attention to the live stream and coding
04:10 - at the same time don't worry you still
04:11 - have it to look at later yes I see in
04:14 - the chat first of all people are from
04:16 - all over the place which is super super
04:18 - cool
04:19 - somebody in the UK probably so
04:23 - knowing I are both coming from New York
04:25 - City so really cool to see at hugely
04:28 - international audience and yeah I see
04:32 - one comment about that we're using zoom
04:34 - we will actually touch on that in the in
04:36 - the future where we are using zoom to
04:38 - stream stuff but we are also going to be
04:40 - hosting some some zoom boom webinars
04:44 - that are not streamed so we won't kind
04:46 - of touch on that towards the end of end
04:47 - of this session okay let me show you how
04:51 - to get here so
04:52 - so here's coke at me if you just go to
04:54 - the catalog you will see we have some
04:57 - career paths which we are not doing and
04:59 - then we are gonna be working with where
05:05 - is it analyze data with Python
05:09 - alright so sorry analyzed it we're doing
05:22 - yeah visualized data with Python alright
05:26 - and let's jump into this first lesson
05:31 - cool Zoe do you want to talk about what
05:34 - this overall path tries to teach we can
05:38 - look at the look at this first lesson
05:39 - and kind of these two capstone option
05:41 - options what's the what's the purpose of
05:44 - visualize to add it with pythons yeah so
05:46 - again much as the name suggests the goal
05:49 - of this path is to teach you how to
05:51 - create data visualizations using the
05:54 - Python programming language fun fact
05:56 - this was a former intensive person code
06:01 - Kadim e users and it was actually the
06:02 - first one that I led so yeah so this
06:07 - skill path is near and dear to my heart
06:09 - and what you can see here this first
06:14 - exercise is actually some of the stuff
06:16 - that you can build once you complete
06:18 - this skill pack so you have two options
06:21 - for completing a capstone you can do
06:23 - both of them if you want but one of them
06:26 - you are analyzing the data of a Netflix
06:30 - stock profile and visualizing that and
06:32 - then the other one is looking
06:35 - GDP and life expectancy data so we tried
06:38 - to think of the different applications
06:40 - that folks may have if they're
06:42 - interested in data visualization maybe
06:44 - you're coming from a feminine side maybe
06:46 - you're coming from more of a of an
06:49 - academic side and we also just have kind
06:51 - of like fun general projects for anyone
06:54 - to go through that I think you know
06:56 - pretty much anyone would find enjoyable
06:58 - yeah I see in the chat we have a soccer
07:02 - girl took that intensive Zoey so we got
07:05 - some math and with us for many many
07:06 - years at this point which is really cool
07:09 - all right cool so that's a that's
07:12 - visualized a with Python I think
07:15 - something that you might notice is you
07:17 - might see you know there's a larger data
07:20 - science path and there are other courses
07:22 - that give some of these topics this is
07:24 - one that really focuses only on data
07:26 - visualization but you can definitely
07:27 - take the skills that you learned here
07:29 - and apply it to machine learning and to
07:33 - data science in general so in fact some
07:37 - of the examples I'm gonna show you later
07:39 - on in this session are from different
07:42 - paths entirely but you use some of the
07:43 - skills that we wanted here
07:46 - soft girl Lisa your name is Lisa cool
07:52 - all right so let's take a look at this
07:55 - first lesson
07:57 - so visualize data in Python what is the
08:03 - format of data that we typically use at
08:05 - least on our code Khadem esight to
08:08 - visualize here we're bringing in data
08:27 - using a CSV file that stands for comma
08:29 - separated values so as you can see let's
08:34 - just open the file that we're actually
08:36 - using as our data in this exercise it's
08:40 - not pretty but you can tell it is true
08:44 - to its name
08:45 - it's using commas to separate the
08:48 - different data values right so at the
08:50 - top you get would essentially be the
08:52 - column name so if you were to pull in a
08:54 - CSV - Excel or Google sheets you'd get
08:57 - your standard spreadsheet and you can
09:01 - even take any spreadsheet you have an
09:02 - export it as a CSV and this looks
09:04 - something like this
09:05 - so again column titles at the top and
09:07 - then below that you start to see the raw
09:11 - data than numbers so the first one you
09:14 - can see is a date 2017 April 4th and
09:19 - then we are getting some other number
09:23 - values this looks like its stock price
09:25 - data from that Netflix capstone project
09:30 - I don't know a lot about stocks yes I
09:38 - think one thing to note is that this is
09:41 - kind of a question that we get a lot is
09:43 - like why bother learning data
09:44 - visualization in Python right like I
09:46 - could open up this CSV file in Excel and
09:49 - I could make my graphs funny in Excel or
09:52 - I could work through my data in Excel so
09:54 - like Zoe from your perspective and
09:56 - whether it's Python or another language
09:58 - like what's what's the value of doing
10:00 - this in a programming language rather
10:02 - than it's cool like Google sheets or
10:03 - Excel with something like that totally
10:07 - it's the ability to customize whatever
10:11 - we want to do right we don't have to
10:13 - rely on the tools like Microsoft Office
10:15 - or Google is providing us sure maybe you
10:18 - can get some nice visualizations out of
10:20 - it you're still gonna have to do a lot
10:21 - of tweaking in a process like this
10:24 - you're controlling it from the very
10:25 - beginning and to the end so you can you
10:28 - know figure out how much of the data
10:30 - that you want to use you can easily
10:31 - clean up the data using Python and it's
10:34 - data analysis libraries like pandas you
10:37 - can try out different visualization
10:38 - libraries so in this scale in the past
10:40 - we have me show you map cut live but we
10:43 - also show you a more advanced
10:45 - visualization library notice Seabourn
10:47 - and again it just gives you way more
10:51 - possibilities I see that Lisa
10:54 - girl saying Excel is limited yeah a lot
10:56 - of these software's you know they just
10:58 - give you the very bare-bones for you to
11:01 - work with if you are really interested
11:03 - in digging into data analysis and
11:05 - producing your own reports producing
11:08 - your own presentations knowing a
11:12 - programming language like Python and how
11:13 - to use it for data visualization is
11:16 - really gonna help yeah I think one of
11:19 - the things we're gonna talk about later
11:20 - in this session is also using data
11:22 - visualization for like an artistic
11:24 - pursuit so hmm
11:25 - not necessarily for your job or to
11:26 - create a report but just to express
11:29 - something that you're interested in or
11:31 - that you find value in and I think being
11:34 - able to use these tools that are like
11:36 - more flexible and you can do kind of
11:38 - weird or less traditional things with
11:40 - it's really helpful for that sort of
11:42 - stuff absolutely you know it is all
11:46 - around us and you know we don't have to
11:48 - think about data as being limited to a
11:50 - business application I think it's really
11:52 - interesting when you start to examine
11:54 - your own life how can i express these
12:01 - patterns in an interesting way can you
12:03 - state a visualization to do that totally
12:06 - cool okay so let's do this first
12:08 - instruction which is basically to copy
12:11 - this block of code and put it down at
12:13 - the bottom of script py and so if you've
12:15 - never seen data visualization before
12:17 - this is a lot of code that we're asking
12:19 - you to copy with personally I'm not a
12:21 - huge fan of because it's like I really
12:24 - like my my students to know what they're
12:26 - copying copying but it's fun to see
12:28 - we're working towards this sort of thing
12:30 - so I'm gonna copy that code in and that
12:33 - you'll see that it creates this line
12:36 - graph of two separate lines opening
12:38 - price and closing price our axes are
12:41 - labeled pretty well where we're able to
12:43 - see what the x-axis is and what the
12:46 - y-axis is I thought we could dig a
12:49 - little bit into this code yeah you can
12:54 - first talk about what libraries we're
12:56 - using so you'll see at the very top of
12:58 - this script reporting to libraries
13:00 - the first one is confusing unfortunate
13:04 - is this like a bit of context right so
13:08 - when you're working on codecademy you're
13:10 - working in a pretty special environment
13:12 - it's not the same as the environment
13:14 - that you'd run on your computer and so
13:18 - in order for us to emulate what it would
13:21 - be like to run an environment on your
13:23 - computer and being able to import
13:25 - certain libraries we have to import one
13:28 - of our own special libraries which we
13:30 - called code cat ameloid but if anywhere
13:32 - to for example want to try this out on
13:35 - your own text editor on your computer
13:37 - you want to have to import that yeah in
13:43 - a way in a later session and perhaps in
13:45 - one of these zoom webinars which we've
13:48 - been teasing we can we can discuss how
13:51 - they'll like set up your own personal
13:52 - computer to run run things on your own
13:54 - computer so you're not reliant on
13:55 - Codecademy we also how much of resources
13:58 - on code can out of me that show you how
14:00 - to do that I think it's always really
14:01 - helpful to see someone go through that
14:02 - process because kind of a pain in the
14:04 - butt absolutely and I mean we have this
14:07 - look great about the skill path is that
14:09 - we have projects throughout the entire
14:11 - path that you're meant to do on your own
14:13 - computer so as I look so saying
14:16 - sometimes it can be really painful to
14:18 - install a lot of the software and get
14:20 - started so yeah I think it's a great
14:21 - idea something like that
14:23 - cool so that's co-captain a lip it's the
14:26 - thing that lets us show your graph right
14:28 - here
14:29 - when you hit the Run button the other
14:30 - more important one is that we are using
14:32 - matplotlib and specifically we are using
14:35 - pipe lot from matplotlib and so this is
14:38 - really the library that this path is
14:39 - going to dive into we're gonna learn a
14:41 - bunch of different matplotlib functions
14:43 - and features and settings that you can
14:46 - set in there so this is kind of the
14:47 - bread and butter of its course later in
14:50 - the path we're going to be getting into
14:54 - yes yeah more complexity get like really
15:01 - interesting graphs highly recommend
15:03 - checking out the documentation you get
15:05 - those crazy violin plots yeah these
15:10 - plots were came from Seaborg yeah they
15:12 - kind of look like birds
15:13 - [Laughter]
15:16 - yeah I think maybe the one last thing to
15:19 - say about the import is that you can see
15:21 - your scroll up at the top again we're
15:24 - importing the pie plot but we're also
15:26 - renaming it to PLT so that just helps us
15:31 - to shorten our code makes it more
15:34 - efficient yeah if you cut if you come
15:36 - down here and look at this code a little
15:37 - bit you'll see we have PLT dot plot
15:39 - basically here we're saying okay we're
15:41 - calling this plot function but what
15:43 - library is it coming from it's coming
15:45 - from
15:46 - PLT which really is PI plot but we've
15:49 - just shorted it so we don't have to
15:50 - write PI plot again and again again and
15:52 - again if I get rid of this I can then
15:55 - cut them down here and we can do PI plot
15:59 - dot plot
16:03 - okay I'm looking at the chat Thank You
16:08 - Kenny for answering questions please
16:12 - continue to ask questions in there Kenny
16:14 - is obviously doing a great job of
16:15 - answering them but we'll try to take a
16:17 - look every now and then of questions for
16:20 - you to answer we really want this to be
16:22 - kind of as interactive as possible again
16:24 - this lesson is a little bit weird
16:25 - because it's more discussion based and
16:26 - not a super coding based but if you have
16:29 - questions about the code in particular
16:31 - we're happy to dive into that otherwise
16:34 - we will just keep going I think this is
16:37 - a great time to you know ground
16:39 - ourselves in the concepts of data
16:42 - visualization to write so like right now
16:46 - we're looking a lot at the code and what
16:47 - it outputs but in the narrative we're
16:49 - also thinking about what is the data
16:50 - visualization process overall and that's
16:53 - something that's going to be important
16:54 - to think about as you get into more of
16:56 - the coding like it so why suggest
17:01 - visualization but specifically like you
17:05 - know how do we go about that at a higher
17:07 - level
17:08 - we start with formatting the data we
17:10 - then move into visualizing that data and
17:12 - you can style the visualization too so I
17:15 - really I do love these Y data visually
17:17 - or I guess I should say like Y X
17:20 - we have at the beginning of a lot of our
17:23 - skill packs because I think they do a
17:25 - great job of contextualizing why you
17:28 - would want to learn this technology and
17:30 - what you should expect to see over the
17:32 - rest of the course even if you have to
17:34 - copy and paste some code and kind of
17:35 - don't know what's happening yeah for
17:37 - sure yeah it's it's kind of a motivating
17:39 - uh this is what's coming up the rest of
17:42 - the lesson kind of talks about what you
17:44 - were to speaking to Zoey where we have a
17:46 - couple of different key parts of data
17:49 - visualization that we're gonna go over
17:50 - in a super high level the first is this
17:52 - idea of formatting so data can come in a
17:57 - bunch of different formats the the ones
18:00 - that we talked about in this narratives
18:02 - are Python set Python has lists which is
18:05 - actually I think the next unit that we
18:08 - cover in this skill path is that we
18:10 - really dive into lists and show you how
18:12 - to work with them that's it's kind of
18:15 - one of the most basic elements of
18:19 - programming in Python and so we'll also
18:22 - want to start working with like a little
18:24 - bit more complex data structures so like
18:26 - we talked about before we have CSV files
18:28 - which are comma separated values these
18:31 - are what you will find if you export
18:34 - from an Excel document or even you can
18:36 - open up a CSV file in Excel and then
18:39 - finally we have panda that pandas
18:41 - dataframes
18:42 - so what that does come up you know I I
19:06 - don't know I feel like I'm often on the
19:08 - wrong side of these debates I'm gonna
19:10 - I'm a Jif guy not a not a gift
19:13 - not again person yeah in the chat tell
19:20 - us if you're I already forget what which
19:22 - one we are so it team Alex is data and
19:25 - Tina it's the other way around
19:28 - it was data it's I mean it's data on
19:32 - Star Trek it is data on Star Trek that's
19:35 - obviously but to go back to your actual
19:42 - original question data frames so pandas
19:46 - is another data analysis library that
19:48 - we're gonna be using and of course the
19:50 - skill path much like the matplotlib
19:52 - one that we saw in the last exercise
19:56 - pandas is a really awesome library you
19:59 - do a lot of stuff with it but what we
20:02 - often use it for is taking in raw data
20:04 - either you know like from a CSV and
20:07 - starting to structure it in a way that
20:09 - enables us to work with it further so
20:13 - that structure is called a data frame
20:15 - and alex is highlighting the specific
20:19 - command that you use to read in a CSV
20:22 - file and then print it as a data frame
20:24 - so let's take a look at what that what
20:27 - that looks like
20:27 - yeah so again we have a CSV kind of
20:30 - behind the scenes here and you'll see
20:32 - that the headers are we're talking about
20:34 - countries and then different years this
20:39 - is global population so you'll see we
20:42 - have this big mess of comma separated
20:46 - values it'll be pretty hard to like you
20:48 - could imagine trying to put like make
20:51 - this a Python list like I could copy all
20:53 - of this over and then like put it like
20:55 - genuinely done try to do some formatting
20:57 - in some of these files right so so
21:04 - that's really the power of pandas other
21:06 - I mean one of the one of the strengths
21:08 - of pandas is that we immediately just
21:10 - get to read in this CSV file and it's in
21:12 - this format now that we can start to
21:14 - work with and so I can probably do stuff
21:16 - like actually it has been in a while
21:18 - [Laughter]
21:22 - mom's writing uh writing our content so
21:26 - I'm more familiar with our at this point
21:27 - but I will try to write a line of pandas
21:30 - code here real quick cool Kenny said
21:36 - Astroworld had a good question oh yeah
21:39 - hi thanks for the live stream YC born
21:41 - over plotly just reference that is a
21:43 - great question
21:45 - so yeah Seabourn was our particular
21:47 - preference partly it's nice because you
21:50 - can do interactive graphs with plotly
21:54 - honestly like if we plot li was like a
21:57 - reach goal for us in this and I hope
21:59 - that someday that we do end up teaching
22:01 - hotly on code Academy cuz it's very
22:04 - popular but Seabourn I think is a nice
22:07 - natural step from matplotlib because
22:09 - it's library and actually I was going to
22:12 - say this plays nicely with canvas you
22:14 - can directly read in a dataframe from
22:17 - pandas and turn that into a
22:18 - visualization cool yeah I know again I
22:22 - was saying I've just been working on our
22:23 - content for a long time and Plumlee was
22:25 - something that I ran into in writing all
22:29 - this our content and so partly is one
22:32 - that again seems to work between
22:35 - different coding languages which is kind
22:37 - of cool yeah so I was about to write
22:40 - some pandas pandas code but I realized
22:42 - we actually aren't showing the the
22:46 - terminal output here we're only showing
22:48 - this this web browser output so even if
22:51 - I didn't do like print length of data
22:54 - frame which I don't even know if that's
22:56 - a real function again it's been a little
22:58 - bit since I've done pandas um even if I
23:00 - ran this we wouldn't see that print that
23:03 - print statement because we're not
23:04 - showing the terminal yeah nevermind
23:07 - basically so I mean a little bit about
23:10 - it like I guess peek into the the
23:12 - backside of coke Adam II as you can see
23:16 - in our lessons we have a you know a text
23:18 - editor in the middle and then we have
23:19 - the output on the right hand side so we
23:21 - can modify those components per exercise
23:24 - depending on what we think is what you
23:29 - should use in the exercise so like if
23:32 - you thought you wanted to have a
23:33 - terminal in order to be your output to
23:35 - the term
23:38 - and I guess this is also a fun fact
23:39 - about the code Academy live that we're
23:41 - actually rendering these panels made
23:43 - Hana data frames as it's like an SVG or
23:47 - something there's like it's like an HTML
23:48 - file yeah again interesting and
23:52 - engineering platform wizardry to be able
23:55 - to print out these pandas into our our
23:59 - web component yeah yeah cool all right
24:02 - let's keep moving
24:03 - we're at the halfway point of this
24:05 - session so I want to make sure we get
24:06 - through this lesson fairly quickly and
24:07 - then we can show off some other
24:08 - visualizations we can take more
24:09 - questions Sam I see your question I will
24:17 - we can we can answer questions as
24:19 - towards the end of the session so keep
24:21 - asking questions and we can come back
24:27 - yes all right so in this one we talked
24:32 - about okay so the first step was getting
24:35 - your data in a format that you can use
24:36 - the next step is visualizing your data
24:39 - so you talked a little bit about the
24:41 - difference between a plot live in C born
24:43 - here ask you to draw this graph which
24:54 - [Laughter]
24:57 - month passengers and bar charts and so I
25:02 - know the next section of this this
25:04 - course is talking about how to make your
25:07 - graph intelligible right where right now
25:09 - I don't really know what this is talking
25:10 - about I would guess it is airline staff
25:14 - yeah yeah loading data sets flights but
25:20 - in the next section we'll talk about how
25:22 - it's important to kind of label your
25:24 - graph appropriately so people know what
25:26 - the heck you're talking about this is
25:30 - this is Seaborn so any any supporting
25:33 - elements thinking about there's some
25:53 - articles that show you that you can
25:56 - choose we're going to talk about styling
25:58 - later you can actually change what kind
26:00 - of grid you're using we're also loading
26:03 - the data set with Seaborn and then we
26:07 - are executing a bar plot and if you're
26:10 - familiar with bar plots we're plotting
26:12 - things on the x-axis the month it is and
26:16 - then the y-axis is the passengers how
26:18 - many passengers are in it and then we're
26:20 - saving the data that we're passing into
26:22 - that bar plot is again the flights data
26:24 - that we had before exactly we're doing a
26:27 - little bit of stuff where we're rotating
26:28 - the x-axis or the things on the x-axis
26:31 - let's see what happens if we just get
26:33 - rid of that
26:47 - yeah and that's something that I think
26:49 - zoeng I would both encourage people to
26:51 - do in these intro lessons where you
26:54 - don't really know what this code is is
26:55 - doing do little things like that right
26:58 - if I just remove this line of code you
26:59 - get a better sense of like okay that's
27:01 - somehow affecting these X ticks you
27:03 - could even look up
27:05 - so X tic is coming from clot so let's do
27:10 - this let's do matplotlib pie plot X 10
27:13 - let's see if we can find the
27:14 - documentation here on the fly right so I
27:22 - can just google that look at the
27:23 - documentation and see examples of
27:29 - different different ways that we can use
27:31 - X to X yeah I'll see if that works
27:37 - oh yeah Alex's points it's really great
27:43 - especially since you are just copying
27:44 - and pasting right now to like spend some
27:46 - time with the code that's
27:49 - that you're that you're pasting in to
27:52 - see if you can understand it a bit more
27:54 - before you even start to really learn it
27:56 - in full yeah I like one of the things
27:59 - that I think that's something that I
28:01 - think that I wish we did a little bit
28:03 - better on Kirk Adam E is like
28:04 - encouraging people to explore and it's
28:07 - hard to do that when it's just through
28:08 - through text because we can write up a
28:10 - you know we can write a paragraph that
28:11 - says exactly what we're saying of like
28:13 - explore on your own but yeah it's so fun
28:15 - to like just go through coke Adam II and
28:17 - like get the green checkmark in that way
28:25 - yeah so it's so to really take advantage
28:27 - of coke at me I'd like that really
28:30 - that's like the best thing that you can
28:31 - do is really kind of experiment and play
28:33 - with the code even after you've got the
28:34 - checkmarks absolutely cool let's move on
28:39 - to the next section
28:45 - yes so let's see what are we doing here
28:49 - we are setting the X tix - so this is
28:55 - our stock exchange data you're setting
29:01 - the x tix - rather than zero 50 100 150
29:04 - 200 and 250 we are overriding those with
29:09 - this list of months month names
29:13 - specifically using this tables function
29:17 - so again that's a that's a function that
29:19 - you might want to go and look up the
29:20 - documentation for and say okay it seems
29:23 - like this is taking a list of names
29:25 - could it take anything else are there
29:27 - other options that I could do with that
29:28 - all that sort of stuff would be a good
29:32 - idea - to do let me actually didn't get
29:37 - the green checkmark but that's because
29:39 - of some weird back-end stuff there we go
29:44 - yes
29:46 - similarly we can have the title mm-hmm I
29:50 - think one thing that we kind of try to
29:51 - highlight here in this lesson is that we
29:55 - say make sure to put all of this code
29:56 - that we're pasting in before plot dot
29:59 - show we do plus if we do an after plot
30:01 - dot show it didn't do anything in
30:06 - personally it passed our test but you'll
30:08 - notice that uh the the title get an
30:12 - update it's a really plot dot show is
30:14 - the thing that says like okay you've set
30:15 - everything about your graphs let's show
30:18 - it now so everything has to come before
30:20 - plot show exactly important thing to
30:24 - remember if you're ever debugging saying
30:26 - hey I changed this thing yep and then
30:30 - finally we do legend labels so this is
30:33 - setting an opening price and a closing
30:36 - price legend for the different colored
30:38 - lines so y legend labels to turn plot
30:46 - yeah I think I mean the obvious answer
30:51 - is to have people understand what your
30:54 - rafters is talking about where there
30:56 - were no there are no labels whatsoever
30:58 - on this crap graph it would be a pretty
31:00 - graph but I would have no idea if this
31:02 - was talking about you know Netflix lock
31:04 - prices or if it was talking about the
31:06 - weather
31:07 - right like it could be it could be
31:08 - literally anything and so just
31:10 - communicating your findings he's kind of
31:13 - the point of data visualization and so I
31:15 - know personally I'm pretty bad at this
31:17 - where we can graph him and I like forget
31:19 - to put in the final five percent to make
31:21 - it yeah I was looking through all the
31:27 - lessons that I've done I found stuff
31:30 - where it's like I do not like put the
31:31 - title on there so like I'm I'm bad I'm
31:34 - bad at it but or I forget sometimes
31:36 - don't aren't as a rigorous as I should
31:39 - be but for like truly professional
31:42 - graphs or graphs that you're really
31:44 - showing people and publishing you want
31:48 - it to be as detailed as possible
31:49 - absolutely a part of it is framing it
31:51 - right like usually you're doing data
31:53 - visualization to
31:54 - sir a set of questions so how did
31:57 - Netflix stocks perform in 2017 right
32:01 - like we are using this visualization to
32:04 - show that performance which is why again
32:07 - it's helpful to have month names there
32:10 - because we're thinking about this in the
32:12 - context of time rather than just using
32:15 - you know whatever I had before I think
32:17 - super easy okay but what are you
32:24 - automatically you know think that's what
32:27 - it was not necessarily it's you know
32:30 - it's taking a lot of this stuff and we
32:31 - can get more cubed readable right here's
32:35 - I think for your audience to slightly
32:36 - critique the graph I think like price we
32:39 - could show units well first of all I
32:40 - know nothing about stock so I don't even
32:42 - know if prices or if this is in if this
32:47 - is in dollars or you know whatever but
32:50 - like I think the y-axis could be
32:53 - slightly more detailed but maybe that's
32:54 - because I am not pretty not exactly the
32:57 - audience for this you know I mean how do
33:03 - you style your plot specifically for
33:05 - your audience you may not need to
33:07 - provide as much detailed information if
33:09 - people already have an understanding of
33:11 - what the context is but if you're
33:13 - writing an article rate like you see a
33:14 - lot of data journalism these days you're
33:18 - usually going to have just like it you
33:20 - know everyday person a professional
33:22 - reading that content so you're gonna
33:24 - want to be as detailed as you can
33:26 - possibly be
33:27 - whereas if you are a I don't know
33:29 - microbiologist and you are presenting a
33:31 - paper at a conference that's on you know
33:34 - some very specific topic I don't nothing
33:36 - about microbiology right shows that as
33:39 - my sample but you probably wouldn't have
33:42 - to like spell everything out for a
33:43 - person performing pretty well right now
33:56 - but that's a pretty good segue so let's
33:59 - fly to the end of this course and I can
34:00 - show you some some other visualizations
34:02 - we have on the platform dad a
34:04 - responsibility yes important topic and
34:08 - really I really love this exercise and
34:11 - I'm really glad to tell you we're at
34:12 - this lesson put in here so I think it's
34:14 - super important yeah do you want to give
34:17 - a high-level overview of what what this
34:19 - one is talking about yeah absolutely so
34:23 - what is covering is kind of saying like
34:25 - it's really easy for us to take in some
34:27 - data and just make a visualization and
34:30 - say like okay great I'm trying to you
34:33 - know ask this question and I've got a
34:37 - set of data and it clearly proves what I
34:39 - would like I wanted to prove or
34:42 - sometimes we look at data like we could
34:47 - say you know like the number of users on
34:49 - coke atom each site and you just let it
34:52 - you know say like what we think the
34:56 - answer is I don't know like we see like
34:58 - a ton of users around like noon oh okay
35:00 - noon Eastern Time everyone's having
35:02 - lunch what is that like really it was
35:04 - happening I think part of it is is
35:09 - taking some as it sounds like some
35:11 - responsibility for your interpretation
35:13 - and thinking about where you come from
35:17 - as an interpreter right like what are
35:19 - some biases that you may hold how is
35:22 - that impacting even your data collection
35:24 - process and what you're bringing in so
35:26 - they have this example may exercise
35:28 - about when they were designing airbags
35:30 - and the prototype that used was just a
35:32 - male mannequin and so the data they
35:34 - collected was actually biased in terms
35:38 - of how it performed and that ended up
35:40 - actually having real ramifications in
35:43 - the production process all the saying
35:47 - that you know ethics I think is super
35:49 - important to talk about generally what
35:50 - we're talking about programming and
35:52 - especially when we get into talking
35:53 - about data how we're collecting data the
35:56 - processes for collecting data the actual
36:00 - content of the data that's there and
36:02 - then how we choose to show data data
36:06 - visualizations
36:07 - notorious for being able to lie to
36:11 - people because you can change things
36:13 - like you know like the why there's like
36:16 - a whole thing about y-axes and like
36:18 - shortening them to make it look like
36:20 - there's actually a greater difference
36:22 - between like two line graphs that there
36:25 - actually is or in this case so plotting
36:30 - to totally different data sets but
36:34 - saying like oh look there's a
36:36 - relationship between this data just
36:38 - because it has a similar shape to it do
36:40 - you really think that there's a
36:42 - relationship between the letters and the
36:44 - winning spelling bee word and we have a
36:50 - good one in chat from Robert saying
36:52 - these rise in sea level and the decline
36:54 - of population in Pirates correlation
37:00 - correlation and causation it would like
37:03 - try and find these like super random
37:07 - different data sets and then show how
37:09 - they they mirror each other right right
37:12 - we should try to find that one but yeah
37:15 - there's lots of articles out there that
37:17 - talk about how you can you know
37:21 - critically look at a data visualization
37:23 - to understand is it actually
37:26 - interpreting the data correctly and
37:28 - presenting the relationships correctly
37:29 - actually there is a great one from The
37:32 - Economist that talked about their
37:35 - process for critiquing their data
37:39 - visualizations and improving that I'm
37:41 - saying like looking at like how clear is
37:43 - this data is the relationship really
37:46 - what we're attempting to show various
37:50 - things like that so it's cool to see you
37:53 - know we do this for a living
37:54 - start to think more deeply about how
37:57 - their work is impactful
37:59 - yeah I mean knowing I could talk about
38:00 - this for hours the cool thing with like
38:06 - basically everything that you can learn
38:08 - in programming is that there's like the
38:10 - syntax of how do I do this thing and
38:12 - then there's the kind of meta discussion
38:15 - around it of okay how do we use these
38:17 - what are the ethics of using these tools
38:19 - that we've done
38:21 - what are the different ways that we can
38:23 - use in the different stakeholders that
38:24 - that are interested in this technology
38:26 - so I mean hopefully that that's one of
38:29 - the benefits of these streams is that
38:30 - you'll not only be able to get like the
38:34 - syntax as we get into doing some real
38:36 - programming but you'll also be able to
38:38 - engage in conversations like this where
38:39 - we talk about you know the impact of
38:42 - these tools that we're teaching
38:44 - absolutely cool we have two final little
38:49 - looking ahead wrapping up we talked
38:52 - about formatting visualization and
38:54 - styling okay so that is the first well
38:59 - in the visualize data with pythonpath
39:02 - so plug it for next week is the next
39:05 - Tuesday it we have two more curriculum
39:11 - developers going through the next course
39:13 - so the next course is going to be let's
39:16 - see I believe it is Python syntax yes so
39:24 - what we did here is the content and we
39:30 - sherry picked a couple of programming
39:32 - concepts that we thought would be super
39:35 - helpful for folks to know if they hadn't
39:36 - done Python before and they were
39:38 - starting to engage with this material so
39:40 - what I really like about a lot of our
39:42 - school paths is that you don't come in
39:44 - with any prior information you really
39:46 - start you at zero so you can skip this
39:49 - stuff if you've already done Python
39:51 - before but if I can't speak for you
39:53 - all good we'll be learning it before we
39:55 - get into the data visualization stuff so
39:58 - that's the plan for next week I believe
40:01 - the people signed up for that are we Ian
40:03 - freed who has written a lot of our data
40:04 - science content and then another alex
40:08 - curriculum developer not me
40:12 - we'll also be doing next Tuesday stream
40:15 - I think this would be a good time to
40:18 - talk about the other set of streams we
40:20 - have planned yeah so in addition to
40:24 - these these streams that are free we're
40:27 - stringing them on YouTube and twitch and
40:30 - everywhere every week we're also going
40:32 - to do a bonus stream or
40:35 - it's not a stream we're gonna do a bonus
40:36 - webinar or bonus session for pro members
40:40 - this week's bonus session is actually
40:44 - going to be open to everyone just to
40:46 - give people a taste of what we might be
40:48 - doing in that session but the idea
40:52 - behind and so that session is gonna be
40:54 - on Friday it's gonna be me
40:55 - Zoe and then a third curriculum
40:57 - developer Carolyn the idea behind these
41:01 - book sessions is rather than doing
41:03 - something consistent like these free
41:07 - streams where the free stream is always
41:09 - going to be going through the next the
41:12 - next step of the path whatever path
41:14 - we're doing these bonus sessions are
41:17 - going to be an opportunity for you to
41:18 - basically have more personal
41:20 - conversations with with us we're gonna
41:22 - do it on a zoom webinar and people can
41:26 - call in if you want to call in and ask
41:28 - us a question and like have a
41:29 - conversation with us that's something
41:30 - that we'll be doing Zoe and I are gonna
41:33 - give out a little bit of an assignment
41:36 - that if you want you can come to be the
41:41 - procession having done this thing and
41:44 - you can show us what you've done and
41:45 - talk about it a little bit it's kind of
41:50 - more Q&A we're in this free session
41:53 - we've really kind of been focused on
41:54 - getting through the lesson and going
41:56 - through the lesson and you know we've
41:57 - been trying to answer questions in chat
41:59 - as we go but we'll have we'll have tons
42:04 - of time for to do that in the bonus
42:05 - session so very briefly I want to show
42:08 - the flow of registering for that bonus
42:11 - session again all of this stuff is this
42:14 - is kind of a beta week for us all this
42:18 - session were is the first time that
42:19 - we're doing it so bear with us as there
42:22 - are kinks in the process and also we
42:24 - would love your feedback for how we can
42:27 - do stuff differently um but if you go to
42:29 - the main page of coke Adam II we now
42:33 - have this events page so you can click
42:36 - on register and you'll see that we have
42:38 - three events one is the one that you are
42:40 - currently watching if you're watching
42:41 - this live which is in this visualize
42:44 - data with Python we have the next free
42:47 - stream which is the second course
42:49 - individualize dating with Python battle
42:50 - that would be the thing that Ian and
42:52 - Alex do next Tuesday
42:54 - so that's this one again that will just
42:56 - be streamed on YouTube and twitch and
42:58 - everywhere so you could either come in
43:00 - here and register for it or you can just
43:03 - find it on our on our YouTube page or
43:05 - our twitch page but then this middle
43:07 - stream is the one that's right now we're
43:09 - calling Q Pro na so normally will
43:13 - restrict these two Pro members but for
43:15 - this one we are letting anyone register
43:18 - for it so you can come in here and
43:20 - register for it
43:22 - click on this link and register for the
43:25 - bazoom webinar basically you'll get an
43:29 - email and then on Friday at 3 p.m. we'll
43:34 - go live we will go live with that
43:38 - webinar so that's the idea basically we
43:42 - want to add we want to do a session
43:45 - where we go through a course and then
43:46 - every week also offer a session where we
43:49 - actually get to like chat with you and
43:50 - get to build a little bit of the
43:51 - community and take any of your like
43:55 - deeper questions that we weren't able to
43:57 - get to in the free session mm-hmm
44:00 - anything no just a game University
44:07 - lecture class and you have those lab
44:11 - sessions with a TA where you really get
44:14 - to engage with your fellow classmates
44:16 - you get to ask questions that maybe you
44:18 - didn't have a chance to ask during the
44:20 - lecture session I think that's how we're
44:23 - thinking of these processions it's
44:25 - really an opportunity for you to you
44:27 - know come to the free session you get
44:29 - exposed to the material maybe spend the
44:31 - next couple of days going through it on
44:34 - your own you start to have questions and
44:36 - Fridays your opportunity to ask those
44:39 - questions to a real live person which
44:43 - isn't something that we've always you
44:45 - know had the opportunity to do with code
44:46 - cabbies are really excited to make that
44:48 - an option yeah the big dream for this it
44:52 - is eventually if these turn out to be
44:55 - popular you can start doing this with
44:56 - different series so right now I'm only
44:59 - going through visualize data with Python
45:02 - but
45:03 - these turn out to be super popular and
45:04 - people want hey let's do a web dev
45:07 - series where we'll have a web dev course
45:10 - and a web dev procession during the week
45:12 - that's kind of like the idea of like we
45:14 - would love to see this events calendar
45:17 - really kind of like build out into
45:20 - almost like you know coke Adam II like
45:25 - here's the week of events at coke Adam
45:26 - II I have a bunch of different learning
45:43 - suddenly enjoyable when you have other
45:45 - folks doing with you and us as teachers
45:48 - we've like just talking with you guys to
45:58 - reading reports and it would be fun to
46:03 - connect to you all with each other right
46:05 - if if someone hops on a call Linley in
46:08 - the process and asks a question related
46:10 - to a project you were working on maybe
46:11 - you can link up with Velma and start
46:13 - working on together or you can help each
46:15 - other out and maybe you know Alex and I
46:43 - talked about little assignments that you
46:45 - can do you know be introduced during the
46:47 - first event and when you come to the Q&A
46:49 - session you show off the word that you
46:52 - did to us and to the other learners cool
47:04 - yeah so Joey and I came up with this
47:06 - little assignment so if you would like
47:09 - to join that the pro Q&A that's gonna be
47:11 - on Friday at 3 p.m. again you can follow
47:14 - that link in the advanced page to read
47:16 - sir for the zoom the zoom call we've
47:19 - linked this form I'll put it in the chat
47:22 - right now but it's also in the YouTube
47:24 - description we've linked this form if
47:30 - you're going to come to the procession
47:31 - which I think would be super fun we
47:33 - would love you fill out this form so
47:35 - we're asking you for your name which is
47:38 - optional we're asking for your name so
47:40 - we give you credit if you ask a question
47:42 - we can say hey you know this person
47:44 - asked this question any general
47:48 - questions about data visualization this
47:52 - is the assignment that we we thought of
47:54 - yeah we wanted you to create a
47:57 - visualization of data of any kind
47:59 - doesn't have to be programming find a
48:01 - way to share it with us
48:02 - could be a pic you know you could make
48:04 - something physical in your house or
48:06 - apartment and take a picture and tweeted
48:08 - at us you could I have an idea already
48:12 - shared with Zoe which i think is a weird
48:16 - one yes let me I'll give you this screen
48:29 - share in one second let me finish going
48:30 - over this form so this is yes so this
48:32 - question is I create a data
48:34 - visualization of any kind if you share
48:36 - it with us we'll talk about it on the
48:37 - probe pro stream or show it off if
48:39 - you're if you're in the pro stream you
48:41 - can come on and talk with us about it if
48:43 - you'd like if you have any links or
48:48 - resources that you would like to share
48:49 - with us we'd love to see them and we
48:53 - again that's something that we could
48:54 - share on the stream and then any
48:56 - feedback about all of this stuff in
48:59 - general what you think about the free
49:01 - live streams of going through a course
49:03 - what you think about the pro live
49:04 - streams of getting a chance to like talk
49:08 - to people and it being a little bit more
49:11 - communal so just any feedback we'd love
49:14 - to have again people watching this you
49:16 - are like the first you are the what well
49:20 - done you're like the first people check
49:22 - this stuff out and so no we would really
49:24 - really value your feedback attack
49:28 - let's see cool Zoey I'm gonna stop my
49:33 - screen share if you want to screen share
49:34 - to show some cool visualizations I will
49:37 - also try to look through chat to answer
49:39 - some questions and we'll do all right we
49:42 - see this cool so as Alex and I were
49:47 - working on putting together today's
49:49 - session we talked about our experience
49:53 - with data visualization and also some
49:55 - data visualizations and I just wanted to
50:00 - share some examples of folks that whose
50:03 - work I've come across in the past couple
50:05 - years so one person is Jared Thor people
50:08 - been on the livestream with me before
50:10 - it's a lot about how I went to graduate
50:11 - school and my view this program called I
50:14 - Tiki Jared Eric was a t-shirt and my
50:16 - Tiki Amy taught a class called data art
50:19 - and so I think he has some really great
50:21 - examples of projects that exist at the
50:25 - intersection of data but are also using
50:29 - a lot of different mediums so again well
50:32 - we're going to be talking about data
50:33 - visualization in programming
50:35 - dude visualization has a long history
50:39 - that existed before we are actually
50:41 - working with computers so I think like
50:43 - one great really example it's W two data
50:46 - visualizations these are incredibly
50:49 - beautiful and talk about life of black
50:52 - Americans at the turn of the 20th
50:54 - century
50:55 - we'll post links to this stuff so you
50:58 - can you can look through it on your own
51:00 - time stuff that's more current again not
51:06 - using programming but Mona Shalaby is a
51:09 - infographics artist and she just he's
51:11 - just like if I needs to be like
51:13 - incredibly hilarious and super relatable
51:16 - data visualization so while she's using
51:19 - the languages of you know our chart
51:22 - she's finding ways to breathe new life
51:25 - into that kind of idea so this is
51:28 - literally just googled Mona jalabiya
51:30 - infographics and you can kind of get a
51:31 - sense of this her Instagram is really
51:33 - fantastic
51:34 - I was the nose job one there in the top
51:37 - left
51:38 - or there's no this is flu viruses see
51:41 - the other one another person who has a
51:45 - really simple way of doing data but
51:48 - visualizations is an Friedman she has a
51:52 - great weekly newsletter email newsletter
51:55 - that she sends out and she posts one of
51:58 - these pie charts at the end of each of
52:00 - it so what are we doing on this airplane
52:03 - and you can click in here and see how
52:08 - she's she's flirting at crying and a
52:10 - Pixar movie okay it dried open third bag
52:16 - of pretzels
52:17 - so again if you're thinking about
52:19 - completing this assignment you know what
52:21 - I happen so you need to go through and
52:23 - like have to program anything it could
52:24 - be as basic as this another really cool
52:28 - one that I came across was this artist
52:30 - married Lucian Berger who did a project
52:34 - data visualization now I'm trying to
52:37 - find using photographs and everyday
52:43 - objects
52:43 - I chose feature and so I'm not going to
52:46 - pretend I know that these visualizations
52:48 - are about but I think just scrolling
52:50 - through them you get a really
52:51 - interesting sense of how you can again
52:54 - visualize data in ways beyond the
52:57 - traditional scatter God's choir charts
53:00 - graphs things like this like what again
53:03 - is in your environment both that you
53:05 - could think of as data but that you
53:06 - could use in your data visualization get
53:09 - super creative I love this sandwich what
53:12 - warranty food do you have use to make
53:16 - any visualization data for example last
53:20 - resource that I'm going to share is a
53:22 - website called pudding so they are as
53:26 - they say digital publication that does
53:28 - these visual essays but a lot of them
53:30 - are really just amazing interactive data
53:35 - visualizations so the worst highest game
53:38 - NBA player ever like what I love it
53:42 - because they they find these really
53:43 - interesting stories that are super me
53:46 - then you're a really great job of
53:48 - presenting that information that's
53:50 - awesome yeah so all of this stuff is our
53:52 - kind of example is of like what we're
53:54 - looking looking for if you want to share
53:57 - with us and come to this procession make
53:59 - something like that and try to find a
54:02 - way to share with us yeah I so we are
54:08 - basically out of time more ways to get
54:13 - involved with this sort of stuff if you
54:14 - enjoyed it subscribe to us on YouTube
54:18 - that will that will actually help I
54:19 - think that that's a great way to just
54:21 - like see the Wendy's live videos come up
54:23 - we're also on Twitch if you follow us on
54:25 - twitch that will also help us out if you
54:28 - want to get in touch with me and Zoey
54:29 - you can get in touch with us on Twitter
54:32 - that even would be a fun place for you
54:34 - to send your send your visualization if
54:39 - you end up making one I think I am at
54:42 - Alex B Koontz and I'll type in the
54:46 - YouTube channel right now and then so we
54:50 - are you can find me on Twitter highly
55:10 - recommend that you sign up for a free
55:12 - account with a free account you get a
55:16 - free week of trial and then that enables
55:18 - you to get access to quizzes projects
55:21 - actually this entire is still packed
55:23 - right Pisco pack is a special content
55:26 - item for our pro learners yeah so um
55:32 - yeah I think that's it so again the
55:35 - events coming up we got one on Friday at
55:36 - 3:00 with me Zoe and Carolyn where it
55:40 - will be a little bit more discussion
55:42 - based so any questions that you had or
55:44 - if you just want to talk to us after
55:45 - watching this session then next Tuesday
55:49 - we have another livestream with Ian and
55:53 - other Alex
55:56 - going through the next course in this
55:59 - path so hopefully they'll get through
56:00 - that course and maybe do the quiz in the
56:02 - project well follow along there and the
56:08 - live stream these are recorded this is
56:10 - not a convenient time for you no worries
56:13 - you'll be able to watch the recording
56:15 - later obviously we love it when people
56:16 - are watching live with us asking
56:18 - questions that we can answer on air too
56:21 - although brief clarification be like
56:24 - bonus session the pro the pro session
56:26 - that's going to be only on it's gonna be
56:29 - a basically a private Zoo and webinar so
56:31 - we won't be stringing that live because
56:33 - that's for pro members sources right
56:36 - exactly yeah so so just a little a
56:40 - little special something for our Kroners
56:43 - or coke addict pro learners which is
56:45 - great and like I'm excited to talk to
56:46 - you more about data visualization as art
56:49 - really innovative ways doing data
56:52 - visualizations talking more around the
56:54 - ethics of data visualization
56:56 - particularly no right now with this hope
57:00 - in 19 days of collection that's going on
57:04 - and how is that even collection helpful
57:06 - to communities basically it's hard to
57:11 - get means that we only wanted to do an
57:19 - hour-long session today but then that
57:21 - wanted to keep talking though we hope
57:23 - that you will join us that yeah alright
57:28 - I think that's it it's it's 201 thank
57:32 - you again to everyone who joined us for
57:34 - this very first sessions really
57:37 - appreciate you taking the time to be
57:40 - with us today
57:41 - bless you for making of our first first
57:45 - time we've tried this
57:46 - [Laughter]
57:52 - you know what really needs is having you
57:54 - all here with us and folks take your
57:56 - questions
57:58 - hi I think it's gonna be a really great
58:02 - series Alex you know yeah this is some
58:05 - money yeah - Kenny and then the folks
58:10 - behind the scenes that helped us Lisa
58:15 - all those folks too so stay tuned for
58:19 - more content
58:20 - okay Kenny lives all right see y'all
58:22 - later

Cleaned transcript:

so hello everyone my name is Alex Koontz I'm a curriculum developer here at Koch Adam II and I'm here with these that we hey everyone I'm Zoe I'm a curriculum product manager here at GoDaddy and so what today is the first in hopefully a long series of events where we are going to be doing some coding with you every single week so we're calling this as of right now well first of all all of you in chat your your your the early adopters right first time ever really kind of trying this this larger series and so there will be I'm sure many many things to talk about and things that will change over time but good for all of you in the chat for being here and being the first ones to check out this series Zoe do you kind of want to describe what is Koch Adam II live what are we doing here yeah so code County live is a new series that we're doing if you've been a code Academy learner with us in the past you may have seen previous live streams with the curriculum team so like Alex and I have both done live streams before but now we're going to start off doing a dedicated series to walk through some code Academy content we're starting off with the data visualization Python skill path so we'll be doing a session every week we're figuring out the times and the days correct Alex yeah I think right now we're planning we're doing this on Wednesday obviously yeah I think in the future we're planning on doing our stream on Tuesdays but again all this is kind of up in the air we'll be relying on feedback from you all to try to help us figure out best way to do this yeah so we are planning on walking through a skill path from the very beginning all the way to the very end and learning a lot along the way yeah and if you folks are new to code Academy basically a skill path is a combination of different content different courses that we have on this site and it's meant to get you to learn a specific skill hence the name scope at us and as the name of the scope acts we're going to be learning data visualization with the Python programming language you can learn data visualization with a couple of different languages but we're doing the Python one specifically this time cool all right let's go ahead and jump right into it I'm gonna share my screen and so today's lesson is going to probably be a little bit different than a traditional lesson where we're gonna be walking through the first lesson in data visualization which is really kind of why are we doing any of this so I think this lesson is gonna be slightly less coding focused we're really we're not gonna go through a ton of syntax will go into this lesson and play around with it a little bit but I think this particular one is going to be a bit more discussion based about what is data visualization why do we care about it what are some cool examples in the past really kind of setting up what we're doing here and why we're doing it and then the following weeks we'll get into the Python syntax Python functions you know all of all of these things that we eventually teach you in this path but this one we're just kind of setting up so again this is the visualized data with Python path it is it is one of our one of our many paths I suppose I won't show you how to navigate there if you want to code along with us we think that that would be you know a fun thing for you to be able to do again we don't really know how manageable that is with if you have a YouTube window and you've the chat open and you have Koch Athenee right so give us feedback on whether or not you're able to code along with us and if that's something that you're actively doing or if it's more fun for you to just kind of watch me and so we go through this are gonna be recorded so if you find that you're not able to pay attention to the live stream and coding at the same time don't worry you still have it to look at later yes I see in the chat first of all people are from all over the place which is super super cool somebody in the UK probably so knowing I are both coming from New York City so really cool to see at hugely international audience and yeah I see one comment about that we're using zoom we will actually touch on that in the in the future where we are using zoom to stream stuff but we are also going to be hosting some some zoom boom webinars that are not streamed so we won't kind of touch on that towards the end of end of this session okay let me show you how to get here so so here's coke at me if you just go to the catalog you will see we have some career paths which we are not doing and then we are gonna be working with where is it analyze data with Python alright so sorry analyzed it we're doing yeah visualized data with Python alright and let's jump into this first lesson cool Zoe do you want to talk about what this overall path tries to teach we can look at the look at this first lesson and kind of these two capstone option options what's the what's the purpose of visualize to add it with pythons yeah so again much as the name suggests the goal of this path is to teach you how to create data visualizations using the Python programming language fun fact this was a former intensive person code Kadim e users and it was actually the first one that I led so yeah so this skill path is near and dear to my heart and what you can see here this first exercise is actually some of the stuff that you can build once you complete this skill pack so you have two options for completing a capstone you can do both of them if you want but one of them you are analyzing the data of a Netflix stock profile and visualizing that and then the other one is looking GDP and life expectancy data so we tried to think of the different applications that folks may have if they're interested in data visualization maybe you're coming from a feminine side maybe you're coming from more of a of an academic side and we also just have kind of like fun general projects for anyone to go through that I think you know pretty much anyone would find enjoyable yeah I see in the chat we have a soccer girl took that intensive Zoey so we got some math and with us for many many years at this point which is really cool all right cool so that's a that's visualized a with Python I think something that you might notice is you might see you know there's a larger data science path and there are other courses that give some of these topics this is one that really focuses only on data visualization but you can definitely take the skills that you learned here and apply it to machine learning and to data science in general so in fact some of the examples I'm gonna show you later on in this session are from different paths entirely but you use some of the skills that we wanted here soft girl Lisa your name is Lisa cool all right so let's take a look at this first lesson so visualize data in Python what is the format of data that we typically use at least on our code Khadem esight to visualize here we're bringing in data using a CSV file that stands for comma separated values so as you can see let's just open the file that we're actually using as our data in this exercise it's not pretty but you can tell it is true to its name it's using commas to separate the different data values right so at the top you get would essentially be the column name so if you were to pull in a CSV Excel or Google sheets you'd get your standard spreadsheet and you can even take any spreadsheet you have an export it as a CSV and this looks something like this so again column titles at the top and then below that you start to see the raw data than numbers so the first one you can see is a date 2017 April 4th and then we are getting some other number values this looks like its stock price data from that Netflix capstone project I don't know a lot about stocks yes I think one thing to note is that this is kind of a question that we get a lot is like why bother learning data visualization in Python right like I could open up this CSV file in Excel and I could make my graphs funny in Excel or I could work through my data in Excel so like Zoe from your perspective and whether it's Python or another language like what's what's the value of doing this in a programming language rather than it's cool like Google sheets or Excel with something like that totally it's the ability to customize whatever we want to do right we don't have to rely on the tools like Microsoft Office or Google is providing us sure maybe you can get some nice visualizations out of it you're still gonna have to do a lot of tweaking in a process like this you're controlling it from the very beginning and to the end so you can you know figure out how much of the data that you want to use you can easily clean up the data using Python and it's data analysis libraries like pandas you can try out different visualization libraries so in this scale in the past we have me show you map cut live but we also show you a more advanced visualization library notice Seabourn and again it just gives you way more possibilities I see that Lisa girl saying Excel is limited yeah a lot of these software's you know they just give you the very barebones for you to work with if you are really interested in digging into data analysis and producing your own reports producing your own presentations knowing a programming language like Python and how to use it for data visualization is really gonna help yeah I think one of the things we're gonna talk about later in this session is also using data visualization for like an artistic pursuit so hmm not necessarily for your job or to create a report but just to express something that you're interested in or that you find value in and I think being able to use these tools that are like more flexible and you can do kind of weird or less traditional things with it's really helpful for that sort of stuff absolutely you know it is all around us and you know we don't have to think about data as being limited to a business application I think it's really interesting when you start to examine your own life how can i express these patterns in an interesting way can you state a visualization to do that totally cool okay so let's do this first instruction which is basically to copy this block of code and put it down at the bottom of script py and so if you've never seen data visualization before this is a lot of code that we're asking you to copy with personally I'm not a huge fan of because it's like I really like my my students to know what they're copying copying but it's fun to see we're working towards this sort of thing so I'm gonna copy that code in and that you'll see that it creates this line graph of two separate lines opening price and closing price our axes are labeled pretty well where we're able to see what the xaxis is and what the yaxis is I thought we could dig a little bit into this code yeah you can first talk about what libraries we're using so you'll see at the very top of this script reporting to libraries the first one is confusing unfortunate is this like a bit of context right so when you're working on codecademy you're working in a pretty special environment it's not the same as the environment that you'd run on your computer and so in order for us to emulate what it would be like to run an environment on your computer and being able to import certain libraries we have to import one of our own special libraries which we called code cat ameloid but if anywhere to for example want to try this out on your own text editor on your computer you want to have to import that yeah in a way in a later session and perhaps in one of these zoom webinars which we've been teasing we can we can discuss how they'll like set up your own personal computer to run run things on your own computer so you're not reliant on Codecademy we also how much of resources on code can out of me that show you how to do that I think it's always really helpful to see someone go through that process because kind of a pain in the butt absolutely and I mean we have this look great about the skill path is that we have projects throughout the entire path that you're meant to do on your own computer so as I look so saying sometimes it can be really painful to install a lot of the software and get started so yeah I think it's a great idea something like that cool so that's cocaptain a lip it's the thing that lets us show your graph right here when you hit the Run button the other more important one is that we are using matplotlib and specifically we are using pipe lot from matplotlib and so this is really the library that this path is going to dive into we're gonna learn a bunch of different matplotlib functions and features and settings that you can set in there so this is kind of the bread and butter of its course later in the path we're going to be getting into yes yeah more complexity get like really interesting graphs highly recommend checking out the documentation you get those crazy violin plots yeah these plots were came from Seaborg yeah they kind of look like birds [Laughter] yeah I think maybe the one last thing to say about the import is that you can see your scroll up at the top again we're importing the pie plot but we're also renaming it to PLT so that just helps us to shorten our code makes it more efficient yeah if you cut if you come down here and look at this code a little bit you'll see we have PLT dot plot basically here we're saying okay we're calling this plot function but what library is it coming from it's coming from PLT which really is PI plot but we've just shorted it so we don't have to write PI plot again and again again and again if I get rid of this I can then cut them down here and we can do PI plot dot plot okay I'm looking at the chat Thank You Kenny for answering questions please continue to ask questions in there Kenny is obviously doing a great job of answering them but we'll try to take a look every now and then of questions for you to answer we really want this to be kind of as interactive as possible again this lesson is a little bit weird because it's more discussion based and not a super coding based but if you have questions about the code in particular we're happy to dive into that otherwise we will just keep going I think this is a great time to you know ground ourselves in the concepts of data visualization to write so like right now we're looking a lot at the code and what it outputs but in the narrative we're also thinking about what is the data visualization process overall and that's something that's going to be important to think about as you get into more of the coding like it so why suggest visualization but specifically like you know how do we go about that at a higher level we start with formatting the data we then move into visualizing that data and you can style the visualization too so I really I do love these Y data visually or I guess I should say like Y X we have at the beginning of a lot of our skill packs because I think they do a great job of contextualizing why you would want to learn this technology and what you should expect to see over the rest of the course even if you have to copy and paste some code and kind of don't know what's happening yeah for sure yeah it's it's kind of a motivating uh this is what's coming up the rest of the lesson kind of talks about what you were to speaking to Zoey where we have a couple of different key parts of data visualization that we're gonna go over in a super high level the first is this idea of formatting so data can come in a bunch of different formats the the ones that we talked about in this narratives are Python set Python has lists which is actually I think the next unit that we cover in this skill path is that we really dive into lists and show you how to work with them that's it's kind of one of the most basic elements of programming in Python and so we'll also want to start working with like a little bit more complex data structures so like we talked about before we have CSV files which are comma separated values these are what you will find if you export from an Excel document or even you can open up a CSV file in Excel and then finally we have panda that pandas dataframes so what that does come up you know I I don't know I feel like I'm often on the wrong side of these debates I'm gonna I'm a Jif guy not a not a gift not again person yeah in the chat tell us if you're I already forget what which one we are so it team Alex is data and Tina it's the other way around it was data it's I mean it's data on Star Trek it is data on Star Trek that's obviously but to go back to your actual original question data frames so pandas is another data analysis library that we're gonna be using and of course the skill path much like the matplotlib one that we saw in the last exercise pandas is a really awesome library you do a lot of stuff with it but what we often use it for is taking in raw data either you know like from a CSV and starting to structure it in a way that enables us to work with it further so that structure is called a data frame and alex is highlighting the specific command that you use to read in a CSV file and then print it as a data frame so let's take a look at what that what that looks like yeah so again we have a CSV kind of behind the scenes here and you'll see that the headers are we're talking about countries and then different years this is global population so you'll see we have this big mess of comma separated values it'll be pretty hard to like you could imagine trying to put like make this a Python list like I could copy all of this over and then like put it like genuinely done try to do some formatting in some of these files right so so that's really the power of pandas other I mean one of the one of the strengths of pandas is that we immediately just get to read in this CSV file and it's in this format now that we can start to work with and so I can probably do stuff like actually it has been in a while [Laughter] mom's writing uh writing our content so I'm more familiar with our at this point but I will try to write a line of pandas code here real quick cool Kenny said Astroworld had a good question oh yeah hi thanks for the live stream YC born over plotly just reference that is a great question so yeah Seabourn was our particular preference partly it's nice because you can do interactive graphs with plotly honestly like if we plot li was like a reach goal for us in this and I hope that someday that we do end up teaching hotly on code Academy cuz it's very popular but Seabourn I think is a nice natural step from matplotlib because it's library and actually I was going to say this plays nicely with canvas you can directly read in a dataframe from pandas and turn that into a visualization cool yeah I know again I was saying I've just been working on our content for a long time and Plumlee was something that I ran into in writing all this our content and so partly is one that again seems to work between different coding languages which is kind of cool yeah so I was about to write some pandas pandas code but I realized we actually aren't showing the the terminal output here we're only showing this this web browser output so even if I didn't do like print length of data frame which I don't even know if that's a real function again it's been a little bit since I've done pandas um even if I ran this we wouldn't see that print that print statement because we're not showing the terminal yeah nevermind basically so I mean a little bit about it like I guess peek into the the backside of coke Adam II as you can see in our lessons we have a you know a text editor in the middle and then we have the output on the right hand side so we can modify those components per exercise depending on what we think is what you should use in the exercise so like if you thought you wanted to have a terminal in order to be your output to the term and I guess this is also a fun fact about the code Academy live that we're actually rendering these panels made Hana data frames as it's like an SVG or something there's like it's like an HTML file yeah again interesting and engineering platform wizardry to be able to print out these pandas into our our web component yeah yeah cool all right let's keep moving we're at the halfway point of this session so I want to make sure we get through this lesson fairly quickly and then we can show off some other visualizations we can take more questions Sam I see your question I will we can we can answer questions as towards the end of the session so keep asking questions and we can come back yes all right so in this one we talked about okay so the first step was getting your data in a format that you can use the next step is visualizing your data so you talked a little bit about the difference between a plot live in C born here ask you to draw this graph which [Laughter] month passengers and bar charts and so I know the next section of this this course is talking about how to make your graph intelligible right where right now I don't really know what this is talking about I would guess it is airline staff yeah yeah loading data sets flights but in the next section we'll talk about how it's important to kind of label your graph appropriately so people know what the heck you're talking about this is this is Seaborn so any any supporting elements thinking about there's some articles that show you that you can choose we're going to talk about styling later you can actually change what kind of grid you're using we're also loading the data set with Seaborn and then we are executing a bar plot and if you're familiar with bar plots we're plotting things on the xaxis the month it is and then the yaxis is the passengers how many passengers are in it and then we're saving the data that we're passing into that bar plot is again the flights data that we had before exactly we're doing a little bit of stuff where we're rotating the xaxis or the things on the xaxis let's see what happens if we just get rid of that yeah and that's something that I think zoeng I would both encourage people to do in these intro lessons where you don't really know what this code is is doing do little things like that right if I just remove this line of code you get a better sense of like okay that's somehow affecting these X ticks you could even look up so X tic is coming from clot so let's do this let's do matplotlib pie plot X 10 let's see if we can find the documentation here on the fly right so I can just google that look at the documentation and see examples of different different ways that we can use X to X yeah I'll see if that works oh yeah Alex's points it's really great especially since you are just copying and pasting right now to like spend some time with the code that's that you're that you're pasting in to see if you can understand it a bit more before you even start to really learn it in full yeah I like one of the things that I think that's something that I think that I wish we did a little bit better on Kirk Adam E is like encouraging people to explore and it's hard to do that when it's just through through text because we can write up a you know we can write a paragraph that says exactly what we're saying of like explore on your own but yeah it's so fun to like just go through coke Adam II and like get the green checkmark in that way yeah so it's so to really take advantage of coke at me I'd like that really that's like the best thing that you can do is really kind of experiment and play with the code even after you've got the checkmarks absolutely cool let's move on to the next section yes so let's see what are we doing here we are setting the X tix so this is our stock exchange data you're setting the x tix rather than zero 50 100 150 200 and 250 we are overriding those with this list of months month names specifically using this tables function so again that's a that's a function that you might want to go and look up the documentation for and say okay it seems like this is taking a list of names could it take anything else are there other options that I could do with that all that sort of stuff would be a good idea to do let me actually didn't get the green checkmark but that's because of some weird backend stuff there we go yes similarly we can have the title mmhmm I think one thing that we kind of try to highlight here in this lesson is that we say make sure to put all of this code that we're pasting in before plot dot show we do plus if we do an after plot dot show it didn't do anything in personally it passed our test but you'll notice that uh the the title get an update it's a really plot dot show is the thing that says like okay you've set everything about your graphs let's show it now so everything has to come before plot show exactly important thing to remember if you're ever debugging saying hey I changed this thing yep and then finally we do legend labels so this is setting an opening price and a closing price legend for the different colored lines so y legend labels to turn plot yeah I think I mean the obvious answer is to have people understand what your rafters is talking about where there were no there are no labels whatsoever on this crap graph it would be a pretty graph but I would have no idea if this was talking about you know Netflix lock prices or if it was talking about the weather right like it could be it could be literally anything and so just communicating your findings he's kind of the point of data visualization and so I know personally I'm pretty bad at this where we can graph him and I like forget to put in the final five percent to make it yeah I was looking through all the lessons that I've done I found stuff where it's like I do not like put the title on there so like I'm I'm bad I'm bad at it but or I forget sometimes don't aren't as a rigorous as I should be but for like truly professional graphs or graphs that you're really showing people and publishing you want it to be as detailed as possible absolutely a part of it is framing it right like usually you're doing data visualization to sir a set of questions so how did Netflix stocks perform in 2017 right like we are using this visualization to show that performance which is why again it's helpful to have month names there because we're thinking about this in the context of time rather than just using you know whatever I had before I think super easy okay but what are you automatically you know think that's what it was not necessarily it's you know it's taking a lot of this stuff and we can get more cubed readable right here's I think for your audience to slightly critique the graph I think like price we could show units well first of all I know nothing about stock so I don't even know if prices or if this is in if this is in dollars or you know whatever but like I think the yaxis could be slightly more detailed but maybe that's because I am not pretty not exactly the audience for this you know I mean how do you style your plot specifically for your audience you may not need to provide as much detailed information if people already have an understanding of what the context is but if you're writing an article rate like you see a lot of data journalism these days you're usually going to have just like it you know everyday person a professional reading that content so you're gonna want to be as detailed as you can possibly be whereas if you are a I don't know microbiologist and you are presenting a paper at a conference that's on you know some very specific topic I don't nothing about microbiology right shows that as my sample but you probably wouldn't have to like spell everything out for a person performing pretty well right now but that's a pretty good segue so let's fly to the end of this course and I can show you some some other visualizations we have on the platform dad a responsibility yes important topic and really I really love this exercise and I'm really glad to tell you we're at this lesson put in here so I think it's super important yeah do you want to give a highlevel overview of what what this one is talking about yeah absolutely so what is covering is kind of saying like it's really easy for us to take in some data and just make a visualization and say like okay great I'm trying to you know ask this question and I've got a set of data and it clearly proves what I would like I wanted to prove or sometimes we look at data like we could say you know like the number of users on coke atom each site and you just let it you know say like what we think the answer is I don't know like we see like a ton of users around like noon oh okay noon Eastern Time everyone's having lunch what is that like really it was happening I think part of it is is taking some as it sounds like some responsibility for your interpretation and thinking about where you come from as an interpreter right like what are some biases that you may hold how is that impacting even your data collection process and what you're bringing in so they have this example may exercise about when they were designing airbags and the prototype that used was just a male mannequin and so the data they collected was actually biased in terms of how it performed and that ended up actually having real ramifications in the production process all the saying that you know ethics I think is super important to talk about generally what we're talking about programming and especially when we get into talking about data how we're collecting data the processes for collecting data the actual content of the data that's there and then how we choose to show data data visualizations notorious for being able to lie to people because you can change things like you know like the why there's like a whole thing about yaxes and like shortening them to make it look like there's actually a greater difference between like two line graphs that there actually is or in this case so plotting to totally different data sets but saying like oh look there's a relationship between this data just because it has a similar shape to it do you really think that there's a relationship between the letters and the winning spelling bee word and we have a good one in chat from Robert saying these rise in sea level and the decline of population in Pirates correlation correlation and causation it would like try and find these like super random different data sets and then show how they they mirror each other right right we should try to find that one but yeah there's lots of articles out there that talk about how you can you know critically look at a data visualization to understand is it actually interpreting the data correctly and presenting the relationships correctly actually there is a great one from The Economist that talked about their process for critiquing their data visualizations and improving that I'm saying like looking at like how clear is this data is the relationship really what we're attempting to show various things like that so it's cool to see you know we do this for a living start to think more deeply about how their work is impactful yeah I mean knowing I could talk about this for hours the cool thing with like basically everything that you can learn in programming is that there's like the syntax of how do I do this thing and then there's the kind of meta discussion around it of okay how do we use these what are the ethics of using these tools that we've done what are the different ways that we can use in the different stakeholders that that are interested in this technology so I mean hopefully that that's one of the benefits of these streams is that you'll not only be able to get like the syntax as we get into doing some real programming but you'll also be able to engage in conversations like this where we talk about you know the impact of these tools that we're teaching absolutely cool we have two final little looking ahead wrapping up we talked about formatting visualization and styling okay so that is the first well in the visualize data with pythonpath so plug it for next week is the next Tuesday it we have two more curriculum developers going through the next course so the next course is going to be let's see I believe it is Python syntax yes so what we did here is the content and we sherry picked a couple of programming concepts that we thought would be super helpful for folks to know if they hadn't done Python before and they were starting to engage with this material so what I really like about a lot of our school paths is that you don't come in with any prior information you really start you at zero so you can skip this stuff if you've already done Python before but if I can't speak for you all good we'll be learning it before we get into the data visualization stuff so that's the plan for next week I believe the people signed up for that are we Ian freed who has written a lot of our data science content and then another alex curriculum developer not me we'll also be doing next Tuesday stream I think this would be a good time to talk about the other set of streams we have planned yeah so in addition to these these streams that are free we're stringing them on YouTube and twitch and everywhere every week we're also going to do a bonus stream or it's not a stream we're gonna do a bonus webinar or bonus session for pro members this week's bonus session is actually going to be open to everyone just to give people a taste of what we might be doing in that session but the idea behind and so that session is gonna be on Friday it's gonna be me Zoe and then a third curriculum developer Carolyn the idea behind these book sessions is rather than doing something consistent like these free streams where the free stream is always going to be going through the next the next step of the path whatever path we're doing these bonus sessions are going to be an opportunity for you to basically have more personal conversations with with us we're gonna do it on a zoom webinar and people can call in if you want to call in and ask us a question and like have a conversation with us that's something that we'll be doing Zoe and I are gonna give out a little bit of an assignment that if you want you can come to be the procession having done this thing and you can show us what you've done and talk about it a little bit it's kind of more Q&A we're in this free session we've really kind of been focused on getting through the lesson and going through the lesson and you know we've been trying to answer questions in chat as we go but we'll have we'll have tons of time for to do that in the bonus session so very briefly I want to show the flow of registering for that bonus session again all of this stuff is this is kind of a beta week for us all this session were is the first time that we're doing it so bear with us as there are kinks in the process and also we would love your feedback for how we can do stuff differently um but if you go to the main page of coke Adam II we now have this events page so you can click on register and you'll see that we have three events one is the one that you are currently watching if you're watching this live which is in this visualize data with Python we have the next free stream which is the second course individualize dating with Python battle that would be the thing that Ian and Alex do next Tuesday so that's this one again that will just be streamed on YouTube and twitch and everywhere so you could either come in here and register for it or you can just find it on our on our YouTube page or our twitch page but then this middle stream is the one that's right now we're calling Q Pro na so normally will restrict these two Pro members but for this one we are letting anyone register for it so you can come in here and register for it click on this link and register for the bazoom webinar basically you'll get an email and then on Friday at 3 p.m. we'll go live we will go live with that webinar so that's the idea basically we want to add we want to do a session where we go through a course and then every week also offer a session where we actually get to like chat with you and get to build a little bit of the community and take any of your like deeper questions that we weren't able to get to in the free session mmhmm anything no just a game University lecture class and you have those lab sessions with a TA where you really get to engage with your fellow classmates you get to ask questions that maybe you didn't have a chance to ask during the lecture session I think that's how we're thinking of these processions it's really an opportunity for you to you know come to the free session you get exposed to the material maybe spend the next couple of days going through it on your own you start to have questions and Fridays your opportunity to ask those questions to a real live person which isn't something that we've always you know had the opportunity to do with code cabbies are really excited to make that an option yeah the big dream for this it is eventually if these turn out to be popular you can start doing this with different series so right now I'm only going through visualize data with Python but these turn out to be super popular and people want hey let's do a web dev series where we'll have a web dev course and a web dev procession during the week that's kind of like the idea of like we would love to see this events calendar really kind of like build out into almost like you know coke Adam II like here's the week of events at coke Adam II I have a bunch of different learning suddenly enjoyable when you have other folks doing with you and us as teachers we've like just talking with you guys to reading reports and it would be fun to connect to you all with each other right if if someone hops on a call Linley in the process and asks a question related to a project you were working on maybe you can link up with Velma and start working on together or you can help each other out and maybe you know Alex and I talked about little assignments that you can do you know be introduced during the first event and when you come to the Q&A session you show off the word that you did to us and to the other learners cool yeah so Joey and I came up with this little assignment so if you would like to join that the pro Q&A that's gonna be on Friday at 3 p.m. again you can follow that link in the advanced page to read sir for the zoom the zoom call we've linked this form I'll put it in the chat right now but it's also in the YouTube description we've linked this form if you're going to come to the procession which I think would be super fun we would love you fill out this form so we're asking you for your name which is optional we're asking for your name so we give you credit if you ask a question we can say hey you know this person asked this question any general questions about data visualization this is the assignment that we we thought of yeah we wanted you to create a visualization of data of any kind doesn't have to be programming find a way to share it with us could be a pic you know you could make something physical in your house or apartment and take a picture and tweeted at us you could I have an idea already shared with Zoe which i think is a weird one yes let me I'll give you this screen share in one second let me finish going over this form so this is yes so this question is I create a data visualization of any kind if you share it with us we'll talk about it on the probe pro stream or show it off if you're if you're in the pro stream you can come on and talk with us about it if you'd like if you have any links or resources that you would like to share with us we'd love to see them and we again that's something that we could share on the stream and then any feedback about all of this stuff in general what you think about the free live streams of going through a course what you think about the pro live streams of getting a chance to like talk to people and it being a little bit more communal so just any feedback we'd love to have again people watching this you are like the first you are the what well done you're like the first people check this stuff out and so no we would really really value your feedback attack let's see cool Zoey I'm gonna stop my screen share if you want to screen share to show some cool visualizations I will also try to look through chat to answer some questions and we'll do all right we see this cool so as Alex and I were working on putting together today's session we talked about our experience with data visualization and also some data visualizations and I just wanted to share some examples of folks that whose work I've come across in the past couple years so one person is Jared Thor people been on the livestream with me before it's a lot about how I went to graduate school and my view this program called I Tiki Jared Eric was a tshirt and my Tiki Amy taught a class called data art and so I think he has some really great examples of projects that exist at the intersection of data but are also using a lot of different mediums so again well we're going to be talking about data visualization in programming dude visualization has a long history that existed before we are actually working with computers so I think like one great really example it's W two data visualizations these are incredibly beautiful and talk about life of black Americans at the turn of the 20th century we'll post links to this stuff so you can you can look through it on your own time stuff that's more current again not using programming but Mona Shalaby is a infographics artist and she just he's just like if I needs to be like incredibly hilarious and super relatable data visualization so while she's using the languages of you know our chart she's finding ways to breathe new life into that kind of idea so this is literally just googled Mona jalabiya infographics and you can kind of get a sense of this her Instagram is really fantastic I was the nose job one there in the top left or there's no this is flu viruses see the other one another person who has a really simple way of doing data but visualizations is an Friedman she has a great weekly newsletter email newsletter that she sends out and she posts one of these pie charts at the end of each of it so what are we doing on this airplane and you can click in here and see how she's she's flirting at crying and a Pixar movie okay it dried open third bag of pretzels so again if you're thinking about completing this assignment you know what I happen so you need to go through and like have to program anything it could be as basic as this another really cool one that I came across was this artist married Lucian Berger who did a project data visualization now I'm trying to find using photographs and everyday objects I chose feature and so I'm not going to pretend I know that these visualizations are about but I think just scrolling through them you get a really interesting sense of how you can again visualize data in ways beyond the traditional scatter God's choir charts graphs things like this like what again is in your environment both that you could think of as data but that you could use in your data visualization get super creative I love this sandwich what warranty food do you have use to make any visualization data for example last resource that I'm going to share is a website called pudding so they are as they say digital publication that does these visual essays but a lot of them are really just amazing interactive data visualizations so the worst highest game NBA player ever like what I love it because they they find these really interesting stories that are super me then you're a really great job of presenting that information that's awesome yeah so all of this stuff is our kind of example is of like what we're looking looking for if you want to share with us and come to this procession make something like that and try to find a way to share with us yeah I so we are basically out of time more ways to get involved with this sort of stuff if you enjoyed it subscribe to us on YouTube that will that will actually help I think that that's a great way to just like see the Wendy's live videos come up we're also on Twitch if you follow us on twitch that will also help us out if you want to get in touch with me and Zoey you can get in touch with us on Twitter that even would be a fun place for you to send your send your visualization if you end up making one I think I am at Alex B Koontz and I'll type in the YouTube channel right now and then so we are you can find me on Twitter highly recommend that you sign up for a free account with a free account you get a free week of trial and then that enables you to get access to quizzes projects actually this entire is still packed right Pisco pack is a special content item for our pro learners yeah so um yeah I think that's it so again the events coming up we got one on Friday at 300 with me Zoe and Carolyn where it will be a little bit more discussion based so any questions that you had or if you just want to talk to us after watching this session then next Tuesday we have another livestream with Ian and other Alex going through the next course in this path so hopefully they'll get through that course and maybe do the quiz in the project well follow along there and the live stream these are recorded this is not a convenient time for you no worries you'll be able to watch the recording later obviously we love it when people are watching live with us asking questions that we can answer on air too although brief clarification be like bonus session the pro the pro session that's going to be only on it's gonna be a basically a private Zoo and webinar so we won't be stringing that live because that's for pro members sources right exactly yeah so so just a little a little special something for our Kroners or coke addict pro learners which is great and like I'm excited to talk to you more about data visualization as art really innovative ways doing data visualizations talking more around the ethics of data visualization particularly no right now with this hope in 19 days of collection that's going on and how is that even collection helpful to communities basically it's hard to get means that we only wanted to do an hourlong session today but then that wanted to keep talking though we hope that you will join us that yeah alright I think that's it it's it's 201 thank you again to everyone who joined us for this very first sessions really appreciate you taking the time to be with us today bless you for making of our first first time we've tried this [Laughter] you know what really needs is having you all here with us and folks take your questions hi I think it's gonna be a really great series Alex you know yeah this is some money yeah Kenny and then the folks behind the scenes that helped us Lisa all those folks too so stay tuned for more content okay Kenny lives all right see y'all later
