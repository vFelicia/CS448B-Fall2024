00:04 - but what exactly do they mean let's
00:07 - think of it this way
00:09 - imagine you go into a computer store
00:11 - they probably have decorated the store
00:12 - nicely to make you feel comfortable and
00:14 - put a few computers out front for you to
00:16 - see
00:17 - however when you actually request to buy
00:19 - a computer
00:20 - they will go to the back and retrieve a
00:22 - new computer for you to take home
00:25 - similarly in web apps the front end is
00:28 - the part of the app the user will see
00:30 - it is nicely designed and easy to
00:32 - interact with
00:33 - the back end is where all of the data is
00:35 - stored and requests are processed like a
00:37 - warehouse or a storeroom
00:39 - the user can make requests from the
00:41 - front end to do things in the back end
00:43 - like place an order for a computer
00:45 - however they can't go
00:47 - in there themselves let's say we're
00:50 - building a website for a restaurant
00:52 - this site contains the restaurant's
00:54 - hours of operations its menu
00:56 - and directions to the restaurant when a
00:58 - user visits this site
01:00 - the html and css files for the site will
01:02 - be retrieved from the back end
01:04 - and displayed in the user's browser what
01:06 - the user can now see
01:08 - the rendered version of these html and
01:10 - css files
01:11 - is the front end of the site
