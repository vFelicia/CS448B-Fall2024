00:00 - hi my name is Stephanie I'm a software
00:02 - developer based in Baltimore and today
00:04 - we're gonna go over wireframes
00:06 - wireframes are just a way for designers
00:08 - to communicate to developers how they
00:11 - intend the product like a website or
00:13 - mobile application to be laid out so
00:16 - these are some key takeaways about
00:17 - wireframes that we'll go over in this
00:19 - video
00:20 - a very common analogy is to compare
00:22 - wireframes to blueprints so here on the
00:25 - Left we have a blueprint of a house that
00:28 - describes how the first floor should be
00:29 - laid out and similarly on the right we
00:33 - have a sample of a wireframe for a
00:35 - website that shows how the designer
00:36 - wants the website to be laid out there's
00:39 - a phone number logo and menu at the top
00:42 - followed by a picture underneath and
00:45 - then the layout of the content after
00:46 - that a common misconception is that you
00:49 - have a lot of aesthetic details in a
00:51 - wireframe but one key part about them is
00:53 - that they emphasize usability this means
00:56 - you won't really see things like color
00:58 - specific fonts or any of the bells and
01:01 - whistles that you see in this picture
01:02 - here this is so that you can focus on
01:05 - the structure of the design similarly
01:07 - blueprints also don't specify
01:09 - implementation details like the type of
01:11 - material the counters will be made of or
01:13 - the color the walls will be painted with
01:16 - wireframes what you see is an organized
01:18 - visual of what a features gonna look
01:20 - like relative to the page so here are
01:23 - some wine frames for a social media app
01:24 - and in the wireframe on the far right
01:27 - you just need to scroll down to view
01:28 - more content wireframes can afford to
01:32 - focus on usability because they're
01:34 - created before mock-ups in the design
01:36 - process so after they're created and
01:38 - approved the designers will go back and
01:40 - fill them in to create more mature
01:42 - mock-up designs or more specific design
01:45 - sketches of what the application should
01:46 - look like once wireframes are created
01:49 - then there are discussions between the
01:51 - designers and the team to make sure that
01:53 - the wireframes address the business
01:55 - needs and that the proposals are
01:56 - feasible from there the designers will
01:59 - create more formal mock-ups to pass off
02:01 - to the developers to build meanwhile
02:04 - developers can use those wireframes to
02:06 - break the design down into pieces and
02:08 - translate those pieces into a
02:10 - development plan for their sprint for
02:12 - example
02:13 - say the designer came to me with these
02:15 - wireframes for a feature that allows the
02:16 - user to book flights I would most likely
02:19 - break them into three different views
02:21 - one to list flights one to find flights
02:24 - and want to fill in passenger
02:25 - information but I can break them down
02:27 - even further into developer components
02:30 - so starting with pieces that are common
02:32 - across all the views there's a logo
02:35 - there's some kind of header and a
02:37 - continue button since they're the same
02:39 - in all three they can each be
02:41 - generalized and reused across each of
02:43 - the views now in the leftmost view there
02:46 - is also a list of the bookings where
02:48 - each of the cards are the same so that
02:50 - could be another component and the
02:51 - middle view and the view on the right
02:53 - I would probably simplify the whole form
02:55 - as a developer component so now we end
02:58 - up with something like these components
03:00 - and can break them up into tasks to
03:02 - complete or determine what order to
03:04 - complete them each team may do it a bit
03:06 - differently and your existing code base
03:08 - and perspective could change how you
03:10 - would tackle these wireframes don't
03:13 - worry about the wireframes lacking in
03:15 - detail the main focus should be on the
03:17 - logical components of the design
03:19 - it's a developers can use the wireframes
03:21 - to break the design down into a
03:23 - development plan I hope you enjoy this
