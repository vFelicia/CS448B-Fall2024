03:10 - focus today is on three things how to
03:12 - search for a job how to interview for a
03:14 - job and how to start a new job and
03:17 - they're all things that we've we've put
03:18 - a lot of thought into we thought felt
03:20 - pretty deeply about all of them both
03:22 - before coronavirus hit and then now
03:24 - afterward and in this whole new remote
03:26 - situation is just it's it's a new world
03:30 - and it's it's kind of incredible that
03:32 - we've only been in this new world for a
03:34 - month and a half or a month or so now
03:38 - because it feels like we've been doing
03:41 - this for a while it feels like we've
03:42 - we've been doing this a number of times
03:44 - we've hired a number of people through
03:46 - it we've interviewed I don't know well
03:48 - over a hundred I don't know hundreds of
03:50 - people through this right now
03:53 - my background so I went to school for
03:56 - education and it was always adult
03:59 - education for me I care deeply about
04:01 - education in all different forms who was
04:04 - always adults that I cared about
04:06 - and so I I first started working as a
04:09 - coordinator literally setting up chairs
04:13 - for classes and taking registration and
04:17 - making sure everyone had a notebook
04:18 - those sorts of things and just every job
04:22 - I was at just try to make sure that I
04:24 - was learning everything I possibly could
04:26 - at that job and you know growing and
04:29 - growing in terms of skill set and
04:31 - knowledge and experiences and I've been
04:33 - at this now especially in the startup
04:35 - world for over ten years I've been at it
04:38 - all together for 15 years in the startup
04:40 - world for 10 I was with what was a
04:42 - start-up at the time JetBlue and got to
04:45 - be with them through some really rough
04:47 - spots in the beginning and just trying
04:49 - to figure out how do we turn this into a
04:50 - real company I was with a Montessori
04:52 - education company for a while try figure
04:54 - out how to make that a real company and
04:56 - I've been with codecademy now for I I
05:00 - guess about half a year I was at first a
05:04 - customer I wanted to learn about I want
05:07 - to learn JavaScript because I wanted to
05:09 - build a slack app and I just kind of
05:13 - fell in love with the product and said
05:14 - this is everything that I had hoped I
05:19 - would be possible in the world I mean
05:21 - the idea of educating not just the
05:23 - person in front of you but millions and
05:26 - we have millions of people who use our
05:28 - product hundred thousand we just hit
05:31 - that milestone recently who are part of
05:33 - our subscription Pro product which by
05:36 - the way we are giving giving out a
05:39 - number of those for free right now for
05:42 - people who have our kind of worst
05:46 - financial situation right now so you can
05:48 - get scaled up in in what I think are the
05:52 - most important skills for has been the
05:55 - most important skills in the economy
05:57 - that I think will continue to be our
05:58 - mission at code Academy is to help
06:01 - people build something meaningful
06:05 - I cared about that before coronavirus
06:08 - hit I care twice as much about that now
06:11 - because the world on pause right now and
06:15 - there is so much to build and all of us
06:19 - need to be builders and we all need to
06:21 - be making things and in trying to
06:22 - rebuild this world that we've put on
06:25 - pause and I'm openly stealing from a
06:30 - blog post by Marc Andreessen who's a
06:32 - famed enter capitalist if you get a
06:34 - chance read that he says things better
06:36 - than I ever could but we need to be
06:38 - building and our Java code Academy is to
06:41 - help teach the builders and that is a
06:43 - wonderful thing to get to be a part of
06:45 - and we our reach is incredible but
06:48 - there's literally only a hundred people
06:51 - as if they there are a hundred people
06:52 - working at code Academy that's it to
06:55 - have that kind of reach and the way you
06:57 - do that is by having the right people
06:59 - and being very very thoughtful about
07:02 - making sure you have the right people
07:04 - interviewing this whole job search thing
07:06 - it's very stressful I know very very
07:08 - stressful for you I've been there I've
07:10 - gone through all that it's also
07:12 - stressful for us because we need to make
07:13 - sure that we're finding all the right
07:15 - people because every every person that's
07:19 - here can help make or break the company
07:21 - and help make or break our mission and
07:23 - our mission is very very important to us
07:25 - so the people you're gonna be hearing
07:30 - from are what I I mean some of the best
07:35 - I have gotten to work with in my career
07:37 - people who have worked at a number of
07:39 - different startups that are very very
07:42 - good at finding the best talent they
07:44 - have a lot to say about how to find a
07:47 - job how to interview for a job and put
07:50 - your best foot forward and then how to
07:52 - start a job how to onboard I it's my
07:55 - belief that a job is made or broken in
07:58 - the first 90 days and you're gonna hear
08:01 - a lot about that as well I think all
08:02 - that's very important in Corona and all
08:05 - this was hard before coronavirus started
08:07 - happening and coronavirus and this whole
08:11 - work-from-home thing makes everything a
08:13 - little bit harder
08:14 - it's all very doable I mean I've Airy
08:17 - much believe that and I
08:19 - been very pleasantly surprised at
08:21 - exactly how doable all this has ended up
08:24 - being and I want to tell you one story
08:28 - and then I'll get out of the way man a
08:30 - man named Andy Stern era it was March
08:34 - 3rd and I know it's hard to go back in
08:39 - time here but March 3rd everyone knew
08:42 - about coronavirus it was starting to
08:43 - happen there were a couple of hot spots
08:45 - around the world there were a couple of
08:47 - cases in California but as far as we
08:49 - were concerned hadn't really hit the US
08:50 - it was in Japan it was in China was in
08:53 - South Korea I think it was in Italy
08:58 - bound to get may realize exactly how bad
08:59 - it was yet and Andy was flying in from
09:04 - Japan to come talk to us to come
09:07 - interview for a role that was the sole
09:10 - reason that he decided to come to us and
09:13 - he was in a hotel we're in Soho New York
09:16 - City in New York City he was in his
09:19 - hotel and office for making huh
09:23 - that's interesting we have somebody who
09:25 - came from a hot spot who's going to be
09:28 - coming into our office to meet with all
09:30 - of us and eat lunch with all of us is
09:35 - this a good idea and we like him he
09:40 - seems really interesting but how do we
09:41 - actually get to know him how do we do
09:43 - things like he was he was interviewing
09:45 - for an engineering role and there are
09:48 - things like having a whiteboard session
09:51 - for a you know you need a whiteboard
09:54 - session to work through your coding
09:55 - interviews how do we do that if he
09:58 - doesn't come in and it was a point where
10:01 - we're still all trying to figure out is
10:02 - this serious as this not serious how
10:05 - worried do we have to be and what we
10:07 - ultimately and it really was just all of
10:09 - us all the people that you're gonna be
10:10 - talking to today sitting around a table
10:12 - trying to think through every single
10:14 - aspect of it and trying to figure out
10:16 - what do we do and ultimately what we did
10:19 - and it was awkward and it was strange
10:21 - but we got a breather space for him that
10:26 - we which is a conference room that we
10:29 - rented out for the day for him to sit
10:32 - and we did everything over zoom and I
10:35 - remember and we put a lot of thought
10:37 - into okay we always try to get a sense
10:39 - of who somebody is so how do we get a
10:42 - sense of how do we target our questions
10:44 - just a little bit more to make sure that
10:45 - we really understand who he is and that
10:47 - whiteboarding well let's just really
10:49 - test that out can you see a white board
10:51 - through the camera should we be using an
10:53 - iPad and the and and work from that can
10:55 - you use a piece of paper we have to
10:57 - think all that through we had to figure
10:59 - all that out to get a sense of somebody
11:01 - and how do we give them a sense of our
11:02 - culture and how do we give them a sense
11:04 - of who worked here and whether or not
11:06 - he's actually going to enjoy being here
11:07 - because that's really important if you
11:09 - don't enjoy being at a company you're
11:11 - not gonna do great work so we want to
11:12 - make sure that you are gonna really like
11:14 - being here we end up doing things like I
11:17 - remember picking up the computer and
11:19 - walking him around the entire office on
11:21 - his zum just to meet every maybe 3040
11:25 - people at the time and then he was
11:29 - completely down for it he thought it was
11:31 - strange but he was into it and he was
11:34 - resilient and he persevered through all
11:35 - of it and we ended up really getting a
11:38 - good sense of him and liking him and we
11:40 - hired it it was the first person we deal
11:43 - with here and he we need to hire him and
11:44 - he started mid-april and then you have
11:46 - to get into the author questions of so
11:47 - and by this point we were all actually
11:50 - working from home but we had to get into
11:51 - the the issues of so how do we give him
11:54 - a great experience I mean we're a very
11:57 - tight-knit group so how do you make sure
11:59 - that he knows everyone really well and
12:01 - he has relationships with everyone
12:02 - because everything's about the
12:03 - relationships you have and how do we
12:05 - make sure that he knows everything that
12:06 - he needs to know to be really successful
12:08 - his job and all that we had to think
12:13 - through as well if you look at the
12:16 - inside of Carrie and Maria's apartments
12:17 - right now they're just filled with swag
12:19 - that we're shipping to all the new
12:21 - people we have and computers trying to
12:23 - figure out all that and and how do you
12:25 - create those relationships one on one so
12:29 - that's gonna give you a bit of a taste
12:31 - that I could keep talking about Andy
12:32 - forever I'm so happy he's here and I'm
12:35 - so happy to go through that process but
12:36 - we can tell you a little about what
12:37 - that's like on our side but also based
12:40 - on that what you should know in order to
12:42 - stand out to people like us to
12:44 - recruiters people are trying to figure
12:45 - out whether or not you make sense
12:47 - whether or not you have the skills and
12:49 - whether not you make sense for that that
12:50 - company I want to leave with one bit of
12:53 - advice because I can know that the
12:56 - people that you were going to be
12:57 - speaking with are going to give you a
12:58 - lot of advice and if you are like a lot
13:03 - of our learners you're probably only
13:05 - sitting there with a pencil and paper or
13:07 - just trying to take notes on absolutely
13:10 - everything and I completely applaud I
13:12 - think that's great
13:13 - the major advice would have for you is
13:17 - instead of trying to vacuum up
13:18 - everything I think them find three
13:21 - things three piece of advice in here
13:23 - that are really really impactful for you
13:26 - that really really matter out of those
13:28 - three just commit to one make sure that
13:31 - you do exactly at least one thing
13:34 - because I want to make sure that this is
13:37 - really productive for you and think
13:38 - about yourself is mining for gold

14:57 - and mia biscaia these two are technical
15:01 - recruiters and before I share too much I

15:18 - Madison
15:19 - I'm iya I'm so excited it's all yours
15:22 - now talk to you later
15:32 - you
15:41 - hello everyone so we are going to be
15:45 - preparing to find a job online right now
15:49 - Madison I think we need your mic on
15:55 - alright hi everybody sorry about that so
15:58 - we'll go ahead and get started um my
16:01 - name is Madison Olson I'm a senior
16:03 - technical recruiter here at code Academy
16:05 - prior to economy I worked in both
16:07 - recruiting and people ops across
16:09 - companies and tech media and advertising
16:12 - spaces so my day today typically
16:16 - consists of essentially trying to get
16:17 - people excited to work at code Khadem ii
16:19 - and i focus on hiring primarily for the
16:22 - data science design engineering
16:24 - marketing and product teams and i am Mia
16:28 - biscaia I'm a technical recruiter here I
16:30 - actually just started right before the
16:33 - stay at home orders came into play so
16:36 - I'm relatively new here at code Academy
16:38 - prior to this I worked as a coordinator
16:40 - and I worked both in house and on the
16:42 - agency side of recruiting I deal with
16:46 - sourcing and building out the top funnel
16:48 - here for most departments from
16:51 - engineering and product to design and
16:53 - marketing so a little bit about what
17:01 - we'll cover during our session we'll go
17:03 - over preparing your profile resume
17:05 - LinkedIn and so forth where and how to
17:07 - look for jobs and preparing for future
17:09 - interview processes and then we'll do a
17:11 - little Q&A at the end so things to
17:14 - consider prior to starting your job
17:16 - search or application process ease
17:19 - things we would recommend doing
17:21 - preparing your resume of course this
17:23 - seems kind of like a given of course but
17:25 - it might seem relatively straightforward
17:26 - but you know keeping these things in
17:27 - mind prior to starting your search or as
17:30 - you start at applying for jobs will
17:32 - definitely be beneficial so although you
17:36 - know most applications and application
17:38 - tracking systems do collect your name
17:40 - and contact info it's still very
17:42 - important to make sure this is very
17:43 - clearly highlighted on your resume
17:45 - obviously you would like to incorporate
17:47 - your work experience so just thinking
17:49 - about what you've done and highlighting
17:50 - experience that shows why you are
17:52 - potentially a great fit for the roles
17:53 - that you're applying
17:54 - or you might want to include your
17:56 - education as well
17:57 - optional sections if you have room you
17:59 - might want to include a section for
18:00 - skills you might want to consider adding
18:02 - a section to talk a little bit more
18:04 - pointedly about you know skills you've
18:06 - developed throughout your experience and
18:08 - highlight why you might be a great fit
18:10 - for this role or how certain skills
18:12 - you've developed would be beneficial and
18:14 - a new opportunity additionally my 1
18:17 - consider adding volunteer experience so
18:18 - if this is something you have room for
18:19 - feel free to throw it on there
18:21 - especially if it highlights and kind of
18:23 - you know the work that you're doing
18:25 - outside of just your job position and
18:27 - then you know feel free to add any
18:29 - awards as well considerations when
18:33 - preparing your resume so just a few
18:36 - considerations to keep in mind as you
18:37 - drum it up
18:38 - length one recommendation that we have
18:40 - is to try to stick to one page for the
18:42 - most part you should not need to expand
18:44 - to two or more pages it's very easy to
18:46 - do because there's so much that you've
18:48 - done you know throughout the course of
18:49 - your existence obviously so we
18:52 - definitely want to keep in mind that you
18:54 - someone who's looking at your resume
18:55 - might not get to the second page or
18:57 - might not scroll all the way down so
19:00 - they might miss something super
19:01 - important that they'll want to know so
19:03 - we definitely recommend sticking to one
19:04 - page when possible also consider the
19:07 - font that you're using you don't want to
19:08 - go too small or use a font that's too
19:10 - difficult to read you know if people are
19:12 - kind of squinting at the screen or
19:14 - squinting at a piece of paper to you
19:16 - know read what's on your resume they
19:18 - might miss a few things design and
19:20 - format also so you know we come across a
19:23 - lot of different resumes and you know
19:25 - unique the resumes can also be great
19:27 - however you know you don't want to you
19:30 - know go to too
19:32 - you don't want your design to be
19:33 - illegible you don't want to expense
19:36 - you know readability for you know a
19:38 - creative or unique looking resume and
19:40 - then finally your education you know
19:43 - something you might want to consider is
19:44 - where to place this on your resume
19:46 - if you are a new grad for instance you
19:49 - might want to consider putting more
19:50 - towards the top of your may before your
19:53 - work experience however if you are a
19:55 - little bit more the senior side or have
19:56 - many years of work experience we would
19:58 - probably recommend putting that further
20:00 - down on your resume and then
20:04 - additionally preparing your LinkedIn so
20:06 - this is a really good kind of
20:07 - supplement to your resume it's something
20:10 - that I know a lot of recruiters or
20:11 - hiring managers might go to you know in
20:13 - addition to looking at your resume a lot

20:43 - should not affect your candidacy so I
20:45 - wouldn't say that this is a must-do it's
20:47 - just something that you know you might
20:49 - want to consider in addition to that you
20:51 - might want to add a quick summary about
20:53 - yourself think about like what do people

21:23 - that you can add on LinkedIn so another
21:24 - great place to add things that you might
21:26 - not have been able to cover on your
21:27 - resume like such as volunteer experience
21:30 - LinkedIn offer also offers you a section
21:33 - around skills and endorsements so
21:35 - definitely don't hesitate to ask like
21:36 - your friends or colleagues to endorse
21:39 - you for skills that are going to be
21:40 - beneficial in your next role and then in
21:43 - addition to that ask previous colleagues
21:44 - for recommendations if you feel
21:45 - comfortable you know I think I look at
21:48 - these personally other people do as well
21:50 - so these are great just kind of
21:51 - supplements to show you know why you
21:53 - might be a great fit for your next role

22:00 - be covering different places that you

22:07 - there are a lot of general jobs pages
22:09 - that you can look at for varying
22:11 - interests industries it's great to go
22:13 - directly to a companies dedicated
22:15 - careers page sometimes companies won't
22:17 - post certain jobs on external boards if
22:19 - there's a
22:20 - funny that you have in mind that you're
22:22 - extremely passionate about go directly
22:24 - to their site LinkedIn is also really
22:27 - helpful as well there are hundreds and
22:29 - thousands of postings on LinkedIn
22:30 - typically companies will keep these
22:32 - postings updated as they tend to get a
22:34 - lot of traffic you can see when they
22:37 - were posted how many people have viewed
22:38 - the postings and how many people have
22:40 - applied so that's really helpful as well
22:42 - in your job search

22:48 - cross post a glass door so anytime that
22:50 - a post is made live on their company
22:52 - page it will also be made live on glass
22:54 - door glass door is helpful in getting a
22:57 - little bit more insight as well into a
22:58 - company and seeing if it's the right fit

23:55 - the more creative job types and github
23:57 - and Stack Overflow are great for
23:59 - engineers and product managers how to
24:07 - look so you should set up a time every
24:09 - day to check for new job postings be it
24:12 - the morning in the afternoon the evening
24:14 - it's best to have a specific time that
24:16 - you can set up every day also it's
24:18 - really great to keep a list of companies
24:19 - and positions that you've applied to who
24:22 - you've heard back from interview
24:24 - confirmations and any notes you want to
24:26 - track when you applied if you've heard
24:28 - back maybe any notes from like the
24:31 - company if they emailed you back if
24:33 - you've spoken on the phone with them or
24:35 - a recruiter or hiring manager take notes
24:37 - make a list of that it's great to not
24:39 - apply to the same jobs over and over
24:41 - again just reach out to the people that
24:44 - you're you're interested in and keep a
24:46 - spreadsheet it's really great that way
24:48 - LinkedIn connections you can reach out
24:51 - to your connections that might be open
24:52 - to making an intro to anyone that maybe
24:56 - you have in common it's a great way to
24:59 - get a referral and also consider
25:02 - reaching out to previous colleagues or
25:04 - friends who work at companies that
25:05 - you're interested in it's also a great
25:08 - way to get your foot in the door great
25:13 - and now we'll talk a little bit about
25:15 - preparing for future interview processes
25:17 - and just kind of getting yourself
25:18 - prepped for any potential conversations
25:21 - that might be coming your way so just a
25:24 - couple quick tips before we wrap up so
25:27 - before you go into an interview process
25:29 - or if you're just trying to prep
25:30 - yourself for future conversations one
25:33 - recommendation would be to prepare to
25:35 - kind of deep dive into your experience
25:37 - you know you can do this kind of by
25:39 - yourself you know going through your
25:41 - experience through your resume being
25:43 - prepared to speak to your experience and
25:44 - thinking about what you accomplished in
25:46 - previous roles like being prepared to
25:49 - discuss projects what was your role in
25:51 - that project what resources did you have
25:53 - how did the project or work have an
25:55 - impact you know who did you work with in
25:57 - the project and just be prepared to
25:59 - speak to your work style maybe a little
26:01 - bit about how you have given or received
26:03 - feedback in the past how you handled a
26:06 - situation when something went wrong and
26:09 - maybe what you learned from it thinking
26:11 - about all those questions in regards to
26:12 - your experience I think can be super
26:13 - helpful as you move into any
26:15 - conversations with recruiters hiring
26:17 - managers and future team members a lot
26:19 - of different interviews might cover
26:20 - things like this and so it's just
26:21 - helpful to be able to you know speak
26:23 - well to those different experiences that
26:25 - you've had and then one other thing you
26:28 - can consider as well is a lot of
26:29 - companies have different values
26:31 - associated with them as far as you know
26:33 - what defines them their culture and so
26:36 - forth and how they work and it might be
26:38 - useful for you to think about how that
26:39 - relates to you your experience as well
26:41 - to kind of speak to that a little bit in
26:44 - addition to that
26:45 - being prepared to speak to any gaps in
26:48 - employment I think gaps in employment
26:49 - definitely do not scare off potential
26:51 - employers the way they might have in the
26:53 - past you know the only you know gaps
26:55 - happen whether they're voluntary or
26:57 - involuntary so I think the biggest thing
26:59 - to look for is just to you know to be
27:02 - able to speak to what you did with that
27:03 - time you know what you learned and so
27:06 - forth and just being prepared you know
27:07 - to discuss why you're ready for the next
27:09 - opportunity it's also great to reconnect
27:12 - with your references if you have any
27:15 - doubt that a reference might not give
27:16 - you a good reference maybe you don't use
27:18 - them it's better to be safe than sorry
27:20 - in these situations you should always
27:21 - use someone that can speak to your
27:26 - day-to-day work and that you've worked
27:28 - directly with they should be able to
27:31 - speak a lot to your work ethic and
27:32 - specific projects that you've executed
27:35 - references are typically more about how
27:37 - to set the candidate up for success and
27:39 - their potential new role and that's what
27:41 - the hiring manager or the recruiter is
27:43 - trying to delve into when they reach out
27:44 - to those references you'll want someone
27:47 - that'll be able to speak to that and
27:48 - shed great light on it and then one
27:51 - other recommendation is just to you know
27:53 - as you continue to move forward in your
27:55 - job search you know try to continuously
27:57 - expand your contacts you know you can
27:59 - connect with people in many different
28:00 - ways obviously through LinkedIn and
28:02 - other social resources but you know
28:05 - definitely don't hesitate to reach out
28:07 - to people that you've mutual contacts
28:08 - with unlinked and kind of like we
28:10 - mentioned earlier you know attend any
28:12 - meetups that might be in an industry
28:15 - that you're interested in I know we're
28:17 - in a virtual world right now but they're
28:18 - definitely still those virtual meetups
28:19 - happening as well even virtual
28:22 - networking happy hours for instance so
28:24 - definitely things to consider it's
28:26 - definitely helpful just to expand sort
28:27 - of your network within the industries
28:29 - that you're interested in and a lot of
28:31 - times there are different panel
28:32 - discussions going on that might be
28:33 - interesting to you as well and this can
28:35 - also be another opportunity to find job
28:37 - opportunities that you might not have
28:39 - how to access to you before or that
28:40 - might not be widely posted online all
28:45 - right so I think that kind of wraps up
28:46 - our presentation portion so I guess now
28:49 - we will move on to QA and I'm super
28:52 - excited that we've got a good number of
28:55 - questions coming in from a lot of people
28:57 - so thank you all of you
28:59 - for sharing your questions in the Q&A
29:01 - box while I'm looking for a few to serve
29:06 - up right now I just want to share a
29:08 - reminder to everybody that if we are if
29:12 - you're typing your questions please do
29:14 - type them into the Q&A box we see you
29:17 - chatting in the chat and it's not easy
29:20 - to answer your questions from there so
29:22 - thank you so much for putting them in
29:23 - the Q&A box another reminder I we also
29:27 - see that your hands are raised for this
29:31 - event we won't be able to respond to and
29:35 - raise hands even though we would really
29:38 - really like to but again please do ask
29:42 - your questions in the question and
29:45 - answer box okay so to get us started oh
29:49 - yeah there we are a little bit bigger I
29:51 - saw a question come in from you and the
29:55 - question was how do we feel about
29:57 - templates on a resume
29:59 - are they good are they bad should we use
30:02 - a template should you design your own I
30:04 - don't know what got me a DUI but yeah I
30:07 - think templates um definitely an okay
30:10 - way to go they are look very clean you
30:14 - just put all of your information right
30:15 - into it I've seen the same template used
30:17 - over and over again and it doesn't
30:19 - really jar me away from a resume so I
30:21 - don't think that it's a bad thing to use
30:22 - a template personally yeah I would I
30:25 - would agree as well I think you can
30:27 - definitely be beneficial don't hesitate
30:29 - to stray away from a template but I
30:31 - think it's an absolutely great starting
30:32 - point as well if you want to work from
30:33 - that and then just yeah if you have
30:35 - questions on how to format your resume
30:36 - it's really great to use a template
30:39 - wonderful so there was also a question
30:45 - about LinkedIn
30:47 - it's from see me Evan I understand that
30:50 - LinkedIn can enhance our chances but is
30:52 - it really more helpful than a resume so
30:55 - I think this question is like comparing
30:56 - and contrasting what is more crucial in
30:59 - the job search right though assets as an
31:03 - outbound sorcerer like I am reaching out
31:05 - to people that I mostly find on LinkedIn
31:08 - so if I if I'm reaching out to someone
31:10 - who hasn't directly
31:11 - to me then I usually will find their
31:13 - LinkedIn page to kind of look at their
31:15 - work history so if you are on the job
31:17 - market and you are looking for a job I
31:19 - would say that it is definitely
31:20 - beneficial to have a LinkedIn if it
31:23 - doesn't get too descriptive that's fine
31:25 - if you have a resume that you've also
31:28 - submitted to a company that's great too
31:30 - but some sort of LinkedIn I think is
31:32 - really helpful yeah I would I would
31:35 - definitely second that as well I think
31:36 - it's a great you know sort of supplement
31:38 - or additional resource as well and as
31:40 - Mia mentioned super critical to making
31:42 - yourself more discoverable as a
31:44 - potential candidate because there might
31:45 - be jobs out there that you might not
31:47 - have discovered for whatever reason and
31:49 - recruiters are going to be recruiters
31:51 - but hiring managers are going to be
31:52 - utilizing LinkedIn to try and discover
31:54 - potentially great candidates so it's
31:56 - definitely helpful if you have the
31:58 - ability to create a little bit of a
32:00 - presence on LinkedIn wonderful thank you
32:04 - so I'm seeing a few people and I'd like
32:09 - to be able to say and like okay missus
32:11 - questions coming in from Rosie so those
32:12 - questions coming in from Simula but I'm
32:15 - seeing a few of you asked what do we do
32:18 - when we don't have experience for the
32:21 - resume what would you suggest for
32:23 - somebody this is really their first job
32:25 - and actually this ties into another
32:27 - question perhaps about where do we put
32:31 - education on our resumes so if you don't
32:35 - have if you don't have any previous like
32:38 - direct work experience or if you have an
32:40 - internship definitely put the internship
32:42 - down or if you've worked on like
32:45 - projects like technical projects or some
32:48 - sort of thesis for for school that could
32:51 - be the top the top section of your your
32:55 - resume underneath education I would
32:58 - definitely put projects underneath
32:59 - education if you don't have any relevant
33:01 - work experience and then you can expand
33:04 - upon your skills below that to up see
33:08 - thank you sorry I'm Addison did you have
33:11 - something that you would attack - no no
33:13 - I would definitely agree I think triage
33:14 - can mine you know what you've learned
33:16 - throughout your education projects
33:17 - you've worked on things like that are
33:19 - definitely great to highlight
33:21 - to be very beneficial for the job search
33:23 - wonderful just a quick reminder to
33:26 - everybody who I see in the chat please
33:30 - do ask your questions in the Q&A box we
33:33 - see them coming through chat and I
33:35 - really want to get them as many as we
33:37 - can answer it so please do place them in
33:39 - the Q&A chat I appreciate it so much and
33:41 - I know that our panelists appreciate it
33:43 - because that's where we can see them all
33:45 - to thank you we have another question
33:47 - coming from Courtney Keller and feel
33:54 - free to pass on this team if you need to
33:56 - and that question is I do both web dev
34:00 - and design do you recommend two
34:03 - different resumes I find that nearly all
34:05 - my contract work uses both of those sets
34:08 - of skills but not always sure how to
34:09 - market yourself Thanks overall I think
34:15 - you should be in a sense should be able
34:18 - to use one resume consistently so I
34:20 - think highlighting both is great however
34:22 - you know depending on what job you're
34:24 - ideally looking for you might want to
34:25 - highlight a certain set of skills maybe
34:27 - a little bit more than others however I
34:29 - know you know and most of my searches or
34:33 - with hiring managers I've worked for in
34:34 - the past they definitely love to know
34:35 - you know sort of your comprehensive
34:37 - skill set and if you have if you even if
34:39 - you were looking for more of a web
34:40 - development job as opposed to design for
34:42 - the time being if you wanted to focus on
34:43 - that more highlighting those design
34:45 - skills is also going to be a huge add as
34:47 - well so I think you know being able to
34:49 - highlight that comprehensively still
34:51 - going to benefit you but I would say you
34:55 - know I would maybe tailor your resume a
34:57 - little bit more towards what opportunity
34:58 - you might be looking for and if that is
35:00 - a comprehensive you know kind of a
35:02 - mixture of both design and development
35:03 - then you should highlight both and again
35:06 - - you can always utilize you know
35:07 - LinkedIn or your portfolio or whatever
35:09 - that might be just highlight you know
35:11 - all of your skills or continue to expand
35:13 - on all of those things as well thank you
35:18 - I'm gonna read ten meals question
35:21 - because this is one that I've actually
35:23 - had um in my life before PDF or word I
35:29 - like PDF I place a PDF and Doc's you
35:34 - there can be depending on the
35:35 - application like tracking system or how
35:37 - you upload it or you know depending on
35:39 - the computer that someone might be using
35:41 - I think it can get a little
35:43 - mistranslated at time when you upload in
35:47 - word for the applicant tracking system
35:50 - that we use it comes up just in courrier
35:52 - font and it's like a very like very
35:55 - messed up document so I would definitely
35:57 - recommend PDF thank you I have not seen
36:00 - this question comes through yet through
36:02 - this Q&A but as a rumor I'm working as
36:06 - the community manager could ketamine so
36:08 - this is a question that I do see come up
36:10 - pretty often like in our community
36:12 - spaces can you Mia or Madison can you
36:15 - speak more to that system that changes
36:19 - up the resumes can you explain that a
36:21 - little bit more Oh applicant tracking
36:23 - system asti's sure so an applicant
36:27 - tracking system or an ATS we use a
36:29 - system called green house there's a
36:31 - bunch of them out there for recruiters
36:33 - to use it basically just when you apply
36:37 - to a job or when your resume is uploaded
36:40 - by the recruiter internally it creates a
36:42 - profile for you and it's our way to
36:44 - track your your candidacy within the
36:46 - company so if you've had if you've had
36:49 - an interview we can put it what stage
36:52 - you're at and we can put some feedback
36:53 - in there and then it helps us like track
36:56 - you along the way so you don't get lost
37:00 - great thank you for that so this is just
37:04 - a plug for the the next the next session
37:08 - that we have we will have a session
37:10 - after this on best practices for
37:12 - interviewing online so get ready for
37:14 - that we do still have about six seven
37:18 - minutes left for Q&A here though so
37:21 - we're gonna pace ourselves I see so many
37:25 - questions right now coming in and I
37:26 - super appreciate them just want to give
37:28 - a heads-up to everybody if your question
37:30 - is not answered for for Madison to Mia
37:33 - you can always visit the Koch Adam II
37:36 - forums we have a space actually where we
37:41 - can keep this conversation going that's
37:43 - discuss codecademy comm so we can keep
37:47 - talking
37:48 - there in case we don't get to
37:51 - everybody's questions right now so I saw
37:53 - earlier a question come in sorry Lenny I
38:01 - like this one very much so maybe this is
38:06 - something that you can ask from you know
38:07 - Thomas Chang asked what tool would you
38:10 - use would you suggest to a job searcher
38:13 - to use for tracking everything that
38:16 - tracking other applications have you
38:18 - ever seen a good system that you like
38:20 - yeah I think you know it is very much up
38:23 - to the user as far as what they like you
38:25 - know there are always there are so many
38:26 - different tools out there and so it
38:28 - definitely can be hard to choose of
38:29 - course I think you could utilize
38:31 - anything from a sort of basic like Excel
38:33 - or Google sheet I think I saw that in
38:36 - recommended with Trello Trello totally
38:39 - works as well again I think you know any
38:42 - of these things could could do this well
38:44 - so I think finding a workflow that works
38:46 - well for you
38:47 - it's what's most important what you
38:49 - think you'll actually go to more like
38:50 - are you more apt to go into Google to
38:52 - utilize a Google sheet or you might have
38:54 - to check your app Trello or whether
38:57 - that's an error table or I think they're
38:59 - kind of almost an endless amount of sort
39:01 - of organizational tools that you might
39:02 - be able to use but definitely
39:04 - recommending something where it's pretty
39:05 - easy for you to edit or move things to
39:08 - different categories or stages or to add
39:11 - notes something that makes that easy to
39:13 - do especially if you think about after
39:15 - you've had a call with an initial call
39:18 - with a company for example a place
39:19 - that's you know something that's easy
39:21 - for you to go into and add a couple
39:22 - notes or you know something that's not
39:24 - too difficult for you to update and edit
39:26 - and track it's definitely going to be
39:28 - important but I think it's totally up to
39:29 - you as far as what's gonna work well for
39:31 - you okay oh thank you
39:35 - we're all at home right now just show us
39:39 - in the chat how many of you are at home
39:41 - with a dog or a pet or a family member
39:44 - right now um there's probably a lot of
39:47 - us you are gonna hear my dog back that's
39:51 - good that's gonna be part of today
39:52 - thank you so much for understanding um
39:55 - okay I really appreciate this question
39:58 - how to add sub
40:00 - medical experience on your resume travel
40:03 - listener
40:03 - yeah yep yeah I'm not sure what your
40:08 - attica like traveling took a break
40:11 - travel people people will most likely
40:13 - understand I think it's better to put
40:15 - something rather than just leave like if
40:17 - it's like six months to a year or even
40:19 - if it's three months just put like
40:21 - sabbatical and Paris or like traveled
40:23 - Europe something like that yeah just add
40:27 - it however you feel comfortable putting
40:28 - it yeah I would agree I think I do
40:31 - personally anyways prefer to see you
40:34 - know something highlighted at you know
40:36 - as a sabbatical experience or time off
40:38 - or whatever that might have been I know
40:40 - there used to be a few different
40:41 - LinkedIn pages that would highlight you
40:43 - know time off whether that was for a
40:44 - sabbatical or parental leave or whatever
40:47 - that might have looked like because most
40:49 - likely you were doing something pretty
40:50 - amazing you know during your time off
40:52 - your sabbatical parental leave whatever
40:54 - that might have been and there are
40:55 - definitely interesting things that
40:56 - you're gonna be able to highlight that
40:57 - will totally benefit you you know moving
40:59 - forward in your job search as well so
41:01 - definitely don't shy away from
41:02 - I think highlighting that a little bit
41:04 - rather than leaving a hiring manager or
41:06 - recruiter wondering like hmm there is a
41:08 - gap there wondering what was going on
41:09 - yeah I think it's nice to mention
41:12 - something if you feel comfortable if you
41:14 - don't and that's fine too you know you
41:15 - have other amazing experience that will
41:17 - you know you'll be able to speak to as
41:19 - well wonderful thank you so much and
41:23 - thanks everybody for telling us who you
41:25 - have it with you that was actually a
41:27 - nice little moment of joy as well
41:30 - somebody has five dogs of you you are
41:34 - you are among the best okay I saw a few
41:38 - questions come in about actually how to
41:41 - start a relationship with recruiters and
41:44 - headhunters if you're new to the job
41:46 - market so outside agencies so is that
41:51 - you're looking to get into a
41:52 - relationship with a headhunter an
41:54 - outside agency they're more than willing
41:55 - to speak with you most likely if you
41:58 - have any sort of relevant experience
42:00 - they will jump at the opportunity to
42:02 - speak with you and to get you in their
42:03 - pipeline to get a relationship with a
42:07 - internal recruiter I would say reach out
42:10 - to them or maybe a contact that you know
42:14 - the company apply the best way is to
42:16 - apply to the position through the job
42:18 - posting I'm constantly going through the
42:21 - inbound application so your your job
42:24 - application will get seen yeah I think
42:28 - those are the best ways Madison anything
42:30 - else dad yeah no I definitely would
42:32 - recommend as Mia said with third-party
42:34 - agencies I would echo that as far as
42:36 - tape to reach out to them apply to their
42:38 - postings going to their you know agency
42:41 - website applying to postings there
42:42 - they'll be you know more than keen to
42:44 - reach out to you I think and then as far
42:47 - as internal recruiters you know
42:49 - something I've seen that has been
42:51 - effective is people will reach out to
42:53 - folks on the team if they can search for
42:55 - them on LinkedIn on the team that
42:56 - they're interested in joining and then
42:58 - they'll see if they're interested in
43:00 - having a chat or just chatting via
43:01 - message and more often than not I think
43:03 - our team members are forwarding and
43:05 - highlighting those resumes to us so you
43:08 - know don't hesitate to give that a try
43:10 - and the most like polite and
43:11 - professional way that you can obviously
43:13 - not everyone is going to have time to
43:14 - respond but most of the time people will
43:16 - forward things long and if they do have
43:18 - time they're usually more than you know
43:20 - willing to speak with you or chat with
43:22 - you a little bit whether that's online
43:23 - or on a call or whatever that might look
43:25 - like so it doesn't definitely isn't hurt
43:27 - to do a sort of like gentle reach out on
43:28 - LinkedIn that way but it is something
43:31 - that has totally worked and we've gotten
43:32 - people into process that way as well
43:34 - from someone reaching up someone on the
43:36 - team oh yeah thank you so much okay we
43:41 - have like less than 60 seconds left with
43:43 - you both before Jeff and Emma come on

43:48 - online so in this limited time that we
43:52 - have is there anything that came up for

43:58 - I would say I know that a lot I saw in
44:03 - the chat a lot of people were worried
44:05 - about applying to jobs right now I'd say
44:07 - still apply to jobs that are open if
44:08 - there are any if there is anything out
44:11 - there there are still companies that are
44:12 - hiring I know that a lot of people are
44:14 - scared right now about finding a new job
44:16 - but I mean hopefully things will get
44:19 - better in the future
44:20 - so I'd say still still put yourself out
44:23 - there and apply absolutely yes
44:25 - definitely like you
44:27 - no trying as best you can to not get
44:29 - yourself down about you know applying I

48:59 - interviewing online before we get into
49:01 - some of the introductions between myself
49:03 - and Emma I would like to address one
49:05 - quick question that came up before about
49:07 - that I saw in the chat about cover
49:09 - letters I think it's an important topic
49:11 - yes yes yes on cover letters start with
49:16 - a great topic sentence tell the company
49:19 - why you want to work there make it
49:21 - personal recruiters read these teams
49:24 - read these so you know yes for me on
49:29 - cover letters and that also goes for
49:31 - optional questions I
49:33 - no companies a lot of doing optional
49:35 - questions on the actual a balloon take
49:37 - some time go full so let's get to the
49:43 - project
49:44 - this is best practice for interviewing
49:46 - online are all going through this many
49:52 - of the time we'll get to all those two
49:56 - things i'm jeff director town code at me
50:00 - before this I worked for a large Bini so
50:04 - work for a recruiting agency for about
50:06 - thirteen years so I've worked with
50:09 - clients of different sizes in many
50:12 - different recruiting processes and
50:14 - fittings and philosophies I've been here
50:18 - for about six months and absolutely
50:21 - loving it I think we have a team of
50:24 - experts as you've already seen in Mia
50:27 - and and has a lot of things to share let
50:32 - me turn it over to you haven't you want
50:33 - to do an introduction for sure um say
50:36 - I'm a senior technical recruiter I'm the
50:38 - talent team here I on a day to day basis
50:42 - focus on engineering roles curriculum
50:45 - roles sales roles and customer support
50:48 - roles I think right now um so basically
50:51 - a broad spectrum of the company in
50:53 - addition to just technical roles and as
50:56 - far as my background goes I've been at
50:58 - code Academy for almost two years now
51:00 - and previously worked in agency
51:03 - recruiting so I focused on working on
51:05 - tech roles in New York City with
51:08 - basically mostly startup and media
51:11 - companies fantastic Emma your wealth of
51:16 - knowledge for code Academy if anybody
51:18 - has questions please put them in the
51:19 - chat if you're interested to know more
51:21 - about recruiting or all things code
51:23 - Academy our agenda for today we're gonna
51:27 - run through what a typical interview
51:30 - process looks like you know how you can
51:33 - think about ways in which you'll
51:36 - describe your experience to various
51:37 - people along the way and what to expect
51:40 - and who you're going to talk to we're
51:43 - gonna talk about preparing for your
51:44 - interview you know the things that go
51:46 - into
51:47 - ooh what will show that you have
51:51 - prepared yourself and we'll talk a
51:56 - little bit about adjusting online
51:57 - interviews of course very relevant for
51:59 - today you know this again is something
52:02 - that we're gonna focus on a lot and then
52:06 - we're just going to give sort of one
52:08 - overview opinion about using the star
52:12 - method to answer behavioural questions
52:15 - you know this is something where there
52:18 - are many different ideas philosophies
52:20 - that are that are roughly the same but
52:24 - this will give you an easy way to
52:26 - remember and go forward about this and
52:29 - then how to follow up so here we go Emma
52:35 - do you want to take it away for the
52:36 - typical interview process for sure um so
52:40 - just to start off we wanted to to talk
52:43 - through what a typical interview process
52:45 - will look like I think it's it's great
52:47 - to know what you're in for when you get
52:48 - into process with the company and and
52:51 - just to kind of highlight we put it at
52:53 - the bottom but this is an example of
52:54 - what a lot of companies will use it's
52:56 - always encouraged to ask the recruiting
52:58 - team at the company you're interviewing
52:59 - with what kind of process they run
53:02 - remember that the recruiter that you're
53:04 - working with is it is a great resource
53:06 - for you for questions that you have in
53:08 - the process and really wants you to
53:10 - succeed in the process and so you have a
53:11 - lot of mutual interests so starting off
53:15 - in the in the interview process is
53:16 - application review candidates are coming
53:20 - to the company in some way whether that
53:21 - be a referral applying online applying
53:24 - through some kind of paid platform or
53:26 - job board and someone's looking at that
53:29 - resume so for us it often is Mia who you
53:32 - guys talked with earlier but it may be
53:34 - another recruiter on the team as well
53:36 - then there's a recruiter phone screen so
53:39 - typically at codecademy this is often
53:41 - done by myself or Madison or Jeff and
53:44 - this is really about the candidates
53:46 - background about what they're looking
53:48 - for there may be some like basic
53:52 - eligibility questions involved as well
53:55 - after that there's often a call with a
53:58 - hiring manager for the role and on we
54:01 - a hiring manager we're talking about the
54:02 - person who will be making the final
54:05 - decision for this role and that's also
54:07 - the person who would eventually be the
54:10 - boss of the person we're bringing in so
54:12 - the the decision maker and the person
54:14 - who would be managing then there's some
54:17 - kind of an assessment stage for
54:19 - technical roles this may be some kind of
54:22 - coding screen or take home assessment
54:25 - for other roles it may be a presentation
54:29 - of some kind or some kind of data
54:31 - analysis there's really a broad range
54:33 - but there's always some kind of writing
54:35 - sample or something involved then we do
54:37 - a final interview previously this was
54:40 - done on-site and it was a great way for
54:42 - the candidate to see what the office
54:44 - looks like get a feel for what it would
54:46 - be like to work with the team and all
54:47 - that unfortunately right now we're
54:49 - running these over over zoom so we're
54:52 - have like five hours in calls with
54:54 - candidates in which different members of
54:56 - the team will pop in and out we shine
54:57 - scheduled breaks to make sure that
55:00 - people have a chance to like grab water
55:01 - grab food that kind of stuff so we we
55:04 - had to really quickly adapt to there and
55:07 - then we do reference checks typically
55:10 - for us that often looks like a past
55:12 - manager or a past peer but I think it
55:15 - can vary depending on the company and me
55:18 - I gave some great tips earlier about
55:20 - picking your references and then from
55:23 - there we make an offer fantastic again I
55:29 - want to +1 to Emma saying that you know
55:32 - this is a typical process this is not
55:34 - going to be the same across the board
55:36 - you know some companies may not do an
55:38 - assessment or some companies you know
55:41 - will have to on-site interviews some
55:44 - companies will do a reference check and
55:46 - you know it can be a character review if
55:48 - you haven't had a previous manager it
55:51 - may be a professor or you know a a
55:54 - relative of some kind so so it is
55:57 - important that you you know are aware
56:00 - that these are all can be a part of the
56:02 - process and making sure that before you
56:06 - begin your job search you have some of
56:08 - these people or places ready to go
56:13 - the
56:15 - really the worst thing you can do is
56:17 - sort of slow down the process that the
56:19 - reason is is that you want to make sure
56:21 - that it is as seamless for you as it is
56:23 - for the company so let's dive into
56:26 - preparing for the interview I will run
56:29 - through a couple of the dudes
56:31 - you'll hear from at mahanakhon Cola the
56:32 - don'ts we find that it's very very very
56:38 - important that candidates know the
56:40 - company before the interview this is for
56:44 - many different reasons you could use
56:45 - your imagination but to us the most
56:47 - important one is that you're showing
56:49 - that you're interested in working for
56:50 - this company that you didn't apply
56:52 - blindly you know that there is some
56:54 - significant reason that you are driven
56:56 - to this specific company whether it's
57:00 - the mission whether it's the industry
57:02 - you know whether it is you know if
57:05 - you're an avid skier and you want to
57:06 - work for a ski company like k2 or if
57:09 - you're a hiker and you want to work for
57:11 - Patagonia you know or if you're a coder
57:13 - and you want to or an educator want to
57:14 - work for Codecademy those types of
57:16 - things a lot of what's posted on
57:19 - companies careers pages you will find
57:22 - valuable for your interviews especially
57:25 - because most of the time they're built
57:27 - by the talent teams and they the talent
57:30 - teams and recruiting teams and HR teams
57:32 - are trying to do their best to highlight
57:35 - all of the information that candidates
57:38 - would find interesting about the company
57:39 - little known facts company values is a
57:43 - really important one you know these are
57:46 - way or these are avenues places for you
57:49 - to highlight your interest in the
57:50 - company but also find questions I you
57:54 - know the old saying is come prepared
57:56 - with a couple of questions to the
57:59 - interview and the more specific you can
58:01 - get the more in depth of an answer you
58:03 - will receive you'll get a much more
58:05 - robust picture of the company you know
58:09 - so that you can better prepare yourself
58:11 - for making a decision down the line also
58:14 - important reread the job description you
58:16 - know these are questions that recruiters
58:18 - or hiring teams will will be the
58:21 - foundation for the questions you'll get
58:23 - so the better you know the job
58:25 - description you know the better you'll
58:27 - be prepared for answering those types of
58:29 - shit's another really important one
58:32 - everybody you need to know your resume
58:35 - you need to know your experience I
58:37 - purposely what I was making my
58:39 - introduction said that I worked at an
58:41 - agency for OS a number of years stumbled
58:45 - over that the real answer is I work for
58:47 - 12 and a half years at an agency and the
58:50 - difference between telling somebody that
58:51 - I worked at an agency for 12 and a half
58:53 - years or have to think about it you know
58:56 - shows that I'm prepared it's really
58:58 - important that you know your experience
59:01 - reread your resume also another nice
59:04 - thing I think is to research your
59:06 - interviewers you know you should be
59:08 - getting a list of the people that you
59:10 - will meet with during your interview go
59:11 - online go on LinkedIn find something in
59:16 - their profile that you can identify with
59:18 - and talk about I think building personal
59:21 - connections now more than ever
59:22 - especially with things on zoom' is
59:24 - really really important you know it
59:27 - shows again that you have prepared
59:29 - yourself that you're interested in the
59:31 - company you know that you are taking
59:34 - pride in this interview and that you're
59:36 - serious and taking this very you know
59:38 - you're considering this opportunity at
59:39 - SAAP opportunity and the last thing I'll
59:42 - leave you with is to practice you know
59:44 - make sure that you run through it it
59:46 - doesn't matter if it's in the mirror and
59:48 - it's just to yourself or to your dog or
59:50 - to your cat or to your child or to you
59:54 - know your neighbor across the street and
59:56 - you scream it over Fifth Avenue you know
59:58 - practice it will help you it will hone
60:02 - your skills it will hone your
60:04 - preparedness it's very important
60:08 - MIUI go ahead yeah almost tying into
60:13 - Jack's last point about practicing um I
60:16 - would definitely not forget to prepare
60:19 - questions at the end of every interview
60:22 - at code Academy you're going to have the
60:25 - chance to ask questions and now more
60:27 - than ever doing these in a remote that's
60:29 - really your chance to get an idea of
60:31 - what it would be like to work with these
60:32 - people and what the culture is like at
60:35 - that company I would also say not to
60:38 - forget to set a calendar and write for
60:39 - 15 minutes prior to your interview you
60:42 - want to make sure that
60:43 - there's gonna be a bit of buffer room in
60:46 - case something goes wrong with setting
60:47 - out some technology make sure that
60:49 - you're ready for when your interview
60:50 - starts cuz even though it's Anna
60:52 - probably zoom or Google hangout or
60:54 - something like that you definitely don't
60:56 - want to be late I would also say to
60:59 - never hesitate to ask the recruiting
61:01 - team if there will be a break or any
61:03 - other questions like that if it's
61:05 - helpful for you to have that break in
61:07 - the center the fact that you're at home
61:08 - right now makes it more flexible for you
61:10 - in terms of your schedule and also don't
61:13 - forget to bring yourself water bring
61:14 - yourself coffee and have that stuff on
61:16 - your desk
61:16 - that'll make it yes just holding up his
61:19 - coffee I've got coffee here and have it
61:22 - having that right next to you um will
61:24 - make the whole thing work all more
61:25 - smoothly and hopefully make you feel
61:27 - more comfortable great let's go to the
61:31 - next slide here and then you want to
61:33 - take the dues here for adjusting to a
61:35 - virtual interview pressure and the main
61:39 - thing that I would just start off here
61:40 - with virtual interviews and saying is
61:42 - that it's probably just as new and
61:45 - slightly uncomfortable to the company
61:46 - that you're interviewing with as it is
61:48 - to you so we're all learning together
61:50 - and adjusting to a rapidly changing
61:51 - world here the number one way to to
61:55 - adjust is to practice so definitely make
61:57 - sure that you've like set up your space
62:00 - see what it would look like in your
62:02 - camera and all of that the next thing I
62:04 - would say is to dress the part this can
62:06 - mean a lot of different things for a lot
62:08 - of different companies sometimes you may
62:10 - be interviewing at like a bank or more
62:13 - corporate environment in that case you
62:14 - probably want to dress up more if you're
62:16 - interviewing for a start-up like
62:17 - codecademy it probably doesn't matter if
62:19 - you're wearing a t-shirt so there really
62:21 - is the need to kind of know your
62:23 - audience and where what's appropriate
62:25 - for that um if you're gonna use a zoom
62:27 - background you might want to think about
62:28 - not wearing like a green shirt or
62:30 - something like that to make sure that
62:32 - you don't fade into the background but
62:34 - it really really depends I would also
62:37 - say to test the technology if you've
62:40 - never used in before you're gonna want
62:41 - to get on ahead of time and download it
62:43 - onto your computer make sure you know
62:44 - how it works
62:45 - check out the basic functionality and
62:47 - all that kind of stuff um and also think
62:50 - about think about the lighting in your
62:52 - room these conversations over zoom are a
62:55 - little bit unnatural
62:56 - a little bit uncomfortable but being
62:59 - able to see each other clearly makes it
63:01 - a lot more effective another thing that
63:05 - we all we actually all did this for this
63:06 - interview as well it's made sure that we
63:08 - had our desktop notifications turned off
63:10 - whether that be email or calendar or
63:12 - slack keep in mind that any
63:15 - notifications or pings that you're
63:17 - getting on your computer will be able to
63:19 - be heard by whoever's on the other end
63:21 - of your video conference so you don't
63:23 - want to hit them to hear the incessant
63:24 - slack notification saying that you got a
63:26 - message it's gonna be really distracting
63:28 - to the interviewer as well as yourself
63:31 - don't forget to take a breath as well I
63:33 - think we could all probably benefit from
63:37 - some advice - take a deep breath think
63:40 - on a question and slow down and I would
63:43 - also say say just talk about something
63:45 - personal these are really really unique
63:48 - times and I think for most people that
63:50 - I'm speaking with that they're maybe
63:51 - like a dog or their child or their
63:55 - family in the background and like that's
63:57 - completely fine just calling it out and
64:00 - saying like Oh like you know I'm
64:02 - definitely paying attention I'm sorry
64:04 - that there's some stuff going on here
64:06 - usually that the company will recognize
64:08 - it and if they're like not interested in
64:13 - the fact that that you have a family and
64:15 - that they're there they're probably not
64:16 - a company but you want to work for and
64:18 - also smile there's so much body language
64:21 - that I think is lost being over
64:23 - videoconferencing um so you don't do
64:25 - whatever you can to uh to project your
64:28 - personality into the interview thanks
64:31 - Emma a couple of don'ts these are you
64:34 - know fairly straightforward don't stress
64:36 - this is new for everybody don't get
64:38 - flustered with the technology it's okay
64:40 - if you know again the dog barks in the
64:42 - background or you know your your screen
64:46 - gets frozen that's okay
64:48 - don't be afraid to take notes I would
64:50 - tell your interviewer that you plan to
64:51 - do so if you aren't going to and if
64:53 - you're going to be typing you know make
64:55 - sure to tell that that person don't be
64:58 - afraid to ask questions including for
64:59 - somebody to repeat the question this
65:01 - sort of folds into the technology piece
65:02 - and don't forget to follow up I think
65:05 - the best thing you can do is is send an
65:07 - email to the recruiter
65:08 - follow up provide any feedback there is
65:11 - ask for a timeline of feedback and
65:14 - emails for people who were on the
65:16 - interview panel so you can drop it thank
65:18 - you
65:20 - um let's move to the star method we're
65:24 - gonna quickly go through this what I'd
65:26 - recommend doing is is doing some
65:28 - research online and these are for
65:30 - behavioral questions the example that
65:32 - we'll come to at the end is tell me
65:34 - about a time that you've made a mistake
65:35 - and how you handled it Emma's gonna go
65:38 - through two answers and we'll share a
65:40 - little bit of context as to why one is a
65:42 - little bit better than the other the
65:44 - star method is situation task action and
65:47 - result this will give the answer a very
65:52 - robust detailed and thoughtful response
65:58 - so you know setting the stage describing
66:01 - what you did how you handled the
66:04 - situation and what your effort was and
66:06 - the outcome and the result so Emma let's
66:10 - do the non star method answer first I
66:14 - will pose the question to you tell me
66:16 - about a mistake that you've made and how
66:18 - did you handle it all right I remember
66:22 - one time when I sent flowers to the
66:24 - wrong address I was an Internet at
66:26 - events company I realized this about two
66:28 - hours before the event and so I got in
66:30 - my car picked them up and took them to
66:32 - the right place it was really stressful
66:34 - but I guess all's well that ends well
66:37 - thank you now let's do the same question
66:41 - using the star method so Emma tell me
66:44 - about it a mistake that you've made and
66:46 - how did you handle it I was working as
66:50 - an intern for an events company and I
66:52 - was responsible for ordering the floral
66:54 - arrangements for a private event hosted
66:56 - by a high-profile client
66:58 - unfortunately I mixed up the information
67:00 - from another event and the flowers were
67:02 - delivered to the wrong venue on the
67:04 - other side of town I admitted my mistake
67:07 - to my boss took an early lunch break
67:09 - drove to the other venue picked up the
67:12 - flowers and delivered them to
67:13 - appropriate venue an hour before the
67:15 - event the client never knew about my
67:16 - mix-up and my boss was very grateful but
67:21 - SiC so I want to save some time for
67:24 - questions but a couple of key things
67:26 - here you know in the first example we
67:29 - had almost no context about why this was
67:31 - a relevant mistake why the person a
67:35 - candidate is describing this particular
67:37 - situation whereas in the second example
67:39 - we really heard that this was a high
67:41 - profile client you know this was a main
67:43 - responsibility for this job you know and
67:46 - and so that so that's the why that's the
67:48 - setting of the stage you know the task
67:51 - at hand very clear and then how you
67:54 - handled the situation is specifically
67:56 - about a mistake and in the first example
67:58 - there was no mention of making mistake
67:59 - there was no you know here's how I
68:02 - understood this to be a mistake in the
68:04 - second answer it was very clear this was
68:06 - my mistake
68:07 - here's I went to my boss I admitted the
68:09 - mistake you know these are things that
68:11 - recruiters look for when hiring schemes
68:12 - look for the ability the ability to take
68:14 - feedback the ability to you know take
68:17 - ownership over a situation and overcome
68:20 - right the result was very clear in the
68:23 - first example the client never knew
68:25 - about the the earth sorry in the star
68:27 - example the client never knew about the
68:29 - problem you know it was solved
68:30 - internally there was a massive efforts
68:32 - and there was buzz that the client got
68:36 - their flowers which is directly tied to
68:39 - what the task was in the first example
68:41 - it was very blurry all as well that ends
68:44 - well
68:44 - we really don't know what that means did
68:47 - the client know anything what was the
68:49 - situation it's very unclear please go
68:52 - research the star method there are
68:54 - multiple examples in out there this
68:56 - works whether or not this is your first
68:58 - job or you're a VP going for a c-level
69:01 - job I promise this is a very very very
69:04 - good method so can we pause here and go
69:11 - to Q&A at least are you there I'm here
69:15 - and so is my dog normal snoring this is
69:18 - real life ok thank you all for your
69:22 - questions
69:22 - I want it where we're running a little
69:24 - tight on time we've only got five
69:25 - minutes or so left so just a reminder
69:29 - any questions that you do have let's
69:31 - please add them to Q&A what that does
69:34 - give presenters like Emma and Jeff an
69:37 - opportunity even after they're done
69:39 - presenting to actually go through the QA
69:41 - and see what else they can answer for
69:42 - you I want to also give a heads up that
69:48 - we will be recording this and you will
69:50 - be able to find this on YouTube I've
69:52 - seen that question come up a few times
69:54 - you will be able to find this on YouTube
69:56 - and if you registered for the event I'm
69:57 - Zoo
69:57 - it'll get sent to you via email and now
70:02 - before we go to QA actually Emma and
70:06 - Jeff is there any questions that you saw
70:08 - come in that you know right now that you
70:10 - want to answer or is there anything that
70:14 - came up if not I've got one yeah let's
70:18 - hear from you okay cool
70:21 - what's a good timeline for feedback like
70:24 - for asking for a feedback after an
70:26 - interview
70:31 - take this what I yeah I definitely think
70:36 - thing that this isn't this is a great
70:39 - question I think follow up after the
70:40 - interview is is really important as well
70:43 - as the interview itself I would say
70:46 - sometimes while rands working remote it
70:48 - may take the recruiter a little bit
70:49 - longer to gather feedback from everyone
70:51 - but typically if it's been 48 hours from
70:54 - a final interview there should be no
70:56 - problem following up with the recruiter
70:58 - and asking for feedback and the worst
71:00 - that they can say is you know I don't
71:02 - have anything yet I should know tomorrow
71:04 - I should know in two more days they're
71:05 - just asking them what the timeline looks
71:07 - like can be really helpful yeah I'll
71:11 - probably underscore that because this is
71:13 - something that we heard in Mia's
71:15 - presentation that ask questions that's a
71:18 - great thing to do
71:19 - a question from Andres BIA what kind of
71:24 - questions at the end of the interview
71:26 - make you stand out I've asked about the
71:28 - future of the company's specific and/or
71:30 - technical questions or just about the
71:31 - hiring process but what are some home
71:35 - runs yeah you know I always find the
71:39 - more specific the question the more
71:41 - engaging the conversation can be so I'll
71:44 - go back to my previous thoughts about
71:46 - researching the company knowing the job
71:48 - description and then showcasing that
71:51 - you've listened to the answers that you
71:53 - have for questions you've asked what
71:55 - have you learned throughout the
71:55 - interview and then I'd be remiss if I
71:58 - didn't say what my my father-in-law gave
72:01 - me some great advice way back when I was
72:03 - looking for jobs and he said you know
72:04 - make sure that you ask if you can have
72:06 - the job for me that is a question that
72:09 - seems to catch people off-guard and but
72:13 - shows that you're very serious so so it
72:15 - almost has a a sense of humor but in a
72:18 - sense of urgency built into it I think
72:20 - that you'll find that that is super
72:23 - helpful you can pair that with something
72:25 - a little bit easier like how do you
72:28 - think the sweat you know if you're the
72:30 - interviewer you know do you think that
72:32 - this went well I thought this went very
72:33 - well you know you can be direct that
72:36 - would be my biggest advice
72:40 - thank you and we have time for one more
72:43 - I really really like this question that
72:46 - came in from an anonymous attendee and I
72:49 - liked it so much because culture is
72:50 - something so important to us at code
72:53 - Khadem a so this is a culture question
72:57 - what is the best way to know what is
73:01 - accurate and what is being sold when
73:05 - your interview interview were is
73:08 - speaking about culture one thing that I
73:13 - would immediately jump to is that it's
73:17 - okay to ask the same question if it's
73:20 - culturally related to more than one
73:22 - interviewer on on your panel I love yeah
73:26 - like you know asking every single person
73:28 - like what's your favorite thing about
73:29 - working here what do you think is a
73:32 - growth area for the company in terms of
73:33 - improving culture those kinds of
73:35 - questions if everyone they answering
73:38 - exactly the same you probably know that
73:41 - the company is pushing a script a little
73:42 - bit and I think that you can really get
73:44 - an idea for the kinds of things that are
73:46 - important to people who work at that
73:47 - company yeah and also making sure that
73:50 - those questions are really are really
73:52 - targeted so if you're asking
73:55 - specifically about an area of culture
73:57 - that's important to you you know it
73:59 - makes sure that your interviewer knows
74:01 - or interviewers know how important it is
74:03 - and ask very specific questions about it
74:05 - you you will depending on the place you
74:08 - will always have an opportunity to add
74:10 - to the culture and that is something
74:12 - that interviewer teams are looking for
74:15 - across the board so so if it's something
74:18 - where you have a specific thing that you
74:20 - want to do you know talk about it and if
74:22 - the company doesn't do it it may be seen
74:24 - as a as a really great thing for the
74:27 - company to do in the future I love it
74:31 - okay there are so many good questions
74:32 - coming in because that's the crowd that
74:35 - we have with us today thank you all for
74:37 - asking your questions if we are at home
74:40 - I'm hoping that we can do like a virtual
74:42 - applause for everybody who comes and
74:46 - speaks with us today I am so grateful
74:49 - Emma and Jeff thank you if there's any
74:53 - little

78:43 - point of contact for anyone on the team
78:45 - who has a question or need support I'm
78:47 - here with Maria hey Maria hi everyone
78:51 - I'm Maria I am the office manager and
78:54 - people Operations Specialist at Code
78:56 - Kadim II a large part of my job is
78:58 - onboarding new hires and helping them
79:00 - feel as welcome as possible our process
79:03 - for onboarding has changed quite a bit
79:04 - since we went remote so I'm super
79:07 - excited to share some of the tips on
79:08 - starting a new job online that we've
79:10 - learned along the way quite a bit has
79:12 - changed Oh
79:14 - like I said congratulations right you've
79:16 - done a lot of the hard work already
79:18 - starting
79:19 - job is a really big moment and very
79:21 - exciting but I can definitely understand
79:23 - the prospect of starting a new job
79:25 - remotely might feel intimidating we hear
79:28 - you for many of us working from home has
79:30 - been a big departure from our normal
79:31 - routines and that can make it really
79:33 - hard to know what to expect I just also
79:36 - want to point out that this experience
79:37 - will be really different for every
79:38 - company and for every person but we just
79:41 - want to take the opportunity to share
79:42 - what we've learned along the way that
79:43 - might help you
79:44 - many of these onboarding tips and tricks
79:46 - are general best practices - and
79:47 - there'll be things you can put into
79:49 - place even if you do go back to the
79:50 - office in the future we'll cover a
79:54 - couple of buckets here three main things
79:57 - getting set up getting set
80:00 - getting started and getting settled
80:01 - getting set up includes our best advice
80:03 - for what you should focus on before your
80:05 - official first day getting started
80:07 - covers first day in your first week
80:09 - while getting settled we'll focus on
80:11 - preparing for long-term success awesome
80:17 - so getting set up at Co Cadenet we
80:20 - consider onboarding to start from the
80:21 - moment a new hire accepts their offer
80:23 - here we want them to have a great
80:25 - experience that whole time couple of
80:28 - things we recommend here ask your
80:30 - onboarding team for advice every company
80:33 - has different procedures and processes
80:34 - so that team will truly be the best
80:37 - experts and helping you figure out what
80:39 - you need to know try reaching out and
80:41 - asking them what they need from you or
80:42 - find out what you can do in advance to
80:44 - prepare it's also a good opportunity to
80:46 - ask about any first-day expectations and
80:48 - when should you be prepared to be online
80:51 - how will you start your day what does
80:54 - your first day agenda look like many
80:58 - companies will send you new hardware
80:59 - like a laptop or a desktop computer for
81:01 - you to use if you receive this early you
81:04 - should try and take some time for your
81:05 - first day to get your computer setup
81:07 - this will let you make sure that
81:09 - everything works to your specifications
81:11 - for example customizing your mouse click
81:13 - settings brightness etc at koke Adam II
81:17 - we've been doing this by shipping
81:18 - welcome kits as a way of bringing that
81:20 - new desk feeling to our new team members
81:23 - homes we send out boxes complete with a
81:26 - laptop a Welcome Packet and some code
81:28 - academy swag to make sure that everyone
81:30 - has everything that they need to
81:32 - right in on their first day we're also
81:34 - then working with each person to set up
81:35 - any extra tech that would help them work
81:37 - better so things like keyboards or mice
81:42 - we also recommend you find out about
81:44 - software right just like Emma mentioned
81:46 - before find out what software the team
81:48 - is using and make yourself familiar with
81:50 - it things like video conferencing
81:52 - calendar email chat or all things you'll
81:55 - use right away on day one and so it's
81:57 - important to be comfortable with them
81:58 - quickly if something is new to you try
82:02 - it out first consider doing a test run
82:04 - on software like video conferencing with
82:06 - a friend or a family member so you know
82:08 - how it works you might also want to try
82:10 - out screen sharing this will let you set
82:12 - up your audio and video permissions
82:13 - before you jump into any big meetings so
82:16 - you're not caught off guard something I
82:18 - want to talk about here and you've
82:20 - definitely seen us struggle with this a
82:21 - little bit on the call the importance of
82:23 - using the mute function on video calls
82:26 - in larger meetings or whenever you might
82:28 - have background noise around you just
82:30 - make sure you are muting yourself right
82:32 - and take the time to practice going on
82:34 - and off mute
82:35 - and many conferencing software's also
82:37 - have keyboard shortcuts that will help
82:39 - you wanna meet yourself quickly and zoom
82:41 - for example you press on the spacebar
82:43 - and hold it down while you're speaking
82:45 - and then let go to go back right back on
82:47 - here
82:47 - I make that mistake daily so it's a good
82:51 - idea to practice another great prep step
82:55 - is setting up a designated workspace you
82:58 - should ensure it's free from
82:59 - distractions try and minimize noise make
83:02 - sure your background is professional it
83:05 - doesn't need to be blank it can still
83:07 - showcase your personality with items
83:09 - like a bookcase or plants but just make
83:11 - sure that everything that's in your
83:12 - frame is professional and very important
83:16 - tip if you are in front of your bed
83:18 - make sure your bed is made before I mean
83:21 - you should consider comfort and
83:23 - ergonomics when you're setting up your
83:24 - space one organ Amma Kip is keeping your
83:28 - laptop and any secondary monitors at eye
83:30 - level this helps reduce neck strain you
83:34 - should be aware of where your lot
83:35 - eyeline is in relation to your camera
83:37 - digital eye contact is something that
83:40 - will go a long way and making you feel
83:41 - connected to your team one tip we
83:43 - recently learned from the team
83:45 - was that if you're trying to take notes
83:46 - while on a video call you should put the
83:48 - window you're looking at directly under
83:50 - your camera that way you can look at
83:52 - your notes and also make eye contact at
83:53 - the same time yeah this is an important
83:56 - one and it's definitely something that's
83:57 - much easier to do in one-on-one meetings
83:59 - where you're having more conversational
84:01 - time but if you are you know trying to
84:04 - present it can be more challenging so
84:06 - just make sure you position the things
84:07 - on your screen correctly our last step
84:09 - in this section is to do your homework
84:10 - it's similar to when you're interviewing
84:12 - this is your chance to make a strong
84:14 - first impression on many of your new
84:16 - teammates if you have things you've been
84:18 - asked to complete make sure you're doing
84:20 - them in a timely manner be sure to stay
84:23 - responsive to emails coming from the
84:24 - team they'll be reaching out with a lot
84:26 - of requests and a lot of information and
84:28 - make sure you get back to them quickly
84:30 - and with everything they asked for you
84:32 - can also take this time to keep on up
84:34 - keep up on any company news right and
84:36 - it's a good chance to start connecting
84:38 - with your new colleagues on LinkedIn
84:41 - awesome so part two getting started
84:44 - so now you've done all the prep work
84:45 - you're ready to start these are some
84:48 - things you can think about on day 1 and
84:50 - week 1 most importantly embrace the
84:54 - challenge I know we've talked a lot
84:55 - about how this is a new experience for
84:57 - many of us just know we're all kind of
85:00 - in the same boat starting a new job is
85:02 - exciting but it can be daunting and it
85:05 - may feel like remote onboarding is gonna
85:06 - be awkward but recognize that everyone
85:08 - else is in the same boat well it's a new
85:11 - experience for you it's also very likely
85:13 - a new experience for the team that's
85:14 - bringing you on know that it might take
85:16 - time for you to feel comfortable and try
85:18 - and be gentle with yourself and patient
85:20 - with yourself in the meantime ultimately
85:22 - just remember that it's gonna be a great
85:23 - learning experience for everyone so even
85:27 - though you've already tested your
85:28 - settings nothing's perfect so be ready
85:31 - to troubleshoot know some basics like
85:33 - where your Wi-Fi router is how to reset
85:36 - it and try not to let tech issues
85:38 - fluster you they happen to everyone
85:40 - especially on your first day if you
85:42 - can't solve it on your own don't
85:43 - hesitate to reach out for help be ready
85:48 - to talk about yourself and your
85:50 - experiences you might feel like the
85:52 - interview is over but there are plenty
85:54 - of people in the office that you haven't
85:55 - met yet your team is gonna want to get
85:57 - to know you
85:57 - be prepared to talk about what you've
85:59 - done in the past and walk through your
86:00 - experiences it's always a good idea to
86:02 - have a personal elevator pitch about
86:04 - yourself or a few fun facts for their
86:06 - ICO Academy in one of my favorite
86:08 - traditions is something we call in for
86:09 - vex once every two weeks we ask our
86:12 - newest team members to come in and
86:13 - create a presentation to share with the
86:15 - team in our intro decks we usually ask
86:17 - people to share things like their role
86:18 - what we can expect from them here
86:20 - background info like their career path
86:22 - school where they've lived in the past
86:24 - we ask them to tell us a little bit
86:26 - about their families
86:27 - fun facts some hobbies and finally and
86:29 - most importantly their process and their
86:31 - purpose in Trebek's give us a lot of
86:34 - insight into who our co-workers are as
86:35 - people it also gives us an easy way to
86:37 - find common ground or a new conversation
86:39 - topic while this is something we do as a
86:42 - company here this is something you could
86:44 - take and adapt in a modified way for
86:45 - yourself right think about these topics
86:47 - and have answers ready to go and use
86:49 - them as icebreakers when you're
86:51 - introducing yourself to new co-workers
86:54 - you should take the time to meet your IT
86:56 - manager or IT Help Desk on your first
86:58 - day that way if you have any issues you
87:00 - already have a contact that can help you
87:03 - you should try and meet HR on your first
87:05 - day as well they can be a great resource
87:06 - if you have any questions about payroll
87:08 - benefits or anything else they can also
87:11 - help point you in the right direction if
87:13 - you have any other questions that need
87:15 - to be answered absolutely also get to
87:19 - know your stakeholders right who are the
87:21 - people who are going to be most
87:22 - important for you to meet quickly you're
87:24 - gonna want to find opportunities to
87:25 - connect with all of your new team
87:26 - members but in our current era of remote
87:29 - work without an office and the organic
87:30 - meet and great opportunities that come
87:32 - from a shared break room bumping into
87:34 - people in the elevator Bank or even
87:36 - walking past someone in the hallway this
87:38 - should really be an area of special
87:39 - focus in your first week or two new
87:42 - hires are often really surprised by how
87:44 - many connections they should focus on
87:45 - making within their first week or so but
87:47 - a good rule of thumb is to aim for 2020
87:50 - I know it sounds like a lot but just
87:52 - think about how many people you now have
87:55 - really quick relationships with that you
87:57 - can ask a question - or I can find out
88:00 - more about the company and use those
88:01 - resources a question we get a lot is how
88:04 - do you identify who those people are how
88:07 - do you find out who
88:08 - most important to me fast think about
88:10 - doing things like asking your manager
88:12 - the onboarding team or a recruiter you
88:14 - met during the interview process you
88:16 - could also take the time to review an
88:17 - org chart and see what roles you think
88:19 - you'll interact with most often most
88:21 - importantly don't hesitate to reach out
88:23 - to your new co-workers via chat or email
88:25 - just put on virtual coffee meetings on
88:28 - the calendar and get to know them you
88:29 - can ask them things like what do they
88:32 - need from you how is your being at the
88:35 - company going to impact their role how
88:36 - can you support them you might also want
88:39 - to ask them how they'll know if you're
88:40 - doing a good job you can use that as a
88:42 - barometer for your own success
88:43 - especially right now like you've seen
88:46 - ELISA doing it can also be important to
88:48 - ask about any constraints they might
88:49 - have on their work-life or what their
88:51 - situation is at home so many people have
88:53 - had major schedule disruptions while
88:55 - dealing with Kofi 19 things like child
88:58 - care new home offices so it's important
89:01 - to kind of just get in their world to
89:02 - make sure you understand also come
89:08 - prepared with questions for your new
89:09 - manager ask them things like what will
89:12 - success look like for you during your
89:14 - onboarding period what do you need to
89:17 - know in your first week your first month
89:19 - okay is there any weird jargon or things
89:22 - you might need to know about the company
89:23 - any terms that they might want to help
89:25 - you define is their background or
89:28 - industry knowledge that you should get
89:29 - up to speed on what are the most
89:31 - important slack groups email groups that
89:33 - you should be a part of and most
89:35 - importantly ask them how they like to be
89:37 - communicated with
89:38 - hey so many of us use so many different
89:41 - ways to get in touch with each other hey
89:43 - does your manager prefer to work over
89:45 - slack or chat do they like email when
89:47 - can you reach them and how should you
89:49 - respect your response also find out if
89:52 - your team has specific working hours
89:54 - recurring meetings or other team norms
89:56 - that you should be aware of awesome our
90:01 - last sections about getting settled what
90:03 - happens after you're in hey how do you
90:07 - get comfortable and really start to
90:08 - succeed in your new role don't hesitate
90:12 - to reach out to your new team for help
90:14 - or advice what do they wish they knew
90:16 - when they started what's the best piece
90:18 - of advice that they have for you they're
90:20 - a great resource for questions
90:22 - as they've been in your shoes before
90:25 - keep learning about the company right
90:29 - your knowledge about the company doesn't
90:31 - start doesn't stop in your first week
90:33 - right you're gonna have to keep building
90:34 - that up over time take every opportunity
90:36 - you can to learn about the business
90:37 - about his history and about any
90:40 - strategies plans or roadmaps the more
90:42 - info me you are the easier it is for you
90:44 - to connect the work you're doing back to
90:46 - the larger company mission you should
90:48 - also ask about what company-wide or
90:49 - Department metrics you should be looking
90:50 - at and learn where to find them and how
90:52 - to keep track of them for yourselves
90:54 - this part is fun
90:56 - you should check in with HR to find out
90:59 - if your company has any social or
91:00 - networking opportunities lined up at
91:02 - code ketamine we've been hosting daily
91:05 - remote lunches we've also started using
91:07 - a slack integration called donut to pair
91:10 - team members for smaller lunch meetings
91:12 - we also have themed tapi hours we've run
91:15 - live cooking demos remote game nights
91:17 - and we're planning a live art class our
91:19 - engineering team hosts bi-weekly
91:22 - lightning talks where members of the
91:24 - team have the opportunity to present on
91:26 - topics that interest them
91:28 - we also hosts a monthly demo event where
91:30 - the team shares projects that they've
91:32 - been working on over breakfast or lunch
91:35 - Thank You Maria so many companies have
91:37 - all these cool different opportunities
91:39 - they're creating during this time and if
91:42 - there is something you wanted to do that
91:44 - you're maybe your company isn't giving
91:45 - yet try suggesting it right come up with
91:48 - an idea and present that back to the HR
91:50 - office team and give them something new
91:52 - to try we also suggest you check in with
91:55 - your manager on progress and
91:57 - expectations don't wait to be given
91:59 - feedback while many companies run
92:02 - regular performance review cycles to
92:03 - give you insight into how you're doing
92:05 - it can help to actively seek out and ask
92:07 - for feedback in between those things
92:08 - request feedback on a project or check
92:11 - in with your manager or appear on how
92:12 - it's been going for them right remember
92:14 - that feedback is an opportunity for
92:16 - development so take everything everyone
92:18 - gives you in and just try and use that
92:20 - to help you grow lastly share your
92:23 - feedback about your experience if you
92:26 - you know you have a great opportunity to
92:28 - impact the experience of every person
92:30 - who joins a new company after you use
92:32 - that opportunity please share what works
92:34 - well for you be open and
92:35 - about what doesn't and as you go on in
92:38 - your role remember that yeah remember
92:41 - that it was hard when you started and
92:42 - make yourself available to offer advice
92:44 - or welcoming words to all the future
92:45 - newbies behind you we are ready for Q&A
92:50 - ELISA wonderful thank you um we can yeah
93:00 - there we go we can probably make
93:02 - ourselves really big okay so thank you
93:05 - for that it was really informative and
93:08 - as somebody who works not on your team
93:12 - but actually receives the benefit of
93:15 - working with you that's all really
93:17 - accurate and true and I just super
93:19 - appreciate the work that you all do on a
93:22 - regular basis thank you thank you
93:24 - before hopping into a Q&A box and once
93:29 - you also thank everybody who sent in
93:31 - some questions for Carrie and Maria um
93:34 - quick plug for what we have coming next
93:37 - we have a panel of learners showing up
93:40 - actually who these are people who've
93:43 - actually learned with code Academy and
93:45 - then got a job after so they're gonna be
93:47 - around in about ten minutes to talk with
93:51 - you all about what it's like now to
93:55 - actually like have this job working
93:57 - remotely so cool for them excited for
94:01 - them for right now we're with Cara Maria
94:03 - and I really like this question that
94:06 - came in from Thomas Chang Thomas is
94:07 - killing it with the questions today has
94:09 - a new hire asks any new questions that
94:13 - you've gone like oh that's really good
94:16 - we're gonna add that to the onboarding
94:18 - process so I guess the question is more
94:20 - like are you building the onboarding
94:24 - process around the experience of working
94:26 - with new hires awesome question Thomas
94:30 - the short answer is every day that
94:32 - happens the long answer is it happens so
94:35 - many times I couldn't even tell you what
94:36 - the what the questions are anymore I can
94:39 - I think that question about how to
94:42 - communicate appropriately with your
94:43 - manager how to expect feedback from them
94:45 - which channels they use is actually
94:48 - something I picked up
94:49 - new hire along the way so that is one
94:51 - example I also think that it's important
94:54 - to note the onboarding process is never
94:56 - finished we're always constantly
94:58 - re-evaluating it constantly changing it
95:00 - and even as we go from week to week
95:02 - we're adding in all the new things we
95:04 - learned last week great thank you
95:10 - we got a question from brandy it was
95:13 - mentioned that it might be common for
95:15 - new co-workers or for employers to ask
95:17 - about your family our get to know you
95:20 - what if you're like I'm not really
95:22 - comfortable sharing about like your
95:25 - personal stuff
95:26 - you don't have to feel free to not share
95:30 - it's something you may want to do is if
95:32 - someone asks right and you are not
95:33 - comfortable with that have something
95:34 - prepared to steer the conversation
95:35 - somewhere else okay it can be an easy
95:38 - thing for you to do to kind of change
95:39 - the topic and talk about something you
95:41 - do want to talk about maybe you steer
95:43 - that back to you a work experience right
95:44 - or how you want to learn to interact
95:46 - with that person maybe you can focus on
95:48 - the things you're doing in your job I
95:50 - talked about perhaps if you don't want
95:52 - to talk about what's going on at home
95:54 - maybe you can talk about how working
95:55 - from home has been going right maybe
95:57 - talk about what your new challenges are
95:59 - and your office space or all the
96:01 - different things that have come up in
96:03 - your day-to-day and you control the
96:05 - conversation and you don't have to share
96:07 - anything you're uncomfortable with and
96:08 - largely your team will respect that
96:11 - definitely you can use the questions
96:15 - that we listed in the intro deck portion
96:17 - which is what we use like a presentation
96:19 - that new team members use to introduce
96:21 - themselves to the company and those are
96:24 - some good icebreakers you know you can
96:26 - weed out the things that you're not
96:28 - comfortable talking about and maybe
96:30 - steer the conversation towards your
96:31 - hobbies or something like that
96:35 - I love it thank you both very much for
96:38 - that so this one I think is actually
96:42 - really this is a cool question coming
96:44 - from Tanner tinsel and I think this is
96:47 - cool because of the culture that we have
96:50 - at code Academy and this what are the
96:54 - tools and things that introverted
96:57 - colleagues can do to stay active and
96:59 - social virtually and I I mean like you
97:03 - both know that I'm just like I were
97:05 - introvert across my forehead like this
97:08 - whoa that's a surprise
97:12 - Kari really oh yes oh yes same with me
97:16 - believe it or not it's definitely a
97:19 - barrier to break down and doing things
97:22 - virtually canned you know sometimes make
97:24 - things easier or harder for certain
97:26 - personality types yeah okay so like what
97:29 - are the tools then let's say we have to
97:33 - stay active socially virtually
97:36 - absolutely something that Randall says a
97:38 - lot sticks with me at coke Adam II were
97:41 - a culture and introverts which may seem
97:43 - surprising because we're putting so much
97:44 - of what we do out into the world and
97:46 - we're so focused on making connections
97:47 - and within our networks with our
97:50 - learners with all the people we're
97:51 - affecting it but apparently we are
97:54 - introverted by nature right so we are
97:57 - finding tools and we are creating new
97:58 - opportunities to kind of do those things
98:00 - on smaller scale and if you're not
98:02 - comfortable speaking up in a big meeting
98:03 - or jumping in right away to like a large
98:06 - lunch table or something like that take
98:08 - an opportunity to meet one co-worker it
98:11 - spend time with an individual get to
98:12 - know them a little more closely maybe
98:14 - have them introduce you to a few people
98:16 - they know and start to build up those
98:17 - relationships more slowly try to focus
98:21 - on the quality of the relationship
98:22 - instead of the quantity in that case we
98:26 - also recommend trying to do things that
98:28 - might push you just a little bit out of
98:29 - your comfort zone take the opportunity
98:31 - to reach out to someone and say hello
98:33 - it's simple hello does go a long way
98:35 - because suddenly you have a connection
98:36 - you don't need to have whole
98:38 - conversation but taking a moment to just
98:39 - introduce yourself and say hello this is
98:42 - who I am this is what I do
98:44 - suddenly this person now knows you and
98:47 - you have a place to go if you do need
98:49 - them
98:49 - have a question in the future and you
98:51 - didn't have to spend a kind of time
98:52 - interacting with them or trying to have
98:55 - conversations that maybe you weren't
98:56 - ready for
98:57 - I think slack has been a very helpful
98:59 - tool for us in particular because I
99:02 - think you get to jump into conversations
99:05 - where you feel comfortable and you can
99:06 - step back where you may not yet be ready
99:08 - to participate and that lets you back to
99:10 - supply in them all we have all these
99:12 - slack channels for hobbies so like a
99:15 - slack channel for gardening or video
99:18 - gaming there's one for Animal Crossing
99:20 - that just started so you can find a
99:23 - place where you're comfortable sharing
99:25 - your hobbies and that'll help you like
99:27 - branch out feel a little bit more
99:28 - comfortable I love it thank you so much
99:32 - I've mentioned a couple times even like
99:35 - my role as community manager is one that
99:40 - I think I'm molded into because I'm so
99:44 - much more chatty online like in flag or
99:50 - even just in our forums it can be a
99:52 - really nice way to I think build
99:55 - connections with other people that is
99:58 - totally virtual and it fits this world
100:01 - that we're in right now this is this is
100:07 - a cool question I think again along the
100:09 - lines of culture what are some soft
100:13 - skills fist questions from mark on some
100:15 - soft skills that you've seen that when
100:19 - somebody really exhibits them it makes
100:21 - them quite successful and like their
100:23 - first few weeks of getting to eat yeah
100:27 - and I use the term soft skills but I'm
100:30 - very happy to be corrected um
100:36 - I don't mind the term soft skills but I
100:38 - am gonna kind of think of this question
100:39 - a little bit of a different frame so the
100:42 - first thing that comes to mind right
100:43 - away from me is one of our core
100:45 - codecademy values and that's thinking
100:47 - deeply I think that's very much any what
100:50 - we consider here to be a soft skill and
100:52 - to us that means that you're putting a
100:55 - ton of focus into what you're doing
100:57 - right and you're producing something
100:59 - that can be that is incredibly well
101:02 - thought out and that
101:03 - can be picked apart and pulled apart and
101:04 - people can dig into the ask questions
101:07 - right and it just shows that you're
101:08 - putting in a lot of depth and thought
101:10 - into what you're doing as a company we
101:13 - tend not to fly by the seat of our pants
101:14 - and I think that's a major soft skill
101:17 - that people can bring in is just the
101:18 - ability to think deeply and to focus and
101:20 - present their thoughts in a way that
101:23 - helps helps make it clear being
101:27 - proactive is definitely important we
101:31 - have like a timeline for how we onboard
101:33 - people's when we send out their welcome
101:35 - package when we request other
101:36 - information and it's always great to see
101:38 - new hires reaching out to us being like
101:41 - okay so when is when is the next step
101:43 - what can I expect or trying to make
101:46 - connections with their future co-workers
101:48 - their LinkedIn or just just being
101:51 - proactive in general it definitely helps
101:54 - this is wonderful thank you so much is
101:59 - there wait we have like a minute and a
102:02 - half laughter so is there anything else
102:03 - that's come up for you Carrie and Maria
102:06 - in this conversation that you think that
102:09 - you'd like to share with everyone that's
102:13 - a good question and not an easy one and
102:16 - I think for me the biggest takeaway is
102:20 - to really just recognize that your
102:23 - experience is going to be unique to you
102:24 - right and you should focus on the things
102:26 - that are going to make it feel most
102:27 - comfortable for you if there is advice
102:30 - out there and it doesn't sit right or
102:32 - maybe you want to try something a little
102:34 - bit differently it focus on how it's
102:36 - going to create the best experience for
102:38 - you and how it's gonna show up joining
102:39 - team and don't be nervous
102:45 - everyone that's already at the company
102:46 - has been through this process they
102:48 - remember what it's like and you know
102:51 - speaking for codecademy everyone here is
102:53 - so so friendly when we have new team
102:56 - members step in the door everyone's
102:57 - ready to greet them so just know that
103:00 - people have been in your shoes before it
103:02 - can relax yeah that's that's super
103:07 - important and I think applicable across
103:09 - so many areas of lives it's like
103:11 - somebody's done this before
103:13 - okay okay thank you so so so much
103:19 - let's bring the snobs the virtual
103:21 - applause for Kerry and Maria there's
103:25 - there are some more questions that came
103:27 - through in the Q&A box so ladies if you
103:29 - have a chance come join us
103:30 - America where what is the term room like
103:33 - a jungle trying to get through those
103:34 - right now oh I see I see the gratitude
103:37 - coming through for you thank you thank
103:40 - you everyone
103:41 - next we have a panel of code Academy
103:47 - learners we decided actually that that
103:53 - we were going to go through with our
103:55 - people team and our talent team what
103:58 - it's like to put together a resume what
104:00 - it's like to interview online what it's
104:03 - like to actually start and then in
104:06 - thinking about it I was like yeah and
104:09 - there's this opportunity to make it real
104:13 - and maybe we can show and share what
104:17 - it's like to have been a learner who has
104:21 - gone through this whole experience and
104:24 - is is living it and this actually is
104:27 - working online so we're gonna give a few
104:30 - minutes to our guests today we have with

104:58 - everybody knows the gist here is let's
105:02 - let's hear from this team of people who
105:05 - are all working remotely in technical
105:07 - roles you all at some point have learned
105:10 - on code Academy I think what is so
105:12 - brilliant is that some of you are still
105:15 - coming back and learning more on cook
105:17 - heavy and oh if you can see the chat
105:20 - team people are saying hi to you so just
105:25 - some reminders for how the rest
105:27 - this is gonna go we're gonna spend 10 15
105:30 - minutes on some questions that I've
105:33 - prepared for this team of learners and
105:35 - then we're gonna turn it over to the
105:38 - audience and that's you all on the line
105:42 - and we're still going to be using that
105:44 - Q&A box just another reminder that if
105:49 - there is something that you want to ask
105:52 - it is it responding to in the Q&A box
105:55 - there's the four ups there's a code kami
105:58 - forms that discuss duck code Academy
105:59 - calm I'm super grateful that we've seen
106:03 - some of them actually you folks here we
106:06 - have on line with us answering questions
106:08 - there I am super excited to get started
106:11 - and we will get started by doing some
106:13 - intros I'm gonna go around in the order
106:16 - that I see you all so let's start with
106:21 - crystal what how are you what's going on
106:24 - at home and what's your day job like
106:27 - right now well crystal you're so muted
106:32 - yeah music me again for some reason how
106:38 - I was I'm doing well I've been working
106:41 - remotely for I think six weeks now and
106:43 - it's um it's going okay my dolls are
106:47 - happy so um Maya fern went completely
106:51 - removed a month ago with only necessary
106:54 - people inside and my part-time job also
106:58 - went remote so basically teaching
107:01 - students via zoom so I'm still I'm still
107:08 - getting used to it I think just going
107:11 - from because I went to the office four
107:13 - days a week and on the one day I work
107:15 - from home it was usually like babies I
107:17 - ran chores and stuff but I think it's
107:21 - just trying to get my work space
107:22 - situated that's then you know the most
107:25 - unique part of it but other than that
107:31 - like I think it's more been trying to
107:33 - support the other people who are trying
107:34 - to be remote right now and so I think
107:38 - we're almost at the point where they're
107:40 - used to it and
107:41 - but I live in Georgia which everyone
107:44 - probably knows they're trying to reopen
107:45 - the state my office has not said
107:49 - anything about it but I'm not sure how
107:52 - it's going to work yet
107:53 - but it's just we support all over the
107:56 - country though so I don't know if that
107:58 - means anything different for me though
108:00 - yeah like that's just like baseline for
108:08 - all of us right now that shrug emoji
108:13 - okay thanks
108:15 - we'll go to Tatiana in just a second I
108:18 - just want to share heads up that Randall
108:22 - and Madison and Emma will be joining us
108:25 - for the Q&A for the open Q&A section of
108:29 - this segment so we will keep going now
108:33 - with some intros for learners Tatiana
108:36 - how you doing what's home like right now
108:38 - what's your day job hi I'm speaking from
108:44 - Brazil
108:46 - my job is tagging I've been working as a
108:50 - dedicate or for five years now
108:53 - completely removed all this time soon so
108:56 - my day job didn't change a lot but my
109:01 - personal life did I well I was caught in
109:05 - the middle of the transition six months
109:09 - ago all this started I moved home moved
109:15 - back with my parents after I'm going out
109:20 - like nine-year relationship and then I
109:26 - moved to são Paulo like really big city
109:29 - and when I just got my own shoe box
109:32 - there you know like at least that lives
109:36 - in New York you know how this is I found
109:40 - my shoe box there and but it wasn't
109:43 - fully furnished so I came back to my
109:45 - parents house left my all my work stuff
109:48 - there like my work chair and every
109:51 - things so I'm having to yeah I think
109:56 - adapting is the name of the game and how
110:00 - are you and what's home like right now
110:03 - and what's your day job yeah so I am a
110:07 - WordPress web developer I've been with
110:10 - the company for about three years and
110:11 - the last two of those three years have
110:14 - been remote so I started in office and
110:16 - then moved across the country and so
110:19 - I've been working from home for like two
110:21 - years but not like this so we have a
110:27 - toddler and we have a nanny that helps
110:29 - out some days and I'd love to work from
110:32 - coffee shops and I have a co-working
110:34 - membership and so this is definitely
110:37 - different to say the least and so my
110:40 - husband is home with our child now and
110:42 - I'm at home like I can't go anywhere so
110:46 - I have a desk good I have like a home
110:48 - set up but being confined to my house is
110:53 - it's very very different so even though
110:57 - I've been working from home and it
111:00 - doesn't feel like it feels like I still
111:02 - left a job in a way if that makes sense
111:05 - yeah that's real that makes sense
111:08 - thank you for sharing Pablo your your
111:11 - next step
111:12 - what's home like are you doing what's
111:16 - your day job hi my name is Pablo choice
111:19 - I live in the Tampa Florida area um my
111:24 - current role is software engineering
111:26 - manager at AI canals the whole company's
111:30 - remote I've been working with them for
111:32 - almost two years so for me it's no
111:35 - different basically like you said in the
111:39 - previous session I'm also a bit of an
111:41 - introvert so I try to go to a coffee
111:44 - shop every now and then just to mix it
111:46 - up but most of the time I'm just here so
111:48 - nothing has really changed
111:50 - aside from I just have more work
111:55 - yeah it's a it's funny to see how
111:58 - workloads have done this over the last
112:02 - few weeks okay thank you I'm gonna get
112:05 - started with the set of like preset
112:08 - questions that I have for you all and
112:10 - then it already see some questions
112:12 - coming through via chat and via the Q&A
112:14 - just a reminder for everybody please put
112:18 - them in the Q&A section because that's
112:20 - where we'll be able to get to them
112:22 - big thanks to Andrew Boland and
112:25 - Christopher Klein because I've already
112:26 - seen your questions coming through
112:27 - that's very nice so this is just to all
112:32 - of you and we can do this by like who
112:36 - unmutes that's how we can is I'm not
112:39 - gonna like pick on anybody
112:41 - where does code Academy fit in your
112:43 - learning journey is that where is where
112:45 - you started it was coke added me where
112:47 - you came about like halfway through do
112:48 - you still visit click at me to learn new
112:50 - things tell us I feel like I'm a mix of
112:57 - all of that I'd kind of just like played
113:01 - around on coke Adam II for fun like
113:02 - years before I got into this my
113:04 - background was in marketing and
113:06 - communications and I had lots of
113:09 - WordPress experience and like plug-ins
113:12 - and themes and clicking buttons to make
113:14 - stuff happen and then I realized there
113:17 - are things that you can do that are way
113:19 - more powerful if you know how to code it
113:21 - or just edit and manipulate the code and
113:24 - so for me I like dough deep into a code
113:28 - Kadim eCourse right after my son was
113:30 - born and that was like a big turning
113:33 - point and so I got my job like right as
113:36 - I finished that course but I still find
113:39 - myself coming back because I think oh
113:41 - here's a new thing that I need to learn
113:43 - or here's something I haven't
113:44 - encountered before like I wonder if Coke
113:46 - Adam II has a lesson on that so I feel
113:49 - like my answer is like D all of the
113:50 - above there I need to include that every
113:55 - time is there anybody else want to share
114:00 - I'm like where Luke Adam if it's a
114:02 - crystal I see that you're unmuted yeah I
114:05 - forgot to mention I'm a software
114:06 - engineer so but when I
114:09 - during Codecademy I was a help desk
114:11 - analyst NIT and so it was one of those
114:15 - things where some of the things we had
114:17 - to do we had to do in HTML and I wanted
114:20 - to delve deeper into it to where HTML
114:22 - and CSS and JavaScript and then it just
114:26 - kind of went on from there you know I
114:28 - started running nose in jQuery and I'm
114:33 - someone that when I'm bored I like to
114:35 - learn new things
114:36 - and so you know Proterra me like kept
114:39 - adding classes I kept taking it's
114:41 - basically where it was and so I started
114:53 - in incorporating some of the stuff I
114:55 - learned on coding care and put my job
114:56 - like sequel and JavaScript and it
115:00 - actually helped me build up to learn you
115:02 - know other languages like PowerShell
115:04 - because you're not like once you learn
115:06 - basic syntax it's kind of easier to pick
115:09 - it up for other things and so today I
115:13 - still go on code Academy to refresh on
115:15 - certain things but also just you know
115:17 - see what's there I like I have tracks
115:20 - now like computer science data science
115:22 - stuff like that that really helps you
115:24 - know focus you know which way I want to
115:27 - go so great thank you
115:32 - I'm going to skip ahead
115:37 - Susa the thing that I think that you all
115:39 - can like give a lot of color on and
115:42 - maybe this is something that we can hear
115:43 - from every each one of you on is how to
115:46 - design your work from home space like we
115:49 - heard from we heard from Maria and carry
115:52 - on like how to get settled into your new
115:55 - job but like what's been working for you
115:58 - long term and maybe do a little compare
116:01 - contrast to like what that means now
116:05 - that like you can't leave your house
116:08 - I see Pablo you're unmuted okay
116:12 - yeah for me again it was a little bit
116:14 - different because they said this is kind
116:16 - of normal for me but the main thing is
116:19 - just being comfortable like I am
116:22 - comfortable standing up
116:23 - I can tell I have a standing desk so
116:26 - everything is within reach like I have
116:28 - three monitors to see everything I need
116:31 - to see I love music so I have good
116:35 - speakers here my bass is over here so if
116:38 - I'm feeling like distracted or whatever
116:40 - or if it's my lunch break I'll just grab
116:42 - the base plate for a little bit and come
116:44 - back to work I always have something
116:47 - candy to grab I need to have something
116:49 - my hand so there's always everything I
116:52 - need is always here in my desk and I
116:56 - also have worked out a lot so I just
116:58 - have a standard routine for stretching
117:01 - that helps my back it helps my posture
117:05 - so it's just a bunch of little random
117:08 - fitness equipment here
117:09 - and it's just a lot of discipline I
117:13 - sometimes you say oh my god it's only 11
117:17 - o'clock I found so much already and have
117:19 - so much to do sometimes it's oh my god
117:21 - it's already 3:00 p.m. and the day just
117:23 - went by and I still have a lot of stuff
117:25 - to do so it's just like a regular job
117:27 - basically in that sense but as long as
117:30 - you have as long as you're comfortable
117:32 - with where you are you don't have to
117:35 - fiddle or move your chair or anything
117:37 - like that just find a good space that
117:39 - actually works for you yeah I'd say good
117:47 - my answer six months ago would be
117:49 - completely different because I had like
117:52 - an office space at home and now I'm in
117:58 - this transition so I definitely agree
118:02 - with Pablo that you need to be
118:05 - comfortable and that's something I'm
118:07 - aiming in the future I'm just winging it
118:11 - [Laughter]
118:14 - but I say try different things if you're
118:18 - allowed to like in my case I have
118:22 - flexible hours I work full-time and it's
118:27 - fully remote but I can choose when I
118:30 - work I have to fulfill 40 hours a week
118:33 - but I can still like work during the
118:37 - if I want to I'm not in that person but
118:40 - I'm more of a morning person but um in
118:44 - my case I was able to during this five
118:46 - years to try a lot of different setups
118:49 - and and find a lot of things during the
118:52 - way like for example do I like to work
118:55 - with music on or I don't do I need to
119:00 - get out of the house in order to I don't
119:05 - know to turn the switch on and so it
119:09 - depends a lot and I would say like try
119:12 - try a different thing it thinks
119:15 - experiment and find out about yourself
119:19 - yeah that makes good sense
119:22 - thank you and I see your immediate yeah
119:25 - I so agree with that trying different
119:27 - things I'll preface all this by saying
119:30 - that I'm a ninny agreement seven which
119:31 - is like a whole other conversation but
119:35 - knowing yourself and knowing your
119:37 - personality and knowing like and you're
119:39 - only gonna know by trying but figuring
119:42 - out what you like and what's important
119:44 - to you I think there's so much value in
119:46 - that so like for me I really care about
119:50 - the aesthetic of things and I just care
119:53 - about visual design and so yes I need a
119:56 - chair that's comfortable to sit in all
119:58 - day but I also need a chair that's gonna
120:00 - look pretty in my house am I you know in
120:02 - my like work set up because that's
120:04 - inspiring to me and there are times when
120:08 - I want two monitors because I've got
120:10 - multiple different browsers and sizes
120:12 - and things going on and I want to be
120:13 - able to like see it all and adjust it
120:15 - all but there are times where I'm good
120:17 - with just my laptop like how did a
120:19 - coffee shop like as long as I have a
120:21 - plug to connect to I would rather be
120:23 - surrounded by people than have you know
120:27 - like the perfect setup tech wise and so
120:31 - like one thing I learned about myself is
120:33 - that I love to start my day out
120:36 - somewhere and then come home and so
120:38 - that's just kind of you know something
120:42 - that I've like worked into my schedule
120:43 - because I found that I work really well
120:45 - that way and then I think too just being
120:49 - okay with it changing
120:50 - season two season and so you know I have
120:54 - some like chronic health issues and so
120:56 - like these past few weeks have been
120:57 - really hard and that way and I've
120:59 - started my day later and I've worked
121:02 - after we put the little one in bed and I
121:05 - to him like lucky to have flexible hours
121:06 - like that and as long as I get you know
121:08 - my 40 hours my full time my list done
121:11 - but being like this is what I need in
121:14 - this season and this is what's going to
121:15 - work for me and it may not be the same
121:17 - in the next season but I'll try
121:21 - something different when that time comes
121:25 - crystal did you have anything to add
121:31 - probably just the same that everyone
121:34 - else was done I think for me since I
121:36 - didn't work remotely much before and I
121:41 - had to kind of get my setup different
121:44 - because when I work from home once a day
121:46 - you know I might be at the dining room
121:47 - table or something so I had to make sure
121:50 - a desk and I had to get an extra monitor
121:52 - and you know a chair that was
121:54 - comfortable because I have issues with
121:56 - my back and sounds like that but also
121:58 - I'm an introvert in heart however you
122:02 - know I still need to get up and move
122:04 - around and go outside so I walk the dogs
122:06 - in the neighborhood or I might go out
122:08 - for coffee or something but I don't have
122:09 - flexible hours you know I'm basically
122:11 - eight five everyday and then with my
122:14 - part-time job you know it's night and
122:16 - Saturdays so I just have to try to fit
122:21 - well I'm at home I want to be stuff play
122:23 - I still have to work so but for me you
122:27 - know I need to make sure I take a break
122:29 - from it you know walk away for 10
122:31 - minutes every few hours or something or
122:33 - I'll stay here for eight hours straight
122:34 - working so I think that's it's also
122:38 - easier that I don't have children or
122:40 - anyone to distract me so you know like
122:43 - work is my distraction I guess so I just
122:45 - saw a dog goes through the back you know
122:47 - yeah yeah they're gonna be really
122:49 - running around efficient distractors um
122:53 - I decided to be Oh tell me in or just
122:56 - say one thing I would add is that if you
122:58 - are working from home right now like
122:59 - whatever your job is don't necessarily
123:03 - assume that the way that things are
123:04 - right now is the way that working from
123:06 - home has to look for you outside of this
123:10 - time brain obviously this time frame you
123:12 - can't change a lot but usually that's
123:14 - not how it is so yeah that's a that's a
123:18 - solid segue into the next question that
123:21 - I have and the final question actually
123:22 - that I have before we open up to Q&A and
123:26 - this one is optional not everybody has
123:28 - to answer this but if there's something
123:30 - that you would change or bring up or
123:36 - some conversation that you would have in
123:38 - your interview if you were interviewing
123:40 - for your current job right now with
123:44 - everything that's going on in the world
123:46 - is there one thing in particular like
123:48 - would you bring up that like hey I
123:50 - actually do need flexible hours because
123:54 - no no yeah maybe I stole a really good
123:58 - example but if there's something that
123:59 - you would bring up if you were
124:01 - interviewing with a company for your
124:04 - current job but with all the
124:06 - circumstances right now
124:11 - ah I can start like actually right now
124:15 - we are hiring and I am interviewing
124:18 - people so the things that I look for
124:20 - because these people are working remote
124:22 - usually in other countries is the first
124:26 - thing is share your video we have had we
124:30 - haven't had good experiences with people
124:32 - who don't share their video and we those
124:35 - that we have higher and even after
124:37 - higher they don't share their video
124:39 - eventually they just went away because
124:42 - they weren't a good fit so in my
124:44 - experience you don't have to share
124:46 - anything specific you don't have to show
124:48 - that yes I have experience working from
124:51 - home or I have this laptop or a half
124:53 - this monitor like to me that does really
124:55 - matter as long as you're a good fit
124:58 - personality wise then you'll make the
125:02 - team so it's more about showing your
125:04 - your real personality and obviously in
125:06 - your technical skills they're gonna ask
125:08 - you questions about it but it's mostly
125:11 - just be about being yourself and also be
125:15 - smart like if you have to share your
125:16 - screen don't have Facebook don't have
125:19 - YouTube or anything like that like even
125:21 - if I haven't seen something that's
125:23 - really really bad but if I'm if you're
125:27 - sharing your screen with me and I'm
125:28 - looking at the application that we're
125:30 - working on I don't want to see your
125:31 - Facebook feed next to it or your YouTube
125:33 - like yes I use YouTube to have music in
125:37 - the background but have it in a
125:39 - different browser so just be smart about
125:41 - what you have and what you're sharing if
125:48 - I see an you yeah I think if I were
125:53 - interviewing right now the question that
125:55 - I would ask is like how are we gonna
125:57 - stay connected one during this time and
126:00 - two in general so we're gonna small team
126:03 - it's just me and my boss but it's really
126:05 - important that we are on the same page
126:07 - and so you know for us that looks like a
126:09 - Monday morning call and I fly out to
126:12 - Colorado you know four or five times a
126:14 - year
126:15 - which we can't do right now but I would
126:18 - ask like how do we stay connected as it
126:20 - slack is it this is it that and then how
126:24 - does that look different
126:25 - outside of our current situation great
126:30 - yeah thank you okay
126:34 - we are time is flying and I think we're
126:40 - ready now for some Q&A from all of our
126:43 - audience I'd like to if you can hear me
126:46 - Randall Emma Madison or listen turn the
126:52 - video on showing us back hi hello
126:58 - everyone how's the afternoon bin or
127:01 - how's the morning been for you I think
127:05 - it's gone really good tell us in the
127:08 - chat how the morning has been give us
127:10 - some give us some feedback
127:12 - yeah and I'd also asked early on I'm
127:15 - gonna want to know what everyone's one
127:17 - major thing they're gonna do is so if
127:20 - everyone wants to throw that into the
127:21 - chat - that would be great
127:26 - I'm hearing some New York City coming
127:28 - from somebody else that was probably
127:29 - random yeah yeah you're a few
127:33 - neighborhoods over from me okay thank
127:37 - you so much all right so Randall Emma
127:40 - and Madison have joined us for this
127:42 - section where we're going to take some
127:44 - questions actually for the learner panel
127:46 - so we'd love to hear from from you all
127:49 - and Tatiana crystal and Pablo but if
127:53 - there's anything that MI Randall in
127:55 - Madison can add they'll hop in with that
127:58 - - oh right so I actually love this
128:03 - question from Amy because it's for
128:06 - everybody who you see on the screen
128:09 - right now how do you ask about flexible
128:12 - hours in an interview without it coming
128:14 - across negatively so for any learners
128:17 - who asked about like how do I get those
128:18 - flexible hours for any of our talent
128:21 - team how do we do it
128:25 - um first so I definitely had this
128:28 - question asked many times and interviews
128:30 - so one recommendation might be to ask
128:35 - this question directly to maybe more of
128:37 - like
128:38 - manager and interviewer as opposed to
128:40 - maybe other people you meet on the panel
128:42 - you know folks that you might be working
128:43 - more closely with are working across
128:45 - functionally with you know just to kind
128:48 - of get some of this sort of says this is
128:50 - sort of like a question that you
128:51 - actually should ask you know you should
128:52 - be open to asking you know what flexible
128:55 - work hours might look like or what
128:56 - work-life balance is like and things
128:59 - like that too and I think this is one of
129:00 - those sort of like logistical questions
129:02 - that's very good for your hiring manager
129:04 - or your potential future manager rather
129:06 - or cruder or someone else on that side
129:09 - of the team we get these questions all
129:11 - the time so it's definitely not off-base
129:13 - to ask but I would maybe save that just
129:16 - as a recommendation there I save that
129:18 - for those folks on your interview panel
129:22 - great it didn't and or Tatiana when you
129:26 - were interviewing did you have to ask
129:27 - for flexible hours did you have to have
129:29 - that conversation or was it just sort of
129:31 - built-in so I started actually only
129:35 - working five hours a week and so at that
129:39 - point in time it was kind of we were
129:41 - just talking about what the expectation
129:42 - is is it do you want one hour but you
129:45 - want me to check in every single day
129:47 - meaning Monday through Friday I check
129:48 - the email I do my things I need to do or
129:51 - you know do you want me to check in
129:53 - every other day but you know two two and
129:55 - a half hours whatever that adds up to be
129:57 - and then time kind of went on and it
129:59 - evolved and I picked up more tasks and
130:02 - we we really just like discussed what's
130:06 - most important so Monday morning 9
130:09 - o'clock that's our team meeting that's
130:11 - like non-negotiable but because I we are
130:14 - such a small company I mean my boss was
130:17 - basically a freelancer before me so he
130:19 - had flexible hours he has kids like I
130:21 - have so I knew we were coming in with
130:23 - similar lifestyles but I think the most
130:26 - important thing as time went on and even
130:29 - from the beginning was just
130:31 - understanding like hey I am your
130:33 - employer like I am here because you're
130:35 - paying me to do things for you so what
130:39 - is it that you expect of me and then of
130:43 - course you know like there's part of
130:45 - that as like this is what I have to
130:46 - offer and this is what will work for me
130:48 - not just that they get to like demand
130:50 - what you do you know
130:52 - but finding that common ground of like
130:54 - this is what works really well for both
130:56 - of us thank you
131:00 - did you Andy yeah I just want to add
131:03 - that in my case it's a big project we
131:07 - have contributors all over the world and
131:10 - it was already designed to be flexible
131:13 - and remote when I joined so I didn't
131:17 - have to yeah to add one quick thing on
131:26 - there I think it's all about
131:28 - communication - I think just staying you
131:31 - know in touch with your team and your
131:32 - manager and you know continuing that
131:34 - conversation as you develop as Ann
131:36 - mentioned I think is super critical and
131:38 - for us to as a company that offers a bit
131:41 - of flexibility as far as working hours
131:43 - and things like that you know that's
131:44 - definitely the most important thing for
131:45 - us and what I communicate to candidates
131:47 - all the time is that communication is
131:49 - the most important as far as setting
131:50 - expectations and moving forward and I
131:54 - feel like that is a great segue into
131:58 - what will be our last question of the
132:01 - day for everybody I know time whew and
132:06 - this one is also a good one for
132:07 - absolutely everybody here because like
132:09 - we have the talent team and the people
132:11 - team who are yes hiring but also we're
132:15 - working and you all who've been doing
132:17 - this for a long time how do you manage
132:20 - your home life separately from your work
132:23 - life and I'm going to respond first by
132:28 - saying what is separate it's about home
132:31 - life integration right now that's that's
132:35 - that's my response I'm C ran I'm gonna
132:37 - I'm gonna go to Randall first because
132:39 - I'm seeing his wheels turn yeah now I
132:41 - mean it's look I have two kids and what
132:47 - I've been thinking about during all this
132:48 - times that this is such a stressful time
132:50 - to be a parent but it's also such a
132:53 - special time to be a parent at the exact
132:55 - same time I'm just going to be around
132:56 - your kids and but it's it is stressed
132:59 - because the work doesn't stop you need
133:01 - to make sure that things are happening
133:04 - [Music]
133:05 - and the way I think about it is
133:10 - definitely work-life integration take
133:13 - advantage of naps definitely but also I
133:16 - do think communicating with your
133:19 - managers I mean I've talked to my CEO
133:21 - Zack he knows that typically from around
133:24 - 6 to 8 it's gonna be really hard to get
133:26 - in touch with me for something that's
133:28 - emergency he knows exactly how to get in
133:30 - touch with me because I do need to be
133:32 - accessible but he you know we've have
133:34 - pretty clear conversations about what is
133:36 - and is not an emergency and you know
133:38 - just made clear look after APM I will do
133:42 - a lot of great work six data I want to
133:45 - be a dad yeah yeah for me coming goes
133:52 - back to discipline and just just being
133:57 - honest with people like I don't have
134:00 - kids but my my sister I shared the house
134:03 - with my sister Soho she has a baby if I
134:07 - need to pick her up from daycare I'll
134:08 - post in slack hey I'm five pick it up my
134:11 - knees everybody knows I'm out if they
134:14 - need me if there's something special
134:15 - they know they can tag me in slack I'll
134:18 - get out of my phone and I'll get back to
134:19 - them when I can but other than that it's
134:23 - just a regular balance like I make my
134:26 - own bread I'll step away 20 30 minutes
134:29 - I'll leave a message and slack afk 15
134:33 - afk 20 and I'll make up the time myself
134:35 - like nobody has to tell me hey you have
134:37 - to make up those 20 minutes I'll just do
134:39 - it I'll stay either late today or I'll
134:42 - come in early tomorrow so it's just
134:44 - about your discipline personal
134:47 - discipline oh yes I need to get stuff
134:49 - done but I also have a life so I'm not
134:52 - gonna put either one on hold just learn
134:55 - how to blend both of them just just say
135:04 - like it's being 5 years broken working
135:06 - from home and I've learned that you
135:09 - don't separate completely and there's no
135:12 - way to do it you
135:14 - I have to get used to having this small
135:21 - interferences from time to time I
135:23 - remember my first time we have like
135:26 - regular check-ups with with HR it is
135:31 - like perhaps the only time we have video
135:34 - meetings we usually communicate through
135:37 - email or chat hangouts and my first
135:42 - check checking with HR my cat just
135:47 - jumped into my screen and she was like
135:53 - oh let me see let me call my daughter
135:55 - because she loves cats part of things
136:01 - you know like you don't work from home
136:04 - and completely separate your personal
136:07 - life from that you know and I think that
136:11 - that's a great place to to leave this is
136:15 - that this is like we're all absolutely
136:17 - doing our best right now you know what
136:19 - no one was like no like having this
136:24 - interferences sometimes those bring
136:27 - between closer yeah that's here okay I'm
136:31 - just like a big disturbance right we we
136:39 - are about to wrap up is there any last
136:43 - things that anybody's like gonna burn if
136:45 - they don't share now would be the right
136:48 - time Oh Randall's always gonna burn if
136:50 - he can't share come on I actually just
136:52 - wanted I've watched all the interviews
136:56 - that Lisa's had with all of you so I
136:59 - feel like I'm I'm with a bunch of
137:01 - celebrities right now and it's just
137:03 - really really nice to hear your stories
137:05 - I just want to say that and it's been
137:08 - very nice to be able to share some of
137:10 - those also with some of the employees
137:12 - because that is that is what we if we
137:15 - don't always hear from you and we can
137:18 - get disconnected from what are we doing
137:20 - why are we showing up every day and it's
137:22 - just just a wonderful thing so thank you
137:24 - very much for sharing everything both
137:25 - here and other place you have it's just
137:27 - it's really
137:28 - interesting yeah thank you thank you
137:31 - Randall if it's a good point to
137:34 - reference that if you are a coke Adam
137:38 - ePro member you have access to Unicode
137:40 - Academy Pro community where an Tatyana
137:43 - Pablo crystal and others actually shared
137:46 - out and and answered a lot of the
137:49 - questions that you are asking in the Q&A
137:52 - right now about how they got started
137:53 - what they had to learn to get their job
137:55 - and what their what their journeys have
137:58 - looked like and so they've done an
138:00 - amazing job of sharing those stories and
138:02 - illustrating what it can look like for

equipped for a job search you learn in your current field or in a brand new one I am beside myself right now so excited to kick off with with our VP of people Randall vector Randall are you with us you there hi hi hello everyone I'm listener firsttime firsttime participation by video often and Randall this is gonna be all yours for a bit thank you so much fantastic hi everyone how y'all doing today I'm loving the chat I'm loving aim to see everyone through the chat that is incredibly exciting hi everyone well I see a hi Randall hello Randall okay so I've got you for 10 minutes I really just want to tell you a little about myself and about code Academy and then a little about what you're gonna be hearing today and the people that you're gonna be hearing from really are our focus today is on three things how to search for a job how to interview for a job and how to start a new job and they're all things that we've we've put a lot of thought into we thought felt pretty deeply about all of them both before coronavirus hit and then now afterward and in this whole new remote situation is just it's it's a new world and it's it's kind of incredible that we've only been in this new world for a month and a half or a month or so now because it feels like we've been doing this for a while it feels like we've we've been doing this a number of times we've hired a number of people through it we've interviewed I don't know well over a hundred I don't know hundreds of people through this right now my background so I went to school for education and it was always adult education for me I care deeply about education in all different forms who was always adults that I cared about and so I I first started working as a coordinator literally setting up chairs for classes and taking registration and making sure everyone had a notebook those sorts of things and just every job I was at just try to make sure that I was learning everything I possibly could at that job and you know growing and growing in terms of skill set and knowledge and experiences and I've been at this now especially in the startup world for over ten years I've been at it all together for 15 years in the startup world for 10 I was with what was a startup at the time JetBlue and got to be with them through some really rough spots in the beginning and just trying to figure out how do we turn this into a real company I was with a Montessori education company for a while try figure out how to make that a real company and I've been with codecademy now for I I guess about half a year I was at first a customer I wanted to learn about I want to learn JavaScript because I wanted to build a slack app and I just kind of fell in love with the product and said this is everything that I had hoped I would be possible in the world I mean the idea of educating not just the person in front of you but millions and we have millions of people who use our product hundred thousand we just hit that milestone recently who are part of our subscription Pro product which by the way we are giving giving out a number of those for free right now for people who have our kind of worst financial situation right now so you can get scaled up in in what I think are the most important skills for has been the most important skills in the economy that I think will continue to be our mission at code Academy is to help people build something meaningful I cared about that before coronavirus hit I care twice as much about that now because the world on pause right now and there is so much to build and all of us need to be builders and we all need to be making things and in trying to rebuild this world that we've put on pause and I'm openly stealing from a blog post by Marc Andreessen who's a famed enter capitalist if you get a chance read that he says things better than I ever could but we need to be building and our Java code Academy is to help teach the builders and that is a wonderful thing to get to be a part of and we our reach is incredible but there's literally only a hundred people as if they there are a hundred people working at code Academy that's it to have that kind of reach and the way you do that is by having the right people and being very very thoughtful about making sure you have the right people interviewing this whole job search thing it's very stressful I know very very stressful for you I've been there I've gone through all that it's also stressful for us because we need to make sure that we're finding all the right people because every every person that's here can help make or break the company and help make or break our mission and our mission is very very important to us so the people you're gonna be hearing from are what I I mean some of the best I have gotten to work with in my career people who have worked at a number of different startups that are very very good at finding the best talent they have a lot to say about how to find a job how to interview for a job and put your best foot forward and then how to start a job how to onboard I it's my belief that a job is made or broken in the first 90 days and you're gonna hear a lot about that as well I think all that's very important in Corona and all this was hard before coronavirus started happening and coronavirus and this whole workfromhome thing makes everything a little bit harder it's all very doable I mean I've Airy much believe that and I been very pleasantly surprised at exactly how doable all this has ended up being and I want to tell you one story and then I'll get out of the way man a man named Andy Stern era it was March 3rd and I know it's hard to go back in time here but March 3rd everyone knew about coronavirus it was starting to happen there were a couple of hot spots around the world there were a couple of cases in California but as far as we were concerned hadn't really hit the US it was in Japan it was in China was in South Korea I think it was in Italy bound to get may realize exactly how bad it was yet and Andy was flying in from Japan to come talk to us to come interview for a role that was the sole reason that he decided to come to us and he was in a hotel we're in Soho New York City in New York City he was in his hotel and office for making huh that's interesting we have somebody who came from a hot spot who's going to be coming into our office to meet with all of us and eat lunch with all of us is this a good idea and we like him he seems really interesting but how do we actually get to know him how do we do things like he was he was interviewing for an engineering role and there are things like having a whiteboard session for a you know you need a whiteboard session to work through your coding interviews how do we do that if he doesn't come in and it was a point where we're still all trying to figure out is this serious as this not serious how worried do we have to be and what we ultimately and it really was just all of us all the people that you're gonna be talking to today sitting around a table trying to think through every single aspect of it and trying to figure out what do we do and ultimately what we did and it was awkward and it was strange but we got a breather space for him that we which is a conference room that we rented out for the day for him to sit and we did everything over zoom and I remember and we put a lot of thought into okay we always try to get a sense of who somebody is so how do we get a sense of how do we target our questions just a little bit more to make sure that we really understand who he is and that whiteboarding well let's just really test that out can you see a white board through the camera should we be using an iPad and the and and work from that can you use a piece of paper we have to think all that through we had to figure all that out to get a sense of somebody and how do we give them a sense of our culture and how do we give them a sense of who worked here and whether or not he's actually going to enjoy being here because that's really important if you don't enjoy being at a company you're not gonna do great work so we want to make sure that you are gonna really like being here we end up doing things like I remember picking up the computer and walking him around the entire office on his zum just to meet every maybe 3040 people at the time and then he was completely down for it he thought it was strange but he was into it and he was resilient and he persevered through all of it and we ended up really getting a good sense of him and liking him and we hired it it was the first person we deal with here and he we need to hire him and he started midapril and then you have to get into the author questions of so and by this point we were all actually working from home but we had to get into the the issues of so how do we give him a great experience I mean we're a very tightknit group so how do you make sure that he knows everyone really well and he has relationships with everyone because everything's about the relationships you have and how do we make sure that he knows everything that he needs to know to be really successful his job and all that we had to think through as well if you look at the inside of Carrie and Maria's apartments right now they're just filled with swag that we're shipping to all the new people we have and computers trying to figure out all that and and how do you create those relationships one on one so that's gonna give you a bit of a taste that I could keep talking about Andy forever I'm so happy he's here and I'm so happy to go through that process but we can tell you a little about what that's like on our side but also based on that what you should know in order to stand out to people like us to recruiters people are trying to figure out whether or not you make sense whether or not you have the skills and whether not you make sense for that that company I want to leave with one bit of advice because I can know that the people that you were going to be speaking with are going to give you a lot of advice and if you are like a lot of our learners you're probably only sitting there with a pencil and paper or just trying to take notes on absolutely everything and I completely applaud I think that's great the major advice would have for you is instead of trying to vacuum up everything I think them find three things three piece of advice in here that are really really impactful for you that really really matter out of those three just commit to one make sure that you do exactly at least one thing because I want to make sure that this is really productive for you and think about yourself is mining for gold through the rest this morning because again we're gonna give you a lot and I want to make sure this is really useful for you now I'm gonna check in with you again at in a couple of hours so I'm gonna be part of a Q&A later on and at that point I want to know from you what is that one thing that you're all going to be doing what's the one thing you're taking away so I think that's it I think I'm also out of time so Alisa once you take it away tell us a little more about what we have in store today I'm very happy thank you so much Randall for this we'll talk to you soon all right everybody it is time for me to share my screen and give everybody a heads up on what else we can expect for the day and we are present really great so again today is the second event in our and Coke ad amis learn from home series we're calling today interviewing from home we just heard from Randall vector our VP of people and we will see him again later today so today's agenda you already heard from me we had that great kickoff from Randall next up we'll be preparing to find a job online with Madison and mia biscaia these two are technical recruiters and before I share too much I will hand it over to them to explain who they are what they do and to share the best of what they have for you thank you very much oh and here they are hi Madison I'm iya I'm so excited it's all yours now talk to you later you hello everyone so we are going to be preparing to find a job online right now Madison I think we need your mic on alright hi everybody sorry about that so we'll go ahead and get started um my name is Madison Olson I'm a senior technical recruiter here at code Academy prior to economy I worked in both recruiting and people ops across companies and tech media and advertising spaces so my day today typically consists of essentially trying to get people excited to work at code Khadem ii and i focus on hiring primarily for the data science design engineering marketing and product teams and i am Mia biscaia I'm a technical recruiter here I actually just started right before the stay at home orders came into play so I'm relatively new here at code Academy prior to this I worked as a coordinator and I worked both in house and on the agency side of recruiting I deal with sourcing and building out the top funnel here for most departments from engineering and product to design and marketing so a little bit about what we'll cover during our session we'll go over preparing your profile resume LinkedIn and so forth where and how to look for jobs and preparing for future interview processes and then we'll do a little Q&A at the end so things to consider prior to starting your job search or application process ease things we would recommend doing preparing your resume of course this seems kind of like a given of course but it might seem relatively straightforward but you know keeping these things in mind prior to starting your search or as you start at applying for jobs will definitely be beneficial so although you know most applications and application tracking systems do collect your name and contact info it's still very important to make sure this is very clearly highlighted on your resume obviously you would like to incorporate your work experience so just thinking about what you've done and highlighting experience that shows why you are potentially a great fit for the roles that you're applying or you might want to include your education as well optional sections if you have room you might want to include a section for skills you might want to consider adding a section to talk a little bit more pointedly about you know skills you've developed throughout your experience and highlight why you might be a great fit for this role or how certain skills you've developed would be beneficial and a new opportunity additionally my 1 consider adding volunteer experience so if this is something you have room for feel free to throw it on there especially if it highlights and kind of you know the work that you're doing outside of just your job position and then you know feel free to add any awards as well considerations when preparing your resume so just a few considerations to keep in mind as you drum it up length one recommendation that we have is to try to stick to one page for the most part you should not need to expand to two or more pages it's very easy to do because there's so much that you've done you know throughout the course of your existence obviously so we definitely want to keep in mind that you someone who's looking at your resume might not get to the second page or might not scroll all the way down so they might miss something super important that they'll want to know so we definitely recommend sticking to one page when possible also consider the font that you're using you don't want to go too small or use a font that's too difficult to read you know if people are kind of squinting at the screen or squinting at a piece of paper to you know read what's on your resume they might miss a few things design and format also so you know we come across a lot of different resumes and you know unique the resumes can also be great however you know you don't want to you know go to too you don't want your design to be illegible you don't want to expense you know readability for you know a creative or unique looking resume and then finally your education you know something you might want to consider is where to place this on your resume if you are a new grad for instance you might want to consider putting more towards the top of your may before your work experience however if you are a little bit more the senior side or have many years of work experience we would probably recommend putting that further down on your resume and then additionally preparing your LinkedIn so this is a really good kind of supplement to your resume it's something that I know a lot of recruiters or hiring managers might go to you know in addition to looking at your resume a lot of companies might utilize this sort of in place of your resume as well so we definitely recommend ensuring that your LinkedIn info is uptodate prior to applying to new positions so that way once you start applying if people are going to your LinkedIn it's already prepared a photo so in the age of social media profile photos are always a very hot topic of course feel free to add a photo you know sort of at your leisure however if you're not comfortable putting up a photo you shouldn't have to I'm having a photo should not affect your candidacy so I wouldn't say that this is a mustdo it's just something that you know you might want to consider in addition to that you might want to add a quick summary about yourself think about like what do people want to know about you and what you want them to know about you what are you looking for having a quick summary at the top of your LinkedIn you can always come in handy and then in addition to that experience this is a great place for you to expand on your experience so if there's stuff that you couldn't fit on one page of your resume that you would still like to highlight definitely feel free to add it here you can add you know as many bullet points as you want and so you can continue to expand on your awesome experience on your LinkedIn and then there are additional sections that you can add on LinkedIn so another great place to add things that you might not have been able to cover on your resume like such as volunteer experience LinkedIn offer also offers you a section around skills and endorsements so definitely don't hesitate to ask like your friends or colleagues to endorse you for skills that are going to be beneficial in your next role and then in addition to that ask previous colleagues for recommendations if you feel comfortable you know I think I look at these personally other people do as well so these are great just kind of supplements to show you know why you might be a great fit for your next role where and how to look so we're going to be covering different places that you can look and the best means to do so so there are a lot of general jobs pages that you can look at for varying interests industries it's great to go directly to a companies dedicated careers page sometimes companies won't post certain jobs on external boards if there's a funny that you have in mind that you're extremely passionate about go directly to their site LinkedIn is also really helpful as well there are hundreds and thousands of postings on LinkedIn typically companies will keep these postings updated as they tend to get a lot of traffic you can see when they were posted how many people have viewed the postings and how many people have applied so that's really helpful as well in your job search Glassdoor is also great for job postings a lot of applicant tracking systems will cross post a glass door so anytime that a post is made live on their company page it will also be made live on glass door glass door is helpful in getting a little bit more insight as well into a company and seeing if it's the right fit for you they offer employee inform employee feedback on worklife balance and benefits just to name a few things and you can also look into salary expectations and reviews of previous interviews for various positions that that have been conducted and that you may be considering indeed a similar a glass door but covers a lot more industries as well there are tons of job postings on indeed that for varying backgrounds and skill sets to angellist is a little less known it's specific for earlystage startups so if you're really interested in getting into a company at the ground level Angeles is a great place to check out you can see how many rounds of funding have been raised people at the company and the mission of the team there are also a variety of industry specific job websites and job boards dribbble offers jobs in the design industry behance also veers to the more creative job types and github and Stack Overflow are great for engineers and product managers how to look so you should set up a time every day to check for new job postings be it the morning in the afternoon the evening it's best to have a specific time that you can set up every day also it's really great to keep a list of companies and positions that you've applied to who you've heard back from interview confirmations and any notes you want to track when you applied if you've heard back maybe any notes from like the company if they emailed you back if you've spoken on the phone with them or a recruiter or hiring manager take notes make a list of that it's great to not apply to the same jobs over and over again just reach out to the people that you're you're interested in and keep a spreadsheet it's really great that way LinkedIn connections you can reach out to your connections that might be open to making an intro to anyone that maybe you have in common it's a great way to get a referral and also consider reaching out to previous colleagues or friends who work at companies that you're interested in it's also a great way to get your foot in the door great and now we'll talk a little bit about preparing for future interview processes and just kind of getting yourself prepped for any potential conversations that might be coming your way so just a couple quick tips before we wrap up so before you go into an interview process or if you're just trying to prep yourself for future conversations one recommendation would be to prepare to kind of deep dive into your experience you know you can do this kind of by yourself you know going through your experience through your resume being prepared to speak to your experience and thinking about what you accomplished in previous roles like being prepared to discuss projects what was your role in that project what resources did you have how did the project or work have an impact you know who did you work with in the project and just be prepared to speak to your work style maybe a little bit about how you have given or received feedback in the past how you handled a situation when something went wrong and maybe what you learned from it thinking about all those questions in regards to your experience I think can be super helpful as you move into any conversations with recruiters hiring managers and future team members a lot of different interviews might cover things like this and so it's just helpful to be able to you know speak well to those different experiences that you've had and then one other thing you can consider as well is a lot of companies have different values associated with them as far as you know what defines them their culture and so forth and how they work and it might be useful for you to think about how that relates to you your experience as well to kind of speak to that a little bit in addition to that being prepared to speak to any gaps in employment I think gaps in employment definitely do not scare off potential employers the way they might have in the past you know the only you know gaps happen whether they're voluntary or involuntary so I think the biggest thing to look for is just to you know to be able to speak to what you did with that time you know what you learned and so forth and just being prepared you know to discuss why you're ready for the next opportunity it's also great to reconnect with your references if you have any doubt that a reference might not give you a good reference maybe you don't use them it's better to be safe than sorry in these situations you should always use someone that can speak to your daytoday work and that you've worked directly with they should be able to speak a lot to your work ethic and specific projects that you've executed references are typically more about how to set the candidate up for success and their potential new role and that's what the hiring manager or the recruiter is trying to delve into when they reach out to those references you'll want someone that'll be able to speak to that and shed great light on it and then one other recommendation is just to you know as you continue to move forward in your job search you know try to continuously expand your contacts you know you can connect with people in many different ways obviously through LinkedIn and other social resources but you know definitely don't hesitate to reach out to people that you've mutual contacts with unlinked and kind of like we mentioned earlier you know attend any meetups that might be in an industry that you're interested in I know we're in a virtual world right now but they're definitely still those virtual meetups happening as well even virtual networking happy hours for instance so definitely things to consider it's definitely helpful just to expand sort of your network within the industries that you're interested in and a lot of times there are different panel discussions going on that might be interesting to you as well and this can also be another opportunity to find job opportunities that you might not have how to access to you before or that might not be widely posted online all right so I think that kind of wraps up our presentation portion so I guess now we will move on to QA and I'm super excited that we've got a good number of questions coming in from a lot of people so thank you all of you for sharing your questions in the Q&A box while I'm looking for a few to serve up right now I just want to share a reminder to everybody that if we are if you're typing your questions please do type them into the Q&A box we see you chatting in the chat and it's not easy to answer your questions from there so thank you so much for putting them in the Q&A box another reminder I we also see that your hands are raised for this event we won't be able to respond to and raise hands even though we would really really like to but again please do ask your questions in the question and answer box okay so to get us started oh yeah there we are a little bit bigger I saw a question come in from you and the question was how do we feel about templates on a resume are they good are they bad should we use a template should you design your own I don't know what got me a DUI but yeah I think templates um definitely an okay way to go they are look very clean you just put all of your information right into it I've seen the same template used over and over again and it doesn't really jar me away from a resume so I don't think that it's a bad thing to use a template personally yeah I would I would agree as well I think you can definitely be beneficial don't hesitate to stray away from a template but I think it's an absolutely great starting point as well if you want to work from that and then just yeah if you have questions on how to format your resume it's really great to use a template wonderful so there was also a question about LinkedIn it's from see me Evan I understand that LinkedIn can enhance our chances but is it really more helpful than a resume so I think this question is like comparing and contrasting what is more crucial in the job search right though assets as an outbound sorcerer like I am reaching out to people that I mostly find on LinkedIn so if I if I'm reaching out to someone who hasn't directly to me then I usually will find their LinkedIn page to kind of look at their work history so if you are on the job market and you are looking for a job I would say that it is definitely beneficial to have a LinkedIn if it doesn't get too descriptive that's fine if you have a resume that you've also submitted to a company that's great too but some sort of LinkedIn I think is really helpful yeah I would I would definitely second that as well I think it's a great you know sort of supplement or additional resource as well and as Mia mentioned super critical to making yourself more discoverable as a potential candidate because there might be jobs out there that you might not have discovered for whatever reason and recruiters are going to be recruiters but hiring managers are going to be utilizing LinkedIn to try and discover potentially great candidates so it's definitely helpful if you have the ability to create a little bit of a presence on LinkedIn wonderful thank you so I'm seeing a few people and I'd like to be able to say and like okay missus questions coming in from Rosie so those questions coming in from Simula but I'm seeing a few of you asked what do we do when we don't have experience for the resume what would you suggest for somebody this is really their first job and actually this ties into another question perhaps about where do we put education on our resumes so if you don't have if you don't have any previous like direct work experience or if you have an internship definitely put the internship down or if you've worked on like projects like technical projects or some sort of thesis for for school that could be the top the top section of your your resume underneath education I would definitely put projects underneath education if you don't have any relevant work experience and then you can expand upon your skills below that to up see thank you sorry I'm Addison did you have something that you would attack no no I would definitely agree I think triage can mine you know what you've learned throughout your education projects you've worked on things like that are definitely great to highlight to be very beneficial for the job search wonderful just a quick reminder to everybody who I see in the chat please do ask your questions in the Q&A box we see them coming through chat and I really want to get them as many as we can answer it so please do place them in the Q&A chat I appreciate it so much and I know that our panelists appreciate it because that's where we can see them all to thank you we have another question coming from Courtney Keller and feel free to pass on this team if you need to and that question is I do both web dev and design do you recommend two different resumes I find that nearly all my contract work uses both of those sets of skills but not always sure how to market yourself Thanks overall I think you should be in a sense should be able to use one resume consistently so I think highlighting both is great however you know depending on what job you're ideally looking for you might want to highlight a certain set of skills maybe a little bit more than others however I know you know and most of my searches or with hiring managers I've worked for in the past they definitely love to know you know sort of your comprehensive skill set and if you have if you even if you were looking for more of a web development job as opposed to design for the time being if you wanted to focus on that more highlighting those design skills is also going to be a huge add as well so I think you know being able to highlight that comprehensively still going to benefit you but I would say you know I would maybe tailor your resume a little bit more towards what opportunity you might be looking for and if that is a comprehensive you know kind of a mixture of both design and development then you should highlight both and again you can always utilize you know LinkedIn or your portfolio or whatever that might be just highlight you know all of your skills or continue to expand on all of those things as well thank you I'm gonna read ten meals question because this is one that I've actually had um in my life before PDF or word I like PDF I place a PDF and Doc's you there can be depending on the application like tracking system or how you upload it or you know depending on the computer that someone might be using I think it can get a little mistranslated at time when you upload in word for the applicant tracking system that we use it comes up just in courrier font and it's like a very like very messed up document so I would definitely recommend PDF thank you I have not seen this question comes through yet through this Q&A but as a rumor I'm working as the community manager could ketamine so this is a question that I do see come up pretty often like in our community spaces can you Mia or Madison can you speak more to that system that changes up the resumes can you explain that a little bit more Oh applicant tracking system asti's sure so an applicant tracking system or an ATS we use a system called green house there's a bunch of them out there for recruiters to use it basically just when you apply to a job or when your resume is uploaded by the recruiter internally it creates a profile for you and it's our way to track your your candidacy within the company so if you've had if you've had an interview we can put it what stage you're at and we can put some feedback in there and then it helps us like track you along the way so you don't get lost great thank you for that so this is just a plug for the the next the next session that we have we will have a session after this on best practices for interviewing online so get ready for that we do still have about six seven minutes left for Q&A here though so we're gonna pace ourselves I see so many questions right now coming in and I super appreciate them just want to give a headsup to everybody if your question is not answered for for Madison to Mia you can always visit the Koch Adam II forums we have a space actually where we can keep this conversation going that's discuss codecademy comm so we can keep talking there in case we don't get to everybody's questions right now so I saw earlier a question come in sorry Lenny I like this one very much so maybe this is something that you can ask from you know Thomas Chang asked what tool would you use would you suggest to a job searcher to use for tracking everything that tracking other applications have you ever seen a good system that you like yeah I think you know it is very much up to the user as far as what they like you know there are always there are so many different tools out there and so it definitely can be hard to choose of course I think you could utilize anything from a sort of basic like Excel or Google sheet I think I saw that in recommended with Trello Trello totally works as well again I think you know any of these things could could do this well so I think finding a workflow that works well for you it's what's most important what you think you'll actually go to more like are you more apt to go into Google to utilize a Google sheet or you might have to check your app Trello or whether that's an error table or I think they're kind of almost an endless amount of sort of organizational tools that you might be able to use but definitely recommending something where it's pretty easy for you to edit or move things to different categories or stages or to add notes something that makes that easy to do especially if you think about after you've had a call with an initial call with a company for example a place that's you know something that's easy for you to go into and add a couple notes or you know something that's not too difficult for you to update and edit and track it's definitely going to be important but I think it's totally up to you as far as what's gonna work well for you okay oh thank you we're all at home right now just show us in the chat how many of you are at home with a dog or a pet or a family member right now um there's probably a lot of us you are gonna hear my dog back that's good that's gonna be part of today thank you so much for understanding um okay I really appreciate this question how to add sub medical experience on your resume travel listener yeah yep yeah I'm not sure what your attica like traveling took a break travel people people will most likely understand I think it's better to put something rather than just leave like if it's like six months to a year or even if it's three months just put like sabbatical and Paris or like traveled Europe something like that yeah just add it however you feel comfortable putting it yeah I would agree I think I do personally anyways prefer to see you know something highlighted at you know as a sabbatical experience or time off or whatever that might have been I know there used to be a few different LinkedIn pages that would highlight you know time off whether that was for a sabbatical or parental leave or whatever that might have looked like because most likely you were doing something pretty amazing you know during your time off your sabbatical parental leave whatever that might have been and there are definitely interesting things that you're gonna be able to highlight that will totally benefit you you know moving forward in your job search as well so definitely don't shy away from I think highlighting that a little bit rather than leaving a hiring manager or recruiter wondering like hmm there is a gap there wondering what was going on yeah I think it's nice to mention something if you feel comfortable if you don't and that's fine too you know you have other amazing experience that will you know you'll be able to speak to as well wonderful thank you so much and thanks everybody for telling us who you have it with you that was actually a nice little moment of joy as well somebody has five dogs of you you are you are among the best okay I saw a few questions come in about actually how to start a relationship with recruiters and headhunters if you're new to the job market so outside agencies so is that you're looking to get into a relationship with a headhunter an outside agency they're more than willing to speak with you most likely if you have any sort of relevant experience they will jump at the opportunity to speak with you and to get you in their pipeline to get a relationship with a internal recruiter I would say reach out to them or maybe a contact that you know the company apply the best way is to apply to the position through the job posting I'm constantly going through the inbound application so your your job application will get seen yeah I think those are the best ways Madison anything else dad yeah no I definitely would recommend as Mia said with thirdparty agencies I would echo that as far as tape to reach out to them apply to their postings going to their you know agency website applying to postings there they'll be you know more than keen to reach out to you I think and then as far as internal recruiters you know something I've seen that has been effective is people will reach out to folks on the team if they can search for them on LinkedIn on the team that they're interested in joining and then they'll see if they're interested in having a chat or just chatting via message and more often than not I think our team members are forwarding and highlighting those resumes to us so you know don't hesitate to give that a try and the most like polite and professional way that you can obviously not everyone is going to have time to respond but most of the time people will forward things long and if they do have time they're usually more than you know willing to speak with you or chat with you a little bit whether that's online or on a call or whatever that might look like so it doesn't definitely isn't hurt to do a sort of like gentle reach out on LinkedIn that way but it is something that has totally worked and we've gotten people into process that way as well from someone reaching up someone on the team oh yeah thank you so much okay we have like less than 60 seconds left with you both before Jeff and Emma come on for best practices for interviewing online so in this limited time that we have is there anything that came up for you that you weren't able to share that you'd like to share with everyone today I would say I know that a lot I saw in the chat a lot of people were worried about applying to jobs right now I'd say still apply to jobs that are open if there are any if there is anything out there there are still companies that are hiring I know that a lot of people are scared right now about finding a new job but I mean hopefully things will get better in the future so I'd say still still put yourself out there and apply absolutely yes definitely like you no trying as best you can to not get yourself down about you know applying I think you know as me I said it's you know it can be a little arduous and it can be a little cumbersome as well to do it but I definitely don't hesitate everyone is you know people who are hiring are more than excited to you know look at all of your applications and try to get in contact with you as well so definitely don't get down yay okay we will not so Mia Madison where's we're still working together

Emma and Jeff for best practices on interviewing online thank you guys thanks Lisa I will share my screen first of all thank you everybody for coming this segment is about best practices for interviewing online before we get into some of the introductions between myself and Emma I would like to address one quick question that came up before about that I saw in the chat about cover letters I think it's an important topic yes yes yes on cover letters start with a great topic sentence tell the company why you want to work there make it personal recruiters read these teams read these so you know yes for me on cover letters and that also goes for optional questions I no companies a lot of doing optional questions on the actual a balloon take some time go full so let's get to the project this is best practice for interviewing online are all going through this many of the time we'll get to all those two things i'm jeff director town code at me before this I worked for a large Bini so work for a recruiting agency for about thirteen years so I've worked with clients of different sizes in many different recruiting processes and fittings and philosophies I've been here for about six months and absolutely loving it I think we have a team of experts as you've already seen in Mia and and has a lot of things to share let me turn it over to you haven't you want to do an introduction for sure um say I'm a senior technical recruiter I'm the talent team here I on a day to day basis focus on engineering roles curriculum roles sales roles and customer support roles I think right now um so basically a broad spectrum of the company in addition to just technical roles and as far as my background goes I've been at code Academy for almost two years now and previously worked in agency recruiting so I focused on working on tech roles in New York City with basically mostly startup and media companies fantastic Emma your wealth of knowledge for code Academy if anybody has questions please put them in the chat if you're interested to know more about recruiting or all things code Academy our agenda for today we're gonna run through what a typical interview process looks like you know how you can think about ways in which you'll describe your experience to various people along the way and what to expect and who you're going to talk to we're gonna talk about preparing for your interview you know the things that go into ooh what will show that you have prepared yourself and we'll talk a little bit about adjusting online interviews of course very relevant for today you know this again is something that we're gonna focus on a lot and then we're just going to give sort of one overview opinion about using the star method to answer behavioural questions you know this is something where there are many different ideas philosophies that are that are roughly the same but this will give you an easy way to remember and go forward about this and then how to follow up so here we go Emma do you want to take it away for the typical interview process for sure um so just to start off we wanted to to talk through what a typical interview process will look like I think it's it's great to know what you're in for when you get into process with the company and and just to kind of highlight we put it at the bottom but this is an example of what a lot of companies will use it's always encouraged to ask the recruiting team at the company you're interviewing with what kind of process they run remember that the recruiter that you're working with is it is a great resource for you for questions that you have in the process and really wants you to succeed in the process and so you have a lot of mutual interests so starting off in the in the interview process is application review candidates are coming to the company in some way whether that be a referral applying online applying through some kind of paid platform or job board and someone's looking at that resume so for us it often is Mia who you guys talked with earlier but it may be another recruiter on the team as well then there's a recruiter phone screen so typically at codecademy this is often done by myself or Madison or Jeff and this is really about the candidates background about what they're looking for there may be some like basic eligibility questions involved as well after that there's often a call with a hiring manager for the role and on we a hiring manager we're talking about the person who will be making the final decision for this role and that's also the person who would eventually be the boss of the person we're bringing in so the the decision maker and the person who would be managing then there's some kind of an assessment stage for technical roles this may be some kind of coding screen or take home assessment for other roles it may be a presentation of some kind or some kind of data analysis there's really a broad range but there's always some kind of writing sample or something involved then we do a final interview previously this was done onsite and it was a great way for the candidate to see what the office looks like get a feel for what it would be like to work with the team and all that unfortunately right now we're running these over over zoom so we're have like five hours in calls with candidates in which different members of the team will pop in and out we shine scheduled breaks to make sure that people have a chance to like grab water grab food that kind of stuff so we we had to really quickly adapt to there and then we do reference checks typically for us that often looks like a past manager or a past peer but I think it can vary depending on the company and me I gave some great tips earlier about picking your references and then from there we make an offer fantastic again I want to +1 to Emma saying that you know this is a typical process this is not going to be the same across the board you know some companies may not do an assessment or some companies you know will have to onsite interviews some companies will do a reference check and you know it can be a character review if you haven't had a previous manager it may be a professor or you know a a relative of some kind so so it is important that you you know are aware that these are all can be a part of the process and making sure that before you begin your job search you have some of these people or places ready to go the really the worst thing you can do is sort of slow down the process that the reason is is that you want to make sure that it is as seamless for you as it is for the company so let's dive into preparing for the interview I will run through a couple of the dudes you'll hear from at mahanakhon Cola the don'ts we find that it's very very very important that candidates know the company before the interview this is for many different reasons you could use your imagination but to us the most important one is that you're showing that you're interested in working for this company that you didn't apply blindly you know that there is some significant reason that you are driven to this specific company whether it's the mission whether it's the industry you know whether it is you know if you're an avid skier and you want to work for a ski company like k2 or if you're a hiker and you want to work for Patagonia you know or if you're a coder and you want to or an educator want to work for Codecademy those types of things a lot of what's posted on companies careers pages you will find valuable for your interviews especially because most of the time they're built by the talent teams and they the talent teams and recruiting teams and HR teams are trying to do their best to highlight all of the information that candidates would find interesting about the company little known facts company values is a really important one you know these are way or these are avenues places for you to highlight your interest in the company but also find questions I you know the old saying is come prepared with a couple of questions to the interview and the more specific you can get the more in depth of an answer you will receive you'll get a much more robust picture of the company you know so that you can better prepare yourself for making a decision down the line also important reread the job description you know these are questions that recruiters or hiring teams will will be the foundation for the questions you'll get so the better you know the job description you know the better you'll be prepared for answering those types of shit's another really important one everybody you need to know your resume you need to know your experience I purposely what I was making my introduction said that I worked at an agency for OS a number of years stumbled over that the real answer is I work for 12 and a half years at an agency and the difference between telling somebody that I worked at an agency for 12 and a half years or have to think about it you know shows that I'm prepared it's really important that you know your experience reread your resume also another nice thing I think is to research your interviewers you know you should be getting a list of the people that you will meet with during your interview go online go on LinkedIn find something in their profile that you can identify with and talk about I think building personal connections now more than ever especially with things on zoom' is really really important you know it shows again that you have prepared yourself that you're interested in the company you know that you are taking pride in this interview and that you're serious and taking this very you know you're considering this opportunity at SAAP opportunity and the last thing I'll leave you with is to practice you know make sure that you run through it it doesn't matter if it's in the mirror and it's just to yourself or to your dog or to your cat or to your child or to you know your neighbor across the street and you scream it over Fifth Avenue you know practice it will help you it will hone your skills it will hone your preparedness it's very important MIUI go ahead yeah almost tying into Jack's last point about practicing um I would definitely not forget to prepare questions at the end of every interview at code Academy you're going to have the chance to ask questions and now more than ever doing these in a remote that's really your chance to get an idea of what it would be like to work with these people and what the culture is like at that company I would also say not to forget to set a calendar and write for 15 minutes prior to your interview you want to make sure that there's gonna be a bit of buffer room in case something goes wrong with setting out some technology make sure that you're ready for when your interview starts cuz even though it's Anna probably zoom or Google hangout or something like that you definitely don't want to be late I would also say to never hesitate to ask the recruiting team if there will be a break or any other questions like that if it's helpful for you to have that break in the center the fact that you're at home right now makes it more flexible for you in terms of your schedule and also don't forget to bring yourself water bring yourself coffee and have that stuff on your desk that'll make it yes just holding up his coffee I've got coffee here and have it having that right next to you um will make the whole thing work all more smoothly and hopefully make you feel more comfortable great let's go to the next slide here and then you want to take the dues here for adjusting to a virtual interview pressure and the main thing that I would just start off here with virtual interviews and saying is that it's probably just as new and slightly uncomfortable to the company that you're interviewing with as it is to you so we're all learning together and adjusting to a rapidly changing world here the number one way to to adjust is to practice so definitely make sure that you've like set up your space see what it would look like in your camera and all of that the next thing I would say is to dress the part this can mean a lot of different things for a lot of different companies sometimes you may be interviewing at like a bank or more corporate environment in that case you probably want to dress up more if you're interviewing for a startup like codecademy it probably doesn't matter if you're wearing a tshirt so there really is the need to kind of know your audience and where what's appropriate for that um if you're gonna use a zoom background you might want to think about not wearing like a green shirt or something like that to make sure that you don't fade into the background but it really really depends I would also say to test the technology if you've never used in before you're gonna want to get on ahead of time and download it onto your computer make sure you know how it works check out the basic functionality and all that kind of stuff um and also think about think about the lighting in your room these conversations over zoom are a little bit unnatural a little bit uncomfortable but being able to see each other clearly makes it a lot more effective another thing that we all we actually all did this for this interview as well it's made sure that we had our desktop notifications turned off whether that be email or calendar or slack keep in mind that any notifications or pings that you're getting on your computer will be able to be heard by whoever's on the other end of your video conference so you don't want to hit them to hear the incessant slack notification saying that you got a message it's gonna be really distracting to the interviewer as well as yourself don't forget to take a breath as well I think we could all probably benefit from some advice take a deep breath think on a question and slow down and I would also say say just talk about something personal these are really really unique times and I think for most people that I'm speaking with that they're maybe like a dog or their child or their family in the background and like that's completely fine just calling it out and saying like Oh like you know I'm definitely paying attention I'm sorry that there's some stuff going on here usually that the company will recognize it and if they're like not interested in the fact that that you have a family and that they're there they're probably not a company but you want to work for and also smile there's so much body language that I think is lost being over videoconferencing um so you don't do whatever you can to uh to project your personality into the interview thanks Emma a couple of don'ts these are you know fairly straightforward don't stress this is new for everybody don't get flustered with the technology it's okay if you know again the dog barks in the background or you know your your screen gets frozen that's okay don't be afraid to take notes I would tell your interviewer that you plan to do so if you aren't going to and if you're going to be typing you know make sure to tell that that person don't be afraid to ask questions including for somebody to repeat the question this sort of folds into the technology piece and don't forget to follow up I think the best thing you can do is is send an email to the recruiter follow up provide any feedback there is ask for a timeline of feedback and emails for people who were on the interview panel so you can drop it thank you um let's move to the star method we're gonna quickly go through this what I'd recommend doing is is doing some research online and these are for behavioral questions the example that we'll come to at the end is tell me about a time that you've made a mistake and how you handled it Emma's gonna go through two answers and we'll share a little bit of context as to why one is a little bit better than the other the star method is situation task action and result this will give the answer a very robust detailed and thoughtful response so you know setting the stage describing what you did how you handled the situation and what your effort was and the outcome and the result so Emma let's do the non star method answer first I will pose the question to you tell me about a mistake that you've made and how did you handle it all right I remember one time when I sent flowers to the wrong address I was an Internet at events company I realized this about two hours before the event and so I got in my car picked them up and took them to the right place it was really stressful but I guess all's well that ends well thank you now let's do the same question using the star method so Emma tell me about it a mistake that you've made and how did you handle it I was working as an intern for an events company and I was responsible for ordering the floral arrangements for a private event hosted by a highprofile client unfortunately I mixed up the information from another event and the flowers were delivered to the wrong venue on the other side of town I admitted my mistake to my boss took an early lunch break drove to the other venue picked up the flowers and delivered them to appropriate venue an hour before the event the client never knew about my mixup and my boss was very grateful but SiC so I want to save some time for questions but a couple of key things here you know in the first example we had almost no context about why this was a relevant mistake why the person a candidate is describing this particular situation whereas in the second example we really heard that this was a high profile client you know this was a main responsibility for this job you know and and so that so that's the why that's the setting of the stage you know the task at hand very clear and then how you handled the situation is specifically about a mistake and in the first example there was no mention of making mistake there was no you know here's how I understood this to be a mistake in the second answer it was very clear this was my mistake here's I went to my boss I admitted the mistake you know these are things that recruiters look for when hiring schemes look for the ability the ability to take feedback the ability to you know take ownership over a situation and overcome right the result was very clear in the first example the client never knew about the the earth sorry in the star example the client never knew about the problem you know it was solved internally there was a massive efforts and there was buzz that the client got their flowers which is directly tied to what the task was in the first example it was very blurry all as well that ends well we really don't know what that means did the client know anything what was the situation it's very unclear please go research the star method there are multiple examples in out there this works whether or not this is your first job or you're a VP going for a clevel job I promise this is a very very very good method so can we pause here and go to Q&A at least are you there I'm here and so is my dog normal snoring this is real life ok thank you all for your questions I want it where we're running a little tight on time we've only got five minutes or so left so just a reminder any questions that you do have let's please add them to Q&A what that does give presenters like Emma and Jeff an opportunity even after they're done presenting to actually go through the QA and see what else they can answer for you I want to also give a heads up that we will be recording this and you will be able to find this on YouTube I've seen that question come up a few times you will be able to find this on YouTube and if you registered for the event I'm Zoo it'll get sent to you via email and now before we go to QA actually Emma and Jeff is there any questions that you saw come in that you know right now that you want to answer or is there anything that came up if not I've got one yeah let's hear from you okay cool what's a good timeline for feedback like for asking for a feedback after an interview take this what I yeah I definitely think thing that this isn't this is a great question I think follow up after the interview is is really important as well as the interview itself I would say sometimes while rands working remote it may take the recruiter a little bit longer to gather feedback from everyone but typically if it's been 48 hours from a final interview there should be no problem following up with the recruiter and asking for feedback and the worst that they can say is you know I don't have anything yet I should know tomorrow I should know in two more days they're just asking them what the timeline looks like can be really helpful yeah I'll probably underscore that because this is something that we heard in Mia's presentation that ask questions that's a great thing to do a question from Andres BIA what kind of questions at the end of the interview make you stand out I've asked about the future of the company's specific and/or technical questions or just about the hiring process but what are some home runs yeah you know I always find the more specific the question the more engaging the conversation can be so I'll go back to my previous thoughts about researching the company knowing the job description and then showcasing that you've listened to the answers that you have for questions you've asked what have you learned throughout the interview and then I'd be remiss if I didn't say what my my fatherinlaw gave me some great advice way back when I was looking for jobs and he said you know make sure that you ask if you can have the job for me that is a question that seems to catch people offguard and but shows that you're very serious so so it almost has a a sense of humor but in a sense of urgency built into it I think that you'll find that that is super helpful you can pair that with something a little bit easier like how do you think the sweat you know if you're the interviewer you know do you think that this went well I thought this went very well you know you can be direct that would be my biggest advice thank you and we have time for one more I really really like this question that came in from an anonymous attendee and I liked it so much because culture is something so important to us at code Khadem a so this is a culture question what is the best way to know what is accurate and what is being sold when your interview interview were is speaking about culture one thing that I would immediately jump to is that it's okay to ask the same question if it's culturally related to more than one interviewer on on your panel I love yeah like you know asking every single person like what's your favorite thing about working here what do you think is a growth area for the company in terms of improving culture those kinds of questions if everyone they answering exactly the same you probably know that the company is pushing a script a little bit and I think that you can really get an idea for the kinds of things that are important to people who work at that company yeah and also making sure that those questions are really are really targeted so if you're asking specifically about an area of culture that's important to you you know it makes sure that your interviewer knows or interviewers know how important it is and ask very specific questions about it you you will depending on the place you will always have an opportunity to add to the culture and that is something that interviewer teams are looking for across the board so so if it's something where you have a specific thing that you want to do you know talk about it and if the company doesn't do it it may be seen as a as a really great thing for the company to do in the future I love it okay there are so many good questions coming in because that's the crowd that we

job and on interviewing online you'll hear us repeat a lot of what was said but that's because all so much of it is still applicable right Maria and I are here now to talk about what happens when all your hard work pays off right your job search has been successful what happens next as Rambla mentioned this morning the first ninety days in your new job are critically important for building a strong foundation how do you build that foundation and prepare to start a new job in the age of remote work take a second introduce ourselves I'm Carrie I'm our senior people operations manager here people apps as we call it teams have a goal of creating optimal work environments for their employees simply put our job is to help everyone else do their job better we focus on making them more productive and more successful my daytoday priorities include things like onboarding to give our teammates everything they need to have a successful first day week month even here at Koch Adam II I also look at things like managing payroll and benefits and I often act as the first point of contact for anyone on the team who has a question or need support I'm here with Maria hey Maria hi everyone I'm Maria I am the office manager and people Operations Specialist at Code Kadim II a large part of my job is onboarding new hires and helping them feel as welcome as possible our process for onboarding has changed quite a bit since we went remote so I'm super excited to share some of the tips on starting a new job online that we've learned along the way quite a bit has changed Oh like I said congratulations right you've done a lot of the hard work already starting job is a really big moment and very exciting but I can definitely understand the prospect of starting a new job remotely might feel intimidating we hear you for many of us working from home has been a big departure from our normal routines and that can make it really hard to know what to expect I just also want to point out that this experience will be really different for every company and for every person but we just want to take the opportunity to share what we've learned along the way that might help you many of these onboarding tips and tricks are general best practices and there'll be things you can put into place even if you do go back to the office in the future we'll cover a couple of buckets here three main things getting set up getting set getting started and getting settled getting set up includes our best advice for what you should focus on before your official first day getting started covers first day in your first week while getting settled we'll focus on preparing for longterm success awesome so getting set up at Co Cadenet we consider onboarding to start from the moment a new hire accepts their offer here we want them to have a great experience that whole time couple of things we recommend here ask your onboarding team for advice every company has different procedures and processes so that team will truly be the best experts and helping you figure out what you need to know try reaching out and asking them what they need from you or find out what you can do in advance to prepare it's also a good opportunity to ask about any firstday expectations and when should you be prepared to be online how will you start your day what does your first day agenda look like many companies will send you new hardware like a laptop or a desktop computer for you to use if you receive this early you should try and take some time for your first day to get your computer setup this will let you make sure that everything works to your specifications for example customizing your mouse click settings brightness etc at koke Adam II we've been doing this by shipping welcome kits as a way of bringing that new desk feeling to our new team members homes we send out boxes complete with a laptop a Welcome Packet and some code academy swag to make sure that everyone has everything that they need to right in on their first day we're also then working with each person to set up any extra tech that would help them work better so things like keyboards or mice we also recommend you find out about software right just like Emma mentioned before find out what software the team is using and make yourself familiar with it things like video conferencing calendar email chat or all things you'll use right away on day one and so it's important to be comfortable with them quickly if something is new to you try it out first consider doing a test run on software like video conferencing with a friend or a family member so you know how it works you might also want to try out screen sharing this will let you set up your audio and video permissions before you jump into any big meetings so you're not caught off guard something I want to talk about here and you've definitely seen us struggle with this a little bit on the call the importance of using the mute function on video calls in larger meetings or whenever you might have background noise around you just make sure you are muting yourself right and take the time to practice going on and off mute and many conferencing software's also have keyboard shortcuts that will help you wanna meet yourself quickly and zoom for example you press on the spacebar and hold it down while you're speaking and then let go to go back right back on here I make that mistake daily so it's a good idea to practice another great prep step is setting up a designated workspace you should ensure it's free from distractions try and minimize noise make sure your background is professional it doesn't need to be blank it can still showcase your personality with items like a bookcase or plants but just make sure that everything that's in your frame is professional and very important tip if you are in front of your bed make sure your bed is made before I mean you should consider comfort and ergonomics when you're setting up your space one organ Amma Kip is keeping your laptop and any secondary monitors at eye level this helps reduce neck strain you should be aware of where your lot eyeline is in relation to your camera digital eye contact is something that will go a long way and making you feel connected to your team one tip we recently learned from the team was that if you're trying to take notes while on a video call you should put the window you're looking at directly under your camera that way you can look at your notes and also make eye contact at the same time yeah this is an important one and it's definitely something that's much easier to do in oneonone meetings where you're having more conversational time but if you are you know trying to present it can be more challenging so just make sure you position the things on your screen correctly our last step in this section is to do your homework it's similar to when you're interviewing this is your chance to make a strong first impression on many of your new teammates if you have things you've been asked to complete make sure you're doing them in a timely manner be sure to stay responsive to emails coming from the team they'll be reaching out with a lot of requests and a lot of information and make sure you get back to them quickly and with everything they asked for you can also take this time to keep on up keep up on any company news right and it's a good chance to start connecting with your new colleagues on LinkedIn awesome so part two getting started so now you've done all the prep work you're ready to start these are some things you can think about on day 1 and week 1 most importantly embrace the challenge I know we've talked a lot about how this is a new experience for many of us just know we're all kind of in the same boat starting a new job is exciting but it can be daunting and it may feel like remote onboarding is gonna be awkward but recognize that everyone else is in the same boat well it's a new experience for you it's also very likely a new experience for the team that's bringing you on know that it might take time for you to feel comfortable and try and be gentle with yourself and patient with yourself in the meantime ultimately just remember that it's gonna be a great learning experience for everyone so even though you've already tested your settings nothing's perfect so be ready to troubleshoot know some basics like where your WiFi router is how to reset it and try not to let tech issues fluster you they happen to everyone especially on your first day if you can't solve it on your own don't hesitate to reach out for help be ready to talk about yourself and your experiences you might feel like the interview is over but there are plenty of people in the office that you haven't met yet your team is gonna want to get to know you be prepared to talk about what you've done in the past and walk through your experiences it's always a good idea to have a personal elevator pitch about yourself or a few fun facts for their ICO Academy in one of my favorite traditions is something we call in for vex once every two weeks we ask our newest team members to come in and create a presentation to share with the team in our intro decks we usually ask people to share things like their role what we can expect from them here background info like their career path school where they've lived in the past we ask them to tell us a little bit about their families fun facts some hobbies and finally and most importantly their process and their purpose in Trebek's give us a lot of insight into who our coworkers are as people it also gives us an easy way to find common ground or a new conversation topic while this is something we do as a company here this is something you could take and adapt in a modified way for yourself right think about these topics and have answers ready to go and use them as icebreakers when you're introducing yourself to new coworkers you should take the time to meet your IT manager or IT Help Desk on your first day that way if you have any issues you already have a contact that can help you you should try and meet HR on your first day as well they can be a great resource if you have any questions about payroll benefits or anything else they can also help point you in the right direction if you have any other questions that need to be answered absolutely also get to know your stakeholders right who are the people who are going to be most important for you to meet quickly you're gonna want to find opportunities to connect with all of your new team members but in our current era of remote work without an office and the organic meet and great opportunities that come from a shared break room bumping into people in the elevator Bank or even walking past someone in the hallway this should really be an area of special focus in your first week or two new hires are often really surprised by how many connections they should focus on making within their first week or so but a good rule of thumb is to aim for 2020 I know it sounds like a lot but just think about how many people you now have really quick relationships with that you can ask a question or I can find out more about the company and use those resources a question we get a lot is how do you identify who those people are how do you find out who most important to me fast think about doing things like asking your manager the onboarding team or a recruiter you met during the interview process you could also take the time to review an org chart and see what roles you think you'll interact with most often most importantly don't hesitate to reach out to your new coworkers via chat or email just put on virtual coffee meetings on the calendar and get to know them you can ask them things like what do they need from you how is your being at the company going to impact their role how can you support them you might also want to ask them how they'll know if you're doing a good job you can use that as a barometer for your own success especially right now like you've seen ELISA doing it can also be important to ask about any constraints they might have on their worklife or what their situation is at home so many people have had major schedule disruptions while dealing with Kofi 19 things like child care new home offices so it's important to kind of just get in their world to make sure you understand also come prepared with questions for your new manager ask them things like what will success look like for you during your onboarding period what do you need to know in your first week your first month okay is there any weird jargon or things you might need to know about the company any terms that they might want to help you define is their background or industry knowledge that you should get up to speed on what are the most important slack groups email groups that you should be a part of and most importantly ask them how they like to be communicated with hey so many of us use so many different ways to get in touch with each other hey does your manager prefer to work over slack or chat do they like email when can you reach them and how should you respect your response also find out if your team has specific working hours recurring meetings or other team norms that you should be aware of awesome our last sections about getting settled what happens after you're in hey how do you get comfortable and really start to succeed in your new role don't hesitate to reach out to your new team for help or advice what do they wish they knew when they started what's the best piece of advice that they have for you they're a great resource for questions as they've been in your shoes before keep learning about the company right your knowledge about the company doesn't start doesn't stop in your first week right you're gonna have to keep building that up over time take every opportunity you can to learn about the business about his history and about any strategies plans or roadmaps the more info me you are the easier it is for you to connect the work you're doing back to the larger company mission you should also ask about what companywide or Department metrics you should be looking at and learn where to find them and how to keep track of them for yourselves this part is fun you should check in with HR to find out if your company has any social or networking opportunities lined up at code ketamine we've been hosting daily remote lunches we've also started using a slack integration called donut to pair team members for smaller lunch meetings we also have themed tapi hours we've run live cooking demos remote game nights and we're planning a live art class our engineering team hosts biweekly lightning talks where members of the team have the opportunity to present on topics that interest them we also hosts a monthly demo event where the team shares projects that they've been working on over breakfast or lunch Thank You Maria so many companies have all these cool different opportunities they're creating during this time and if there is something you wanted to do that you're maybe your company isn't giving yet try suggesting it right come up with an idea and present that back to the HR office team and give them something new to try we also suggest you check in with your manager on progress and expectations don't wait to be given feedback while many companies run regular performance review cycles to give you insight into how you're doing it can help to actively seek out and ask for feedback in between those things request feedback on a project or check in with your manager or appear on how it's been going for them right remember that feedback is an opportunity for development so take everything everyone gives you in and just try and use that to help you grow lastly share your feedback about your experience if you you know you have a great opportunity to impact the experience of every person who joins a new company after you use that opportunity please share what works well for you be open and about what doesn't and as you go on in your role remember that yeah remember that it was hard when you started and make yourself available to offer advice or welcoming words to all the future newbies behind you we are ready for Q&A ELISA wonderful thank you um we can yeah there we go we can probably make ourselves really big okay so thank you for that it was really informative and as somebody who works not on your team but actually receives the benefit of working with you that's all really accurate and true and I just super appreciate the work that you all do on a regular basis thank you thank you before hopping into a Q&A box and once you also thank everybody who sent in some questions for Carrie and Maria um quick plug for what we have coming next we have a panel of learners showing up actually who these are people who've actually learned with code Academy and then got a job after so they're gonna be around in about ten minutes to talk with you all about what it's like now to actually like have this job working remotely so cool for them excited for them for right now we're with Cara Maria and I really like this question that came in from Thomas Chang Thomas is killing it with the questions today has a new hire asks any new questions that you've gone like oh that's really good we're gonna add that to the onboarding process so I guess the question is more like are you building the onboarding process around the experience of working with new hires awesome question Thomas the short answer is every day that happens the long answer is it happens so many times I couldn't even tell you what the what the questions are anymore I can I think that question about how to communicate appropriately with your manager how to expect feedback from them which channels they use is actually something I picked up new hire along the way so that is one example I also think that it's important to note the onboarding process is never finished we're always constantly reevaluating it constantly changing it and even as we go from week to week we're adding in all the new things we learned last week great thank you we got a question from brandy it was mentioned that it might be common for new coworkers or for employers to ask about your family our get to know you what if you're like I'm not really comfortable sharing about like your personal stuff you don't have to feel free to not share it's something you may want to do is if someone asks right and you are not comfortable with that have something prepared to steer the conversation somewhere else okay it can be an easy thing for you to do to kind of change the topic and talk about something you do want to talk about maybe you steer that back to you a work experience right or how you want to learn to interact with that person maybe you can focus on the things you're doing in your job I talked about perhaps if you don't want to talk about what's going on at home maybe you can talk about how working from home has been going right maybe talk about what your new challenges are and your office space or all the different things that have come up in your daytoday and you control the conversation and you don't have to share anything you're uncomfortable with and largely your team will respect that definitely you can use the questions that we listed in the intro deck portion which is what we use like a presentation that new team members use to introduce themselves to the company and those are some good icebreakers you know you can weed out the things that you're not comfortable talking about and maybe steer the conversation towards your hobbies or something like that I love it thank you both very much for that so this one I think is actually really this is a cool question coming from Tanner tinsel and I think this is cool because of the culture that we have at code Academy and this what are the tools and things that introverted colleagues can do to stay active and social virtually and I I mean like you both know that I'm just like I were introvert across my forehead like this whoa that's a surprise Kari really oh yes oh yes same with me believe it or not it's definitely a barrier to break down and doing things virtually canned you know sometimes make things easier or harder for certain personality types yeah okay so like what are the tools then let's say we have to stay active socially virtually absolutely something that Randall says a lot sticks with me at coke Adam II were a culture and introverts which may seem surprising because we're putting so much of what we do out into the world and we're so focused on making connections and within our networks with our learners with all the people we're affecting it but apparently we are introverted by nature right so we are finding tools and we are creating new opportunities to kind of do those things on smaller scale and if you're not comfortable speaking up in a big meeting or jumping in right away to like a large lunch table or something like that take an opportunity to meet one coworker it spend time with an individual get to know them a little more closely maybe have them introduce you to a few people they know and start to build up those relationships more slowly try to focus on the quality of the relationship instead of the quantity in that case we also recommend trying to do things that might push you just a little bit out of your comfort zone take the opportunity to reach out to someone and say hello it's simple hello does go a long way because suddenly you have a connection you don't need to have whole conversation but taking a moment to just introduce yourself and say hello this is who I am this is what I do suddenly this person now knows you and you have a place to go if you do need them have a question in the future and you didn't have to spend a kind of time interacting with them or trying to have conversations that maybe you weren't ready for I think slack has been a very helpful tool for us in particular because I think you get to jump into conversations where you feel comfortable and you can step back where you may not yet be ready to participate and that lets you back to supply in them all we have all these slack channels for hobbies so like a slack channel for gardening or video gaming there's one for Animal Crossing that just started so you can find a place where you're comfortable sharing your hobbies and that'll help you like branch out feel a little bit more comfortable I love it thank you so much I've mentioned a couple times even like my role as community manager is one that I think I'm molded into because I'm so much more chatty online like in flag or even just in our forums it can be a really nice way to I think build connections with other people that is totally virtual and it fits this world that we're in right now this is this is a cool question I think again along the lines of culture what are some soft skills fist questions from mark on some soft skills that you've seen that when somebody really exhibits them it makes them quite successful and like their first few weeks of getting to eat yeah and I use the term soft skills but I'm very happy to be corrected um I don't mind the term soft skills but I am gonna kind of think of this question a little bit of a different frame so the first thing that comes to mind right away from me is one of our core codecademy values and that's thinking deeply I think that's very much any what we consider here to be a soft skill and to us that means that you're putting a ton of focus into what you're doing right and you're producing something that can be that is incredibly well thought out and that can be picked apart and pulled apart and people can dig into the ask questions right and it just shows that you're putting in a lot of depth and thought into what you're doing as a company we tend not to fly by the seat of our pants and I think that's a major soft skill that people can bring in is just the ability to think deeply and to focus and present their thoughts in a way that helps helps make it clear being proactive is definitely important we have like a timeline for how we onboard people's when we send out their welcome package when we request other information and it's always great to see new hires reaching out to us being like okay so when is when is the next step what can I expect or trying to make connections with their future coworkers their LinkedIn or just just being proactive in general it definitely helps this is wonderful thank you so much is there wait we have like a minute and a half laughter so is there anything else that's come up for you Carrie and Maria in this conversation that you think that you'd like to share with everyone that's a good question and not an easy one and I think for me the biggest takeaway is to really just recognize that your experience is going to be unique to you right and you should focus on the things that are going to make it feel most comfortable for you if there is advice out there and it doesn't sit right or maybe you want to try something a little bit differently it focus on how it's going to create the best experience for you and how it's gonna show up joining team and don't be nervous everyone that's already at the company has been through this process they remember what it's like and you know speaking for codecademy everyone here is so so friendly when we have new team members step in the door everyone's ready to greet them so just know that people have been in your shoes before it can relax yeah that's that's super important and I think applicable across so many areas of lives it's like somebody's done this before okay okay thank you so so so much let's bring the snobs the virtual applause for Kerry and Maria there's there are some more questions that came through in the Q&A box so ladies if you have a chance come join us America where what is the term room like a jungle trying to get through those right now oh I see I see the gratitude coming through for you thank you thank you everyone next we have a panel of code Academy learners we decided actually that that we were going to go through with our people team and our talent team what it's like to put together a resume what it's like to interview online what it's like to actually start and then in thinking about it I was like yeah and there's this opportunity to make it real and maybe we can show and share what it's like to have been a learner who has gone through this whole experience and is is living it and this actually is working online so we're gonna give a few minutes to our guests today we have with us Pablo choice we have Kathy Anna we have an and we have crystal so team if you're around now's the time to turn on your video I'm so happy to be joined by you right now oh my gosh hi everybody hi everybody so today this is ideal thank you all okay so just so that everybody knows the gist here is let's let's hear from this team of people who are all working remotely in technical roles you all at some point have learned on code Academy I think what is so brilliant is that some of you are still coming back and learning more on cook heavy and oh if you can see the chat team people are saying hi to you so just some reminders for how the rest this is gonna go we're gonna spend 10 15 minutes on some questions that I've prepared for this team of learners and then we're gonna turn it over to the audience and that's you all on the line and we're still going to be using that Q&A box just another reminder that if there is something that you want to ask it is it responding to in the Q&A box there's the four ups there's a code kami forms that discuss duck code Academy calm I'm super grateful that we've seen some of them actually you folks here we have on line with us answering questions there I am super excited to get started and we will get started by doing some intros I'm gonna go around in the order that I see you all so let's start with crystal what how are you what's going on at home and what's your day job like right now well crystal you're so muted yeah music me again for some reason how I was I'm doing well I've been working remotely for I think six weeks now and it's um it's going okay my dolls are happy so um Maya fern went completely removed a month ago with only necessary people inside and my parttime job also went remote so basically teaching students via zoom so I'm still I'm still getting used to it I think just going from because I went to the office four days a week and on the one day I work from home it was usually like babies I ran chores and stuff but I think it's just trying to get my work space situated that's then you know the most unique part of it but other than that like I think it's more been trying to support the other people who are trying to be remote right now and so I think we're almost at the point where they're used to it and but I live in Georgia which everyone probably knows they're trying to reopen the state my office has not said anything about it but I'm not sure how it's going to work yet but it's just we support all over the country though so I don't know if that means anything different for me though yeah like that's just like baseline for all of us right now that shrug emoji okay thanks we'll go to Tatiana in just a second I just want to share heads up that Randall and Madison and Emma will be joining us for the Q&A for the open Q&A section of this segment so we will keep going now with some intros for learners Tatiana how you doing what's home like right now what's your day job hi I'm speaking from Brazil my job is tagging I've been working as a dedicate or for five years now completely removed all this time soon so my day job didn't change a lot but my personal life did I well I was caught in the middle of the transition six months ago all this started I moved home moved back with my parents after I'm going out like nineyear relationship and then I moved to são Paulo like really big city and when I just got my own shoe box there you know like at least that lives in New York you know how this is I found my shoe box there and but it wasn't fully furnished so I came back to my parents house left my all my work stuff there like my work chair and every things so I'm having to yeah I think adapting is the name of the game and how are you and what's home like right now and what's your day job yeah so I am a WordPress web developer I've been with the company for about three years and the last two of those three years have been remote so I started in office and then moved across the country and so I've been working from home for like two years but not like this so we have a toddler and we have a nanny that helps out some days and I'd love to work from coffee shops and I have a coworking membership and so this is definitely different to say the least and so my husband is home with our child now and I'm at home like I can't go anywhere so I have a desk good I have like a home set up but being confined to my house is it's very very different so even though I've been working from home and it doesn't feel like it feels like I still left a job in a way if that makes sense yeah that's real that makes sense thank you for sharing Pablo your your next step what's home like are you doing what's your day job hi my name is Pablo choice I live in the Tampa Florida area um my current role is software engineering manager at AI canals the whole company's remote I've been working with them for almost two years so for me it's no different basically like you said in the previous session I'm also a bit of an introvert so I try to go to a coffee shop every now and then just to mix it up but most of the time I'm just here so nothing has really changed aside from I just have more work yeah it's a it's funny to see how workloads have done this over the last few weeks okay thank you I'm gonna get started with the set of like preset questions that I have for you all and then it already see some questions coming through via chat and via the Q&A just a reminder for everybody please put them in the Q&A section because that's where we'll be able to get to them big thanks to Andrew Boland and Christopher Klein because I've already seen your questions coming through that's very nice so this is just to all of you and we can do this by like who unmutes that's how we can is I'm not gonna like pick on anybody where does code Academy fit in your learning journey is that where is where you started it was coke added me where you came about like halfway through do you still visit click at me to learn new things tell us I feel like I'm a mix of all of that I'd kind of just like played around on coke Adam II for fun like years before I got into this my background was in marketing and communications and I had lots of WordPress experience and like plugins and themes and clicking buttons to make stuff happen and then I realized there are things that you can do that are way more powerful if you know how to code it or just edit and manipulate the code and so for me I like dough deep into a code Kadim eCourse right after my son was born and that was like a big turning point and so I got my job like right as I finished that course but I still find myself coming back because I think oh here's a new thing that I need to learn or here's something I haven't encountered before like I wonder if Coke Adam II has a lesson on that so I feel like my answer is like D all of the above there I need to include that every time is there anybody else want to share I'm like where Luke Adam if it's a crystal I see that you're unmuted yeah I forgot to mention I'm a software engineer so but when I during Codecademy I was a help desk analyst NIT and so it was one of those things where some of the things we had to do we had to do in HTML and I wanted to delve deeper into it to where HTML and CSS and JavaScript and then it just kind of went on from there you know I started running nose in jQuery and I'm someone that when I'm bored I like to learn new things and so you know Proterra me like kept adding classes I kept taking it's basically where it was and so I started in incorporating some of the stuff I learned on coding care and put my job like sequel and JavaScript and it actually helped me build up to learn you know other languages like PowerShell because you're not like once you learn basic syntax it's kind of easier to pick it up for other things and so today I still go on code Academy to refresh on certain things but also just you know see what's there I like I have tracks now like computer science data science stuff like that that really helps you know focus you know which way I want to go so great thank you I'm going to skip ahead Susa the thing that I think that you all can like give a lot of color on and maybe this is something that we can hear from every each one of you on is how to design your work from home space like we heard from we heard from Maria and carry on like how to get settled into your new job but like what's been working for you long term and maybe do a little compare contrast to like what that means now that like you can't leave your house I see Pablo you're unmuted okay yeah for me again it was a little bit different because they said this is kind of normal for me but the main thing is just being comfortable like I am comfortable standing up I can tell I have a standing desk so everything is within reach like I have three monitors to see everything I need to see I love music so I have good speakers here my bass is over here so if I'm feeling like distracted or whatever or if it's my lunch break I'll just grab the base plate for a little bit and come back to work I always have something candy to grab I need to have something my hand so there's always everything I need is always here in my desk and I also have worked out a lot so I just have a standard routine for stretching that helps my back it helps my posture so it's just a bunch of little random fitness equipment here and it's just a lot of discipline I sometimes you say oh my god it's only 11 o'clock I found so much already and have so much to do sometimes it's oh my god it's already 300 p.m. and the day just went by and I still have a lot of stuff to do so it's just like a regular job basically in that sense but as long as you have as long as you're comfortable with where you are you don't have to fiddle or move your chair or anything like that just find a good space that actually works for you yeah I'd say good my answer six months ago would be completely different because I had like an office space at home and now I'm in this transition so I definitely agree with Pablo that you need to be comfortable and that's something I'm aiming in the future I'm just winging it [Laughter] but I say try different things if you're allowed to like in my case I have flexible hours I work fulltime and it's fully remote but I can choose when I work I have to fulfill 40 hours a week but I can still like work during the if I want to I'm not in that person but I'm more of a morning person but um in my case I was able to during this five years to try a lot of different setups and and find a lot of things during the way like for example do I like to work with music on or I don't do I need to get out of the house in order to I don't know to turn the switch on and so it depends a lot and I would say like try try a different thing it thinks experiment and find out about yourself yeah that makes good sense thank you and I see your immediate yeah I so agree with that trying different things I'll preface all this by saying that I'm a ninny agreement seven which is like a whole other conversation but knowing yourself and knowing your personality and knowing like and you're only gonna know by trying but figuring out what you like and what's important to you I think there's so much value in that so like for me I really care about the aesthetic of things and I just care about visual design and so yes I need a chair that's comfortable to sit in all day but I also need a chair that's gonna look pretty in my house am I you know in my like work set up because that's inspiring to me and there are times when I want two monitors because I've got multiple different browsers and sizes and things going on and I want to be able to like see it all and adjust it all but there are times where I'm good with just my laptop like how did a coffee shop like as long as I have a plug to connect to I would rather be surrounded by people than have you know like the perfect setup tech wise and so like one thing I learned about myself is that I love to start my day out somewhere and then come home and so that's just kind of you know something that I've like worked into my schedule because I found that I work really well that way and then I think too just being okay with it changing season two season and so you know I have some like chronic health issues and so like these past few weeks have been really hard and that way and I've started my day later and I've worked after we put the little one in bed and I to him like lucky to have flexible hours like that and as long as I get you know my 40 hours my full time my list done but being like this is what I need in this season and this is what's going to work for me and it may not be the same in the next season but I'll try something different when that time comes crystal did you have anything to add probably just the same that everyone else was done I think for me since I didn't work remotely much before and I had to kind of get my setup different because when I work from home once a day you know I might be at the dining room table or something so I had to make sure a desk and I had to get an extra monitor and you know a chair that was comfortable because I have issues with my back and sounds like that but also I'm an introvert in heart however you know I still need to get up and move around and go outside so I walk the dogs in the neighborhood or I might go out for coffee or something but I don't have flexible hours you know I'm basically eight five everyday and then with my parttime job you know it's night and Saturdays so I just have to try to fit well I'm at home I want to be stuff play I still have to work so but for me you know I need to make sure I take a break from it you know walk away for 10 minutes every few hours or something or I'll stay here for eight hours straight working so I think that's it's also easier that I don't have children or anyone to distract me so you know like work is my distraction I guess so I just saw a dog goes through the back you know yeah yeah they're gonna be really running around efficient distractors um I decided to be Oh tell me in or just say one thing I would add is that if you are working from home right now like whatever your job is don't necessarily assume that the way that things are right now is the way that working from home has to look for you outside of this time brain obviously this time frame you can't change a lot but usually that's not how it is so yeah that's a that's a solid segue into the next question that I have and the final question actually that I have before we open up to Q&A and this one is optional not everybody has to answer this but if there's something that you would change or bring up or some conversation that you would have in your interview if you were interviewing for your current job right now with everything that's going on in the world is there one thing in particular like would you bring up that like hey I actually do need flexible hours because no no yeah maybe I stole a really good example but if there's something that you would bring up if you were interviewing with a company for your current job but with all the circumstances right now ah I can start like actually right now we are hiring and I am interviewing people so the things that I look for because these people are working remote usually in other countries is the first thing is share your video we have had we haven't had good experiences with people who don't share their video and we those that we have higher and even after higher they don't share their video eventually they just went away because they weren't a good fit so in my experience you don't have to share anything specific you don't have to show that yes I have experience working from home or I have this laptop or a half this monitor like to me that does really matter as long as you're a good fit personality wise then you'll make the team so it's more about showing your your real personality and obviously in your technical skills they're gonna ask you questions about it but it's mostly just be about being yourself and also be smart like if you have to share your screen don't have Facebook don't have YouTube or anything like that like even if I haven't seen something that's really really bad but if I'm if you're sharing your screen with me and I'm looking at the application that we're working on I don't want to see your Facebook feed next to it or your YouTube like yes I use YouTube to have music in the background but have it in a different browser so just be smart about what you have and what you're sharing if I see an you yeah I think if I were interviewing right now the question that I would ask is like how are we gonna stay connected one during this time and two in general so we're gonna small team it's just me and my boss but it's really important that we are on the same page and so you know for us that looks like a Monday morning call and I fly out to Colorado you know four or five times a year which we can't do right now but I would ask like how do we stay connected as it slack is it this is it that and then how does that look different outside of our current situation great yeah thank you okay we are time is flying and I think we're ready now for some Q&A from all of our audience I'd like to if you can hear me Randall Emma Madison or listen turn the video on showing us back hi hello everyone how's the afternoon bin or how's the morning been for you I think it's gone really good tell us in the chat how the morning has been give us some give us some feedback yeah and I'd also asked early on I'm gonna want to know what everyone's one major thing they're gonna do is so if everyone wants to throw that into the chat that would be great I'm hearing some New York City coming from somebody else that was probably random yeah yeah you're a few neighborhoods over from me okay thank you so much all right so Randall Emma and Madison have joined us for this section where we're going to take some questions actually for the learner panel so we'd love to hear from from you all and Tatiana crystal and Pablo but if there's anything that MI Randall in Madison can add they'll hop in with that oh right so I actually love this question from Amy because it's for everybody who you see on the screen right now how do you ask about flexible hours in an interview without it coming across negatively so for any learners who asked about like how do I get those flexible hours for any of our talent team how do we do it um first so I definitely had this question asked many times and interviews so one recommendation might be to ask this question directly to maybe more of like manager and interviewer as opposed to maybe other people you meet on the panel you know folks that you might be working more closely with are working across functionally with you know just to kind of get some of this sort of says this is sort of like a question that you actually should ask you know you should be open to asking you know what flexible work hours might look like or what worklife balance is like and things like that too and I think this is one of those sort of like logistical questions that's very good for your hiring manager or your potential future manager rather or cruder or someone else on that side of the team we get these questions all the time so it's definitely not offbase to ask but I would maybe save that just as a recommendation there I save that for those folks on your interview panel great it didn't and or Tatiana when you were interviewing did you have to ask for flexible hours did you have to have that conversation or was it just sort of builtin so I started actually only working five hours a week and so at that point in time it was kind of we were just talking about what the expectation is is it do you want one hour but you want me to check in every single day meaning Monday through Friday I check the email I do my things I need to do or you know do you want me to check in every other day but you know two two and a half hours whatever that adds up to be and then time kind of went on and it evolved and I picked up more tasks and we we really just like discussed what's most important so Monday morning 9 o'clock that's our team meeting that's like nonnegotiable but because I we are such a small company I mean my boss was basically a freelancer before me so he had flexible hours he has kids like I have so I knew we were coming in with similar lifestyles but I think the most important thing as time went on and even from the beginning was just understanding like hey I am your employer like I am here because you're paying me to do things for you so what is it that you expect of me and then of course you know like there's part of that as like this is what I have to offer and this is what will work for me not just that they get to like demand what you do you know but finding that common ground of like this is what works really well for both of us thank you did you Andy yeah I just want to add that in my case it's a big project we have contributors all over the world and it was already designed to be flexible and remote when I joined so I didn't have to yeah to add one quick thing on there I think it's all about communication I think just staying you know in touch with your team and your manager and you know continuing that conversation as you develop as Ann mentioned I think is super critical and for us to as a company that offers a bit of flexibility as far as working hours and things like that you know that's definitely the most important thing for us and what I communicate to candidates all the time is that communication is the most important as far as setting expectations and moving forward and I feel like that is a great segue into what will be our last question of the day for everybody I know time whew and this one is also a good one for absolutely everybody here because like we have the talent team and the people team who are yes hiring but also we're working and you all who've been doing this for a long time how do you manage your home life separately from your work life and I'm going to respond first by saying what is separate it's about home life integration right now that's that's that's my response I'm C ran I'm gonna I'm gonna go to Randall first because I'm seeing his wheels turn yeah now I mean it's look I have two kids and what I've been thinking about during all this times that this is such a stressful time to be a parent but it's also such a special time to be a parent at the exact same time I'm just going to be around your kids and but it's it is stressed because the work doesn't stop you need to make sure that things are happening and the way I think about it is definitely worklife integration take advantage of naps definitely but also I do think communicating with your managers I mean I've talked to my CEO Zack he knows that typically from around 6 to 8 it's gonna be really hard to get in touch with me for something that's emergency he knows exactly how to get in touch with me because I do need to be accessible but he you know we've have pretty clear conversations about what is and is not an emergency and you know just made clear look after APM I will do a lot of great work six data I want to be a dad yeah yeah for me coming goes back to discipline and just just being honest with people like I don't have kids but my my sister I shared the house with my sister Soho she has a baby if I need to pick her up from daycare I'll post in slack hey I'm five pick it up my knees everybody knows I'm out if they need me if there's something special they know they can tag me in slack I'll get out of my phone and I'll get back to them when I can but other than that it's just a regular balance like I make my own bread I'll step away 20 30 minutes I'll leave a message and slack afk 15 afk 20 and I'll make up the time myself like nobody has to tell me hey you have to make up those 20 minutes I'll just do it I'll stay either late today or I'll come in early tomorrow so it's just about your discipline personal discipline oh yes I need to get stuff done but I also have a life so I'm not gonna put either one on hold just learn how to blend both of them just just say like it's being 5 years broken working from home and I've learned that you don't separate completely and there's no way to do it you I have to get used to having this small interferences from time to time I remember my first time we have like regular checkups with with HR it is like perhaps the only time we have video meetings we usually communicate through email or chat hangouts and my first check checking with HR my cat just jumped into my screen and she was like oh let me see let me call my daughter because she loves cats part of things you know like you don't work from home and completely separate your personal life from that you know and I think that that's a great place to to leave this is that this is like we're all absolutely doing our best right now you know what no one was like no like having this interferences sometimes those bring between closer yeah that's here okay I'm just like a big disturbance right we we are about to wrap up is there any last things that anybody's like gonna burn if they don't share now would be the right time Oh Randall's always gonna burn if he can't share come on I actually just wanted I've watched all the interviews that Lisa's had with all of you so I feel like I'm I'm with a bunch of celebrities right now and it's just really really nice to hear your stories I just want to say that and it's been very nice to be able to share some of those also with some of the employees because that is that is what we if we don't always hear from you and we can get disconnected from what are we doing why are we showing up every day and it's just just a wonderful thing so thank you very much for sharing everything both here and other place you have it's just it's really interesting yeah thank you thank you Randall if it's a good point to reference that if you are a coke Adam ePro member you have access to Unicode Academy Pro community where an Tatyana Pablo crystal and others actually shared out and and answered a lot of the questions that you are asking in the Q&A right now about how they got started what they had to learn to get their job and what their what their journeys have looked like and so they've done an amazing job of sharing those stories and illustrating what it can look like for all of you so again that's just a plug for the Academy Pro community for our Pro members ok I can't thank you all enough for joining us today I massive thanks to our people team I think right now what we can do is can we just like wave to each other for a little bit right now yeah okay and then everybody's going to see us over there on the side massive massive thank you I'll talk to you all soon bye Randall bye
