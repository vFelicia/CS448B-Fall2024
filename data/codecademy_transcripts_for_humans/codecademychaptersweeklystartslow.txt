00:00 - hi everyone my name is elisa
00:03 - for those of you who haven't who i
00:05 - haven't had the pleasure of meeting yet
00:07 - i am a community manager at cook academy
00:09 - alongside mike
00:11 - who you already know and i will be
00:14 - around in this discord channel for all
00:17 - things onboarding
00:19 - and inviting and growing your meetup
00:22 - i was thinking that
00:25 - i've been building community for like
00:27 - five or six years now and community
00:30 - is good work and it's also hard work
00:33 - mostly good work but one of the things
00:36 - that
00:37 - makes it hard can be getting
00:40 - started so i was thinking
00:44 - that i would each week create a little
00:46 - video like this where i just share a
00:47 - snippet
00:48 - of encouragement um i knew that in the
00:51 - early days of building some of the
00:52 - communities i've worked on
00:54 - i definitely needed it and each
00:57 - week we'll have a theme so this week's
01:00 - theme
01:00 - for this video is start small
01:04 - and keep going and i think that that's a
01:06 - really
01:07 - important one to to note because i know
01:09 - a lot of you are starting
01:10 - your your chapters here and they're
01:13 - going to have just a few people
01:15 - um unless you're an absolute rock star
01:18 - or
01:18 - like isabelle here um at cuny or you
01:22 - already have your
01:23 - your community when you're starting it
01:25 - it's gonna be small
01:26 - and um personal experience when i was
01:29 - starting
01:30 - the codecademy meetup at headquarters in
01:32 - new york city
01:33 - for the first like three or four only a
01:36 - handful like three or four people came
01:37 - like it was
01:38 - tiny and i was like certain that
01:41 - i totally failed right um but by the
01:45 - fourth time
01:46 - it was clear that okay what people
01:49 - needed to see
01:51 - was a few meetups had already happened
01:54 - to see that okay this is legit and i'm
01:56 - gonna come
01:57 - so those first three
02:00 - or four stick through them
02:04 - the only real failure is not trying
02:08 - and you're already past that you're
02:10 - trying you're doing a thing
02:12 - it's brave you've said i'm
02:16 - whatever your goal is i'm sticking to my
02:18 - goal of learning these modern technical
02:20 - skills and i'm bringing other people
02:21 - with me
02:22 - you already win bringing
02:25 - new people in will happen over time
02:30 - you're awesome that's all i have i don't
02:33 - want to
02:34 - go on for much longer um you know where
02:36 - to find
