00:00 - hi i'm rob i'm a developer and i'm here to teach 
you about http request you've worked with http all  
00:07 - the time when accessing a site loading its content 
and interacting with its content in this video  
00:13 - you'll learn about the different processes that 
take place to make these actions on the internet  
00:17 - work smoothly http stands for hypertext transfer 
protocol and is used to structure requests and  
00:24 - responses over the internet the transfer 
of resources happens using tcp transmission  
00:29 - control protocol in viewing web pages tcp manages 
the channels between your browser and the server  
00:36 - in this case codecademy.com tcp is used to manage 
many types of internet connections in which one  
00:42 - computer or device wants to send something to 
another http is the command language that the  
00:48 - devices on both sides of the connection must 
follow in order to communicate when you type an  
00:53 - address such as codecademy.com into your browser 
you are commanding it to open a tcp channel  
00:59 - to the server that responds to that url in this 
situation your browser which is making the request  
01:05 - is called the client the url you are requesting 
is the address that belongs to the server once  
01:11 - the tcp connection is established the client sends 
an http get request to the server to retrieve the  
01:18 - web page it should display after the server has 
sent the response it closes the tcp connection  
01:25 - get requests are one kind of http method a client 
can call they retrieve an existing resource from a  
01:31 - server post request create new resources put 
requests edit an existing resource finally  
01:37 - delete requests delete an existing resource let's 
explore an example of how get requests the most  
01:43 - common type of requests are used to help your 
browser the client access resources on the web  
01:49 - suppose you want to check out the latest course 
offerings from codecademy.com after you type the  
01:54 - url into your browser your browser will extract 
the http part and recognize that it is the name  
02:00 - of the network protocol to use then it will 
take the domain name from the url in this case  
02:05 - codecademy.com and ask the internet domain name 
server to return an internet protocol ip address  
02:13 - now the client knows the destination's ip address 
and then opens a connection to the server at that  
02:18 - address using the http protocol as specified 
it will initiate a get request to the server  
02:24 - which contains the ip address of the host and 
optionally a data payload the get request contains  
02:30 - the following text this identifies the type of 
request the path and the protocol http version 1.1  
02:40 - the second line of the request contains the 
address of the server which is www.codecademy.com  
02:46 - there may be additional lines depending 
on what data your browser chooses to send  
02:50 - if the server is able to locate the path 
requested the server might send a response back  
02:56 - in the response it could have a header http 1.1 
that states it is the http 1.1 protocol and it has  
03:05 - the status number of 200 and ok meaning there are 
no issues with the request this header is followed  
03:11 - by the content requested which in this case is 
the information needed to render codecademy.com  
03:18 - in this case content type text html meaning it's 
sending back information in the form of text and  
03:25 - html if the server is not able to locate the path 
requested by the client it will respond with this  
03:31 - header which means that the server identifies that 
it understands the http protocol but the 404 not  
03:38 - found status code signifies that the specific 
piece of content requested was not found this  
03:44 - might happen if the content was moved or if you 
typed in the url path incorrectly or if the page  
03:50 - was removed since your http requests can be read 
by anyone at certain network junctures it might  
03:57 - not be a good idea to deliver information such as 
your credit card or password using this protocol  
04:03 - fortunately many servers support https short for 
http secure which allows you to encrypt data that  
04:11 - you send and receive thanks for taking a look at 
http request with me we were able to cover how tcp  
04:18 - allows a client to connect with a server and 
how http allows us to structure requests and  
04:24 - responses we learned about the different types 
of requests get post put and delete we took a  
04:30 - look at http message properties and response 
headers we saw that a status number of 200 and  
04:35 - ok means that there are no issues with the 
request while a 404 status signifies that  
04:41 - a specific piece of content requested was not 
found finally we saw http secure which allows  
04:48 - you to encrypt data that you send and receive
