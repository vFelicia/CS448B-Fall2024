00:01 - in this video I'd like to talk about CSS
00:04 - selectors
00:06 - now of course CSS is key to styling HTML
00:09 - pages and selectors are key to CSS
00:14 - CSS is what makes it possible to
00:16 - selectively style an individual element
00:18 - and completely ignore the other ones on
00:21 - the on that page and one of the
00:23 - mechanisms that support this
00:25 - architecture is of course the selector
00:28 - selectors are are actually patterns that
00:31 - developers can use to Target certain
00:34 - elements that they wish to style
00:37 - so in HTML whenever we code an element
00:41 - there are usually lots of other
00:44 - attributes and values and things like
00:46 - that we put alongside the name of the of
00:49 - the HTML tag itself so for example we we
00:52 - can attach a class to a particular
00:55 - element we can attach an ID and name
00:57 - these are all selectors
00:59 - but what I want to focus on in this
01:02 - video are those attribute equal values
01:05 - those attributes that we add to HTML
01:08 - elements
01:09 - those are not so common and but they
01:12 - provide excellent value when it comes to
01:15 - selecting things on a webpage
01:20 - so whenever we have an element and we
01:23 - have some kind of an attribute attached
01:25 - to that element we can or just simply
01:28 - looking or searching for that attribute
01:30 - it is already a selector in itself so
01:32 - for example we might be searching for
01:34 - all of the classes that that exist on
01:36 - the page and if there is a class then we
01:38 - can apply a particular style to it or we
01:41 - can search for IDs Etc there we can
01:43 - search specific value that that
01:45 - attribute has so for example the
01:48 - attribute is on the left the value is on
01:49 - the right and we can search for all of
01:51 - those elements that have that specific
01:53 - value
01:55 - we can even search with a wildcard value
01:58 - so for example if an attribute exists on
02:00 - the page and it contains a few letters
02:03 - let's say then we can search for
02:05 - anything with the value that has those
02:09 - letters in it
02:10 - now the wildcard value is very similar
02:13 - to searching for a specific value inside
02:17 - of a list so for example we may have a
02:21 - particular pattern of letters that we're
02:23 - looking for and we're simply searching
02:25 - to see if that exists so so value in the
02:27 - list and wildcard value are very similar
02:30 - we can also search for a particular
02:32 - pattern that starts the value part of
02:35 - the attribute so for example if it
02:37 - starts with the letter v a l then we
02:39 - know that we want to select those
02:41 - particular elements
02:43 - and there are a couple more like these
02:45 - but these are the more important ones
02:49 - there are some newer types of selectors
02:52 - so for example combinators combinators
02:55 - the designer to Target two or more
02:57 - elements that share a single parent
03:00 - it allows the designer or developer to
03:03 - Target specific columns for example that
03:05 - that are part of a table
03:08 - there are also pseudo-class selectors
03:10 - and these are really special in that
03:12 - they don't really Target the element
03:14 - itself
03:15 - but what they look for what they listen
03:17 - for is the state of a particular element
03:21 - for example if the element is being
03:23 - hovered over
03:25 - or maybe a link has already been visited
03:28 - so these are the kinds of states that
03:31 - these selectors will Target
03:33 - pseudo element type of selectors will
03:35 - Target items in a list allowing the
03:37 - designer to focus on a specific item in
03:40 - that list even if we have 100 of them we
03:42 - can focus on just one in the list
03:45 - and of course a typical example of this
03:48 - would be displaying data from a database
03:50 - we never know how many lines there are
03:54 - but with CSS we can Target for example
03:56 - the first item in that list the last
03:59 - item or somewhere in between
04:03 - so my purpose of showing you this
04:05 - particular slide is to show you and make
04:07 - you aware that there are new CSS
04:10 - selectors appearing all the time and
04:12 - that you should be aware of them
