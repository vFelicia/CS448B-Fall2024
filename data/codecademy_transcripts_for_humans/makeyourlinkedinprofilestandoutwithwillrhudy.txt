01:01 - will rudy i work here at codecademy as a
01:04 - senior technical recruiter um here i
01:06 - mainly focus on supporting some of our
01:08 - engineering teams uh as well as some of
01:10 - our devops and product teams
01:13 - but uh background has been in technical
01:15 - recruiting for the last couple years i
01:17 - uh live in boston originally from the
01:19 - midwest but uh boston's been home for
01:22 - the last 10 years and so worked at a
01:24 - couple different kinds of companies i
01:26 - started in an agency i was working at uh
01:30 - chewy.com when they moved up to boston i
01:32 - was their 42nd employee there which was
01:34 - a lot of fun um worked at a couple
01:36 - startups worked at some larger ed tech
01:38 - companies and uh you know
01:41 - wanted to come to code academy because i
01:42 - really believe in the mission i was
01:43 - actually a learner years ago i was a
01:46 - technical recruiter i thought it'd be a
01:47 - good idea to learn what i was talking
01:48 - about a little bit more and uh probably
01:50 - not going to hire myself anytime soon
01:52 - but uh it's fun to learn a little bit
01:54 - and uh i've picked up my code foundation
01:56 - since i came back so um all right it's a
01:58 - lot of fun
01:59 - dropping uh dropping the knowledge right
02:01 - from the beginning guys you heard it uh
02:03 - he was researching i mean not
02:05 - researching but you knew about the the
02:07 - place you wanted to work at before you
02:08 - applied for it i think that's like uh
02:11 - one of the pro tips that we are always
02:12 - sharing here every week is if you are
02:15 - applying applying to a place make sure
02:17 - that you know what they're about make
02:19 - sure that you know basics of what they
02:21 - do because it's just gonna make you look
02:23 - better so
02:25 - today's focus uh with you will is we
02:29 - wanted to talk a bit about linkedin and
02:31 - the role that linkedin plays in jobs i
02:34 - know that a lot of learners here
02:36 - especially if you are is your first time
02:37 - your career switcher is your first time
02:39 - applying for a job you might be
02:41 - wondering how much does linkedin matter
02:45 - compared to
02:46 - a traditional resume a traditional cover
02:48 - letter or some people might think well
02:51 - you know do recruiters search for
02:53 - candidates on linkedin or is this just a
02:55 - showcase place where i share it like do
02:57 - i share this or do other people share
02:59 - with it so
03:01 - let's just get started and um i'm just
03:03 - gonna start with a really basic question
03:05 - which is
03:07 - will can you tell us a little bit about
03:09 - the role of linkedin when it comes to
03:12 - its place in the traditional application
03:14 - process of having a cover letter having
03:16 - a resume linkedin how how does linkedin
03:19 - compare and stack against the others
03:22 - yeah yeah so i definitely think it's a
03:25 - you know you want to kind of cover your
03:26 - bases and kind of
03:28 - work at a couple different angles so the
03:30 - resumes and the cover letters are great
03:31 - when you're being proactive when you
03:33 - know that there's a company out there
03:34 - that you know you're really passionate
03:36 - about you'd like to work there always
03:38 - great to have those ready to go but the
03:40 - nice thing about a linkedin is it's
03:42 - there
03:43 - maybe a little bit more as a passive
03:45 - resume in a sense because there are
03:48 - technical recruiters like me at every
03:50 - company out there that's hiring software
03:52 - engineers or they're working with an
03:53 - agency to hire software engineers and
03:56 - the main place that a lot of us go to
03:58 - look or at least to start when we're
04:00 - searching for new candidates is going to
04:02 - be linkedin obviously we'll be going
04:05 - through resumes and cover letters as
04:07 - well but usually um especially for very
04:10 - hyper-focused roles or specific
04:12 - experiences we are being very proactive
04:15 - and going out and looking for those
04:17 - types of folks and so having a linkedin
04:20 - it just is going to give you a lot more
04:21 - options and so it's definitely my first
04:23 - place to start it's not the only there's
04:25 - other sites out there but in terms of
04:27 - just you know again being that place to
04:30 - start and uh kind of get my feet wet is
04:32 - why i learn a little bit about the role
04:34 - um it's it's imperative and there's not
04:36 - really a replacement at that at this
04:37 - point
04:39 - okay and do you uh when you're looking
04:41 - at these linkedin profiles i know
04:42 - there's a lot of fields so you can
04:44 - personalize on linkedin so you can have
04:45 - a banner image like a splash at the top
04:47 - you can have your profile uh i'm
04:49 - assuming that all these things sort of
04:51 - like
04:52 - make your image to that recruiter and
04:56 - you know i hate to say it and a lot of
04:57 - people think that's unfair but that
04:59 - first impression that you get from
05:00 - someone uh you're trying not to be
05:02 - biased towards that but i would imagine
05:04 - that putting more effort into linkedin
05:06 - it's better than putting less effort
05:08 - into your linkedin right because i've
05:09 - seen some very bare bones yes yes no for
05:12 - sure for sure it's definitely you know
05:14 - the first impression you're exactly
05:15 - right it's it's the first thing that i
05:18 - see as a recruiter and so i think it's
05:20 - definitely just a place to let your
05:21 - personality shine you know that's not to
05:23 - say that you need to have a loud and
05:25 - verbose profile you know if you are more
05:27 - of a minimalistic person then it's
05:29 - totally cool but at the same time i
05:31 - would definitely you know be thorough
05:33 - and you know adding those banners or a
05:36 - picture if you're comfortable you know
05:37 - those things just help personalize you
05:39 - because you know at the end of the day
05:41 - you know it's it's a people-to-people
05:42 - kind of relationship and so the more
05:44 - that you can kind of just let yourself
05:46 - um you know be highlighted and showcased
05:49 - uh it's gonna be helpful because at the
05:51 - end of the day
05:52 - you know you being yourself and the
05:54 - company being themselves if that links
05:56 - up you know that's really kind of what
05:58 - would be perfect and and so i really
06:00 - don't think you know trying to do too
06:02 - much uh would be to your benefit you
06:04 - know it's definitely just a good place
06:06 - to let your own personality out whatever
06:08 - that looks like
06:09 - and this uh does things like for example
06:11 - i know that uh a linkedin profile might
06:13 - show you the activity of someone on
06:15 - linkedin how much does that play a role
06:17 - when you're looking at a profile because
06:18 - i know that some people create the
06:20 - linkedin and they just kind of it's kind
06:21 - of like a go and forget it they just
06:22 - make it and that's it it's going there
06:24 - like that's that's influence does that
06:26 - influence your your take on a candidate
06:28 - when you see that maybe they're more
06:30 - active on linkedin or they've had
06:32 - references added there or they have uh
06:34 - you know different uh i think uh what's
06:36 - it called when when someone kind of like
06:37 - vouches for you recommendation
06:39 - recommendations so so do all those
06:41 - things also matter or you're just
06:43 - looking for general information when
06:44 - you're looking i think they definitely
06:45 - help i really try to get a holistic view
06:47 - so um you know usually some recruiters
06:49 - will start at the top some will start at
06:51 - the bottom but those recommendations are
06:53 - always really helpful because they're
06:54 - essentially living references um and so
06:57 - i always appreciate when people write
06:58 - them for me vice versa if i have a great
07:00 - experience i try to write them as well
07:02 - it's definitely good practice um to help
07:04 - your fellow
07:06 - job seekers out in terms of being able
07:08 - to if you have recommendations to share
07:09 - them but no i think when i when i come
07:12 - across a profile that looks like it
07:14 - hasn't been updated in five years it's
07:16 - probably not what i'm gonna spend a lot
07:17 - of time looking at and so
07:19 - um usually when i go there i'm looking
07:21 - for you know the relevant information
07:23 - recent experience and then you know
07:25 - breaking down some of the key things
07:26 - that that i know our company is looking
07:29 - for and kind of basically trying to see
07:32 - um just where that is and try to find
07:34 - candidates that have enough of the
07:36 - pieces that could be you know a
07:38 - potential fit because at the end of the
07:40 - day you don't need to have you know
07:42 - every single piece of information about
07:44 - your background on linkedin if anything
07:45 - it's probably best to you know focus on
07:48 - your strengths and so you know when i'm
07:51 - looking at profiles i'm looking at
07:53 - you know not only companies and
07:54 - longevity but also you know what kind of
07:56 - projects have you been working on you
07:58 - know are any chance that you have to
08:01 - give some kind of ownership or if you've
08:03 - you know really led something those are
08:05 - the things that really kind of stick out
08:06 - and so i think when people take the time
08:09 - to at least you know put a couple
08:11 - sentences add a couple uh you know
08:13 - bullet points to to your careers not
08:15 - only will it set you up for success in
08:17 - the future but once you do it once you
08:19 - know that experience isn't going to
08:20 - change too too much so it's just sort of
08:22 - that living record and so it's it's easy
08:24 - to do it ahead of time than to try to
08:26 - play ketchup
08:27 - and uh as a recruiter since you like you
08:30 - mentioned you go through uh resumes a
08:32 - lot um i would imagine that it is a good
08:35 - practice for people especially in tech
08:36 - roles to maybe include a link in their
08:40 - pdf cover or like resume uh to the
08:43 - linkedin profile so maybe if it's a
08:45 - developer or somebody looking for a
08:46 - technical role maybe even to their
08:47 - github repos if they have github repos
08:50 - what is the how does linkedin compare to
08:53 - personal websites i know that some
08:54 - people to showcase hey i'm a web
08:56 - developer so i made a website because i
08:58 - it's what i do how does that compare
09:00 - like is that is that better worse or
09:02 - just about the same level of like how
09:04 - does that compare to oh my linkedin kind
09:06 - of like not great but look i made these
09:08 - personal websites and here's what i
09:09 - really showcase who i am yeah i think
09:11 - they're complimentary i think you
09:13 - definitely you know having both would
09:15 - probably be my preference and i
09:16 - definitely will always click on a link
09:18 - to a personal website for a software
09:20 - engineer that i'm looking you know that
09:21 - came up in one of my searches because
09:23 - you're right it's a great indicator of
09:25 - what someone can actually do i think
09:27 - when i look at a linkedin profile i'm
09:29 - looking for a little bit more of a
09:31 - history versus maybe uh
09:33 - what's going on today or what's been
09:35 - built most recently because usually when
09:37 - i get a role from one of my hiring
09:39 - managers they give me more to go on than
09:42 - just you know a tech stack they're
09:43 - asking you know someone that's had
09:45 - experience you know breaking down a
09:47 - monolith into microservices or you know
09:50 - someone who has been you know a lot with
09:52 - product integration work because usually
09:55 - especially with companies you know at
09:57 - you know a couple hundred or even you
09:59 - know as low as 100 i would say they're
10:01 - going to have enough specialization
10:02 - where the recruiters have a very
10:04 - specific
10:05 - goal in mind in terms of what they're
10:07 - looking for and so i think a linkedin
10:09 - profile is great to have you know the
10:11 - history there but a personal website
10:13 - especially for those web developers or a
10:15 - product designer or anything that would
10:17 - be a little bit more front-end or
10:19 - user-focused it's always great to
10:21 - include you want them to kind of be
10:22 - complimentary as i mentioned because it
10:24 - is great usually if you're a candidate
10:26 - especially if you don't have maybe as
10:28 - much work experience any sort of
10:30 - personal projects will definitely be you
10:33 - know a benefit to your overall candidacy
10:35 - because at the end of the day it's a
10:37 - it's an example of the work even if you
10:38 - don't necessarily have the you know
10:40 - years of experience that uh you know
10:42 - historically is what people are looking
10:44 - for i think what other candid uh not
10:47 - kind of what other guests here on the
10:50 - video live stream said in the past was
10:52 - that
10:53 - uh a poor linkedin profile won't
10:56 - necessarily take away from your
10:57 - application but it doesn't add to it and
11:00 - if you are competing against another
11:01 - five or six strong candidates uh you
11:04 - need every every bit of help that you
11:06 - can get so
11:07 - yeah you know no one no recruiter at
11:09 - least a code academy recruiter won't
11:11 - look at your linkedin page well well
11:12 - this is not great polish polish so we're
11:15 - gonna move on like they're they won't do
11:17 - that but at the same time you're missing
11:18 - another opportunity to showcase who you
11:20 - are and your work your history and why
11:22 - they should pick you over other
11:24 - candidates so i feel like it's one of
11:26 - those places where it's like yeah it
11:27 - won't hurt you but it could definitely
11:28 - help you so you sure it's true
11:31 - yeah especially if you know if you are
11:33 - you know you're happy in your job maybe
11:35 - you're casually interested to hear
11:36 - what's out there it never hurts to have
11:38 - a linkedin profile that can just you
11:40 - know
11:41 - have options because i know that you
11:43 - know as a software engineer or as a
11:45 - technical recruiter you know you're
11:46 - going to get messages and some of them
11:48 - will be interesting some of them won't
11:49 - be when codecademy reached out to me i
11:52 - was very excited i wasn't necessarily
11:53 - looking but it obviously worked out and
11:55 - i was thrilled so i think you can
11:57 - surprise yourself when you take a little
11:59 - bit of time to just keep that linkedin
12:01 - up to date because it's how people like
12:03 - me are going to find you i would agree
12:04 - that um a linkedin you know a less
12:07 - robust linkedin profile probably won't
12:09 - hurt your candidacy but it really cuts
12:11 - down on the chances of me being able to
12:13 - find you because usually i'm looking for
12:15 - a very specific you know boolean search
12:18 - of key tech um pieces that i know we're
12:21 - looking for in terms of a full stack
12:23 - engineer or a back-end engineer and so
12:25 - if you don't put any time or effort into
12:27 - talking about what you've actually been
12:29 - working on you know key languages and
12:31 - frameworks you're probably not going to
12:32 - come up in my search and so that's what
12:35 - i think you can really do yourself the
12:36 - most good is to just highlight that
12:38 - experience that you know you feel most
12:40 - confident about and then
12:42 - eventually a tech recruiter like me or
12:44 - will find you and it'll be a great fit
12:46 - but uh if you don't put anything on
12:47 - there it's gonna be really tough to
12:48 - locate you
12:50 - so what are the basic building blocks of
12:52 - a good linkedin profile are we talking
12:54 - about uh keywords or is it like
12:56 - hashtagging or just normal keywords uh
12:59 - are we talking about uh certain
13:01 - sections of linkedin that should be
13:03 - filled out like i know that it's a
13:04 - biosection a short description there's
13:06 - sections where you can highlight links
13:08 - and when you can you know link to your
13:10 - resumes and all the documents and so
13:12 - what are kind of like the main building
13:14 - blocks of a linkedin profile that will
13:16 - make it more discoverable for people
13:18 - like you recruiters and more
13:20 - likely to be heading searches
13:22 - right yeah so i would definitely say and
13:24 - this is kind of one thing i've just you
13:26 - know always recommend to candidates and
13:27 - i think it's very applicable to this and
13:29 - that's
13:30 - be confident about what you know be
13:32 - honest about what you don't and be very
13:34 - willing and excited to learn if that's
13:36 - what you really you know are interested
13:37 - in doing because nine times out of ten
13:40 - it's going to be very rare that you're
13:41 - going to have every single thing a
13:43 - recruiter is looking for and recruiters
13:44 - know that we're not expecting to come
13:46 - across someone who has every single
13:48 - piece but if you have the
13:50 - main components like for instance when
13:53 - i'm doing a search for a full stack role
13:55 - here at codecademy we have a react front
13:57 - end and so we also have a lot of ruby on
14:00 - rails in the back end so i am looking
14:02 - for someone that has both ruby and react
14:05 - now if you know ruby react in a handful
14:08 - of other languages but you know perhaps
14:11 - ruby and react tend to be the most um
14:13 - comfortable for you that's where you're
14:15 - the most confident that's what i would
14:16 - recommend you highlight and i think
14:19 - a couple years ago maybe even you know
14:21 - 10 15 the whole jack of all trades idea
14:23 - was something that was really sort of
14:25 - kind of you know much more
14:28 - i don't know maybe applicable to some of
14:30 - the roles in my experience companies are
14:32 - looking for specialization so it's good
14:34 - in the beginning to get a lot of
14:35 - exposure but what i would definitely
14:37 - recommend is really highlighting where
14:40 - you feel most comfortable because at the
14:42 - end of the day those are the recruiters
14:43 - that are going to find you and they're
14:45 - the ones that'll be able to set you up
14:46 - for success in terms of being able to go
14:49 - through the technical interviews and so
14:51 - i've talked to candidates over the years
14:53 - and you know they had a lot of languages
14:55 - and a lot of frameworks listed on their
14:57 - resume including the ones i was looking
14:59 - for but at the end of the day it wasn't
15:01 - a great fit on either side because it
15:04 - just wasn't really where their strength
15:05 - lies and so i would definitely focus on
15:08 - you know
15:09 - the work experience you have in terms of
15:11 - your key languages your key frameworks
15:13 - but don't feel the need to list all of
15:15 - them i would really focus on your top
15:17 - couple because those are the ones you're
15:18 - going to need to use in a technical
15:20 - interview you know once you get through
15:21 - the door so definitely there i like the
15:24 - recommendations i always look at them um
15:27 - just to see if it's you know past
15:28 - managers if it's peers because usually
15:31 - if it's a senior level role there might
15:33 - be some mentorship opportunities or
15:35 - responsibilities and so if someone has a
15:38 - recommendation from a peer like that
15:40 - it's something that'll stand out that i
15:42 - will flag to the hiring manager and so
15:44 - when you take the time to invest in in
15:47 - those linkedin profiles and we're only
15:48 - talking 20 25 minutes it's not like you
15:51 - have to write a book um it's just very
15:53 - helpful and will set you up for success
15:54 - maybe not right away today but you'll be
15:57 - surprised especially as you gain more
15:59 - experience um
16:01 - how many more folks will start trickling
16:03 - into your inbox and whether you're
16:05 - looking or not it's great to have
16:07 - options and it's good to just have some
16:08 - experience talking to recruiters i would
16:11 - definitely recommend have some
16:13 - conversations when they come through
16:14 - because it'll give you great practice
16:16 - for when you actually do talk to a
16:17 - company you want to speak with so um but
16:20 - the only way or one of the main ways
16:22 - that conversation will happen is if the
16:24 - recruiter can find you so um
16:27 - really highlighting those key frameworks
16:29 - and languages um talking about
16:31 - leadership and ownership you know those
16:33 - are some of the simple you know
16:34 - specifics i would say but uh but a
16:37 - little bit of time can go a long way
16:38 - especially in terms of you know
16:40 - the roi over years of how many folks
16:43 - will be able to find you so i imagine
16:45 - that uh the way that the search works at
16:46 - linkedin uh when you're writing uh your
16:48 - descriptions or you're writing these
16:50 - fields those become key words right and
16:52 - um it's interesting that you say that
16:54 - you you might want to be a jack of all
16:56 - trades but you need to be focused on
16:58 - something because i
17:00 - you know you often hear the
17:02 - recommendation that you should try to
17:03 - hit as many keywords as possible
17:06 - because when you have all those keywords
17:07 - then you're more likely to show up in
17:09 - everyone's church but it sounds like at
17:11 - the same time you're saying that
17:14 - showing up in everyone's shirt search
17:15 - might be uh what might play against you
17:18 - because the you you might show up in
17:20 - this in this research and there's
17:21 - recruiters and recruiters and they would
17:23 - just say well
17:24 - yeah great i found you but you're not
17:26 - what i'm looking for um
17:28 - so so yes you got them there but they're
17:30 - not you're not really going to that
17:32 - extra step of actually getting called or
17:34 - actually getting messaged right
17:35 - right right and that's where i think
17:37 - playing your strengths really comes into
17:38 - play because yeah you might be able to
17:40 - show up in a lot of searches but you're
17:42 - realistically probably not going to get
17:43 - through a lot of final round interviews
17:45 - if you're trying to cast such a wide net
17:48 - so usually today you know someone
17:50 - focuses as a and when it comes to
17:51 - software engineering you're either you
17:53 - know front end full stack back end and
17:55 - then there's some fun infrastructure
17:57 - stuff these days too and so i definitely
17:59 - recommend
18:00 - having the experience and really
18:02 - highlighting what you're trying to
18:05 - what kind of job you're trying to get
18:06 - you know if you want to be a full stack
18:07 - engineer make sure your resume and your
18:09 - linkedin profile is touching on both
18:11 - front end and back end experience if
18:13 - you're looking for a devops position
18:16 - make sure that you have you know some
18:18 - basic you know public cloud
18:19 - infrastructure work listed there you
18:21 - know aws is a lot of places but azure
18:23 - google cloud a lot of those skills are
18:26 - applicable and most of the time if you
18:28 - have some experience with one you'll
18:29 - probably be able to kind of ramp up in
18:32 - another a little bit more easily and so
18:34 - i definitely recommend you know
18:36 - it's in the best interest as a job
18:38 - seeker to have the highest percentage of
18:40 - conversations based on your experience
18:43 - and so
18:44 - if i would just you know i would rather
18:45 - have five conversations that would lead
18:47 - to four finals then 20 conversations
18:50 - that maybe lead to two
18:52 - okay
18:53 - and i would imagine that the way you
18:55 - look at linkedin is different if you've
18:57 - already had a wrestleman first like i
18:59 - know that uh i've talked to people
19:00 - before that said well i look at that
19:02 - resume and i have like ten seconds six
19:04 - seven seconds to get a resume uh if it
19:06 - looks if it sparks my curiosity and
19:08 - there's a link a hyperlink to linkedin i
19:11 - will click it just to get like a better
19:12 - idea of this candidate so
19:15 - does it change how you look at a
19:17 - linkedin profile when you are doing that
19:18 - has the first step looking for a
19:20 - candidate versus when you're doing that
19:22 - has a feeling after looking at a resume
19:25 - is that do you approach a linkedin
19:26 - profile differently yeah i think when
19:29 - i'm doing you know just some heads down
19:30 - sourcing and just sort of looking at a
19:32 - lot of profiles
19:34 - i definitely focus on the keywords
19:36 - because one thing that happens when
19:37 - you're using a linkedin recruiter is
19:39 - they'll actually populate as highlighted
19:41 - words when you look at a profile and so
19:43 - i can get a quick glimpse at a
19:44 - candidate's just how many you know how
19:46 - many hits you might have on a specific
19:48 - resume at first glance and if you start
19:50 - seeing a lot of that highlight you kind
19:52 - of start reading a little bit more
19:53 - detailed and so i definitely think you
19:55 - know again they complement each other i
19:57 - definitely wouldn't recommend having
19:58 - either a resume or a linkedin but um i
20:01 - do think that it's helpful to just
20:04 - show the exposure and get a little bit
20:06 - more of a
20:07 - variety in terms of where you're
20:09 - actually seeing some of this interest
20:10 - come in because it's great to be
20:12 - proactive and send your resume and cover
20:14 - letters out there but you'd be surprised
20:16 - at who might be able to find you there's
20:17 - definitely companies out there that
20:19 - especially today with software
20:21 - engineering they're hiring remote
20:23 - engineers left and right and that's not
20:25 - something that happened you know three
20:26 - years ago so i think right now
20:29 - as a software engineer or you know
20:31 - soon-to-be software engineer you're
20:33 - gonna have a lot more options than you
20:35 - even think but the only way again you'll
20:37 - have those is if they can find you
20:40 - yeah
20:40 - the i want to switch gears a little bit
20:42 - and i you mentioned that um
20:45 - recruiters reaching out to candidates on
20:48 - linkedin
20:49 - now
20:50 - i've seen messages before my linkedin i
20:52 - have it on my phone and it will pop and
20:54 - say you know you have a notification and
20:55 - i never know what it is if somebody
20:57 - mentioned me in a post or if it's
20:58 - someone said something or if it's one in
21:01 - my inbox um is there is there an
21:04 - etiquette on
21:06 - how long or how fast you need to reply
21:08 - to these recruiters or like what's kind
21:10 - of like the opportunity window like if
21:11 - you if you're looking for candidates and
21:13 - you see somebody you're interested in
21:14 - you message them and say hey i'm with
21:16 - code academy i'm interested blah blah do
21:18 - you want to talk
21:19 - how
21:20 - how many hours or days do do they go by
21:23 - before you just moved on on the search
21:25 - and it's too late for this candid
21:28 - so for me i think it's it's
21:31 - you know once i send that message what i
21:32 - will personally try to do is make sure i
21:34 - have like a follow-up cadence coming and
21:36 - so i'll usually try to send one or two
21:38 - messages per candidate but in terms of
21:40 - when they reply back to me you know the
21:42 - sooner the better the sooner they reply
21:43 - i usually try to have that conversation
21:45 - within you know 24 to 48 hours and then
21:48 - if that conversation goes well they'll
21:50 - be into process and would technically be
21:52 - you know less than a week away from a
21:54 - final so it's really up to the candidate
21:56 - and so
21:57 - a lot of times i'll have messages coming
21:59 - back you know a few days or maybe a week
22:02 - later and so
22:03 - i personally don't hold it against a
22:05 - candidate or really focus too much on
22:08 - whether it came back you know a day late
22:10 - or a week later um if their reply comes
22:13 - in and they look like they can still be
22:15 - a good fit or you know would be
22:16 - interested i'm just going to be looking
22:18 - forward to having a conversation so i
22:20 - don't think the timing matters but it's
22:21 - in your best interest if you are
22:23 - interested in the role to reply sooner
22:25 - than later
22:26 - i guess i guess if you're actively
22:28 - looking for work you should have the app
22:29 - on your phone and be able to uh to get
22:32 - on top of that uh rather quickly
22:34 - um
22:36 - how does it work i know that you can
22:37 - have profiles in different languages on
22:39 - linkedin and i guess this is more of a
22:41 - question of some companies are large
22:43 - enough that they are sourcing from all
22:45 - over the world or they might be able to
22:47 - hire from different parts of the world
22:48 - here in the u.s sometimes it's not
22:50 - unheard of of companies choosing from
22:52 - canada for example which is technically
22:54 - abroad uh even though they're neighbors
22:56 - so
22:57 - um how does it work in terms of these uh
23:00 - these profiles that might be in
23:01 - different languages so maybe people are
23:03 - you know students that are trying to get
23:04 - jobs in the us or they're trying to get
23:06 - work visas uh do the keywords on a
23:09 - search for recruiters work the same or
23:10 - get automatically translated or or if
23:13 - you're looking for a keyword in english
23:15 - it would only highlight the profiles
23:16 - that have it in english
23:18 - that's a great question um i'm not sure
23:21 - just because i don't have a ton of
23:22 - experience sourcing internationally most
23:25 - of my career has been very boston based
23:27 - and so mostly u.s focused i will say i
23:30 - do see translations come through quickly
23:32 - on linkedin so i think sometimes if i
23:34 - were to you know potentially click on a
23:36 - profile um i will see it you know be
23:39 - translated into english so i can read
23:41 - through it but also realistically you
23:44 - know i think it's just um it would if
23:46 - you're looking for jobs in the us you
23:48 - know i think you would definitely you'd
23:50 - be encouraged to to you know be
23:52 - identifiable by those kind of companies
23:53 - as best you can but other than that i
23:56 - don't know exactly if the uh the po if
23:58 - the keywords will translate but uh
24:01 - that's a great question i will show you
24:04 - yeah i know yeah no i'm curious because
24:05 - i know that a lot of our learners are
24:07 - all over the world right and and i
24:09 - always i always like to remind everyone
24:10 - that you know when we talk about
24:12 - recruiting and we talk about practices
24:13 - of recruiting we are talking about them
24:15 - from the point of view of the us and you
24:17 - know recruiting happens at different
24:19 - levels all over the world uh for example
24:21 - i know that in some countries it's
24:23 - typical to include your profile photo in
24:24 - your resume and in the us that's not the
24:27 - case so there's always all these little
24:29 - details and caveats so um i always like
24:32 - to remind everybody that um you know
24:34 - that's why i'm asking these questions
24:35 - like okay if i'm if i'm in europe and
24:38 - i'm planning on trying to get a job in a
24:40 - u.s company how that works well
24:43 - realistically like you said if you're
24:45 - trying to get a job in a place that
24:47 - speaks english you would want to maybe
24:49 - have your wrestling english uh and your
24:52 - profile translator i know that linkedin
24:53 - makes it really easy for you to have
24:55 - your profile in different languages
24:57 - so
24:58 - uh that i guess the the general rule of
25:00 - thumb is
25:01 - have it in english if you can
25:04 - you should definitely get uh yeah i
25:06 - think you will be more identifiable and
25:08 - i think yeah folks will be able to come
25:09 - across your resume a lot or linkedin a
25:11 - lot more easily
25:12 - have you seen any uh
25:15 - kind of like obvious or mistakes that
25:17 - should have been avoided on any linkedin
25:18 - profiles like i know that i'm sure that
25:20 - you go through volumes of linkedin
25:22 - profiles so
25:23 - there must be certain mistakes or
25:25 - certain things that keep occurring and
25:28 - are just reoccurring
25:29 - mistakes that you wish people knew to
25:32 - avoid is there any like top three or
25:34 - something that you could that you can
25:35 - think of there are things that are like
25:37 - don't do this yeah yeah i know that's a
25:39 - great that's a great question i guess
25:41 - the first one might be a little twofold
25:43 - but i mean spelling errors are
25:45 - definitely ones that will pop out the
25:47 - most especially if you mis use the wrong
25:50 - form of principle so principal engineer
25:52 - is al just for future reference so when
25:55 - everyone's later in their career that's
25:56 - a good one because that does come up
25:58 - quite a few times um
26:00 - other types of uh errors that are
26:02 - usually made i would say
26:04 - maybe
26:05 - and it's not something you necessarily
26:06 - need to capture on the linkedin profile
26:08 - but you know sometimes you know there
26:10 - might be a gap in your work experience
26:12 - which is totally fine life happens
26:14 - that's not a deal breaker but i think at
26:16 - least having an explanation for what
26:18 - that looks like not necessarily on
26:19 - linkedin but for the recruiter if they
26:22 - reach out to have a conversation i think
26:24 - that's one thing i always notice i do go
26:26 - through the history just to see okay
26:28 - this then this then this and so if
26:30 - there's a little bit of a gap it will be
26:32 - picked up but again it's not a deal
26:34 - breaker but just be ready to sort of
26:36 - talk through that um
26:38 - assuming that you're comfortable there
26:40 - lastly you know um germany actually one
26:42 - of the recruiters she told me that you
26:44 - can get a little creative and uh people
26:46 - that have had a gap for cobit uh well
26:49 - maybe they lost their jobs at the
26:50 - beginning of the pandemic and then now
26:51 - they're looking for another job and they
26:52 - have that gap in their experience she
26:55 - said that uh people get created with it
26:56 - and sometimes they will set things like
26:58 - uh you know uh travel in the world uh
27:01 - for eight months or you know took a
27:03 - sabbatical or you know covet layoffs
27:05 - like some people like apparently some
27:07 - candidates have started to list kobit
27:10 - has uh has a gap reason so
27:12 - i'm sure that you can get a little
27:13 - creative oh yeah oh yeah no i i
27:16 - definitely can you can get creative
27:18 - there and like i said it's not a deal
27:20 - breaker i just would definitely be ready
27:21 - to kind of chat through what that looks
27:23 - like a little bit um and then you know
27:25 - lastly i would say
27:28 - it's definitely good to have a picture
27:30 - if you're comfortable but i would
27:32 - definitely also be aware of you know the
27:35 - kinds of pictures that you might be
27:36 - sharing of yourself and so in terms of
27:38 - you know you don't need to be overly
27:39 - professional but you probably don't want
27:41 - to be overly casual either and it's a
27:43 - fine line between that and you obviously
27:44 - a culture or a values of a company or a
27:47 - little different when they're uh you
27:48 - know small and more startupy versus you
27:51 - know a large you know big enterprise and
27:53 - so knowing your audience and knowing a
27:55 - little bit about where you're trying to
27:57 - get that job i think you can kind of
27:59 - curate your your profile a little bit to
28:01 - that as well and so i think that also
28:03 - depends on the industry you know some of
28:05 - the expectations there i do enjoy
28:07 - working in tech because i'm very
28:09 - comfortable in t-shirts so um i i i
28:12 - definitely think you know having an idea
28:14 - of of your target audience is is also an
28:17 - important thing because sometimes if if
28:19 - there's a little bit of a disconnect
28:20 - there um it's it's it's a little tough
28:23 - to kind of get over that initial initial
28:25 - bump
28:26 - would you consider something to avoid uh
28:28 - when some people list that experience in
28:30 - the linkedin profile things that don't
28:32 - that barely qualify has experience like
28:34 - sometimes people like i said you know we
28:36 - try to get creative and highlight our or
28:38 - our profiles because we're trying to
28:40 - land jobs
28:41 - and
28:42 - you might see people
28:44 - uh highlighting certain volunteer work
28:46 - or certain things that
28:48 - they basically don't really
28:51 - they're not relevant maybe like if you
28:52 - are a developer and you say that you
28:53 - have experiences in a different field
28:56 - something uh
28:57 - is that something to avoid is that
28:59 - something that you can that you should
29:00 - be comfortable sharing as well what do
29:02 - you think yeah that's a great question
29:03 - and i actually i had this personal
29:05 - experience because i wasn't always a
29:07 - recruiter i was a bartender before i got
29:09 - into the recruiting game and so i had
29:11 - that on my linkedin profile for a little
29:12 - while and then eventually i gained
29:14 - enough experience and i think my career
29:16 - transitioned to the point where i just
29:18 - decided to remove that not because i was
29:20 - embarrassed or anything but because it
29:22 - wasn't really relevant to what i was
29:24 - doing now and what kind of future career
29:26 - i was planning to have and so i
29:28 - definitely think you're you're right
29:29 - there fede in the sense that hey there's
29:31 - a place for volunteer experience on the
29:32 - linkedin profile which is also a great
29:34 - place to add some of that stuff but i
29:37 - will admit sometimes when people get a
29:38 - little cheeky with some of the
29:40 - experience listed
29:41 - it doesn't exactly
29:43 - it doesn't do you any favors i think
29:45 - it's also good to be honest and if you
29:48 - know maybe some some dark humor is how
29:50 - you're honest that's totally fine too
29:52 - but at the same time i think just
29:54 - knowing that audience and you know
29:57 - knowing what really is going to help you
29:59 - land the job and it's not about just
30:02 - making sure there's no gap so you list
30:03 - something that's not very relevant or
30:05 - maybe not work at all i think it's much
30:07 - more important to just you know focus on
30:09 - what you know you really do bring to the
30:11 - table and kind of what you're targeting
30:12 - to get next and you know at the end of
30:14 - the day i think that that's the best
30:17 - yeah i feel like as some people um it's
30:19 - easy to forget that you are being judged
30:22 - on your experience and your and your
30:23 - ability but you are also getting judged
30:25 - on your character and who you are as a
30:27 - person because at the end of the day you
30:28 - will be working on a team with other
30:30 - people and who you are as a person
30:33 - matters just as much as how what you can
30:35 - do as a professional
30:36 - um and i i suppose uh trying to get a
30:39 - little too cheeky or a little too uh
30:42 - not too trusty
30:44 - on certain things like the way you share
30:45 - on your profile that oh it does also
30:48 - shine in a light on the on the kind of
30:50 - candy that you are and it might just it
30:52 - might just deter the recruiter from from
30:55 - saying well this is a person that would
30:56 - fit here like we'll add the value that
30:59 - we're looking for for team in the future
31:00 - right
31:01 - right and at the same time there you
31:03 - know there's definitely going to be
31:05 - cheeky companies out there to you to use
31:07 - the word one more time that maybe we'll
31:09 - really enjoy that and if that's who you
31:10 - are at the end of the day i definitely
31:12 - just would recommend being honest with
31:14 - the profile like don't put a suit on if
31:16 - you're not a suit where don't you know
31:18 - try to make your linkedin profile look
31:20 - like someone else's that you saw you
31:22 - know that you want to try to emulate let
31:24 - your own profile speak for yourself and
31:26 - that's what i try to do that's what i
31:28 - think a lot of other people who maybe
31:30 - don't overthink it and just really kind
31:32 - of let it naturally occur you know
31:34 - that's the best case because at the end
31:36 - of the day you want to be your authentic
31:37 - self because if you're not you're
31:39 - probably you know going to be setting
31:41 - yourself up for a little disappointment
31:42 - even if you get the job because they're
31:44 - going to be expecting you to be someone
31:46 - who you've been performing for the last
31:48 - couple months and so definitely just
31:50 - highlight your real experience and be
31:52 - yourself both in terms of you know the
31:54 - type of profile you create and the way
31:56 - you describe yourself because there are
31:58 - a lot of companies out there i think
31:59 - there are certain strategies that will
32:01 - give you more options that are going to
32:03 - be a little bit more applicable to just
32:05 - a larger group of companies but
32:07 - if you prefer to be you know
32:09 - an odd duck and just look for those odd
32:11 - duck companies just being on duck that's
32:13 - totally fine too but you know you might
32:15 - have a little bit of a limited options
32:16 - there
32:18 - and what do you think about um
32:20 - i'm sure a lot of people that will watch
32:22 - this video are beginners or they're
32:24 - junior they're looking for junior
32:25 - positions or you know software engineer
32:27 - one depending on where you work and how
32:29 - they call it different companies call it
32:30 - differently
32:31 - um these kind of uh candidates you often
32:34 - struggle to get their foot in the door
32:36 - because they don't have relevant
32:37 - experience and and they struggle to
32:40 - showcase what they can do without that
32:42 - relevant experience so what are your
32:44 - thoughts when you look at a linkedin
32:45 - profile and you see that there might be
32:47 - no relevant experience if you're looking
32:49 - to source somebody in a junior role or
32:51 - maybe
32:52 - uh what are your thoughts on them
32:54 - listing volunteer work has relevant
32:56 - experience
32:57 - yeah so i think
32:59 - it's the whole chicken before the egg
33:00 - thing right and it's it's it's very
33:02 - difficult it's something that's been in
33:04 - existence for a while you need
33:05 - experience to get the job how are you
33:06 - going to get the job without any
33:07 - experience and so i definitely i've seen
33:09 - it a lot and i would say you know in
33:12 - terms of what to list on a resume you
33:13 - know especially these days i see a lot
33:15 - of people highlighting their open source
33:17 - contributions which i think is helpful
33:19 - um especially whether it's a github or
33:21 - whether you have been participating in
33:23 - some of these other type of development
33:25 - initiatives having links there
33:27 - especially you know for me to share with
33:29 - my hiring manager obviously i'm not
33:31 - going to be evaluating the code but if i
33:33 - see that it exists it implies to me that
33:35 - this person at least has enough desire
33:37 - and drive to be proactive and go a
33:39 - little bit above and beyond and so i'll
33:41 - usually share that and if it's great
33:42 - code the person you know the engineering
33:44 - manager will see it and then they'll let
33:45 - me know hey i know this person doesn't
33:47 - have a ton of experience but this looks
33:49 - great let's have a conversation and so i
33:51 - think listing some of you know that type
33:54 - of work um even if it's boot camp stuff
33:56 - you know that's applicable it shows what
33:57 - you can do and i also think that you
34:00 - know as companies continue to grow
34:02 - they're gonna have some some difference
34:05 - of uh priorities so some quarters they
34:07 - might be a little more focused on
34:08 - seniority sometimes maybe they're
34:10 - looking to just build up a few other
34:12 - teams and they'll be able to hire more
34:14 - you know entry level or software
34:16 - engineer once and so i think having the
34:19 - experience that you do have listed and
34:21 - really focusing on some of that extra
34:23 - work that you've done is is going to
34:25 - help you get your foot in the door it's
34:26 - going to be difficult i i'm not going to
34:28 - you know i'm not going to sugarcoat that
34:30 - but um
34:32 - taking the initiative there and another
34:33 - thing don't be scared of contract work i
34:36 - was a contractor before i had a
34:37 - full-time job and it helped me realize
34:39 - kind of how i was going to start
34:41 - building a career and so especially as
34:43 - software engineers or product designers
34:46 - you know there's sites out there that
34:47 - like upwork i've used i've seen before
34:50 - and so there are places out there
34:51 - that'll offer you some contract work
34:53 - that maybe isn't going to be the most
34:54 - interesting but you do a couple of those
34:56 - boom you've got a year and a half two
34:58 - years of experience and then you're you
35:00 - know potentially available for a
35:02 - mid-level software engineer role and so
35:04 - it's tough to get started but once you
35:07 - do it'll start to snowball and before
35:08 - you know it you'll have that year or two
35:11 - that'll help you kind of get more feet
35:13 - in the door so it's it's always tough in
35:15 - the beginning it'll get easier i promise
35:18 - it's just it sounds like uh it sounds
35:20 - like uh like you were saying
35:22 - it's a holistic view of the candidate
35:24 - and uh i know that uh
35:26 - i like to remind everybody watching this
35:28 - that when a company is looking for to
35:31 - fill a role they have sort of like a
35:33 - mold of what they're looking for right
35:35 - so you're trying to fit that mold but at
35:37 - the same time uh there's always wiggle
35:39 - room and
35:40 - they if you hear back from a recruiter
35:42 - or if somebody hits you up on linkedin
35:44 - or whatever it is that means that you've
35:46 - shown enough that they're interested in
35:48 - having a conversation with you so
35:49 - sometimes you have to trust yourself and
35:51 - get over that um
35:53 - impostor syndrome that a lot of us have
35:55 - saying you know i'm a fake or i don't
35:57 - really know i didn't get formal
35:58 - education on this or i didn't get formal
36:00 - training on that um i know that
36:02 - sometimes and volunteering work uh like
36:04 - you said if you can showcase that that
36:06 - work is yours or like at the end of the
36:07 - day like if you just list some random
36:10 - project that you worked on and it's not
36:12 - clear what your role was in the project
36:13 - it's not clear what your
36:14 - responsibilities were in the project
36:16 - it's less likely to help you and if you
36:18 - can definitely show you know i was in
36:20 - charge of this i wrote this code this is
36:22 - what i did right
36:24 - it always so like don't be so afraid of
36:26 - the labels right like it's not a fancy
36:28 - company it's not a fancy but but it is
36:30 - experience and it is showing what you
36:32 - can do right
36:34 - right and just getting getting a few of
36:35 - those early reps um you can become a lot
36:38 - more selective once you get some of
36:39 - those out of the way so it's definitely
36:41 - good to especially right after you know
36:43 - when you're
36:44 - initially starting as a as a software
36:46 - engineer take take some of that initial
36:48 - experience you know have you know try to
36:50 - have fun but really just know that
36:51 - you're kind of paying your dues a little
36:53 - bit and you'll be surprised at how
36:55 - selective you can be in a couple years
36:57 - because software engineering is a
36:59 - ridiculously in-demand skill set and
37:01 - it's not going anywhere and so i think
37:03 - anybody who's on that path is is doing
37:05 - themselves a great service it might be a
37:07 - little slow out of the gate it'll pay
37:09 - dividends if i was better at math i
37:11 - would probably be a software engineer
37:15 - what about the
37:17 - what about the opposite what is what is
37:19 - the uh the etiquette per se when
37:21 - you are actively looking for a role at a
37:23 - company maybe they have some open roles
37:24 - that you're interested in and we often
37:26 - talk about researching the companies
37:28 - that you want to work for and trying to
37:30 - build your network trying to reach out
37:32 - so what is sort of etiquette if someone
37:34 - let's say we have an open role in a
37:36 - back-end engineer and you get a message
37:38 - tonight from someone on linkedin saying
37:40 - hey i see that you're a technical
37:41 - recruiter at code academy and i'm
37:43 - interested in these roles i want to talk
37:44 - more about this is it like what's the
37:47 - line of being polite and inquiring on a
37:50 - of an interesting work versus
37:53 - not being polite or like you know doing
37:55 - it wrong and taking away from that
37:57 - chance yeah no i mean i definitely think
37:59 - you should be as proactive as again you
38:02 - feel comfortable with but i think also
38:03 - be realistic and so if you think you're
38:06 - a great fit for the role and you are a
38:08 - great fit then feel free be confident
38:10 - reach out to that recruiter i get
38:12 - sometimes engineers you know with a with
38:14 - a linkedin request like a friend request
38:16 - or a networking request and so sometimes
38:18 - they'll include hey i saw you know this
38:20 - particular job would love to hear a
38:21 - little bit more about it if you think my
38:23 - background could be a fit and i always
38:25 - you know will click on the resume that
38:26 - they share with me or just click into
38:28 - their linkedin profile and take a look
38:30 - and if they you know could be a fit then
38:32 - i'll definitely have that conversation
38:33 - but what i would avoid is you know
38:36 - potentially you know maybe spamming uh
38:38 - some other recruiters in the sense of
38:40 - going for roles that are just really far
38:43 - afield and that probably aren't going to
38:44 - be you know within your wheelhouse for
38:46 - you know a little bit of time at least
38:48 - because as much as people like to say
38:50 - hey i can learn really quick
38:52 - there you know there are certain things
38:54 - at companies especially at that you know
38:56 - some mid to definitely at senior level
38:58 - where they won't be able to take a risk
39:00 - on someone having to learn that you know
39:02 - they're going to be waiting and looking
39:03 - for someone who really can kind of hit
39:05 - the ground running and so definitely
39:07 - feel free to reach out to recruiters but
39:09 - you know just like you don't want them
39:10 - to waste your time i would say you know
39:12 - don't be overly zealous if it's uh not
39:15 - really a great fit
39:16 - okay i mean that's fair i've always
39:18 - spamming if you if somebody mess if you
39:20 - message someone and they don't get back
39:22 - to you within an hour don't message them
39:24 - again and give them some time they're
39:26 - busy don't
39:36 - okay so so it's totally fine but just do
39:38 - it with do it we're always in the
39:40 - context of
39:41 - there is a time frame there is an
39:43 - interest and you don't even know if the
39:45 - role that you are interested in it has
39:46 - been filled or if it's in the last
39:47 - stages or getting failed so always with
39:50 - that with a kind of like grain of salt
39:52 - or saying you know you can try but there
39:54 - is no guarantees and you should always
39:55 - keep that in mind that
39:57 - there's only so much you can do
39:59 - right exactly definitely you know apply
40:01 - on the company's website and then the
40:03 - next step maybe yeah reach out to one of
40:05 - the recruiters if you see them
40:07 - especially if you maybe have a
40:08 - connection request with them um you know
40:11 - i think building your network you know
40:13 - maybe as a another last takeaway is
40:15 - definitely something you know i i
40:16 - definitely accept a lot of uh you know
40:18 - linkedin requests especially folks that
40:20 - i've previously worked with or
40:21 - candidates that maybe i've had
40:22 - conversations with maybe they didn't get
40:24 - a job but it's a small world and i've
40:26 - definitely spoken to people at you know
40:28 - several companies and they've kind of
40:30 - you know been able to follow me where i
40:31 - go places and vice versa and so um there
40:34 - is a nice symbiosis that can exist
40:36 - between recruiters and engineers
40:38 - and so it's just a matter about kind of
40:40 - finding that right fit but uh keeping
40:42 - your options open and being honest with
40:43 - yourself i would say
40:45 - and have you ever come across anyone
40:47 - that might be a bit more sales when it
40:48 - comes to their online privacy i mean in
40:50 - the last few years we've seen leaks data
40:52 - leaks you know social media leaks so
40:56 - i i can imagine that it's not out of the
40:58 - realm of possibility that some of these
40:59 - candidates say look i don't have social
41:00 - media and i don't have a linkedin either
41:02 - because i'm trying to limit my footprint
41:04 - online um is that have you come across
41:07 - anyone like that or like do you think
41:08 - that that would be kind of like a
41:10 - a harder
41:12 - candidate to
41:13 - scout or to to get like what happens if
41:16 - you are that kind of person that is more
41:18 - you know worried about your private
41:19 - online it's really not something that's
41:21 - you know you're not going to end up on
41:23 - some amazon mailing list whether you
41:24 - give your recruiter a cell phone uh so i
41:27 - i definitely think you know as you feel
41:29 - comfortable you know sharing is is
41:31 - probably the best way to go
41:33 - okay
41:34 - um i think
41:36 - i apologize i think youtube just told me
41:38 - that there was like a slight gap there
41:40 - in the answer maybe for like a second or
41:42 - two i think you didn't miss too much
41:43 - information sorry everybody uh well i
41:46 - think i i asked a lot of questions today
41:48 - you've shared a lot of good uh insights
41:51 - on how recruiters think and what
41:52 - recruiters are looking for when they are
41:54 - using linkedin as a tool for scouting
41:56 - candidates and communicating with them
41:58 - so
41:59 - do you have any general thoughts or
42:01 - anything that you would like to share
42:02 - before we pass to the q a
42:05 - no no i think uh i think that this is a
42:07 - a fun conversation for me it's it's nice
42:09 - to sort of think about you know the day
42:10 - to day a little bit more um i think i
42:13 - would just really bring it back to to
42:14 - being honest with yourself and putting
42:16 - out that honest persona because you want
42:18 - canada you want companies to find you
42:20 - where you can be yourself vice versa i
42:22 - think i've seen too many times where
42:24 - people try to perform in a way that they
42:26 - think the company is looking for
42:29 - it doesn't end well you know even if the
42:31 - job does that they do get the job they
42:33 - don't stick around very long so it's in
42:34 - your best interest to just put your
42:36 - honest foot forward and the companies
42:38 - that you know you'll want to work for
42:39 - and feel comfortable they'll find you
42:41 - and vice versa you know if you're
42:43 - proactive i think you'll be able to find
42:44 - them too
42:45 - you know it's interesting that you bring
42:47 - that up because uh last week
42:49 - we're talking just about that about how
42:51 - far you can mold yourself to fit a
42:54 - certain role or hit certain requirements
42:56 - or or must-haves and how far you can
42:59 - mold yourself to that before you're
43:01 - sacrificing who you are as a person then
43:03 - you're gonna have a bad time uh i think
43:05 - this comes often with tech with the big
43:07 - tech companies the fang companies where
43:09 - people say well you know
43:11 - i don't care if it's a six month burnout
43:12 - rate i don't care if people get in and
43:15 - out of there like a revolving door the
43:16 - moment i put that in my resume that i've
43:18 - been there for 18 months that's it dan's
43:21 - done deal i'm gonna get a job whatever i
43:22 - want and uh it seems to it seems to be a
43:26 - big problem uh in tech where people
43:28 - might be willing to put up with a lot or
43:30 - might be willing to say yes to a lot of
43:31 - things during a recruiting uh you know
43:34 - uh process
43:35 - even if they are not okay with the
43:37 - compensation they're not okay with the
43:38 - hours they're not okay with how company
43:40 - does a or b
43:41 - just because they they just want to have
43:43 - it on the rest of them so i think it's
43:45 - interesting like you said you know you
43:47 - you have to also keep in mind
43:49 - where you're going to work and why
43:51 - exactly exactly that's why it's always
43:53 - best to be yourself easiest rule
43:56 - okay easiest rule well i'm gonna look at
43:58 - the chat see if we have any questions
44:00 - here that we might have missed during
44:02 - our conversation i'm gonna scroll up
44:04 - um
44:05 - let's see
44:15 - okay yeah so one of the first questions
44:17 - was just wondering about you know how to
44:19 - make a perfect linkedin profile i would
44:21 - imagine that there's no perfect linkedin
44:22 - profile depends on the role but uh
44:25 - uh if you want to maybe uh summarize
44:27 - like you said before some of the main
44:30 - areas to shine in your profile i think
44:31 - you mentioned uh recommendations from
44:33 - other users being important
44:35 - yeah so in terms of you know really high
44:38 - level takeaways definitely the
44:39 - recommendations are helpful um
44:40 - especially because it's a it's just a
44:43 - living reference and so i think for
44:44 - recruiters and you know future hiring
44:46 - managers it's a great sort of insight
44:49 - into what you kind of would bring to the
44:51 - table or some of your past experience um
44:53 - i would also recommend being concise
44:56 - when you're describing sort of your your
44:59 - your best
45:00 - characteristics or strongest strengths
45:02 - because if you end up casting that
45:04 - really wide net and listing a million
45:06 - different languages and frameworks you
45:07 - might get a lot of you know recruiters
45:10 - reaching out to you but they might not
45:11 - be really a fit for what you want to do
45:13 - and so definitely highlight you know the
45:16 - key you know strengths that you bring to
45:18 - the table as well as any opportunities
45:20 - that you've had to really own a project
45:22 - take the lead mentor some other
45:23 - engineers those are some of the kind of
45:26 - keywords that although i'm not
45:27 - necessarily including in a boolean
45:29 - search i'm noticing when i'm reading
45:31 - kind of next to all the languages and
45:33 - frameworks because a lot of times
45:35 - especially the company like codecademy
45:36 - you know we only have you know 220
45:38 - people that work here so people tend to
45:40 - work on multiple projects help out in
45:42 - different ways and so when you have the
45:45 - ability to be flexible like that um
45:48 - it's just gonna set you up more for
45:49 - success and so the recommendations um i
45:52 - guess also lastly you know the picture
45:54 - if you feel comfortable i think is great
45:56 - but that's a personal opinion i think
45:57 - it's everyone's specific you know
46:00 - preference but
46:01 - to help personalize it you know i think
46:03 - we live on screens these days which can
46:05 - be a little tough and so you know i
46:06 - always hope people know i'm a person on
46:08 - the other side and not some robot
46:10 - sending spam messages and i think yeah
46:11 - vice versa it's probably helpful when uh
46:14 - you know the recruiter can get a sense
46:15 - as to to who you are as well
46:18 - do you uh i think linkedin has like a
46:20 - way for you to take exams and it kind of
46:22 - like adds those to your profile
46:25 - i guess those are nice to have too if
46:27 - you want to
46:28 - yeah i would say nice to have not a need
46:30 - to have you know i think i know that
46:32 - hiring managers i support will like you
46:34 - know we'll look at aws certification a
46:36 - little bit more um strongly than a
46:39 - linkedin certification now i think that
46:40 - could change over time but yeah
46:42 - definitely nice to have it shows
46:44 - initiative if nothing else but i
46:46 - wouldn't try to you know
46:48 - over emphasize linkedin recommendations
46:50 - at this point compared to what other
46:52 - kind of work you've done
46:54 - okay i see uh javier uh looks like you
46:57 - have a spanish name so i guess it makes
46:58 - sense to this question we have a user
47:01 - asking what are the recommendations to
47:03 - ex to expose your profile to other
47:05 - countries did you
47:08 - did you say companies are hiring
47:09 - remotely so i think this comes into
47:12 - uh javier um just to remind you uh
47:15 - remote work doesn't mean overseas work a
47:17 - lot of times companies are required to
47:20 - have certain uh you know there's laws
47:22 - like labor laws that require you to have
47:25 - work visas and other paperwork so
47:28 - um remote works sometimes uh often times
47:30 - just refers to the fact that you're not
47:32 - in a physical office more than if a
47:35 - more than that you are abroad in a
47:36 - different country but uh just in general
47:40 - i think we touched on that earlier where
47:42 - we said well if you're going to work on
47:44 - a country that speaks a different
47:45 - language than the one you're using it's
47:47 - probably a smart idea to make a profile
47:49 - in in that language right yeah i would
47:51 - definitely agree with that and then one
47:53 - thing i'm pretty sure a lot of people
47:54 - know about this but if you are looking
47:57 - for new work there is a
47:59 - little toggle or a little button you
48:00 - click on linkedin that says open in new
48:02 - opportunities and that allow once you
48:04 - click that it allows you to list some
48:07 - positions that you're interested in list
48:09 - locations and so in terms of javier's
48:11 - question if he's looking for you know
48:13 - specific countries he can list those
48:15 - specific countries and that's where his
48:17 - profile would populate in terms of where
48:20 - the recruiters would be looking for and
48:22 - then there's always also just the
48:23 - opportunity to list a little like
48:25 - personal
48:26 - couple sentences about why or what
48:28 - you're looking for and sometimes there
48:30 - you can really set yourself apart
48:31 - because if you
48:33 - haven't know what you're looking for or
48:35 - have a specific goal in mind and can
48:37 - sort of cav um kind of deliver that
48:40 - succinctly it's helpful because then the
48:42 - recruiter can get a sense as to oh this
48:44 - is a candidate who i could maybe
48:46 - consider for this position so knowing
48:48 - that you can open to new opportunities
48:50 - have that little um adjustment that's a
48:53 - way to definitely kind of get even
48:55 - further up the pecking order in terms of
48:57 - you know sometimes recruiters if they're
48:59 - you know really under the gun and
49:00 - looking for a you know need to kind of
49:03 - engage candidates quickly who do you
49:04 - think they're going to start with it's
49:05 - going to be candidates that are open to
49:07 - new opportunities because they know
49:08 - they're active and so i think being able
49:11 - to
49:12 - toggle that when you need to um
49:14 - especially listing the countries that
49:16 - you are targeting to work at definitely
49:18 - is uh is a great place to start
49:20 - great
49:21 - uh yeah javier is just saying thank you
49:23 - for the feedback yes my mother tongue is
49:24 - spanish yeah i i sounded like it javier
49:27 - so hello
49:28 - um
49:29 - i know that um
49:31 - so like i was mentioning the labor laws
49:33 - and stuff is it is this something that
49:35 - you need to mention in your linkedin uh
49:37 - let's say that you are uh
49:39 - from spain and you want to work in the
49:41 - us and you actually do happen to have a
49:43 - work visa for the us maybe you obtain
49:46 - one is that something that you should
49:47 - list preemptively in a linkedin profile
49:49 - has available to work in the us
49:52 - or is that something that it's more
49:53 - adequate to mention in a in a
49:55 - conversation face-to-face like would a
49:57 - recruiter look at a profile if they
49:59 - don't see that skip over because they
50:01 - assume that that person is not
50:03 - qualified
50:04 - you know able to work in the us
50:06 - yeah so it's a great question i think it
50:08 - probably does differ a little bit
50:09 - country to country company to company
50:11 - but in general i would definitely if you
50:14 - have that um certification that
50:15 - authorization definitely listed it's not
50:18 - going to hurt you to have that listed
50:19 - usually also you know there's only
50:21 - certain things recruiters can ask in
50:23 - terms of like location compensation
50:25 - every state in the us actually has
50:26 - different laws um and so there's only
50:29 - there's some questions that i could ask
50:30 - in new york that i can't ask in
50:31 - massachusetts which is odd but it's
50:33 - they're there and so that's what it is
50:35 - yeah usually location isn't too much of
50:37 - a deal breaker but i think you're going
50:40 - to set yourself up for more
50:41 - opportunities if you you know either
50:44 - list your authorizations or you know
50:46 - target you know your open and new
50:48 - opportunities to specific um countries
50:50 - just because
50:52 - you know it'll be it'll be the most
50:53 - realistic option to hopefully get you
50:56 - so i guess if you're confident i mean it
50:58 - comes down back to privacy again like we
51:00 - were saying before uh if you're
51:01 - confident comfortable sharing that
51:03 - publicly on linkedin on your profile say
51:05 - i'm authorized to work in the us for
51:07 - example i'm authorized to work in
51:09 - colombia i'm authorized to work in japan
51:11 - um i guess if you're comfortable saying
51:14 - that out loud in the on the internet uh
51:17 - then definitely it's not going to hurt
51:18 - you right to add it in your bio so like
51:20 - yeah
51:21 - uh and like you said i think that was a
51:23 - great tip um you when you say on
51:25 - linkedin that you are open to work you
51:27 - can list the countries that you are
51:29 - targeting so
51:30 - that is a big big tip that we got there
51:34 - uh let's do one more question so someone
51:37 - here asked
51:39 - projects that would you would recommend
51:41 - doing to impress recruiters
51:44 - so
51:45 - i guess it depends on the role that
51:47 - you're applying what front-end back-end
51:49 - devops full stack it will depend but uh
51:52 - are there um
51:54 - when you're looking at a project from a
51:56 - candidate to try like the first
51:58 - screening
51:59 - what are the things that basically set
52:01 - apart a project that is just
52:03 - to a project that showcases someone's
52:05 - ability so so yeah so the way i'll
52:07 - answer that is definitely focus on
52:09 - github when it comes to software
52:10 - engineering and it's not because it's
52:13 - just because a it's it's applicable and
52:15 - you'll be able to highlight your your
52:16 - specific experience but at the end of
52:18 - the day if i look at code i'm not going
52:21 - to know what it can do but if i go to
52:23 - your github profile and i see you've
52:24 - been active for the last x number of
52:27 - months or x number of years to show that
52:29 - you have been hands on the keyboard and
52:31 - really applying some of the knowledge
52:33 - you've gained from either a boot camp or
52:34 - some online courses maybe it doesn't you
52:36 - know exactly translate to real work
52:38 - experience but you know github shows you
52:41 - the the shaded squares with how many
52:43 - days you were active and how where your
52:45 - commits came from and if i go to a
52:47 - github profile and i just see it lit up
52:49 - with yellow and red and orange i know
52:51 - that person spends a lot of time on
52:52 - their keyboard and i know that they
52:54 - could probably be able to pick something
52:55 - up a little more quickly so i wouldn't
52:57 - worry about like this is one project
52:59 - that every recruiter is going to love i
53:01 - would focus on doing the work day in day
53:04 - out not and you know just a couple hours
53:05 - or whatever you can afford to do but
53:07 - when you show the consistency that's
53:09 - when you'll be able to apply to a hiring
53:11 - company that hey i can be committed to a
53:14 - long-term project i'm really passionate
53:16 - about this and here's some examples of
53:18 - of what i could bring to the table so i
53:19 - would definitely say it's more about the
53:21 - scope and the consistency versus any one
53:24 - particular project
53:26 - okay there you have it uh just focus on
53:28 - consistency and i will plus one that
53:30 - because uh actually one of our
53:32 - moderators on our community on discord
53:34 - got a job recently and
53:36 - the user wasn't even applying for jobs
53:39 - he was really involved in a lot of open
53:41 - source work
53:42 - and
53:43 - a lot like you look at his github and
53:45 - he's extremely active like 800 commits
53:48 - in the past year or something like that
53:49 - like extremely active and
53:51 - basically people that he was
53:52 - collaborating with online they said hey
53:54 - where do you work at he said no i don't
53:56 - work i just self-taught developer and
53:58 - they said excuse me and they started
54:00 - they started you know referencing him
54:02 - and sending him to recruiters of the
54:04 - company say hey my company is hiring my
54:05 - company's hiding here you go and he
54:07 - actually landed a job even not asking
54:08 - for one he just kind of like was so
54:10 - consistent and so active in communities
54:12 - that other people noticed how consistent
54:14 - and
54:15 - so definitely for sure consistency
54:19 - just going to show that you you do it
54:20 - because you love it and you're going to
54:22 - keep doing it
54:25 - i think okay so all right we will answer
54:27 - this question before we close off uh
54:28 - we've been here for a while uh last last
54:30 - question very last question is in your
54:32 - experience how much how much age matters
54:35 - for a computer especially in those years
54:38 - of job loss or changing due to covet
54:41 - and and i think there's some legal
54:43 - requirements on this too like i'm pretty
54:45 - sure that h is not a way you can't
54:47 - discriminate based on it i'm sure that
54:49 - but i guess it does i can imagine
54:52 - companies being a bit more leaning
54:55 - towards one side than another but i know
54:56 - that a code academy at least in
54:58 - particular uh you can speak to this i
55:00 - don't think that age is a factor
55:02 - oh no not at all i think it's more i'm
55:04 - looking for people that have you know
55:06 - the specific experience for what we need
55:08 - you know today and so if that comes in
55:11 - the form of a you know
55:13 - 17 year old prodigy or an 18 year old
55:15 - prodigy or a 65 year old retiree who
55:17 - just picked up coding i don't care if
55:19 - you know react and you know you can work
55:21 - with some microservices like at a pretty
55:23 - high level i'll have a conversation with
55:25 - you and so i don't think that age really
55:27 - plays a part and i think in terms of
55:29 - like some of those gaps from covid as
55:31 - long as you have you know something to
55:33 - show for it like if you you know had
55:35 - some down on your luck time and you know
55:37 - you needed to you know take some time
55:39 - being able to talk about you know i did
55:41 - took this opportunity to either study at
55:43 - a boot camp or to work on this personal
55:45 - project i think you can really kind of
55:48 - cover your bases a little there and so i
55:50 - wouldn't worry too much about you know
55:52 - ageism or you know people worrying about
55:55 - gaps on resumes as long as you have you
55:57 - know you've been proactive you're
55:59 - working on self-improvement and you know
56:01 - eventually i think those those uh
56:04 - those resources will pay dividends and
56:06 - you'll actually be able to really kind
56:07 - of get where you want to go um i think
56:10 - sometimes when people just get a little
56:11 - defeatist and then start just not
56:14 - putting any emphasis on their linkedin
56:15 - profile letting it kind of go by the
56:17 - wayside
56:18 - those are the profiles that you know you
56:20 - come across and
56:21 - they don't really make a you know they
56:23 - don't really stick and you usually go on
56:24 - to the next
56:26 - all right well i say it every week and i
56:28 - keep saying it i'll keep saying it is
56:30 - don't self-select yourself out you have
56:32 - to let the recruiters be the ones that
56:33 - say no like if you don't you know you
56:35 - have doubts you don't think you have the
56:36 - right experience the right knowledge or
56:38 - you don't fit well or my age or my
56:40 - experience or my my volunteering work
56:43 - just just put yourself out there and let
56:45 - the recruiters be the ones saying no
56:47 - because if you you you will tell
56:49 - yourself no 100 of the time so
56:52 - you you gotta sometimes get past that
56:54 - well thank you will so much for today uh
56:56 - thank you for sharing all this

Cleaned transcript:

be fun i know i'll sleep all right all right so three two one okay so we're live great so everybody can see us now on youtube now and in the future i guess whoever is watching us live now welcome everybody for the next episode of recruiting tips and tricks we're doing this every week and hopefully we share information that is relevant to you looking for a job or maybe just exploring jobs in tech if you're wondering about uh you know interview etiquette review of resumes cover letters linkedin platforms in general um what to do what not to do what things to avoid to give you a better chance that's why we do this every week and this week we have will with us so we'll introduce yourself tell me a little bit about your background yeah sure thanks for yeah so my name is will rudy i work here at codecademy as a senior technical recruiter um here i mainly focus on supporting some of our engineering teams uh as well as some of our devops and product teams but uh background has been in technical recruiting for the last couple years i uh live in boston originally from the midwest but uh boston's been home for the last 10 years and so worked at a couple different kinds of companies i started in an agency i was working at uh chewy.com when they moved up to boston i was their 42nd employee there which was a lot of fun um worked at a couple startups worked at some larger ed tech companies and uh you know wanted to come to code academy because i really believe in the mission i was actually a learner years ago i was a technical recruiter i thought it'd be a good idea to learn what i was talking about a little bit more and uh probably not going to hire myself anytime soon but uh it's fun to learn a little bit and uh i've picked up my code foundation since i came back so um all right it's a lot of fun dropping uh dropping the knowledge right from the beginning guys you heard it uh he was researching i mean not researching but you knew about the the place you wanted to work at before you applied for it i think that's like uh one of the pro tips that we are always sharing here every week is if you are applying applying to a place make sure that you know what they're about make sure that you know basics of what they do because it's just gonna make you look better so today's focus uh with you will is we wanted to talk a bit about linkedin and the role that linkedin plays in jobs i know that a lot of learners here especially if you are is your first time your career switcher is your first time applying for a job you might be wondering how much does linkedin matter compared to a traditional resume a traditional cover letter or some people might think well you know do recruiters search for candidates on linkedin or is this just a showcase place where i share it like do i share this or do other people share with it so let's just get started and um i'm just gonna start with a really basic question which is will can you tell us a little bit about the role of linkedin when it comes to its place in the traditional application process of having a cover letter having a resume linkedin how how does linkedin compare and stack against the others yeah yeah so i definitely think it's a you know you want to kind of cover your bases and kind of work at a couple different angles so the resumes and the cover letters are great when you're being proactive when you know that there's a company out there that you know you're really passionate about you'd like to work there always great to have those ready to go but the nice thing about a linkedin is it's there maybe a little bit more as a passive resume in a sense because there are technical recruiters like me at every company out there that's hiring software engineers or they're working with an agency to hire software engineers and the main place that a lot of us go to look or at least to start when we're searching for new candidates is going to be linkedin obviously we'll be going through resumes and cover letters as well but usually um especially for very hyperfocused roles or specific experiences we are being very proactive and going out and looking for those types of folks and so having a linkedin it just is going to give you a lot more options and so it's definitely my first place to start it's not the only there's other sites out there but in terms of just you know again being that place to start and uh kind of get my feet wet is why i learn a little bit about the role um it's it's imperative and there's not really a replacement at that at this point okay and do you uh when you're looking at these linkedin profiles i know there's a lot of fields so you can personalize on linkedin so you can have a banner image like a splash at the top you can have your profile uh i'm assuming that all these things sort of like make your image to that recruiter and you know i hate to say it and a lot of people think that's unfair but that first impression that you get from someone uh you're trying not to be biased towards that but i would imagine that putting more effort into linkedin it's better than putting less effort into your linkedin right because i've seen some very bare bones yes yes no for sure for sure it's definitely you know the first impression you're exactly right it's it's the first thing that i see as a recruiter and so i think it's definitely just a place to let your personality shine you know that's not to say that you need to have a loud and verbose profile you know if you are more of a minimalistic person then it's totally cool but at the same time i would definitely you know be thorough and you know adding those banners or a picture if you're comfortable you know those things just help personalize you because you know at the end of the day you know it's it's a peopletopeople kind of relationship and so the more that you can kind of just let yourself um you know be highlighted and showcased uh it's gonna be helpful because at the end of the day you know you being yourself and the company being themselves if that links up you know that's really kind of what would be perfect and and so i really don't think you know trying to do too much uh would be to your benefit you know it's definitely just a good place to let your own personality out whatever that looks like and this uh does things like for example i know that uh a linkedin profile might show you the activity of someone on linkedin how much does that play a role when you're looking at a profile because i know that some people create the linkedin and they just kind of it's kind of like a go and forget it they just make it and that's it it's going there like that's that's influence does that influence your your take on a candidate when you see that maybe they're more active on linkedin or they've had references added there or they have uh you know different uh i think uh what's it called when when someone kind of like vouches for you recommendation recommendations so so do all those things also matter or you're just looking for general information when you're looking i think they definitely help i really try to get a holistic view so um you know usually some recruiters will start at the top some will start at the bottom but those recommendations are always really helpful because they're essentially living references um and so i always appreciate when people write them for me vice versa if i have a great experience i try to write them as well it's definitely good practice um to help your fellow job seekers out in terms of being able to if you have recommendations to share them but no i think when i when i come across a profile that looks like it hasn't been updated in five years it's probably not what i'm gonna spend a lot of time looking at and so um usually when i go there i'm looking for you know the relevant information recent experience and then you know breaking down some of the key things that that i know our company is looking for and kind of basically trying to see um just where that is and try to find candidates that have enough of the pieces that could be you know a potential fit because at the end of the day you don't need to have you know every single piece of information about your background on linkedin if anything it's probably best to you know focus on your strengths and so you know when i'm looking at profiles i'm looking at you know not only companies and longevity but also you know what kind of projects have you been working on you know are any chance that you have to give some kind of ownership or if you've you know really led something those are the things that really kind of stick out and so i think when people take the time to at least you know put a couple sentences add a couple uh you know bullet points to to your careers not only will it set you up for success in the future but once you do it once you know that experience isn't going to change too too much so it's just sort of that living record and so it's it's easy to do it ahead of time than to try to play ketchup and uh as a recruiter since you like you mentioned you go through uh resumes a lot um i would imagine that it is a good practice for people especially in tech roles to maybe include a link in their pdf cover or like resume uh to the linkedin profile so maybe if it's a developer or somebody looking for a technical role maybe even to their github repos if they have github repos what is the how does linkedin compare to personal websites i know that some people to showcase hey i'm a web developer so i made a website because i it's what i do how does that compare like is that is that better worse or just about the same level of like how does that compare to oh my linkedin kind of like not great but look i made these personal websites and here's what i really showcase who i am yeah i think they're complimentary i think you definitely you know having both would probably be my preference and i definitely will always click on a link to a personal website for a software engineer that i'm looking you know that came up in one of my searches because you're right it's a great indicator of what someone can actually do i think when i look at a linkedin profile i'm looking for a little bit more of a history versus maybe uh what's going on today or what's been built most recently because usually when i get a role from one of my hiring managers they give me more to go on than just you know a tech stack they're asking you know someone that's had experience you know breaking down a monolith into microservices or you know someone who has been you know a lot with product integration work because usually especially with companies you know at you know a couple hundred or even you know as low as 100 i would say they're going to have enough specialization where the recruiters have a very specific goal in mind in terms of what they're looking for and so i think a linkedin profile is great to have you know the history there but a personal website especially for those web developers or a product designer or anything that would be a little bit more frontend or userfocused it's always great to include you want them to kind of be complimentary as i mentioned because it is great usually if you're a candidate especially if you don't have maybe as much work experience any sort of personal projects will definitely be you know a benefit to your overall candidacy because at the end of the day it's a it's an example of the work even if you don't necessarily have the you know years of experience that uh you know historically is what people are looking for i think what other candid uh not kind of what other guests here on the video live stream said in the past was that uh a poor linkedin profile won't necessarily take away from your application but it doesn't add to it and if you are competing against another five or six strong candidates uh you need every every bit of help that you can get so yeah you know no one no recruiter at least a code academy recruiter won't look at your linkedin page well well this is not great polish polish so we're gonna move on like they're they won't do that but at the same time you're missing another opportunity to showcase who you are and your work your history and why they should pick you over other candidates so i feel like it's one of those places where it's like yeah it won't hurt you but it could definitely help you so you sure it's true yeah especially if you know if you are you know you're happy in your job maybe you're casually interested to hear what's out there it never hurts to have a linkedin profile that can just you know have options because i know that you know as a software engineer or as a technical recruiter you know you're going to get messages and some of them will be interesting some of them won't be when codecademy reached out to me i was very excited i wasn't necessarily looking but it obviously worked out and i was thrilled so i think you can surprise yourself when you take a little bit of time to just keep that linkedin up to date because it's how people like me are going to find you i would agree that um a linkedin you know a less robust linkedin profile probably won't hurt your candidacy but it really cuts down on the chances of me being able to find you because usually i'm looking for a very specific you know boolean search of key tech um pieces that i know we're looking for in terms of a full stack engineer or a backend engineer and so if you don't put any time or effort into talking about what you've actually been working on you know key languages and frameworks you're probably not going to come up in my search and so that's what i think you can really do yourself the most good is to just highlight that experience that you know you feel most confident about and then eventually a tech recruiter like me or will find you and it'll be a great fit but uh if you don't put anything on there it's gonna be really tough to locate you so what are the basic building blocks of a good linkedin profile are we talking about uh keywords or is it like hashtagging or just normal keywords uh are we talking about uh certain sections of linkedin that should be filled out like i know that it's a biosection a short description there's sections where you can highlight links and when you can you know link to your resumes and all the documents and so what are kind of like the main building blocks of a linkedin profile that will make it more discoverable for people like you recruiters and more likely to be heading searches right yeah so i would definitely say and this is kind of one thing i've just you know always recommend to candidates and i think it's very applicable to this and that's be confident about what you know be honest about what you don't and be very willing and excited to learn if that's what you really you know are interested in doing because nine times out of ten it's going to be very rare that you're going to have every single thing a recruiter is looking for and recruiters know that we're not expecting to come across someone who has every single piece but if you have the main components like for instance when i'm doing a search for a full stack role here at codecademy we have a react front end and so we also have a lot of ruby on rails in the back end so i am looking for someone that has both ruby and react now if you know ruby react in a handful of other languages but you know perhaps ruby and react tend to be the most um comfortable for you that's where you're the most confident that's what i would recommend you highlight and i think a couple years ago maybe even you know 10 15 the whole jack of all trades idea was something that was really sort of kind of you know much more i don't know maybe applicable to some of the roles in my experience companies are looking for specialization so it's good in the beginning to get a lot of exposure but what i would definitely recommend is really highlighting where you feel most comfortable because at the end of the day those are the recruiters that are going to find you and they're the ones that'll be able to set you up for success in terms of being able to go through the technical interviews and so i've talked to candidates over the years and you know they had a lot of languages and a lot of frameworks listed on their resume including the ones i was looking for but at the end of the day it wasn't a great fit on either side because it just wasn't really where their strength lies and so i would definitely focus on you know the work experience you have in terms of your key languages your key frameworks but don't feel the need to list all of them i would really focus on your top couple because those are the ones you're going to need to use in a technical interview you know once you get through the door so definitely there i like the recommendations i always look at them um just to see if it's you know past managers if it's peers because usually if it's a senior level role there might be some mentorship opportunities or responsibilities and so if someone has a recommendation from a peer like that it's something that'll stand out that i will flag to the hiring manager and so when you take the time to invest in in those linkedin profiles and we're only talking 20 25 minutes it's not like you have to write a book um it's just very helpful and will set you up for success maybe not right away today but you'll be surprised especially as you gain more experience um how many more folks will start trickling into your inbox and whether you're looking or not it's great to have options and it's good to just have some experience talking to recruiters i would definitely recommend have some conversations when they come through because it'll give you great practice for when you actually do talk to a company you want to speak with so um but the only way or one of the main ways that conversation will happen is if the recruiter can find you so um really highlighting those key frameworks and languages um talking about leadership and ownership you know those are some of the simple you know specifics i would say but uh but a little bit of time can go a long way especially in terms of you know the roi over years of how many folks will be able to find you so i imagine that uh the way that the search works at linkedin uh when you're writing uh your descriptions or you're writing these fields those become key words right and um it's interesting that you say that you you might want to be a jack of all trades but you need to be focused on something because i you know you often hear the recommendation that you should try to hit as many keywords as possible because when you have all those keywords then you're more likely to show up in everyone's church but it sounds like at the same time you're saying that showing up in everyone's shirt search might be uh what might play against you because the you you might show up in this in this research and there's recruiters and recruiters and they would just say well yeah great i found you but you're not what i'm looking for um so so yes you got them there but they're not you're not really going to that extra step of actually getting called or actually getting messaged right right right and that's where i think playing your strengths really comes into play because yeah you might be able to show up in a lot of searches but you're realistically probably not going to get through a lot of final round interviews if you're trying to cast such a wide net so usually today you know someone focuses as a and when it comes to software engineering you're either you know front end full stack back end and then there's some fun infrastructure stuff these days too and so i definitely recommend having the experience and really highlighting what you're trying to what kind of job you're trying to get you know if you want to be a full stack engineer make sure your resume and your linkedin profile is touching on both front end and back end experience if you're looking for a devops position make sure that you have you know some basic you know public cloud infrastructure work listed there you know aws is a lot of places but azure google cloud a lot of those skills are applicable and most of the time if you have some experience with one you'll probably be able to kind of ramp up in another a little bit more easily and so i definitely recommend you know it's in the best interest as a job seeker to have the highest percentage of conversations based on your experience and so if i would just you know i would rather have five conversations that would lead to four finals then 20 conversations that maybe lead to two okay and i would imagine that the way you look at linkedin is different if you've already had a wrestleman first like i know that uh i've talked to people before that said well i look at that resume and i have like ten seconds six seven seconds to get a resume uh if it looks if it sparks my curiosity and there's a link a hyperlink to linkedin i will click it just to get like a better idea of this candidate so does it change how you look at a linkedin profile when you are doing that has the first step looking for a candidate versus when you're doing that has a feeling after looking at a resume is that do you approach a linkedin profile differently yeah i think when i'm doing you know just some heads down sourcing and just sort of looking at a lot of profiles i definitely focus on the keywords because one thing that happens when you're using a linkedin recruiter is they'll actually populate as highlighted words when you look at a profile and so i can get a quick glimpse at a candidate's just how many you know how many hits you might have on a specific resume at first glance and if you start seeing a lot of that highlight you kind of start reading a little bit more detailed and so i definitely think you know again they complement each other i definitely wouldn't recommend having either a resume or a linkedin but um i do think that it's helpful to just show the exposure and get a little bit more of a variety in terms of where you're actually seeing some of this interest come in because it's great to be proactive and send your resume and cover letters out there but you'd be surprised at who might be able to find you there's definitely companies out there that especially today with software engineering they're hiring remote engineers left and right and that's not something that happened you know three years ago so i think right now as a software engineer or you know soontobe software engineer you're gonna have a lot more options than you even think but the only way again you'll have those is if they can find you yeah the i want to switch gears a little bit and i you mentioned that um recruiters reaching out to candidates on linkedin now i've seen messages before my linkedin i have it on my phone and it will pop and say you know you have a notification and i never know what it is if somebody mentioned me in a post or if it's someone said something or if it's one in my inbox um is there is there an etiquette on how long or how fast you need to reply to these recruiters or like what's kind of like the opportunity window like if you if you're looking for candidates and you see somebody you're interested in you message them and say hey i'm with code academy i'm interested blah blah do you want to talk how how many hours or days do do they go by before you just moved on on the search and it's too late for this candid so for me i think it's it's you know once i send that message what i will personally try to do is make sure i have like a followup cadence coming and so i'll usually try to send one or two messages per candidate but in terms of when they reply back to me you know the sooner the better the sooner they reply i usually try to have that conversation within you know 24 to 48 hours and then if that conversation goes well they'll be into process and would technically be you know less than a week away from a final so it's really up to the candidate and so a lot of times i'll have messages coming back you know a few days or maybe a week later and so i personally don't hold it against a candidate or really focus too much on whether it came back you know a day late or a week later um if their reply comes in and they look like they can still be a good fit or you know would be interested i'm just going to be looking forward to having a conversation so i don't think the timing matters but it's in your best interest if you are interested in the role to reply sooner than later i guess i guess if you're actively looking for work you should have the app on your phone and be able to uh to get on top of that uh rather quickly um how does it work i know that you can have profiles in different languages on linkedin and i guess this is more of a question of some companies are large enough that they are sourcing from all over the world or they might be able to hire from different parts of the world here in the u.s sometimes it's not unheard of of companies choosing from canada for example which is technically abroad uh even though they're neighbors so um how does it work in terms of these uh these profiles that might be in different languages so maybe people are you know students that are trying to get jobs in the us or they're trying to get work visas uh do the keywords on a search for recruiters work the same or get automatically translated or or if you're looking for a keyword in english it would only highlight the profiles that have it in english that's a great question um i'm not sure just because i don't have a ton of experience sourcing internationally most of my career has been very boston based and so mostly u.s focused i will say i do see translations come through quickly on linkedin so i think sometimes if i were to you know potentially click on a profile um i will see it you know be translated into english so i can read through it but also realistically you know i think it's just um it would if you're looking for jobs in the us you know i think you would definitely you'd be encouraged to to you know be identifiable by those kind of companies as best you can but other than that i don't know exactly if the uh the po if the keywords will translate but uh that's a great question i will show you yeah i know yeah no i'm curious because i know that a lot of our learners are all over the world right and and i always i always like to remind everyone that you know when we talk about recruiting and we talk about practices of recruiting we are talking about them from the point of view of the us and you know recruiting happens at different levels all over the world uh for example i know that in some countries it's typical to include your profile photo in your resume and in the us that's not the case so there's always all these little details and caveats so um i always like to remind everybody that um you know that's why i'm asking these questions like okay if i'm if i'm in europe and i'm planning on trying to get a job in a u.s company how that works well realistically like you said if you're trying to get a job in a place that speaks english you would want to maybe have your wrestling english uh and your profile translator i know that linkedin makes it really easy for you to have your profile in different languages so uh that i guess the the general rule of thumb is have it in english if you can you should definitely get uh yeah i think you will be more identifiable and i think yeah folks will be able to come across your resume a lot or linkedin a lot more easily have you seen any uh kind of like obvious or mistakes that should have been avoided on any linkedin profiles like i know that i'm sure that you go through volumes of linkedin profiles so there must be certain mistakes or certain things that keep occurring and are just reoccurring mistakes that you wish people knew to avoid is there any like top three or something that you could that you can think of there are things that are like don't do this yeah yeah i know that's a great that's a great question i guess the first one might be a little twofold but i mean spelling errors are definitely ones that will pop out the most especially if you mis use the wrong form of principle so principal engineer is al just for future reference so when everyone's later in their career that's a good one because that does come up quite a few times um other types of uh errors that are usually made i would say maybe and it's not something you necessarily need to capture on the linkedin profile but you know sometimes you know there might be a gap in your work experience which is totally fine life happens that's not a deal breaker but i think at least having an explanation for what that looks like not necessarily on linkedin but for the recruiter if they reach out to have a conversation i think that's one thing i always notice i do go through the history just to see okay this then this then this and so if there's a little bit of a gap it will be picked up but again it's not a deal breaker but just be ready to sort of talk through that um assuming that you're comfortable there lastly you know um germany actually one of the recruiters she told me that you can get a little creative and uh people that have had a gap for cobit uh well maybe they lost their jobs at the beginning of the pandemic and then now they're looking for another job and they have that gap in their experience she said that uh people get created with it and sometimes they will set things like uh you know uh travel in the world uh for eight months or you know took a sabbatical or you know covet layoffs like some people like apparently some candidates have started to list kobit has uh has a gap reason so i'm sure that you can get a little creative oh yeah oh yeah no i i definitely can you can get creative there and like i said it's not a deal breaker i just would definitely be ready to kind of chat through what that looks like a little bit um and then you know lastly i would say it's definitely good to have a picture if you're comfortable but i would definitely also be aware of you know the kinds of pictures that you might be sharing of yourself and so in terms of you know you don't need to be overly professional but you probably don't want to be overly casual either and it's a fine line between that and you obviously a culture or a values of a company or a little different when they're uh you know small and more startupy versus you know a large you know big enterprise and so knowing your audience and knowing a little bit about where you're trying to get that job i think you can kind of curate your your profile a little bit to that as well and so i think that also depends on the industry you know some of the expectations there i do enjoy working in tech because i'm very comfortable in tshirts so um i i i definitely think you know having an idea of of your target audience is is also an important thing because sometimes if if there's a little bit of a disconnect there um it's it's it's a little tough to kind of get over that initial initial bump would you consider something to avoid uh when some people list that experience in the linkedin profile things that don't that barely qualify has experience like sometimes people like i said you know we try to get creative and highlight our or our profiles because we're trying to land jobs and you might see people uh highlighting certain volunteer work or certain things that they basically don't really they're not relevant maybe like if you are a developer and you say that you have experiences in a different field something uh is that something to avoid is that something that you can that you should be comfortable sharing as well what do you think yeah that's a great question and i actually i had this personal experience because i wasn't always a recruiter i was a bartender before i got into the recruiting game and so i had that on my linkedin profile for a little while and then eventually i gained enough experience and i think my career transitioned to the point where i just decided to remove that not because i was embarrassed or anything but because it wasn't really relevant to what i was doing now and what kind of future career i was planning to have and so i definitely think you're you're right there fede in the sense that hey there's a place for volunteer experience on the linkedin profile which is also a great place to add some of that stuff but i will admit sometimes when people get a little cheeky with some of the experience listed it doesn't exactly it doesn't do you any favors i think it's also good to be honest and if you know maybe some some dark humor is how you're honest that's totally fine too but at the same time i think just knowing that audience and you know knowing what really is going to help you land the job and it's not about just making sure there's no gap so you list something that's not very relevant or maybe not work at all i think it's much more important to just you know focus on what you know you really do bring to the table and kind of what you're targeting to get next and you know at the end of the day i think that that's the best yeah i feel like as some people um it's easy to forget that you are being judged on your experience and your and your ability but you are also getting judged on your character and who you are as a person because at the end of the day you will be working on a team with other people and who you are as a person matters just as much as how what you can do as a professional um and i i suppose uh trying to get a little too cheeky or a little too uh not too trusty on certain things like the way you share on your profile that oh it does also shine in a light on the on the kind of candy that you are and it might just it might just deter the recruiter from from saying well this is a person that would fit here like we'll add the value that we're looking for for team in the future right right and at the same time there you know there's definitely going to be cheeky companies out there to you to use the word one more time that maybe we'll really enjoy that and if that's who you are at the end of the day i definitely just would recommend being honest with the profile like don't put a suit on if you're not a suit where don't you know try to make your linkedin profile look like someone else's that you saw you know that you want to try to emulate let your own profile speak for yourself and that's what i try to do that's what i think a lot of other people who maybe don't overthink it and just really kind of let it naturally occur you know that's the best case because at the end of the day you want to be your authentic self because if you're not you're probably you know going to be setting yourself up for a little disappointment even if you get the job because they're going to be expecting you to be someone who you've been performing for the last couple months and so definitely just highlight your real experience and be yourself both in terms of you know the type of profile you create and the way you describe yourself because there are a lot of companies out there i think there are certain strategies that will give you more options that are going to be a little bit more applicable to just a larger group of companies but if you prefer to be you know an odd duck and just look for those odd duck companies just being on duck that's totally fine too but you know you might have a little bit of a limited options there and what do you think about um i'm sure a lot of people that will watch this video are beginners or they're junior they're looking for junior positions or you know software engineer one depending on where you work and how they call it different companies call it differently um these kind of uh candidates you often struggle to get their foot in the door because they don't have relevant experience and and they struggle to showcase what they can do without that relevant experience so what are your thoughts when you look at a linkedin profile and you see that there might be no relevant experience if you're looking to source somebody in a junior role or maybe uh what are your thoughts on them listing volunteer work has relevant experience yeah so i think it's the whole chicken before the egg thing right and it's it's it's very difficult it's something that's been in existence for a while you need experience to get the job how are you going to get the job without any experience and so i definitely i've seen it a lot and i would say you know in terms of what to list on a resume you know especially these days i see a lot of people highlighting their open source contributions which i think is helpful um especially whether it's a github or whether you have been participating in some of these other type of development initiatives having links there especially you know for me to share with my hiring manager obviously i'm not going to be evaluating the code but if i see that it exists it implies to me that this person at least has enough desire and drive to be proactive and go a little bit above and beyond and so i'll usually share that and if it's great code the person you know the engineering manager will see it and then they'll let me know hey i know this person doesn't have a ton of experience but this looks great let's have a conversation and so i think listing some of you know that type of work um even if it's boot camp stuff you know that's applicable it shows what you can do and i also think that you know as companies continue to grow they're gonna have some some difference of uh priorities so some quarters they might be a little more focused on seniority sometimes maybe they're looking to just build up a few other teams and they'll be able to hire more you know entry level or software engineer once and so i think having the experience that you do have listed and really focusing on some of that extra work that you've done is is going to help you get your foot in the door it's going to be difficult i i'm not going to you know i'm not going to sugarcoat that but um taking the initiative there and another thing don't be scared of contract work i was a contractor before i had a fulltime job and it helped me realize kind of how i was going to start building a career and so especially as software engineers or product designers you know there's sites out there that like upwork i've used i've seen before and so there are places out there that'll offer you some contract work that maybe isn't going to be the most interesting but you do a couple of those boom you've got a year and a half two years of experience and then you're you know potentially available for a midlevel software engineer role and so it's tough to get started but once you do it'll start to snowball and before you know it you'll have that year or two that'll help you kind of get more feet in the door so it's it's always tough in the beginning it'll get easier i promise it's just it sounds like uh it sounds like uh like you were saying it's a holistic view of the candidate and uh i know that uh i like to remind everybody watching this that when a company is looking for to fill a role they have sort of like a mold of what they're looking for right so you're trying to fit that mold but at the same time uh there's always wiggle room and they if you hear back from a recruiter or if somebody hits you up on linkedin or whatever it is that means that you've shown enough that they're interested in having a conversation with you so sometimes you have to trust yourself and get over that um impostor syndrome that a lot of us have saying you know i'm a fake or i don't really know i didn't get formal education on this or i didn't get formal training on that um i know that sometimes and volunteering work uh like you said if you can showcase that that work is yours or like at the end of the day like if you just list some random project that you worked on and it's not clear what your role was in the project it's not clear what your responsibilities were in the project it's less likely to help you and if you can definitely show you know i was in charge of this i wrote this code this is what i did right it always so like don't be so afraid of the labels right like it's not a fancy company it's not a fancy but but it is experience and it is showing what you can do right right and just getting getting a few of those early reps um you can become a lot more selective once you get some of those out of the way so it's definitely good to especially right after you know when you're initially starting as a as a software engineer take take some of that initial experience you know have you know try to have fun but really just know that you're kind of paying your dues a little bit and you'll be surprised at how selective you can be in a couple years because software engineering is a ridiculously indemand skill set and it's not going anywhere and so i think anybody who's on that path is is doing themselves a great service it might be a little slow out of the gate it'll pay dividends if i was better at math i would probably be a software engineer what about the what about the opposite what is what is the uh the etiquette per se when you are actively looking for a role at a company maybe they have some open roles that you're interested in and we often talk about researching the companies that you want to work for and trying to build your network trying to reach out so what is sort of etiquette if someone let's say we have an open role in a backend engineer and you get a message tonight from someone on linkedin saying hey i see that you're a technical recruiter at code academy and i'm interested in these roles i want to talk more about this is it like what's the line of being polite and inquiring on a of an interesting work versus not being polite or like you know doing it wrong and taking away from that chance yeah no i mean i definitely think you should be as proactive as again you feel comfortable with but i think also be realistic and so if you think you're a great fit for the role and you are a great fit then feel free be confident reach out to that recruiter i get sometimes engineers you know with a with a linkedin request like a friend request or a networking request and so sometimes they'll include hey i saw you know this particular job would love to hear a little bit more about it if you think my background could be a fit and i always you know will click on the resume that they share with me or just click into their linkedin profile and take a look and if they you know could be a fit then i'll definitely have that conversation but what i would avoid is you know potentially you know maybe spamming uh some other recruiters in the sense of going for roles that are just really far afield and that probably aren't going to be you know within your wheelhouse for you know a little bit of time at least because as much as people like to say hey i can learn really quick there you know there are certain things at companies especially at that you know some mid to definitely at senior level where they won't be able to take a risk on someone having to learn that you know they're going to be waiting and looking for someone who really can kind of hit the ground running and so definitely feel free to reach out to recruiters but you know just like you don't want them to waste your time i would say you know don't be overly zealous if it's uh not really a great fit okay i mean that's fair i've always spamming if you if somebody mess if you message someone and they don't get back to you within an hour don't message them again and give them some time they're busy don't okay so so it's totally fine but just do it with do it we're always in the context of there is a time frame there is an interest and you don't even know if the role that you are interested in it has been filled or if it's in the last stages or getting failed so always with that with a kind of like grain of salt or saying you know you can try but there is no guarantees and you should always keep that in mind that there's only so much you can do right exactly definitely you know apply on the company's website and then the next step maybe yeah reach out to one of the recruiters if you see them especially if you maybe have a connection request with them um you know i think building your network you know maybe as a another last takeaway is definitely something you know i i definitely accept a lot of uh you know linkedin requests especially folks that i've previously worked with or candidates that maybe i've had conversations with maybe they didn't get a job but it's a small world and i've definitely spoken to people at you know several companies and they've kind of you know been able to follow me where i go places and vice versa and so um there is a nice symbiosis that can exist between recruiters and engineers and so it's just a matter about kind of finding that right fit but uh keeping your options open and being honest with yourself i would say and have you ever come across anyone that might be a bit more sales when it comes to their online privacy i mean in the last few years we've seen leaks data leaks you know social media leaks so i i can imagine that it's not out of the realm of possibility that some of these candidates say look i don't have social media and i don't have a linkedin either because i'm trying to limit my footprint online um is that have you come across anyone like that or like do you think that that would be kind of like a a harder candidate to scout or to to get like what happens if you are that kind of person that is more you know worried about your private online it's really not something that's you know you're not going to end up on some amazon mailing list whether you give your recruiter a cell phone uh so i i definitely think you know as you feel comfortable you know sharing is is probably the best way to go okay um i think i apologize i think youtube just told me that there was like a slight gap there in the answer maybe for like a second or two i think you didn't miss too much information sorry everybody uh well i think i i asked a lot of questions today you've shared a lot of good uh insights on how recruiters think and what recruiters are looking for when they are using linkedin as a tool for scouting candidates and communicating with them so do you have any general thoughts or anything that you would like to share before we pass to the q a no no i think uh i think that this is a a fun conversation for me it's it's nice to sort of think about you know the day to day a little bit more um i think i would just really bring it back to to being honest with yourself and putting out that honest persona because you want canada you want companies to find you where you can be yourself vice versa i think i've seen too many times where people try to perform in a way that they think the company is looking for it doesn't end well you know even if the job does that they do get the job they don't stick around very long so it's in your best interest to just put your honest foot forward and the companies that you know you'll want to work for and feel comfortable they'll find you and vice versa you know if you're proactive i think you'll be able to find them too you know it's interesting that you bring that up because uh last week we're talking just about that about how far you can mold yourself to fit a certain role or hit certain requirements or or musthaves and how far you can mold yourself to that before you're sacrificing who you are as a person then you're gonna have a bad time uh i think this comes often with tech with the big tech companies the fang companies where people say well you know i don't care if it's a six month burnout rate i don't care if people get in and out of there like a revolving door the moment i put that in my resume that i've been there for 18 months that's it dan's done deal i'm gonna get a job whatever i want and uh it seems to it seems to be a big problem uh in tech where people might be willing to put up with a lot or might be willing to say yes to a lot of things during a recruiting uh you know uh process even if they are not okay with the compensation they're not okay with the hours they're not okay with how company does a or b just because they they just want to have it on the rest of them so i think it's interesting like you said you know you you have to also keep in mind where you're going to work and why exactly exactly that's why it's always best to be yourself easiest rule okay easiest rule well i'm gonna look at the chat see if we have any questions here that we might have missed during our conversation i'm gonna scroll up um let's see okay yeah so one of the first questions was just wondering about you know how to make a perfect linkedin profile i would imagine that there's no perfect linkedin profile depends on the role but uh uh if you want to maybe uh summarize like you said before some of the main areas to shine in your profile i think you mentioned uh recommendations from other users being important yeah so in terms of you know really high level takeaways definitely the recommendations are helpful um especially because it's a it's just a living reference and so i think for recruiters and you know future hiring managers it's a great sort of insight into what you kind of would bring to the table or some of your past experience um i would also recommend being concise when you're describing sort of your your your best characteristics or strongest strengths because if you end up casting that really wide net and listing a million different languages and frameworks you might get a lot of you know recruiters reaching out to you but they might not be really a fit for what you want to do and so definitely highlight you know the key you know strengths that you bring to the table as well as any opportunities that you've had to really own a project take the lead mentor some other engineers those are some of the kind of keywords that although i'm not necessarily including in a boolean search i'm noticing when i'm reading kind of next to all the languages and frameworks because a lot of times especially the company like codecademy you know we only have you know 220 people that work here so people tend to work on multiple projects help out in different ways and so when you have the ability to be flexible like that um it's just gonna set you up more for success and so the recommendations um i guess also lastly you know the picture if you feel comfortable i think is great but that's a personal opinion i think it's everyone's specific you know preference but to help personalize it you know i think we live on screens these days which can be a little tough and so you know i always hope people know i'm a person on the other side and not some robot sending spam messages and i think yeah vice versa it's probably helpful when uh you know the recruiter can get a sense as to to who you are as well do you uh i think linkedin has like a way for you to take exams and it kind of like adds those to your profile i guess those are nice to have too if you want to yeah i would say nice to have not a need to have you know i think i know that hiring managers i support will like you know we'll look at aws certification a little bit more um strongly than a linkedin certification now i think that could change over time but yeah definitely nice to have it shows initiative if nothing else but i wouldn't try to you know over emphasize linkedin recommendations at this point compared to what other kind of work you've done okay i see uh javier uh looks like you have a spanish name so i guess it makes sense to this question we have a user asking what are the recommendations to ex to expose your profile to other countries did you did you say companies are hiring remotely so i think this comes into uh javier um just to remind you uh remote work doesn't mean overseas work a lot of times companies are required to have certain uh you know there's laws like labor laws that require you to have work visas and other paperwork so um remote works sometimes uh often times just refers to the fact that you're not in a physical office more than if a more than that you are abroad in a different country but uh just in general i think we touched on that earlier where we said well if you're going to work on a country that speaks a different language than the one you're using it's probably a smart idea to make a profile in in that language right yeah i would definitely agree with that and then one thing i'm pretty sure a lot of people know about this but if you are looking for new work there is a little toggle or a little button you click on linkedin that says open in new opportunities and that allow once you click that it allows you to list some positions that you're interested in list locations and so in terms of javier's question if he's looking for you know specific countries he can list those specific countries and that's where his profile would populate in terms of where the recruiters would be looking for and then there's always also just the opportunity to list a little like personal couple sentences about why or what you're looking for and sometimes there you can really set yourself apart because if you haven't know what you're looking for or have a specific goal in mind and can sort of cav um kind of deliver that succinctly it's helpful because then the recruiter can get a sense as to oh this is a candidate who i could maybe consider for this position so knowing that you can open to new opportunities have that little um adjustment that's a way to definitely kind of get even further up the pecking order in terms of you know sometimes recruiters if they're you know really under the gun and looking for a you know need to kind of engage candidates quickly who do you think they're going to start with it's going to be candidates that are open to new opportunities because they know they're active and so i think being able to toggle that when you need to um especially listing the countries that you are targeting to work at definitely is uh is a great place to start great uh yeah javier is just saying thank you for the feedback yes my mother tongue is spanish yeah i i sounded like it javier so hello um i know that um so like i was mentioning the labor laws and stuff is it is this something that you need to mention in your linkedin uh let's say that you are uh from spain and you want to work in the us and you actually do happen to have a work visa for the us maybe you obtain one is that something that you should list preemptively in a linkedin profile has available to work in the us or is that something that it's more adequate to mention in a in a conversation facetoface like would a recruiter look at a profile if they don't see that skip over because they assume that that person is not qualified you know able to work in the us yeah so it's a great question i think it probably does differ a little bit country to country company to company but in general i would definitely if you have that um certification that authorization definitely listed it's not going to hurt you to have that listed usually also you know there's only certain things recruiters can ask in terms of like location compensation every state in the us actually has different laws um and so there's only there's some questions that i could ask in new york that i can't ask in massachusetts which is odd but it's they're there and so that's what it is yeah usually location isn't too much of a deal breaker but i think you're going to set yourself up for more opportunities if you you know either list your authorizations or you know target you know your open and new opportunities to specific um countries just because you know it'll be it'll be the most realistic option to hopefully get you so i guess if you're confident i mean it comes down back to privacy again like we were saying before uh if you're confident comfortable sharing that publicly on linkedin on your profile say i'm authorized to work in the us for example i'm authorized to work in colombia i'm authorized to work in japan um i guess if you're comfortable saying that out loud in the on the internet uh then definitely it's not going to hurt you right to add it in your bio so like yeah uh and like you said i think that was a great tip um you when you say on linkedin that you are open to work you can list the countries that you are targeting so that is a big big tip that we got there uh let's do one more question so someone here asked projects that would you would recommend doing to impress recruiters so i guess it depends on the role that you're applying what frontend backend devops full stack it will depend but uh are there um when you're looking at a project from a candidate to try like the first screening what are the things that basically set apart a project that is just to a project that showcases someone's ability so so yeah so the way i'll answer that is definitely focus on github when it comes to software engineering and it's not because it's just because a it's it's applicable and you'll be able to highlight your your specific experience but at the end of the day if i look at code i'm not going to know what it can do but if i go to your github profile and i see you've been active for the last x number of months or x number of years to show that you have been hands on the keyboard and really applying some of the knowledge you've gained from either a boot camp or some online courses maybe it doesn't you know exactly translate to real work experience but you know github shows you the the shaded squares with how many days you were active and how where your commits came from and if i go to a github profile and i just see it lit up with yellow and red and orange i know that person spends a lot of time on their keyboard and i know that they could probably be able to pick something up a little more quickly so i wouldn't worry about like this is one project that every recruiter is going to love i would focus on doing the work day in day out not and you know just a couple hours or whatever you can afford to do but when you show the consistency that's when you'll be able to apply to a hiring company that hey i can be committed to a longterm project i'm really passionate about this and here's some examples of of what i could bring to the table so i would definitely say it's more about the scope and the consistency versus any one particular project okay there you have it uh just focus on consistency and i will plus one that because uh actually one of our moderators on our community on discord got a job recently and the user wasn't even applying for jobs he was really involved in a lot of open source work and a lot like you look at his github and he's extremely active like 800 commits in the past year or something like that like extremely active and basically people that he was collaborating with online they said hey where do you work at he said no i don't work i just selftaught developer and they said excuse me and they started they started you know referencing him and sending him to recruiters of the company say hey my company is hiring my company's hiding here you go and he actually landed a job even not asking for one he just kind of like was so consistent and so active in communities that other people noticed how consistent and so definitely for sure consistency just going to show that you you do it because you love it and you're going to keep doing it i think okay so all right we will answer this question before we close off uh we've been here for a while uh last last question very last question is in your experience how much how much age matters for a computer especially in those years of job loss or changing due to covet and and i think there's some legal requirements on this too like i'm pretty sure that h is not a way you can't discriminate based on it i'm sure that but i guess it does i can imagine companies being a bit more leaning towards one side than another but i know that a code academy at least in particular uh you can speak to this i don't think that age is a factor oh no not at all i think it's more i'm looking for people that have you know the specific experience for what we need you know today and so if that comes in the form of a you know 17 year old prodigy or an 18 year old prodigy or a 65 year old retiree who just picked up coding i don't care if you know react and you know you can work with some microservices like at a pretty high level i'll have a conversation with you and so i don't think that age really plays a part and i think in terms of like some of those gaps from covid as long as you have you know something to show for it like if you you know had some down on your luck time and you know you needed to you know take some time being able to talk about you know i did took this opportunity to either study at a boot camp or to work on this personal project i think you can really kind of cover your bases a little there and so i wouldn't worry too much about you know ageism or you know people worrying about gaps on resumes as long as you have you know you've been proactive you're working on selfimprovement and you know eventually i think those those uh those resources will pay dividends and you'll actually be able to really kind of get where you want to go um i think sometimes when people just get a little defeatist and then start just not putting any emphasis on their linkedin profile letting it kind of go by the wayside those are the profiles that you know you come across and they don't really make a you know they don't really stick and you usually go on to the next all right well i say it every week and i keep saying it i'll keep saying it is don't selfselect yourself out you have to let the recruiters be the ones that say no like if you don't you know you have doubts you don't think you have the right experience the right knowledge or you don't fit well or my age or my experience or my my volunteering work just just put yourself out there and let the recruiters be the ones saying no because if you you you will tell yourself no 100 of the time so you you gotta sometimes get past that well thank you will so much for today uh thank you for sharing all this information i'm sure that there's a lot of people walking out of here today thinking all right i'm going to go spruce up my linkedin better make it look good so thank you so much no problem fat it was a pleasure thank you for having me all right and everybody i'll see you next week we are we continue to do this every week so i'll see you next monday on another recruiting tips and tricks live stream
