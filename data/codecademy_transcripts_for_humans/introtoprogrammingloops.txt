00:01 - hi I'm Sarah from code Academy and today
00:04 - we're going to talk about a fundamental
00:05 - concept in computer science
00:07 - loop's life like programming is full of
00:10 - repeating routines and sub routines
00:12 - every day we wake up and brush our teeth
00:14 - we don't just brush one tooth
00:16 - we rushed each tooth in our mouth until
00:18 - we've brushed all of our teeth in
00:19 - programming when we know we're gonna use
00:22 - a routine again it's good practice to
00:23 - put that routine into a function so that
00:25 - we can reuse it when we want to repeat a
00:28 - function or subroutine multiple times in
00:30 - a row we can use loops the other day I
00:33 - wrote some instructions for frosting a
00:35 - cupcake and put them in a handy function
00:36 - frost cupcakes so that I could reuse
00:39 - them whenever I needed say I need to
00:41 - frost three cupcakes in a row okay no
00:44 - problem I can just call my function
00:45 - three times right but what if I needed
00:48 - to frost five ten or even a thousand
00:50 - cupcakes here's where a loop saves the
00:53 - day a loop allows you to continually
00:55 - execute the same code multiple times or
00:58 - loop through a routine until a stopping
01:00 - condition is met there are different
01:02 - types of loops and each programming
01:04 - language has their own syntax but all
01:06 - loops have one thing in common a
01:08 - stopping condition this condition is
01:10 - checked every round and the loop will
01:12 - continue to run until the condition is
01:13 - reached if our goal was to frost four
01:16 - cupcakes the loop stopping condition
01:18 - would specify to continue to frost
01:19 - cupcakes until four cupcakes have been
01:21 - frosted so our loop would run frost
01:24 - cupcakes four times giving us four fully
01:26 - frosted cupcakes loops allow us to tell
01:30 - the computer where to start and provide
01:31 - a condition upon which to stop all in a
01:34 - few easy to read lines of code which is
01:36 - super sweet
