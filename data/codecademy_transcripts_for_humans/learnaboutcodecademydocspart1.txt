With timestamps:

00:00 - all right all right let me um let's hit
00:02 - the button
00:05 - all right yeah uh youtube says that
00:06 - we're live now so uh welcome sunny to
00:09 - another episode of code academy live
00:12 - and
00:13 - we like to have these conversations here
00:15 - where
00:16 - we are you know asking you some
00:18 - questions learning about some of the
00:19 - products and some of the offerings that
00:21 - code academy does some of the
00:22 - innovations that we do every week so
00:26 - here you are you want to introduce
00:27 - yourself tell me a little bit of what
00:29 - you do at code academy your background
00:33 - cool yeah so hey everybody my name is
00:35 - sunny
00:36 - i'm a senior curriculum developer at
00:37 - codecammy and i'm based in brooklyn new
00:39 - york
00:40 - i currently manage the curriculum free
00:42 - team
00:43 - and you might know me because i wrote a
00:45 - lot of the learn c plus learn swift
00:47 - learn sql courses and also help shaped
00:50 - our data science path and computer
00:51 - science path
00:52 - um i'm mostly here now echocam i've been
00:55 - here about four little over four years
00:57 - i'm mostly here now to empower people on
00:58 - my team on the crypto free team
01:00 - and also be a hype man for for things
01:03 - like cocamy docks
01:05 - which which is what i'm here today to
01:07 - promote
01:08 - this our newest product feature
01:11 - fun facts about me
01:12 - um
01:14 - i
01:14 - was born in shanghai china moved a bunch
01:16 - when i was a kid you know from germany
01:18 - france eugene oregon kent ohio and now
01:21 - in new york city
01:22 - [Music]
01:24 - my first how i got it coding i started
01:27 - cs in in college
01:29 - um and then did an internship at this
01:31 - tech startup called jack threads and
01:32 - kind of that was like a very eye-opening
01:34 - experience and have been uh doing
01:37 - tech related stuff ever since
01:39 - um during my free time i like to play
01:40 - dota i like to read product startup
01:43 - books and i like to tinker and build uh
01:46 - things outside work
01:48 - wow that's pretty cool so it sounds like
01:50 - you're pretty involved not only with
01:52 - teaching code but also writing code like
01:54 - doing things with code in general
01:56 - um is that kind of like how code docs
01:59 - sort of came to be like you were just
02:00 - looking at resources looking around and
02:02 - said you know i wish there was a better
02:04 - way
02:06 - yeah i mean i think the
02:08 - the idea of code cabinet docs has been
02:11 - floating around the company actually for
02:13 - a few years
02:15 - um
02:16 - and it's really similar to what you're
02:17 - saying just like you know me building
02:19 - stuff and kind of
02:20 - and not just me a few other people on
02:21 - the team too just you know we're kind of
02:23 - tired of seeing very inconsistent coding
02:25 - documentation
02:26 - um on the web you know some languages
02:29 - like swift's or reacts are very
02:31 - extremely solid their official
02:32 - documentation whereas other ones like
02:35 - you know javas or sequels or c plus
02:38 - felt you know a little bit outdated um
02:41 - and not interactive enough or not
02:43 - beginner friendly enough um so we kind
02:45 - of started building this doing an
02:47 - internal company hackathon and the
02:48 - project then was actually called
02:50 - codepedia inspired by wikipedia
02:53 - um
02:54 - and that kind of grew into that we built
02:56 - the prototype the team loved it and then
02:59 - we launched mvp i guess v1 and then more
03:01 - recently v2
03:04 - last month and v2 was more focused on uh
03:06 - you know contribution leaderboard uh
03:08 - highlighting the authors for each entry
03:10 - and so on
03:11 - um that's right
03:14 - yeah
03:15 - i guess for the for the viewers who who
03:17 - don't really know what code county docs
03:19 - is um so kogami docs is basically an
03:22 - open contribution coding documentation
03:25 - for all popular programming languages
03:27 - and frameworks um
03:29 - it's our we like to say that it's our
03:31 - our dream was like it's built by the
03:33 - community
03:34 - and it's maintained by codecademy
03:37 - um right now we have about 718 entries
03:41 - live across 18 different topics so
03:43 - javascript and python and 89 of those
03:47 - entries are actually created by devs and
03:49 - learners around the world which is
03:51 - pretty exciting so i'm going to share
03:52 - some links in the chat
03:54 - for people to check out
03:56 - but these three entries
03:58 - oh wait what there's 265 character limit
04:02 - so wait a second let me do this one by
04:03 - one
04:04 - you hit the limit in the chat yeah
04:06 - sounds like it
04:08 - um
04:10 - so
04:11 - so the very first one is the functional
04:12 - programming
04:14 - entry created by amelie from amsterdam
04:17 - this one so the three i'm going to share
04:19 - are all created this week okay
04:21 - here's another one
04:22 - it's a java hash map one and it's
04:25 - created by anusha from india
04:28 - and also
04:30 - factory pattern
04:31 - um
04:32 - a general entry created by bernard from
04:35 - england
04:36 - i think that those three showcases
04:39 - just like the potential of
04:41 - cocamy ducks
04:43 - awesome
04:44 - you know um i'm actually curious you
04:47 - were talking about codex and how it came
04:48 - to be like the v1 and the mvp and stuff
04:51 - um
04:52 - what was some of the can you speak a
04:53 - little bit about the guiding principles
04:55 - of this like i know that you said that
04:56 - the you know documentation online for
04:58 - certain languages is pretty inconsistent
05:01 - it kind of was a little frustrating so
05:03 - how do you tackle a problem like this
05:05 - like how do you go about okay the idea
05:07 - is we want better documentation and then
05:09 - actually for what we have today this
05:11 - really cool website is really well you
05:13 - know the design people can contribute
05:15 - all around the world how how does that
05:17 - process go from like nothing to what we
05:19 - have today
05:21 - yeah um so how to start from zero to one
05:24 - um
05:25 - i mean first i think that even during
05:27 - the hackathon we're trying to pinpoint
05:29 - an area
05:30 - um
05:31 - in the in the coding journey where every
05:34 - developer
05:35 - like we're essentially before we even
05:37 - have the idea you know we're
05:38 - brainstorming with different things to
05:39 - tackle um we want to be part of we want
05:42 - to build something that's part of the
05:43 - conversation
05:44 - um
05:46 - for every single developer around around
05:48 - the world you know how stack overflow is
05:50 - for you know answering questions there's
05:52 - um you know
05:53 - vs code is for for the for the code
05:56 - editor
05:57 - and we thought
05:58 - coding documentation is very much an
06:01 - often overlooked market
06:03 - um
06:04 - and we you know um w3 schools
06:08 - most of the web docs they've been around
06:09 - for 15 years they have deep roots in the
06:11 - seo um but
06:14 - something that people don't don't really
06:15 - know about is that w3school is actually
06:17 - the
06:17 - 136th most most visited sites in the
06:20 - world
06:21 - right so we knew there was a market
06:22 - there
06:23 - um
06:25 - so so is this one is this a process
06:27 - where you're kind of like you you think
06:29 - like a user like where if i were to use
06:31 - this myself
06:32 - yeah this is the things i would like to
06:34 - see
06:34 - oh absolutely this is definitely
06:36 - something that
06:37 - we're building for ourselves uh
06:40 - and for us and after we pinpoint it okay
06:42 - let's let's give coding documentation a
06:44 - shot we just literally just brainstormed
06:47 - all the different ways that we think
06:48 - coding coding documentation could be
06:49 - improved um
06:51 - and in our dream world you know we're
06:53 - talking about very high quality content
06:56 - very beginner-friendly content
06:58 - with breadth and scope most of the
07:00 - coding documentation that we see only
07:01 - focus on one two or three or sometimes
07:04 - less than five languages frameworks um
07:06 - and we're trying to build something
07:07 - that's a little bit more scalable
07:10 - one thing we also really
07:13 - like on the team is interactivity um so
07:16 - you know
07:17 - when you when you find what a function
07:19 - what a method or function does you know
07:21 - what the
07:22 - parameters are you also want to see
07:24 - different examples different example
07:26 - code blocks and also we include this
07:28 - which we're trying to include at the
07:29 - very very end of every single entry
07:31 - something called a code byte and it's
07:33 - basically you can click um
07:35 - press play and then you'll actually see
07:37 - the output of the of the example code um
07:40 - that's pretty cool a lot of people are
07:42 - very visual right like you you explain
07:44 - the code but they will look at it like
07:45 - well i just want to see it like in
07:47 - action i want to see the code actually
07:48 - so that's really cool feature i mean
07:50 - exactly that sounds like one of those
07:52 - features that kind of like really make
07:54 - the whole experience a new take it takes
07:57 - it to a new level
07:58 - yeah and then i would say one last thing
08:00 - um it's searchability um even within the
08:03 - the the product itself um this is
08:05 - inspire
08:06 - inspired by um the ipod and also airbnb
08:10 - this sort of a three three-click rule um
08:12 - so hopefully down the road um we'll get
08:14 - to a point for kokami docs where you
08:16 - know within three clicks you can find
08:18 - exactly the answer to your question
08:20 - um
08:22 - that's like a dream
08:23 - the dream the dream world
08:26 - nice so
08:27 - since this is a resource i know that we
08:29 - have a code academy other things like
08:30 - cheat sheets for example right when
08:31 - people are going through our coursework
08:33 - um
08:35 - what would you say is kind of like the
08:37 - prime time for a new learner to start
08:40 - exploring these kind of things because
08:41 - sometimes documentation can be very
08:42 - daunting and if you don't know a lot of
08:44 - coding uh your background is a little
08:46 - shaky you go to the augmentation pages
08:47 - and they're really thick a lot of text a
08:49 - lot of you know verbiage that you
08:51 - understand so
08:53 - it's it's co it's code academy docs like
08:55 - the way that it's getting built on the
08:56 - way that it's it you know it's adding
08:58 - new pages every day it said would you
09:00 - say there's something that people should
09:02 - jump on like at the beginning of the
09:03 - cutting journey should you first get a
09:05 - bit of background like
09:07 - what's kind of like the optimal path for
09:09 - someone that comes to code academy to
09:10 - start exploring this
09:12 - yeah i'll say cooking docs
09:14 - that the target audience is the day
09:16 - seven learner or the date
09:18 - the week two learner to advanced
09:20 - learners so the minute that you start
09:23 - trying to build something on your own
09:24 - and you're like oh i forgot what this um
09:26 - what for loop does for in python uh in c
09:29 - plus plus what a list is in python
09:32 - that's when you can look things up
09:34 - and instead of jumping out of the
09:35 - ecosystem and you know go find other
09:37 - coding documentation we thought why not
09:39 - just build it
09:40 - uh ourselves
09:41 - yeah
09:42 - no i i know that um a lot of learners
09:45 - sometimes they will have this kind of
09:46 - like feeling of like i'm not good enough
09:47 - like i don't know enough to ask this
09:49 - writer questions and stuff right so
09:51 - sometimes people it's almost like it's
09:53 - stopping them from going to the place
09:55 - like hey there's this amazing
09:56 - documentation place but they just hear
09:58 - the word documentation and think there's
10:00 - no way uh that's probably not for me
10:03 - right like but it sounds like the way
10:05 - information is being you know presented
10:07 - and the way everything's organized is
10:09 - very beginner friendly and it's it's
10:11 - almost like a tool that you want to
10:12 - learn alongside
10:15 - to use alongside your own coding journey
10:17 - like the better you get a documentation
10:19 - the better you get right like you're
10:20 - getting better as a developer you get
10:22 - has a documentation
10:24 - yeah totally uh and this is probably the
10:26 - reasons why even in colleges uh boot
10:30 - camps and also
10:31 - even on codecammy we teach people how to
10:33 - use google to search for
10:35 - um answers to your coding questions all
10:37 - the time right um
10:39 - [Music]
10:40 - yeah so there there's a pros and cons to
10:43 - this i'll say
10:44 - i'll say this is probably why seo is
10:47 - such a big
10:48 - um
10:50 - big player for for for for for things
10:53 - like hook emmy docs um just because all
10:56 - the other players out there have already
10:58 - have a strong roots in the seo business
11:00 - um over the last 15 years um
11:03 - right and that's that's that's a hard
11:04 - thing to beat right now for good gaming
11:07 - okay so let's say that um
11:09 - let we've been talking a lot about like
11:11 - the front facing or like the the first
11:13 - touch experience that you get with code
11:14 - academy docs uh let's say that we have a
11:16 - user like you said week two week three
11:18 - uh they need some help in kodakami docs
11:21 - they find help and they go oh you know
11:22 - what this is really cool i would like to
11:24 - contribute myself as well um how how was
11:28 - the thought process behind the way that
11:30 - code academy was building code docs and
11:32 - color gaming docs to to enable the
11:35 - community and everybody else to also
11:37 - contribute to these pages
11:40 - yeah we try to do a couple of things and
11:42 - one thing we try to make the process of
11:43 - adding entry and editing entry as seen
11:46 - as easy and seamless as possible
11:49 - so one thing we actually add in the v2
11:51 - uh product feature is
11:53 - building and edit adding an edit button
11:55 - for on on top of every single
11:57 - um
11:58 - codecammydocs entries so on the top
12:00 - right of every single entry they see
12:02 - every page you see you should see and
12:03 - edit this page on github so if you just
12:05 - click that
12:06 - um it'll take you directly there so this
12:09 - helps
12:10 - [Music]
12:12 - people who are new to github people who
12:14 - are a little bit overwhelmed by open
12:17 - source um you know version control
12:20 - systems
12:21 - to get over that little hump um and one
12:24 - thing we actually did
12:26 - when we first brainstorming you know
12:28 - what do we do we do build cooking docs
12:30 - internally like in-house or do we do it
12:33 - over github i was pretty bullish on
12:35 - using github because you know i think
12:37 - cocamy docs is actually a very good
12:40 - like almost the perfect
12:41 - um first open source
12:44 - project that you can take on it helps
12:46 - you you know
12:47 - get used to um
12:50 - you know how to make a br and things
12:51 - like that um how to merge your pr get
12:53 - you know just get just do the get some
12:55 - reps in
12:57 - wow yeah that's that's a really good
12:59 - point i know that a lot of learners you
13:00 - know you build things for yourself that
13:02 - we always say hey you need to build
13:03 - things with people and version control
13:05 - git and github they get really really
13:07 - scary really fast uh if you've never
13:10 - used them before so
13:12 - i'm assuming that
13:13 - the idea is people you know if they like
13:16 - what they see and they want to
13:17 - contribute like is there is there a
13:19 - world in which people contribute to code
13:21 - docs more than they use code academy
13:24 - docs like they basically say well i'm
13:26 - just looking to contribute an open
13:27 - source like i don't really like look at
13:29 - the pages i just like building the pages
13:31 - because i'm assuming that it's kind of
13:32 - like the same wikipedia right like some
13:34 - people they just write articles they're
13:36 - not really consumers they're just
13:37 - contributors right
13:39 - yeah
13:40 - um
13:42 - i mean that would be that would be
13:43 - awesome
13:44 - um but right now we have we have a team
13:46 - of internal maintainers like i think
13:48 - christie and brandon probably in the
13:49 - chat right now they're they're they
13:50 - helped me with maintaining kokami docks
13:52 - but i'll say for most these sort of uh
13:55 - open contribution sites what happens is
13:57 - like the sort of 90 10 or i forgot the
14:00 - numbers like 90 10 22 rule or whatever
14:03 - where only the two percent really
14:05 - contribute and most of them are just the
14:06 - users
14:07 - um
14:08 - but we are trying to build out a
14:10 - community of contributors who um
14:14 - we're just you know i think the dream
14:15 - world for this is that down the road in
14:17 - 10 years in five years um
14:20 - there are tens of thousands of
14:22 - developers worldwide who can you know
14:24 - make this better and better every day
14:27 - yeah because um i was asking because uh
14:30 - i would imagine that one concern most
14:32 - people have is okay i want to use code
14:34 - academy dogs but what's the quality of
14:36 - it if anyone can contribute to this is
14:38 - what i'm consuming true not true it's a
14:41 - best practice right there's a lot of
14:43 - concern about form and you know if
14:45 - you're teaching me this way of a for
14:46 - loop is that the only way is that the
14:48 - best way i want to be a good coder right
14:50 - so uh maybe you can explain a little bit
14:52 - what's the process like behind the
14:54 - scenes to ensure that code academy docs
14:56 - you know has the good a good level of
14:58 - quality and consistency and it doesn't
15:00 - you know i'm assuming that not every
15:02 - contribution not everyone can just dump
15:04 - whatever they want in kodakanidox it
15:06 - goes live right totally um yeah quality
15:09 - is something that we have a really we
15:10 - try to have a really solid grasp on for
15:12 - for for every single entry that comes in
15:15 - um so right now um we have a style guide
15:18 - in the in the repo where everybody can
15:20 - check out and sort of understand how we
15:22 - look at things how we view things how we
15:24 - review things
15:25 - and our maintainers such as christine
15:27 - and brandon
15:29 - and steven and
15:31 - kyra and a bunch of others
15:33 - what we do is we usually try to do two
15:35 - rounds of reviews for each single entry
15:38 - for every single entry um this is the
15:40 - first time we ever tackle something like
15:42 - utc user generated content so this is
15:44 - all like you know sort of
15:46 - new area for us
15:48 - but um i think two rounds of reviews
15:50 - have been doing it pretty well for us
15:52 - but we look at everything from
15:54 - formatting from
15:55 - technical accuracy from plagiarism
15:58 - um to typos grammar
16:01 - pedagogy and things like that
16:04 - that's pretty cool yeah um
16:07 - okay we've talked about how it came to
16:09 - be how it's running how you go
16:12 - through the review process
16:14 - what would you say kind of like to wrap
16:16 - it all into one big concept
16:18 - if you are a user at code academy and
16:21 - you hear about this like in this video
16:23 - somewhere else you might be thinking
16:24 - well
16:26 - why should i contribute to this like
16:28 - what is it in it for me right like
16:30 - um
16:31 - why should anyone care about
16:32 - contributing to open source projects or
16:34 - to contribute to documentation in
16:36 - general right uh do you have do you have
16:38 - like a thought about like if somebody
16:40 - asks you well why should i care like why
16:42 - should i take my time in contributing to
16:44 - this
16:45 - yeah
16:46 - i mean first of all i think it's just
16:48 - fun i think that's that's you know
16:49 - that's why open source uh community is
16:52 - such a
16:52 - such a big community is because when
16:55 - you're collectively building something
16:56 - together um it's it's just it's just a
16:59 - fun it's
17:00 - at least for me um you know to see
17:02 - something grow from nothing to even now
17:04 - it's only been a few months i already
17:06 - have over 700 entries it's something
17:07 - like almost
17:09 - um
17:11 - yeah very very very rewarding um and
17:14 - also you're building something that a
17:15 - lot of people see for example i think
17:17 - today i just pulled the stats um
17:20 - you know after the initial
17:22 - hump i guess the launch hump
17:24 - we're looking at looking at about 4k to
17:27 - 6k weekly active users for cogami docs
17:29 - consistently over the past eight weeks
17:33 - so every single entry that you
17:35 - build
17:36 - there are going to be a lot of eyeballs
17:37 - on our current most highest traffic
17:39 - topics are javascript c plus
17:43 - html and java
17:45 - so if you're writing those entries you
17:47 - know you we're talking about a lot of
17:49 - people checking out your your work um
17:51 - the total cumulative distinct users as
17:53 - of this morning is 95 000
17:56 - and i know a lot of people
17:58 - say that it's kind of cumulative users
17:59 - total users kind of a benedi vanity
18:02 - metric uh and not necessarily what we
18:04 - should pay attention to
18:06 - um when when you know when we try to
18:08 - inform our product strategy
18:10 - but we are about to break 100 000
18:13 - distinct users this week or next week so
18:16 - this is a huge heart-earned win for the
18:18 - team uh leading indicator that
18:20 - something's resonated resonating here
18:22 - with people um so i'll say that when
18:24 - you're part of something you know that's
18:26 - growing and sort of uh
18:28 - um
18:30 - you know something that started from
18:31 - scratch a few months ago i think it's
18:32 - just very very very fun very very
18:34 - rewarding and also number two i
18:37 - i think the biggest reason why i think
18:39 - some people should should help out with
18:41 - this uh on the learner's side is that
18:43 - there hasn't really been a single source
18:45 - of truth
18:46 - um for for coding documentation
18:49 - right like you know some some current
18:51 - document sites focus on languages some
18:53 - focus on um you know uh you know data
18:56 - science machine learning you know python
18:58 - packages some focus on you know the
19:00 - official documentation only focus on one
19:01 - thing or two things
19:03 - so here we have opportunity to build
19:05 - something
19:06 - that's
19:07 - very that has breadth and depth um
19:10 - and because it's open it's open
19:13 - contribution
19:15 - it's it's actually easier for us to
19:17 - maintain
19:18 - and to keep it updated right because
19:20 - because frameworks you know things get
19:22 - um new
19:24 - people ship new new new versions all the
19:27 - time but to have this sort of single
19:29 - source of truth um
19:32 - yeah i think it's it's something that um
19:34 - people should um aspire to for and help
19:37 - out especially and also a
19:39 - third reason actually i just thought of
19:40 - this on the spot but i think when you're
19:42 - writing something it's probably the when
19:44 - you're teaching something it's probably
19:45 - the best way to learn something that's
19:47 - what people always say um so when you're
19:49 - writing when you're learning a new new
19:51 - new topic or a new concept and you go to
19:54 - code gaming docs and realize oh this is
19:55 - missing i think the best way to do is
19:57 - try to write it in a very concise you
19:59 - know clear
20:01 - clarity but not losing the um
20:04 - the brevity um
20:07 - and
20:08 - try to teach it to people right i think
20:09 - that will help you sort of um
20:11 - [Music]
20:12 - really uh submit your your learnings
20:16 - totally agree yeah so to summarize
20:18 - basically is because it feels good to be
20:20 - part of a team
20:22 - bragging rights you go to people like
20:24 - look at this i wrote this article so
20:25 - bragging feels good to be at in a team
20:27 - bragging rights number three it helps
20:30 - you learn as well like by trying to
20:32 - teach us to somebody you find your own
20:34 - gaps in your knowledge like oh i don't
20:35 - know how to explain this like maybe
20:37 - intuitively you understand how it works
20:39 - but how do you explain it right like it
20:40 - makes you better too yeah that's it's
20:42 - kind of like the trinity yeah of uh
20:44 - learning to code i guess it's like
20:45 - you're part of you know you're
20:46 - collaborating you get to showcase your
20:49 - work and you also get to increase the
20:51 - depth of your own knowledge at the same
20:53 - time so that's pretty cool yeah um well
20:57 - do you have any parting thoughts we've
20:58 - been talking here for like 20 minutes 20
21:00 - some minutes uh do you have any
21:02 - maybe you can give us a sneak peek of
21:03 - some features coming up to go to academy
21:05 - docs in the future or you can tell us a
21:07 - little bit of what the future holds for
21:09 - this project
21:11 - yeah i don't think i can share too much
21:12 - about what we're going to build in
21:14 - quarter one but um next week next friday
21:17 - um we have a session another session on
21:19 - this but
21:20 - me i'll be joined by two people on my
21:22 - team christine and brandon who who have
21:24 - been helping me with cooking me doc the
21:25 - last few months um and we're gonna
21:27 - review a couple of one or two or three
21:30 - who knows
21:32 - poll requests live
21:34 - and teach you how and sort of show you
21:36 - how we look at um
21:39 - new entries on code chemi docs
21:42 - but i think that'll be super fun so i
21:43 - highly recommend people to to join and
21:45 - also um there's so many ways to
21:47 - contribute to people give me docs and
21:48 - that's something i've you know if you're
21:50 - watching this right now um not only you
21:52 - know should you check out cookie cocaine
21:54 - docs find find problems with it edit
21:56 - entries ad entries but you can also help
21:58 - promote on your social media you can
22:00 - also um give us product feedback those
22:04 - highly um
22:05 - yeah
22:06 - something we'd really
22:08 - look forward
22:10 - to yeah and i'm also here to answer any
22:13 - other questions in the chat too uh
22:16 - awesome yeah let's check out the q a
22:18 - uh yeah so this is the part of the live
22:20 - stream where we take some questions from
22:22 - the audience anyone watching right now
22:23 - live if you have questions for sunny
22:26 - about you know anything uh kodakami docs
22:29 - related documentation house bill how you
22:31 - contribute any other questions that you
22:32 - may have
22:33 - now it's time to drop those questions in
22:35 - the chat uh i know that we had a couple
22:38 - already
22:39 - one of them i feel like you already
22:40 - answered which is um you know what's the
22:43 - incentive to freely write the good
22:46 - documentation from code academy i like
22:47 - the nuance of what's the incentive to
22:50 - write good documentations in code
22:52 - academy so we're talking about what's
22:53 - incented to just contribute but like
22:55 - what's the
22:56 - incentive for someone to contribute
22:59 - good content right like
23:01 - not just brevity like oh this took me
23:03 - like 20 minutes submit the pr good to go
23:06 - like what are your thoughts on like
23:08 - people actually contributing quality
23:09 - work
23:10 - yeah i mean i think everybody should be
23:12 - have a pretty high bar for this
23:13 - especially in the in the very beginning
23:15 - whatever bar that you set
23:17 - will be the bar that people feature
23:20 - the first the first hundred i always
23:21 - tell people like the first 100
23:23 - docs entries will set the bar for the
23:25 - next 10 000.
23:27 - um so that's something to think about
23:29 - especially if you're early adopter
23:30 - you're early user of kogami docs try to
23:32 - make sure you know the stuff early
23:34 - contributor i mean try to make sure this
23:36 - stuff is solid read through the
23:37 - documentation and also just remember
23:39 - that you know when you're writing
23:40 - something like cookie docs
23:42 - hundreds of thousands people will use it
23:44 - you know in the next year or two right
23:46 - or possibly even millions so it does
23:48 - have a sort of a splash effect um if
23:52 - you're writing good compared to you i
23:53 - mean
23:54 - definitely don't
23:56 - um you know add in
23:59 - inaccurate information that's like
24:01 - number one thing to expect for um but
24:04 - the good part
24:05 - i'm going to say though for cocaine docs
24:07 - is that it's always evolving similar to
24:09 - wikipedia anybody can add an end entry
24:12 - same thing with kokami docs right it's
24:14 - right even if you do you know make an
24:17 - error and the maintainers did not catch
24:19 - it another user can
24:21 - you know
24:22 - we see this across in the last few weeks
24:25 - you know people picking up bugs and
24:27 - reporting not only reporting them but
24:29 - also fixing
24:30 - themselves yeah that's a good point i
24:32 - think it's something that a lot of
24:34 - people complain about or uh will think
24:36 - that like the first thought on an open
24:37 - source project is oh you know there's no
24:39 - quality control and that's not true like
24:41 - you can see open source projects all
24:42 - across the internet where all kinds of
24:44 - people from all over the world
24:45 - contributing and and it does work
24:48 - because someone's mistake gets picked up
24:50 - by somebody else right or uh someone's
24:53 - error or whatever like it's it's just
24:54 - kind of like
24:55 - the blob the mass right it's keeping it
24:57 - together right so and it's also an
25:00 - incentive for inviting new friends to go
25:02 - to academy docs because the more eyes on
25:03 - the docs the better they get right the
25:05 - more contributors the more people that
25:07 - contribute to it and use it the better
25:09 - it gets so it's a win for everyone uh
25:12 - let's see another question um somebody
25:15 - was wondering if code academy docs will
25:18 - ever be paywalled in any way
25:21 - yeah i think for killian yeah i think
25:23 - it's going to be free forever um that's
25:25 - just how we we set the ground rule for
25:27 - this and and
25:29 - i think i really try to make sense you
25:31 - know really try to document that you
25:33 - know this should be a free resource from
25:34 - the very get-go um
25:38 - it's just how the market is for for
25:40 - coding documentation every platform most
25:42 - platform every single actually i can't
25:44 - even think of one coding documentation
25:45 - that's not free
25:46 - um think of coming in automation as the
25:49 - sort of the the reference guy the
25:50 - reference menu for building your ikea
25:53 - ikea furnitures or
25:55 - legos right um
25:58 - this stuff uh it
26:01 - yeah
26:02 - it's it's gotta be great um
26:04 - yeah and
26:06 - another way how we think about it from
26:08 - the business perspective is um when
26:10 - we're trying to beat big players right
26:12 - now like w3 schools and mozilla web docs
26:15 - they're they're almost like the
26:16 - craigslist of of um
26:19 - of coding documentation right um and you
26:22 - know
26:23 - hundreds of
26:24 - people
26:25 - companies have tried to take down
26:26 - craigslist over the last decade nobody
26:28 - was able to do so um
26:31 - and fundamentally for that sort of
26:33 - marketplace um it's you know
26:35 - buyers go where sellers are sellers go
26:38 - where
26:38 - things are being sold and same thing and
26:40 - we look when we try to frame that with
26:42 - cocamy docs too is that um
26:45 - people are looking for free content you
26:47 - know this is how people are finding
26:48 - coding documentation is through google
26:50 - people are going to places where it's
26:52 - easily accessible it's beginner friendly
26:56 - and where they can't find answers
26:58 - if you have a paywall it's just it just
27:00 - doesn't make sense from the business
27:02 - perspective if you're looking at other
27:03 - competitors
27:05 - and it doesn't make sense for
27:06 - contributors either right like um like
27:08 - you were saying one of the benefits of
27:09 - contributing to code docs is
27:11 - is that
27:12 - lots of people are going to see your
27:13 - content you can flex like you can
27:15 - contribute article after article and
27:16 - then go put it in your restaurant put in
27:18 - your personal website or something so
27:19 - like this is what i did around you
27:20 - github if it's a paywall now people
27:23 - can't see it like you give them you're
27:25 - giving the links to protect the pages
27:27 - right so it also decentralizes people
27:30 - you know the average person from coming
27:32 - and contributing right it hurts the that
27:34 - feeding as well of content so it makes a
27:37 - lot of sense what you're saying
27:39 - uh let's see here at 130
27:41 - huh
27:42 - you're saying i was just going to say
27:44 - our philosophy here too is also just
27:45 - give more to to gain more um so we're
27:48 - building an awesome free resource for
27:50 - everybody to use and hoping that you
27:52 - know if you do need if you do uh um
27:54 - blocks you create but if you do want to
27:55 - dive a little bit deeper you can go
27:57 - check out the cooking course
27:59 - awesome all right so since we're at the
28:01 - time i'm going to go through one more
28:02 - question and then we're calling it a day
28:04 - for today let's see there's a question
28:06 - here that said will code academy dogs
28:07 - add more topics in the near future
28:10 - i think that's an easy question oh yeah
28:12 - absolutely um so check out so this is
28:14 - actually something that you all can do
28:16 - if you're watching right now go check
28:17 - out github issues um
28:19 - in the github repo so i'm going to send
28:21 - out the github repo right now in the
28:22 - chat
28:24 - um
28:25 - but
28:27 - there are tons of topics that we still
28:30 - don't have right now such as r
28:33 - such as um
28:35 - django
28:36 - uh flask all and any machine learning uh
28:39 - packages and libraries we we actually
28:41 - don't have um so there so there are
28:44 - almost endless things that um you know
28:46 - um
28:48 - that we're looking for really uh so take
28:50 - a look at cocaine dots at the existing
28:51 - entries existing topics see what's
28:53 - missing uh even within the topics itself
28:56 - there's still tons of concepts
28:59 - functions methods
29:01 - libraries that that are still needs to
29:03 - be uh filled in so so take a look at
29:05 - those first
29:07 - but github issues is a perfect place to
29:09 - re to to request for a new um concept or
29:12 - topic but also
29:14 - you know if you're if you want those
29:16 - doers go in and just make the edits
29:18 - yourself and make those uh add it into
29:20 - yourself
29:21 - yeah i mean it sounds like uh kodakami
29:23 - dogs is not limited to languages
29:24 - themselves like some people might think
29:25 - of this as oh that's for javascript or
29:27 - for python but like you said libraries
29:29 - and other tools that are like coding
29:31 - related like that it it's a home for
29:33 - everything it's a one-stop for
29:35 - everything right like if you're thinking
29:37 - of if you really like as obscure library
29:40 - that you use on javascript a lot like
29:42 - they said there's room for that too
29:43 - right
29:44 - totally
29:46 - all right that's awesome well i think uh
29:48 - yeah thank you for stopping by today and
29:50 - like you said we have a demo next week
29:53 - you're going to be here with a couple
29:54 - contributors i've been building uh code
29:56 - academy docs for a few months now and
29:59 - you're going to be doing a demo on how
30:01 - like you're going to be reviewing some
30:02 - pr's live you're going to be explaining
30:04 - how to contribute to the camera docs
30:06 - yeah yeah just to show you show
30:08 - everybody the whole process
30:09 - let us know too um feel free to shoot me
30:11 - a peer message if there's specific
30:13 - things that you want to see
30:15 - um
30:16 - at the next week's session and hopefully
30:17 - we can we can add that into the
30:19 - programming
30:21 - all right great well thank you for
30:22 - stopping by and i guess i will see you
30:24 - all next friday at the same time i
30:27 - believe 1 p.m so
30:28 - see you in a week
30:30 - all right good weekend everybody
30:36 - and that's the live stream all right

Cleaned transcript:

all right all right let me um let's hit the button all right yeah uh youtube says that we're live now so uh welcome sunny to another episode of code academy live and we like to have these conversations here where we are you know asking you some questions learning about some of the products and some of the offerings that code academy does some of the innovations that we do every week so here you are you want to introduce yourself tell me a little bit of what you do at code academy your background cool yeah so hey everybody my name is sunny i'm a senior curriculum developer at codecammy and i'm based in brooklyn new york i currently manage the curriculum free team and you might know me because i wrote a lot of the learn c plus learn swift learn sql courses and also help shaped our data science path and computer science path um i'm mostly here now echocam i've been here about four little over four years i'm mostly here now to empower people on my team on the crypto free team and also be a hype man for for things like cocamy docks which which is what i'm here today to promote this our newest product feature fun facts about me um i was born in shanghai china moved a bunch when i was a kid you know from germany france eugene oregon kent ohio and now in new york city my first how i got it coding i started cs in in college um and then did an internship at this tech startup called jack threads and kind of that was like a very eyeopening experience and have been uh doing tech related stuff ever since um during my free time i like to play dota i like to read product startup books and i like to tinker and build uh things outside work wow that's pretty cool so it sounds like you're pretty involved not only with teaching code but also writing code like doing things with code in general um is that kind of like how code docs sort of came to be like you were just looking at resources looking around and said you know i wish there was a better way yeah i mean i think the the idea of code cabinet docs has been floating around the company actually for a few years um and it's really similar to what you're saying just like you know me building stuff and kind of and not just me a few other people on the team too just you know we're kind of tired of seeing very inconsistent coding documentation um on the web you know some languages like swift's or reacts are very extremely solid their official documentation whereas other ones like you know javas or sequels or c plus felt you know a little bit outdated um and not interactive enough or not beginner friendly enough um so we kind of started building this doing an internal company hackathon and the project then was actually called codepedia inspired by wikipedia um and that kind of grew into that we built the prototype the team loved it and then we launched mvp i guess v1 and then more recently v2 last month and v2 was more focused on uh you know contribution leaderboard uh highlighting the authors for each entry and so on um that's right yeah i guess for the for the viewers who who don't really know what code county docs is um so kogami docs is basically an open contribution coding documentation for all popular programming languages and frameworks um it's our we like to say that it's our our dream was like it's built by the community and it's maintained by codecademy um right now we have about 718 entries live across 18 different topics so javascript and python and 89 of those entries are actually created by devs and learners around the world which is pretty exciting so i'm going to share some links in the chat for people to check out but these three entries oh wait what there's 265 character limit so wait a second let me do this one by one you hit the limit in the chat yeah sounds like it um so so the very first one is the functional programming entry created by amelie from amsterdam this one so the three i'm going to share are all created this week okay here's another one it's a java hash map one and it's created by anusha from india and also factory pattern um a general entry created by bernard from england i think that those three showcases just like the potential of cocamy ducks awesome you know um i'm actually curious you were talking about codex and how it came to be like the v1 and the mvp and stuff um what was some of the can you speak a little bit about the guiding principles of this like i know that you said that the you know documentation online for certain languages is pretty inconsistent it kind of was a little frustrating so how do you tackle a problem like this like how do you go about okay the idea is we want better documentation and then actually for what we have today this really cool website is really well you know the design people can contribute all around the world how how does that process go from like nothing to what we have today yeah um so how to start from zero to one um i mean first i think that even during the hackathon we're trying to pinpoint an area um in the in the coding journey where every developer like we're essentially before we even have the idea you know we're brainstorming with different things to tackle um we want to be part of we want to build something that's part of the conversation um for every single developer around around the world you know how stack overflow is for you know answering questions there's um you know vs code is for for the for the code editor and we thought coding documentation is very much an often overlooked market um and we you know um w3 schools most of the web docs they've been around for 15 years they have deep roots in the seo um but something that people don't don't really know about is that w3school is actually the 136th most most visited sites in the world right so we knew there was a market there um so so is this one is this a process where you're kind of like you you think like a user like where if i were to use this myself yeah this is the things i would like to see oh absolutely this is definitely something that we're building for ourselves uh and for us and after we pinpoint it okay let's let's give coding documentation a shot we just literally just brainstormed all the different ways that we think coding coding documentation could be improved um and in our dream world you know we're talking about very high quality content very beginnerfriendly content with breadth and scope most of the coding documentation that we see only focus on one two or three or sometimes less than five languages frameworks um and we're trying to build something that's a little bit more scalable one thing we also really like on the team is interactivity um so you know when you when you find what a function what a method or function does you know what the parameters are you also want to see different examples different example code blocks and also we include this which we're trying to include at the very very end of every single entry something called a code byte and it's basically you can click um press play and then you'll actually see the output of the of the example code um that's pretty cool a lot of people are very visual right like you you explain the code but they will look at it like well i just want to see it like in action i want to see the code actually so that's really cool feature i mean exactly that sounds like one of those features that kind of like really make the whole experience a new take it takes it to a new level yeah and then i would say one last thing um it's searchability um even within the the the product itself um this is inspire inspired by um the ipod and also airbnb this sort of a three threeclick rule um so hopefully down the road um we'll get to a point for kokami docs where you know within three clicks you can find exactly the answer to your question um that's like a dream the dream the dream world nice so since this is a resource i know that we have a code academy other things like cheat sheets for example right when people are going through our coursework um what would you say is kind of like the prime time for a new learner to start exploring these kind of things because sometimes documentation can be very daunting and if you don't know a lot of coding uh your background is a little shaky you go to the augmentation pages and they're really thick a lot of text a lot of you know verbiage that you understand so it's it's co it's code academy docs like the way that it's getting built on the way that it's it you know it's adding new pages every day it said would you say there's something that people should jump on like at the beginning of the cutting journey should you first get a bit of background like what's kind of like the optimal path for someone that comes to code academy to start exploring this yeah i'll say cooking docs that the target audience is the day seven learner or the date the week two learner to advanced learners so the minute that you start trying to build something on your own and you're like oh i forgot what this um what for loop does for in python uh in c plus plus what a list is in python that's when you can look things up and instead of jumping out of the ecosystem and you know go find other coding documentation we thought why not just build it uh ourselves yeah no i i know that um a lot of learners sometimes they will have this kind of like feeling of like i'm not good enough like i don't know enough to ask this writer questions and stuff right so sometimes people it's almost like it's stopping them from going to the place like hey there's this amazing documentation place but they just hear the word documentation and think there's no way uh that's probably not for me right like but it sounds like the way information is being you know presented and the way everything's organized is very beginner friendly and it's it's almost like a tool that you want to learn alongside to use alongside your own coding journey like the better you get a documentation the better you get right like you're getting better as a developer you get has a documentation yeah totally uh and this is probably the reasons why even in colleges uh boot camps and also even on codecammy we teach people how to use google to search for um answers to your coding questions all the time right um yeah so there there's a pros and cons to this i'll say i'll say this is probably why seo is such a big um big player for for for for for things like hook emmy docs um just because all the other players out there have already have a strong roots in the seo business um over the last 15 years um right and that's that's that's a hard thing to beat right now for good gaming okay so let's say that um let we've been talking a lot about like the front facing or like the the first touch experience that you get with code academy docs uh let's say that we have a user like you said week two week three uh they need some help in kodakami docs they find help and they go oh you know what this is really cool i would like to contribute myself as well um how how was the thought process behind the way that code academy was building code docs and color gaming docs to to enable the community and everybody else to also contribute to these pages yeah we try to do a couple of things and one thing we try to make the process of adding entry and editing entry as seen as easy and seamless as possible so one thing we actually add in the v2 uh product feature is building and edit adding an edit button for on on top of every single um codecammydocs entries so on the top right of every single entry they see every page you see you should see and edit this page on github so if you just click that um it'll take you directly there so this helps people who are new to github people who are a little bit overwhelmed by open source um you know version control systems to get over that little hump um and one thing we actually did when we first brainstorming you know what do we do we do build cooking docs internally like inhouse or do we do it over github i was pretty bullish on using github because you know i think cocamy docs is actually a very good like almost the perfect um first open source project that you can take on it helps you you know get used to um you know how to make a br and things like that um how to merge your pr get you know just get just do the get some reps in wow yeah that's that's a really good point i know that a lot of learners you know you build things for yourself that we always say hey you need to build things with people and version control git and github they get really really scary really fast uh if you've never used them before so i'm assuming that the idea is people you know if they like what they see and they want to contribute like is there is there a world in which people contribute to code docs more than they use code academy docs like they basically say well i'm just looking to contribute an open source like i don't really like look at the pages i just like building the pages because i'm assuming that it's kind of like the same wikipedia right like some people they just write articles they're not really consumers they're just contributors right yeah um i mean that would be that would be awesome um but right now we have we have a team of internal maintainers like i think christie and brandon probably in the chat right now they're they're they helped me with maintaining kokami docks but i'll say for most these sort of uh open contribution sites what happens is like the sort of 90 10 or i forgot the numbers like 90 10 22 rule or whatever where only the two percent really contribute and most of them are just the users um but we are trying to build out a community of contributors who um we're just you know i think the dream world for this is that down the road in 10 years in five years um there are tens of thousands of developers worldwide who can you know make this better and better every day yeah because um i was asking because uh i would imagine that one concern most people have is okay i want to use code academy dogs but what's the quality of it if anyone can contribute to this is what i'm consuming true not true it's a best practice right there's a lot of concern about form and you know if you're teaching me this way of a for loop is that the only way is that the best way i want to be a good coder right so uh maybe you can explain a little bit what's the process like behind the scenes to ensure that code academy docs you know has the good a good level of quality and consistency and it doesn't you know i'm assuming that not every contribution not everyone can just dump whatever they want in kodakanidox it goes live right totally um yeah quality is something that we have a really we try to have a really solid grasp on for for for every single entry that comes in um so right now um we have a style guide in the in the repo where everybody can check out and sort of understand how we look at things how we view things how we review things and our maintainers such as christine and brandon and steven and kyra and a bunch of others what we do is we usually try to do two rounds of reviews for each single entry for every single entry um this is the first time we ever tackle something like utc user generated content so this is all like you know sort of new area for us but um i think two rounds of reviews have been doing it pretty well for us but we look at everything from formatting from technical accuracy from plagiarism um to typos grammar pedagogy and things like that that's pretty cool yeah um okay we've talked about how it came to be how it's running how you go through the review process what would you say kind of like to wrap it all into one big concept if you are a user at code academy and you hear about this like in this video somewhere else you might be thinking well why should i contribute to this like what is it in it for me right like um why should anyone care about contributing to open source projects or to contribute to documentation in general right uh do you have do you have like a thought about like if somebody asks you well why should i care like why should i take my time in contributing to this yeah i mean first of all i think it's just fun i think that's that's you know that's why open source uh community is such a such a big community is because when you're collectively building something together um it's it's just it's just a fun it's at least for me um you know to see something grow from nothing to even now it's only been a few months i already have over 700 entries it's something like almost um yeah very very very rewarding um and also you're building something that a lot of people see for example i think today i just pulled the stats um you know after the initial hump i guess the launch hump we're looking at looking at about 4k to 6k weekly active users for cogami docs consistently over the past eight weeks so every single entry that you build there are going to be a lot of eyeballs on our current most highest traffic topics are javascript c plus html and java so if you're writing those entries you know you we're talking about a lot of people checking out your your work um the total cumulative distinct users as of this morning is 95 000 and i know a lot of people say that it's kind of cumulative users total users kind of a benedi vanity metric uh and not necessarily what we should pay attention to um when when you know when we try to inform our product strategy but we are about to break 100 000 distinct users this week or next week so this is a huge heartearned win for the team uh leading indicator that something's resonated resonating here with people um so i'll say that when you're part of something you know that's growing and sort of uh um you know something that started from scratch a few months ago i think it's just very very very fun very very rewarding and also number two i i think the biggest reason why i think some people should should help out with this uh on the learner's side is that there hasn't really been a single source of truth um for for coding documentation right like you know some some current document sites focus on languages some focus on um you know uh you know data science machine learning you know python packages some focus on you know the official documentation only focus on one thing or two things so here we have opportunity to build something that's very that has breadth and depth um and because it's open it's open contribution it's it's actually easier for us to maintain and to keep it updated right because because frameworks you know things get um new people ship new new new versions all the time but to have this sort of single source of truth um yeah i think it's it's something that um people should um aspire to for and help out especially and also a third reason actually i just thought of this on the spot but i think when you're writing something it's probably the when you're teaching something it's probably the best way to learn something that's what people always say um so when you're writing when you're learning a new new new topic or a new concept and you go to code gaming docs and realize oh this is missing i think the best way to do is try to write it in a very concise you know clear clarity but not losing the um the brevity um and try to teach it to people right i think that will help you sort of um really uh submit your your learnings totally agree yeah so to summarize basically is because it feels good to be part of a team bragging rights you go to people like look at this i wrote this article so bragging feels good to be at in a team bragging rights number three it helps you learn as well like by trying to teach us to somebody you find your own gaps in your knowledge like oh i don't know how to explain this like maybe intuitively you understand how it works but how do you explain it right like it makes you better too yeah that's it's kind of like the trinity yeah of uh learning to code i guess it's like you're part of you know you're collaborating you get to showcase your work and you also get to increase the depth of your own knowledge at the same time so that's pretty cool yeah um well do you have any parting thoughts we've been talking here for like 20 minutes 20 some minutes uh do you have any maybe you can give us a sneak peek of some features coming up to go to academy docs in the future or you can tell us a little bit of what the future holds for this project yeah i don't think i can share too much about what we're going to build in quarter one but um next week next friday um we have a session another session on this but me i'll be joined by two people on my team christine and brandon who who have been helping me with cooking me doc the last few months um and we're gonna review a couple of one or two or three who knows poll requests live and teach you how and sort of show you how we look at um new entries on code chemi docs but i think that'll be super fun so i highly recommend people to to join and also um there's so many ways to contribute to people give me docs and that's something i've you know if you're watching this right now um not only you know should you check out cookie cocaine docs find find problems with it edit entries ad entries but you can also help promote on your social media you can also um give us product feedback those highly um yeah something we'd really look forward to yeah and i'm also here to answer any other questions in the chat too uh awesome yeah let's check out the q a uh yeah so this is the part of the live stream where we take some questions from the audience anyone watching right now live if you have questions for sunny about you know anything uh kodakami docs related documentation house bill how you contribute any other questions that you may have now it's time to drop those questions in the chat uh i know that we had a couple already one of them i feel like you already answered which is um you know what's the incentive to freely write the good documentation from code academy i like the nuance of what's the incentive to write good documentations in code academy so we're talking about what's incented to just contribute but like what's the incentive for someone to contribute good content right like not just brevity like oh this took me like 20 minutes submit the pr good to go like what are your thoughts on like people actually contributing quality work yeah i mean i think everybody should be have a pretty high bar for this especially in the in the very beginning whatever bar that you set will be the bar that people feature the first the first hundred i always tell people like the first 100 docs entries will set the bar for the next 10 000. um so that's something to think about especially if you're early adopter you're early user of kogami docs try to make sure you know the stuff early contributor i mean try to make sure this stuff is solid read through the documentation and also just remember that you know when you're writing something like cookie docs hundreds of thousands people will use it you know in the next year or two right or possibly even millions so it does have a sort of a splash effect um if you're writing good compared to you i mean definitely don't um you know add in inaccurate information that's like number one thing to expect for um but the good part i'm going to say though for cocaine docs is that it's always evolving similar to wikipedia anybody can add an end entry same thing with kokami docs right it's right even if you do you know make an error and the maintainers did not catch it another user can you know we see this across in the last few weeks you know people picking up bugs and reporting not only reporting them but also fixing themselves yeah that's a good point i think it's something that a lot of people complain about or uh will think that like the first thought on an open source project is oh you know there's no quality control and that's not true like you can see open source projects all across the internet where all kinds of people from all over the world contributing and and it does work because someone's mistake gets picked up by somebody else right or uh someone's error or whatever like it's it's just kind of like the blob the mass right it's keeping it together right so and it's also an incentive for inviting new friends to go to academy docs because the more eyes on the docs the better they get right the more contributors the more people that contribute to it and use it the better it gets so it's a win for everyone uh let's see another question um somebody was wondering if code academy docs will ever be paywalled in any way yeah i think for killian yeah i think it's going to be free forever um that's just how we we set the ground rule for this and and i think i really try to make sense you know really try to document that you know this should be a free resource from the very getgo um it's just how the market is for for coding documentation every platform most platform every single actually i can't even think of one coding documentation that's not free um think of coming in automation as the sort of the the reference guy the reference menu for building your ikea ikea furnitures or legos right um this stuff uh it yeah it's it's gotta be great um yeah and another way how we think about it from the business perspective is um when we're trying to beat big players right now like w3 schools and mozilla web docs they're they're almost like the craigslist of of um of coding documentation right um and you know hundreds of people companies have tried to take down craigslist over the last decade nobody was able to do so um and fundamentally for that sort of marketplace um it's you know buyers go where sellers are sellers go where things are being sold and same thing and we look when we try to frame that with cocamy docs too is that um people are looking for free content you know this is how people are finding coding documentation is through google people are going to places where it's easily accessible it's beginner friendly and where they can't find answers if you have a paywall it's just it just doesn't make sense from the business perspective if you're looking at other competitors and it doesn't make sense for contributors either right like um like you were saying one of the benefits of contributing to code docs is is that lots of people are going to see your content you can flex like you can contribute article after article and then go put it in your restaurant put in your personal website or something so like this is what i did around you github if it's a paywall now people can't see it like you give them you're giving the links to protect the pages right so it also decentralizes people you know the average person from coming and contributing right it hurts the that feeding as well of content so it makes a lot of sense what you're saying uh let's see here at 130 huh you're saying i was just going to say our philosophy here too is also just give more to to gain more um so we're building an awesome free resource for everybody to use and hoping that you know if you do need if you do uh um blocks you create but if you do want to dive a little bit deeper you can go check out the cooking course awesome all right so since we're at the time i'm going to go through one more question and then we're calling it a day for today let's see there's a question here that said will code academy dogs add more topics in the near future i think that's an easy question oh yeah absolutely um so check out so this is actually something that you all can do if you're watching right now go check out github issues um in the github repo so i'm going to send out the github repo right now in the chat um but there are tons of topics that we still don't have right now such as r such as um django uh flask all and any machine learning uh packages and libraries we we actually don't have um so there so there are almost endless things that um you know um that we're looking for really uh so take a look at cocaine dots at the existing entries existing topics see what's missing uh even within the topics itself there's still tons of concepts functions methods libraries that that are still needs to be uh filled in so so take a look at those first but github issues is a perfect place to re to to request for a new um concept or topic but also you know if you're if you want those doers go in and just make the edits yourself and make those uh add it into yourself yeah i mean it sounds like uh kodakami dogs is not limited to languages themselves like some people might think of this as oh that's for javascript or for python but like you said libraries and other tools that are like coding related like that it it's a home for everything it's a onestop for everything right like if you're thinking of if you really like as obscure library that you use on javascript a lot like they said there's room for that too right totally all right that's awesome well i think uh yeah thank you for stopping by today and like you said we have a demo next week you're going to be here with a couple contributors i've been building uh code academy docs for a few months now and you're going to be doing a demo on how like you're going to be reviewing some pr's live you're going to be explaining how to contribute to the camera docs yeah yeah just to show you show everybody the whole process let us know too um feel free to shoot me a peer message if there's specific things that you want to see um at the next week's session and hopefully we can we can add that into the programming all right great well thank you for stopping by and i guess i will see you all next friday at the same time i believe 1 p.m so see you in a week all right good weekend everybody and that's the live stream all right
