00:01 - when I was spanked I'm teaching my
00:04 - friends had a program or even really
00:05 - just trying to learn myself it was so
00:07 - clear that there just so many barriers
00:09 - to entry so many frustrations and we
00:12 - wanted to take all those frustrations
00:13 - and remove them I was a political
00:16 - science major in college and went to the
00:19 - library looked at a stack of for dummies
00:21 - books on programming and didn't know
00:23 - whether I should learn you know basic or
00:25 - COBOL or PHP or whatever and so I
00:27 - learned JavaScript with Ryan's help and
00:30 - then I wrote the first JavaScript lesson
00:31 - for people like me if I could understand
00:33 - it then we'd help the rest of the world
00:35 - be able to understand it as well and in
00:38 - in the tiers we've been around more than
00:40 - 24 million people have started on that
00:42 - journey with us
00:43 - [Music]
00:46 - Sam's one of our learners who started to
00:48 - code on code Academy after completing
00:52 - part of our code year program he illed
00:54 - this website called outgrow dot me and
00:56 - it ended up being one of the times top
00:59 - 50 websites of 2013 and that was just an
01:03 - incredible moment where I realized here
01:05 - we had learners who were building real
01:06 - applications for the world that were
01:08 - having real impact what we want to do is
01:11 - be that conduit for anyone to enhance
01:13 - their impact on the world by learning
01:15 - the skills that help them better
01:16 - themselves and also better their
01:17 - communities we think about what we build
01:20 - as the fiber that connects a community
01:23 - of what is millions and millions of
01:24 - people and we looked around and we saw
01:26 - that resources that people needed in
01:28 - order to get jobs weren't available to
01:30 - them and we decided then that code
01:31 - Academy would be a free and easy way for
01:33 - anyone to learn the skills they need in
01:35 - order to better themselves and find a
01:37 - job so when I think about how far we've
01:40 - come with code Academy it's really just
01:43 - the beginning
