00:00 - hi my name is Stephanie I am a software
00:02 - developer and I'm here with coke atom II
00:04 - today bringing to you all the reasons
00:06 - why coding is useful for everyone as we
00:10 - become more reliant on technology code
00:12 - plays a much bigger role in our lives so
00:14 - even just some basic knowledge of how to
00:16 - code can help improve our interactions
00:19 - with technology and the ability to write
00:21 - code extends way beyond learning a
00:23 - language it helps you build on other
00:25 - skills that are applicable in any field
00:28 - today all the technology that we
00:31 - interact with from our cell phones to
00:34 - messages they're all powered by code
00:37 - when we send a message it may seem like
00:40 - there's a ferry running around in the
00:42 - background to pass the messages back and
00:44 - forth but concreted appropriate belief
00:47 - it's all powered by a piece of code then
00:50 - there's more code that will alert their
00:52 - recipient hey you've got a new message
00:56 - there's even code powering the videos we
00:58 - watch and the websites we browse through
01:01 - speaking of websites have you ever felt
01:04 - helpless when you're trying to load a
01:05 - page and then you get this wheel that
01:07 - never stops spinning well fun fact a lot
01:11 - of these spinny wheels are designed to
01:13 - make you think that progress is being
01:14 - made and the weight isn't that bad but
01:17 - then you realize that it's been spinning
01:19 - for ever and then you have no idea what
01:22 - to do so you figure it's broken and you
01:24 - just give up no matter what you do how
01:27 - old you are where you are unless you're
01:29 - in an area with bad internet connection
01:31 - just knowing a little bit about coding
01:34 - particularly web development in this
01:36 - case can help you figure out what's
01:38 - wrong all the people I've met that I've
01:41 - picked up coding abilities come from
01:43 - vastly different backgrounds some work
01:45 - truckers who needed a career change
01:49 - others are sales representatives whose
01:51 - coding backgrounds help them fully
01:53 - understand their company software and
01:55 - communicate the benefits of the product
01:57 - more effectively to their clients I
02:01 - friends
02:02 - Financial Analysts that want to learn
02:04 - how to use Python and sequel to build
02:06 - scripts that will run different analyses
02:08 - on their data this allows them to draw
02:11 - conclusions from financial trends more
02:13 - accurately and efficiently just
02:18 - yesterday I spoke with a guy who owns a
02:20 - small home-improvement business and is
02:22 - looking to expand his customer base he
02:24 - plans on using his coding skills to
02:26 - create an app where he can interact with
02:28 - his clients and roll out a loyalty and
02:30 - referral program for my marketers and
02:34 - designers having CSS skills allows them
02:36 - to design websites more effectively and
02:38 - communicate better with the developers
02:40 - that are building the website actually
02:43 - regardless of your current or future
02:45 - occupation anyone can use it to be
02:47 - better and more creative at their job it
02:50 - can seem a little intimidating but code
02:52 - Academy is a great resource to get your
02:54 - feet wet and help you lay down some
02:56 - fundamentals that can translate into any
02:58 - kind of problem solving when you write
03:01 - code you're also forming a new
03:03 - perspective and learning how to think
03:04 - creatively through it this is because
03:07 - when you write code for your computer to
03:09 - run it can only execute one small task
03:11 - at a time so you have to break down a
03:13 - problem into bite-size instructions to
03:15 - guide the computer to do what you want
03:17 - kind of like if your friend was
03:19 - blindfolded and trying to make you a
03:21 - PB&J since you have all the information
03:23 - of where everything is you have to break
03:26 - the process down for them from how to
03:28 - get the bread out of the bag all the way
03:30 - down to how to slice a sandwich and on
03:33 - top of that you'll have to be creative
03:35 - like what if you only have one spoon to
03:38 - make the sandwich your instructions
03:40 - would definitely be more different than
03:42 - if you rate just using a knife code is
03:45 - very much a team effort a large part of
03:48 - it is also working effectively in a team
03:50 - especially for larger projects like
03:52 - building out an application or finding a
03:55 - solution to a really difficult problem a
03:57 - lot of times you need to be able to
03:59 - clearly communicate with your team
04:00 - members to make sure the code flows
04:03 - cohesively these kinds of communication
04:05 - skills are transferable to any
04:07 - environment and are especially critical
04:10 - in a work environment one of the most
04:14 - valuable skills I've gained from working
04:15 - on teams is recognizing what I've taken
04:18 - on too much and knowing when to reach
04:20 - out to my team members for help
04:24 - technology is for making our lives
04:26 - easier and there is code powering
04:29 - technology so this should mean that code
04:32 - is for making our lives easier right
04:36 - right using code to automate any tasks
04:40 - is kind of like waving your magic wand
04:42 - and kicking back while the dishes wash
04:44 - themselves if you're shopping online and
04:47 - you want to know when an item is back in
04:49 - stock you can write some code to alert
04:52 - you when it's ready you could also use
04:54 - some code to build out a website that
04:56 - will advertise the company you're
04:57 - running I mean during college class
05:01 - registration began at 7 a.m. before the
05:03 - end of the previous semester and
05:05 - thankfully it was online but it wasn't
05:08 - enough I'm the kind of person that likes
05:10 - to see as little of the morning as
05:11 - possible so I wrote a script that would
05:14 - load up my classes for the semester and
05:16 - then enroll me at 7 a.m. so I could
05:18 - sleep or if you use Excel to manage data
05:21 - you may have noticed that you're a lot
05:24 - more prone to errors when you're
05:25 - manipulating the data and that you see a
05:28 - huge lag when you have really really
05:30 - large data sets well I've got a fix for
05:33 - you just automate that so you have a
05:37 - list of transactions that your grocery
05:39 - store made in a year and you're trying
05:42 - to get all the transactions where an
05:43 - Apple was bought if you're trying to do
05:45 - this in the Excel there are a lot of
05:46 - steps and buttons you would have to
05:48 - click to make this happen and if you're
05:50 - a popular grocery store you're gonna
05:52 - have thousands and thousands of rows to
05:54 - go through and you'll be waiting around
05:56 - forever but if you wrote some code to do
06:00 - all that for you you'll be less prone to
06:02 - errors and your code can go through
06:05 - those thousands of rows more quickly
06:06 - than Excel plus you can run the script
06:09 - on next use data set without any
06:10 - additional effort on your part there's a
06:14 - lot of manual work out there that can
06:16 - just be pushed on to some code instead
06:17 - so why not let your code do the heavy
06:21 - lifting while you get a sit back and
06:23 - relax and Sapir bubble tea
06:27 - and in the process you can improve your
06:30 - team skills and form a new perspective
06:32 - that enables you to think differently
06:34 - and more creatively and if you ever get
06:37 - stuck well the coding community is
06:39 - always here to help because at the end
06:41 - of the day we're all just trying to make
06:43 - people's lives easier well thanks for
06:46 - watching this was stephanie with code
06:47 - Academy and I really hope you found this
06:49 - video helpful please join the
06:52 - conversation by subscribing to the
06:53 - channel or dropping in comment below and
06:55 - if you're ready to take your skills to
