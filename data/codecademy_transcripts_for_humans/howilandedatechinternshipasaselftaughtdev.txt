00:01 - okay going live
00:08 - and i believe we are
00:11 - live now so
00:14 - how are you doing today julie i'm doing
00:16 - well thank you how are you
00:18 - i'm doing great uh thank you for coming
00:20 - thank you for stopping by you know uh
00:22 - all learners are always eager to learn a
00:24 - lot of information when it comes to
00:26 - job jobs careers you know learning to
00:30 - tech
00:30 - tech in general so i know that your
00:32 - journey it's one of those unique ones
00:34 - that a lot of people can learn from and
00:35 - take advice from and that's why i was so
00:38 - excited to get you to talk to
00:41 - to us today um let's just get started
00:43 - with some of the basics
00:45 - so can you tell me a little bit about
00:47 - you your background what you do
00:50 - sure and thank you again for having me
00:52 - i'm really excited to be able to share
00:54 - my story hopefully
00:56 - it will help some of the learners out
00:57 - there to also
00:59 - um shoot for their dreams so my
01:02 - background
01:03 - i am a pharmacist and i'm also a mom
01:08 - who decided to switch gears and
01:12 - go into tech i felt that tech would be
01:18 - kind of have more doors open for me so i
01:20 - wanted to explore that further
01:22 - the reason why i had stepped down from
01:24 - my pharmacy role was
01:26 - to be home with my children and during
01:28 - that time
01:29 - i wanted to add some
01:32 - ad programming to my skill set to
01:35 - differentiate myself
01:36 - and after learning programming i
01:40 - i knew i just wanted to keep going and
01:42 - here i am
01:45 - um before uh
01:48 - before i had stepped down i also
01:52 - had various roles within pharmacy i
01:54 - started as
01:56 - a pharmacy clerk then intern pharmacist
01:59 - and i even landed a corporate role in
02:02 - pharmacy where
02:03 - i helped with a really big project on
02:09 - changing the pharmacy label and
02:13 - the label now includes a little dosing
02:16 - chart to help
02:17 - patients kind of see what time of day
02:18 - they should take their medications
02:21 - in that way if they have multiple of
02:23 - these prescriptions then they can
02:26 - line them up and be able to
02:29 - see which ones they should take in the
02:30 - morning and which ones in the evening
02:32 - because of that role
02:33 - i wanted to go
02:37 - go into tech and do something like that
02:40 - again where i could
02:41 - have such a big impact um where i could
02:46 - i could do something where it had an
02:48 - impact on millions of users and i think
02:50 - we might have lost fit
02:51 - a um video are you there
03:16 - mm-hmm
03:26 - looks like we might have lost fitty
03:44 - hello
04:01 - hey can you hear me i can hear you my
04:04 - laptop completely shut down
04:06 - i'm sorry uh so i let's go
04:09 - let's just uh yeah it just decides to
04:12 - quit on me you know
04:13 - live stuff it happens that's awesome so
04:16 - can you just uh start from the beginning
04:18 - again just tell me
04:20 - you were telling i was asking you i
04:23 - wanted to ask you a pharmacist
04:25 - is something that was related to code
04:26 - and programming and like that's why you
04:28 - thought that programming was kind of
04:29 - like the natural
04:30 - uh progression for you is that is that
04:33 - were you using programming before
04:34 - as a pharmacist i was not using
04:37 - programming before as a pharmacist
04:39 - however as on the business side i did
04:42 - speak
04:43 - to developers to help
04:47 - i'm sorry if you didn't hear my story
04:49 - about working on the prescription label
04:52 - but when i when when our team had
04:55 - changed
04:56 - the prescription label we had to work
04:57 - with developers to work on
04:59 - uh some changes in our software in order
05:03 - for pharmacists to verify
05:04 - this new dosing chart and
05:08 - i wanted to be in that same role again
05:11 - i knew that i couldn't maintain that
05:13 - role with children because i wanted to
05:15 - stay home
05:16 - with my kids during that time so i had
05:18 - to leave and
05:20 - figured if i got into programming maybe
05:23 - i can go back
05:24 - and do something similar where i could
05:25 - have an impact and i could have a say
05:28 - and i could build something for
05:31 - millions of people no i mean you know
05:34 - it's interesting that you mentioned that
05:36 - you wanted to build things and be
05:38 - impactful because i feel like that's
05:39 - something that a lot of people go into
05:41 - when they're trying to
05:42 - go into tech they realize that you build
05:45 - things other people use and that's like
05:47 - very exciting and you work on problems
05:48 - and challenges that are very
05:50 - hands-on and sometimes uh other kinds of
05:53 - careers don't really give you that
05:55 - chance to be so close to what you're
05:56 - building
05:57 - and that you know that kind of uh like
06:00 - you you almost
06:01 - feel it every day like oh yeah i did
06:03 - that i coded that i built that so
06:05 - um i think that probably is going to
06:06 - resonate with a lot of people are
06:08 - that are interested in getting into tech
06:11 - do you
06:11 - um did you have any process when it came
06:15 - to
06:16 - what part of tech to focus on like did
06:18 - you how did you decided
06:20 - i'm going to go this route and not that
06:21 - route because a lot of our learners that
06:23 - come to code academy have that question
06:24 - a lot of people are saying hey should i
06:26 - do data science should i do web
06:28 - development
06:28 - should i do something else uh how do you
06:32 - decide that
06:34 - yes to be honest with you i fell into
06:37 - that same
06:38 - learner where i didn't know what i
06:40 - wanted to do i
06:42 - just first started picking a language
06:45 - making sure
06:45 - that i learned that language really well
06:47 - you want to be able to
06:50 - learn something deeply versus learning
06:52 - multiple languages but not really diving
06:54 - deep into something
06:56 - so once i felt comfortable in a language
07:00 - then i thought well maybe i might go
07:02 - into web development
07:04 - because there's a lot of jobs out there
07:07 - for web development
07:09 - i did not want to do data science
07:11 - because
07:12 - to be honest data scares me a little bit
07:16 - and so i would have to kind of ease into
07:19 - that but if i really
07:20 - wanted to get into data science i'm sure
07:22 - that's um something that could
07:24 - that could happen uh so
07:30 - did you go to any communities online or
07:32 - do you read anything about it like did
07:34 - you do the classic
07:35 - go to google like what's the best
07:37 - programming field to get into
07:38 - or what's the most jobs in demand in the
07:41 - main jobs like did you do you do
07:43 - anything like that
07:44 - actually i went when i first got
07:46 - exposure to
07:48 - programming i started with code academy
07:51 - and there is like a code academy quiz to
07:53 - find out like
07:54 - what kind of programmer you are and uh
07:57 - web development was was on there um
08:01 - but some of the some of the things that
08:03 - i would just
08:04 - do is kind of google and
08:07 - search like what kind of jobs are
08:09 - available that people are looking for
08:11 - around me just to
08:12 - kind of get an idea but one of my good
08:16 - friends told me
08:17 - what what are you passionate about and i
08:20 - felt that
08:22 - i didn't think that i could think about
08:24 - what i was passionate about i felt like
08:27 - it was just so hard for some people to
08:29 - get jobs
08:30 - that people might feel like i should
08:33 - just
08:34 - try to get anything that i can but when
08:38 - i really thought about what i was
08:39 - passionate about
08:40 - which is education and gamification
08:43 - that really narrowed my search for jobs
08:45 - eventually
08:46 - and so i ultimately just really wanted
08:50 - to
08:51 - work on something involving education or
08:54 - working on an education platform
08:56 - okay yeah that's useful i mean so
09:00 - people right now around the world are
09:02 - taking courses with code academy or any
09:03 - other platform online
09:06 - being able to say okay let me take a
09:08 - step back
09:09 - what is it that i'm interested in am i
09:11 - interested in this field
09:12 - or that field am i interested in this
09:14 - work or that work and then kind of like
09:16 - work
09:16 - way work your way backwards and say well
09:19 - if i want to get there
09:20 - what are the technologies that they use
09:22 - what is more typically used here or
09:24 - there
09:24 - and those are the technologies i need to
09:26 - focus in learning uh would you say that
09:29 - since you went through the process i
09:30 - guess of just exploring
09:32 - programming in general you went from
09:34 - zero to you know starting from zero
09:36 - um is it do you find it true
09:40 - that any programming language that you
09:41 - start with it sort of like
09:43 - builds up into your repertoire or just
09:45 - being good at coding in general like
09:47 - problem solving and looking at how code
09:48 - works like you know some people might
09:50 - argue hey you should go c plus plus we
09:52 - used to go python you should go
09:54 - like do you feel that regardless of the
09:56 - language you start with once you figure
09:58 - out hey that's the direction i want to
09:59 - go in and maybe it's a different
10:00 - language but
10:02 - it wasn't a waste of time learning a
10:04 - different language in the beginning
10:05 - right
10:06 - that is so interesting that you bring
10:07 - that up uh because
10:09 - when i first started learning
10:11 - programming i learned in ruby
10:13 - and after about a year of learning ruby
10:16 - i switched over to javascript because i
10:19 - was thinking of doing web development
10:21 - and at the time i was like gosh did i
10:24 - just waste a whole year of learning ruby
10:25 - if i'm
10:26 - not going to be using ruby and it really
10:29 - turns out that
10:30 - it really wasn't a waste of time because
10:32 - that was when i learned the fundamentals
10:34 - and the basic concepts
10:36 - that really applies to more difficult
10:38 - things
10:39 - and i have mentioned that i thought i
10:43 - had wasted my year but i really didn't
10:45 - because
10:46 - it was so much easier for me to pick up
10:48 - a new language having
10:49 - already had ruby under my belt
10:53 - and when i switched to
10:56 - so when i switched i had also did python
10:59 - i also
11:01 - did javascript and i was just learning a
11:03 - couple of
11:04 - new languages i also learned c and
11:07 - c was actually to me really helpful to
11:10 - learn because it helped me
11:12 - understand more of the computer science
11:14 - concepts
11:15 - uh really how the data is working kind
11:18 - of underneath the hood
11:20 - so oh yeah even though i don't use c i
11:23 - it was really helpful for me to to kind
11:26 - of learn it a little bit more deeply
11:28 - and that helps me with understanding
11:31 - how data kind of works and so it sounds
11:35 - like you have a very
11:36 - it sounds like you have a very
11:37 - background i mean a very diverse sort of
11:39 - background you touch a few languages and
11:42 - they all sort of like brought something
11:44 - different to the table like they just
11:45 - kind of like shine a different light
11:47 - into
11:47 - what it is to its coding and programming
11:50 - and kind of like
11:50 - the techniques behind it yeah absolutely
11:54 - i
11:54 - would recommend starting with any
11:57 - language first
11:58 - as long as it's something not too
12:01 - low level but starting with any language
12:04 - i started with ruby but i hear a lot of
12:06 - people starting with python
12:08 - or even javascript and then once you
12:12 - are comfortable with that i suggest
12:13 - learning something a little bit lower
12:15 - level like c
12:16 - or something similar just to get that
12:18 - computer science
12:19 - um background and
12:23 - and then just just keep going forward
12:26 - starting to learn a little
12:27 - you know a framework here and there and
12:30 - if you want to get into web development
12:31 - i started with node but
12:33 - now i'm working back in ruby and rails
12:35 - so
12:36 - you really you're really full circle
12:39 - exactly you're really
12:40 - going full circle where you're gonna end
12:42 - up
12:43 - do you um okay so let's back up for a
12:45 - moment and talk about
12:46 - uh you just talked about how you ended
12:49 - up using
12:50 - ruby which is now at your current
12:52 - position so
12:53 - let's talk about that journey and how
12:56 - you got there so you start zero it's day
12:58 - one
12:59 - julie decided she wants to be a
13:01 - programmer so
13:02 - can you kind of like try to summarize
13:04 - what it's like that whole
13:06 - journey of like this is how it started
13:07 - this is like how how often did you
13:10 - code every week how often was it in days
13:12 - was it
13:13 - did you measure in hours when i want to
13:15 - know
13:16 - when did you feel that you were job
13:17 - ready did you go to communities online
13:20 - to find like portfolio ideas did you
13:22 - build some ideas on github or do you
13:24 - have friends help you
13:25 - do you do any pure coding like i just
13:27 - want to understand what was the journey
13:29 - that you took
13:30 - that got you to be successful and
13:33 - get land the job that you have today
13:35 - sure
13:36 - and actually i had my first exposure to
13:40 - programming
13:40 - i believe when i was 17 in high school
13:44 - i took an intro to computer science
13:46 - course and
13:48 - failed miserably and so i hadn't looked
13:50 - at programming
13:51 - all these years until until i had
13:54 - stepped down from my pharmacy job when
13:55 - i spoke with a friend who loves
13:59 - his job as a software engineer and said
14:01 - that he
14:04 - he loves logic puzzles and solving
14:06 - problems and i
14:08 - said i love doing those things so that's
14:10 - when i decided
14:12 - uh go go to google one day and say how
14:14 - do i learn programming
14:16 - and code codecademy actually was the
14:18 - first
14:19 - thing that popped up so i made an
14:21 - account that day and i started learning
14:24 - and i will say that for the first year i
14:27 - was learning by myself
14:29 - solo i didn't join any groups
14:32 - i i
14:36 - had a rough time just trying to stay
14:39 - motivated without
14:41 - some support or a friend to be
14:43 - accountable
14:44 - with and so i only
14:47 - started learning about one hour a day at
14:50 - the time i also wasn't sure if this is
14:52 - just a hobby
14:53 - or if this is going to be a career so
14:57 - i started about one hour a day and
15:00 - i might go for a couple of weeks at a
15:02 - time here and there where i didn't do
15:03 - any programming and when i came back i
15:06 - realized how much i had forgotten
15:08 - so a good tip would be just make sure at
15:12 - least get in something every day even if
15:14 - it's just five minutes
15:16 - if you can and what was the tipping
15:18 - point when did you decide okay
15:20 - i'm going all in now that would happen
15:25 - when covid had began
15:28 - in 2020 and there's something called
15:32 - code in place
15:33 - where stanford
15:36 - computer science instructors has led a
15:38 - huge effort about
15:40 - 10 000 students 900 section leaders
15:44 - for something called code in place where
15:45 - we were going to learn
15:47 - the first five weeks of their intro to
15:49 - computer science course
15:51 - and the section leaders are there to
15:54 - meet with you
15:55 - every week to work on a computer science
15:57 - or one of the
15:59 - coding problems every week
16:02 - and after the five weeks was over you
16:05 - make a final project and
16:08 - and then you can kind of choose where
16:10 - you want to go from there
16:12 - and i felt like learning in a community
16:14 - was just
16:16 - so different from learning on my own
16:18 - when i learned in the community i
16:20 - was putting a lot more hours i would say
16:23 - at least three hours a day
16:26 - going through that course with
16:30 - now friends and
16:33 - just having that community having people
16:35 - to talk to
16:36 - and answer questions and also anybody
16:39 - who has questions you can
16:41 - help answer and it really made me feel
16:43 - good that
16:44 - i was able to contribute back it totally
16:47 - makes sense
16:47 - yeah i mean it's it's like anything
16:50 - right it's like going to the gym
16:51 - or any other project that you take like
16:53 - when you are in it with other people
16:55 - just
16:55 - there's like a little bit of extra
16:56 - motivation a little bit of extra
16:58 - camaraderie and talking to other people
17:00 - just kind of like keeps you going right
17:01 - like it's just
17:02 - to me it makes total sense that that you
17:04 - were sort of like dabbing into coding a
17:06 - bit and then once you
17:08 - found a community and a group that were
17:11 - saying yeah we are all on this together
17:13 - that that's when it sort of like clicked
17:14 - in your mind that yes
17:16 - uh this is something that uh that i want
17:18 - to put more time into more effort into
17:21 - um so and ever since then like
17:24 - and then what i was gonna say ever since
17:26 - then uh
17:28 - i only learned in communities pretty
17:30 - much so after
17:32 - after the stanford course i went on to
17:35 - do
17:35 - a harvard cs50 course also in a
17:38 - community
17:39 - that we built to complete that course
17:42 - and then after that i did kind of go
17:46 - a little bit onto web development on my
17:48 - own
17:49 - but earlier this year
17:52 - i joined a boot camp
17:56 - but it wasn't a boot camp that people
17:58 - may have heard of before
17:59 - it was called all aboard boot camp uh
18:03 - led by john crapezy and he
18:06 - wanted to help underrepresented groups
18:09 - break into tech so he decided that he
18:12 - was going to
18:14 - make a boot camp and after the boot camp
18:18 - was over you just do a final project
18:20 - and it wasn't really until that boot
18:23 - camp
18:24 - and doing that capstone project for the
18:26 - boot camp where i felt
18:28 - that maybe i am ready to
18:33 - to find a job and okay i
18:36 - yeah what was the what was your capstone
18:40 - project about
18:41 - did you use like a framework how
18:43 - involved was this
18:44 - yeah so the bootcamp was four weeks long
18:47 - and
18:49 - in the four weeks you're learning ruby
18:51 - rails a little bit of html css and
18:53 - javascript so
18:55 - my final project was a full stack
18:58 - project that and because i was so
19:02 - passionate about education i wanted to
19:04 - build something
19:06 - that would help me while learning in
19:08 - communities to have all of
19:10 - my materials in one location so since i
19:12 - learned in communities
19:15 - during this time there's always multiple
19:18 - apps that you might use
19:19 - to talk to somebody like slack
19:22 - and then there might be no uh
19:24 - announcements that would go through
19:26 - email
19:27 - and there might be assignments that are
19:28 - through another portal and so i created
19:31 - an education platform
19:32 - where users can go to whichever class
19:35 - they were enrolled in
19:36 - and then access all of those things in
19:39 - one location and i
19:40 - created a little chat thing in there too
19:42 - so that users can talk to each other
19:45 - wow um and just for the learners that
19:47 - might not be familiar with what
19:48 - when you say a full stack project but
19:50 - some some might not be familiar
19:52 - with that can you explain the kind of
19:53 - technologies and programming languages
19:54 - that you used
19:55 - sure so ruby would be like the backend
19:58 - language and then rails would be
20:00 - the framework uh for the back end but
20:03 - the way rails works you can kind of
20:05 - incorporate front end into it as well so
20:07 - you add your html and your css and your
20:10 - javascript
20:11 - all in one and you would be able to
20:15 - have a full stack project where in my
20:18 - case the identification platform
20:20 - will have let's say user data which
20:23 - would be
20:24 - in the back end in a database and
20:27 - the front end would be what you see on
20:29 - the page so users can click and add
20:31 - themselves into
20:32 - whichever of course that they want to
20:34 - enroll in wow that's awesome so
20:36 - if i understand it has i heard it um
20:40 - you build this project after boot camp
20:42 - and you realize you look you look at
20:44 - your work and you say wow i built all
20:45 - this
20:46 - from the back end full stack like i
20:49 - i feel like i know enough that
20:52 - it would be worth starting a prime for
20:54 - jobs so once that happens in your mind
20:56 - you say
20:56 - this might be the next step do you
21:00 - how do you go about learning how to
21:02 - write a resume
21:03 - learning how to do a good cover letter
21:06 - uh you know where you should be applying
21:08 - like there's so many companies you could
21:09 - be applying for like all the application
21:11 - process did you do any interview prep
21:13 - so what were the next steps that you
21:15 - took
21:17 - that's a really great question and to be
21:19 - honest with you i don't know if i
21:20 - ever felt job ready i felt like i was
21:23 - comfortable enough to
21:25 - find a place that at least provided
21:28 - mentorship so i really wanted to look
21:30 - for something like an apprenticeship or
21:32 - an internship
21:33 - to start because i didn't feel like i
21:35 - was ready just to be put in and then
21:37 - automatically start working so i focused
21:40 - my efforts on looking for
21:41 - people that were really hiring
21:45 - definitely junior roles but mainly
21:48 - apprentices okay and
21:51 - my my story with looking for a job is
21:54 - probably
21:55 - not your typical story that here because
21:57 - i really
21:59 - when i felt that i was ready i
22:00 - immediately went on to codecademy
22:03 - to like to see if they were hiring
22:05 - because i
22:06 - i knew i wanted to be there and luckily
22:09 - at the same time they were also hiring
22:11 - for apprenticeship roles
22:12 - and so i was like oh my gosh is this a
22:14 - sign like i i'm on this
22:16 - and i i focused all of my time
22:20 - crafting my cover letter for it
22:23 - uh codecademy codecademy's interview
22:27 - or application process it's very
22:31 - transparent so they ask you
22:33 - for like three questions and make sure
22:35 - you answer it in your cover letter so i
22:36 - didn't have to
22:37 - have a lot of my own material that i
22:40 - needed
22:41 - to add into a cover letter but i
22:43 - answered the three questions
22:45 - and i probably spent several days just
22:48 - rereading it okay and rewriting it
22:51 - and making sure that just because i knew
22:54 - like
22:55 - i'm curious to know that you have to use
22:56 - any like uh externals
22:58 - do you have any resources like maybe
22:59 - from your bootcamp or from the other
23:01 - courses that you took
23:02 - in communities were there any resources
23:05 - that you looked up
23:05 - like okay this is this is a typical
23:08 - junior
23:09 - level resume or this typical like cover
23:12 - letter like
23:13 - do you do you use any resources or did
23:15 - you just kind of like trust that your
23:16 - gut and said well
23:17 - this looks good and this is what i'm
23:20 - going to submit
23:23 - i do you have anyone like who's read it
23:25 - for example do you have anyone read it
23:27 - i feel like i must have googled a
23:31 - template like for example in the first
23:34 - progress
23:34 - paragraph you might just introduce
23:36 - yourself for something like that and
23:38 - then because it asked for the three
23:39 - questions it was really easy for me to
23:41 - just
23:42 - answer those three questions and then
23:43 - have a closing statement
23:45 - so i did google some and i might have
23:47 - read like what
23:50 - verbiage how you might want to present
23:52 - yourself um
23:54 - yeah i can't remember yeah i can't
23:56 - remember where
23:57 - what i looked at but definitely have
24:00 - multiple people
24:01 - proofread it for you um
24:04 - i think i had like five people proofread
24:06 - it for me so in different stages and
24:09 - my cover letter originally was two pages
24:11 - but i got it down to one page
24:14 - make sure your make sure your verbiage
24:16 - is direct
24:17 - and clear into the point so you don't
24:19 - want to fluff it with too many words
24:22 - okay and do you do any interview prep
24:24 - like once you submitted that
24:25 - the resume and your cover like once you
24:27 - submitted the application you you
24:29 - realize
24:29 - okay if this goes through the next step
24:32 - is gonna be they contact me
24:34 - and we go through questions so were you
24:36 - already
24:38 - sort of like thinking ahead and saying
24:40 - okay i'm gonna start looking around
24:42 - typical interview questions typical
24:44 - coding questions
24:45 - making sure that my github repo is clean
24:47 - and all everything very tied it up
24:50 - did you do any any of these kind of
24:51 - interview prep
24:53 - yeah good point i did take a
24:56 - data structures and algorithms course
25:00 - just to understand some of the
25:03 - basic data structures and algorithms
25:06 - that will help you
25:08 - solve for example lead code problems and
25:10 - i did do
25:11 - a few leak code problems just to
25:15 - make sure that i could solve some of the
25:16 - easy ones and
25:21 - i i felt like
25:24 - that course that i took was
25:28 - kind of gave me the basics but it didn't
25:31 - i didn't really
25:31 - get deep into the more complicated data
25:35 - structures
25:36 - which is okay because i didn't end up
25:38 - having to use
25:39 - much of it maybe indirectly i had to
25:42 - but for example for my interview here
25:46 - it was a pair programming session and so
25:49 - it wasn't
25:49 - your typical whiteboard session where
25:52 - they give you a problem and you
25:54 - whiteboarded it out and then you code it
25:56 - so it was a little bit different than
25:57 - that
25:58 - um i also uh as a part of being
26:03 - in wnb.rb which is a
26:06 - group that i'm in for women and
26:09 - non-binary folks
26:11 - i started creating a interview prep kind
26:14 - of group
26:15 - where i would just meet with a few folks
26:18 - and we would solve leap code problems
26:21 - together
26:21 - oh okay that's smart awesome
26:25 - yeah i like to like i said i like to
26:27 - learn in a community
26:28 - and i love to collaborate so i
26:31 - wanted to have something that i could
26:34 - work on
26:35 - with with other folks who are kind of
26:37 - going through the same thing and so
26:38 - i mean it sounds like a fair statement
26:40 - that collaboration
26:42 - and working with others is what got you
26:45 - like at least half the way there like it
26:46 - sounds like you got really serious about
26:48 - learning to code when you got in a
26:49 - community with all the people that we're
26:51 - learning too
26:52 - and it sounds like you lean on that
26:53 - community for code practice
26:56 - collaboration projects like you you just
26:57 - kept coming back to that so
26:59 - it sounds fair to say that that that
27:02 - aspect of collaborating with others and
27:04 - finding a niche community or some group
27:06 - that can help you that that's that was
27:07 - one of the key to your success
27:10 - yeah i think so and also make sure
27:13 - ensure you
27:13 - making sure you have a good
27:17 - support system just within maybe you're
27:19 - not working with them but
27:20 - some close friends that will help you
27:22 - stay accountable and
27:23 - you can help them stay accountable as
27:25 - well just
27:26 - just having that support the community
27:28 - yeah really really
27:30 - excelled my learning anyway
27:33 - nice so i'm curious okay so we talked
27:35 - about your journey from
27:36 - xero to the boot camp learning to code
27:39 - feeling job ready
27:40 - you prepared the cover letter you
27:42 - prepared the resume submit it you went
27:44 - through interview and prep
27:45 - a little bit of interviewing prep so you
27:47 - get the call
27:48 - you've been accepted into the role and
27:50 - now we have a lot of learners
27:52 - that they i mean they say it's
27:54 - nerve-racking because there's this thing
27:56 - imposter syndrome
27:57 - right that creeps on you and you feel
27:59 - like oh no like i learned like
28:01 - i didn't really like i didn't go i
28:03 - didn't get like a college degree on this
28:05 - you know i'm like i'm not that smart i
28:07 - don't really know that much what's gonna
28:08 - happen my first day
28:09 - they're gonna ask me questions that i
28:11 - don't know about it's gonna be a mess
28:13 - did you could you speak a little bit of
28:15 - like what it's like to get into your
28:17 - first role in tech and like kind of like
28:19 - checking your expectations checking
28:20 - yourself and like kind of believing a
28:22 - little bit yourself say hey
28:24 - if they invited me it must be that i'm
28:25 - good enough and like i'm just gonna take
28:27 - it one day at a time and keep growing
28:28 - and learning
28:31 - yeah i all of those things that you said
28:33 - resonated with me
28:34 - because i was very worried before i
28:37 - started my first role
28:39 - what what if i'm gonna be so stressed
28:41 - out that i i don't know anything and i'm
28:43 - gonna
28:43 - spend all my time googling and looking
28:45 - things up and
28:47 - will i have time to to complete all the
28:49 - tasks that they're asking of me
28:51 - and uh well i think it's very fair
28:55 - that your first role is probably either
28:57 - an apprenticeship role or a junior role
28:59 - and they know that you're still learning
29:02 - and
29:03 - they shouldn't expect you to have that
29:05 - to know everything i mean
29:07 - even seniors admit that they don't know
29:10 - everything
29:10 - and they also look things up so
29:14 - my experience with starting
29:18 - was actually and i still wear my
29:20 - imposter hat syndrome
29:22 - my imposter syndrome hat and i i
29:26 - every day i have to think about well i
29:29 - they they chose me because they believed
29:32 - in something in me
29:33 - they believed that i can figure things
29:35 - out and that's what i'm here to do i'm
29:37 - i'm here
29:38 - to to learn and
29:41 - help solve problems and there's there's
29:44 - people here
29:45 - that can help me whenever i need the the
29:47 - community at codecademy is
29:49 - very very supportive uh
29:52 - very friendly and always willing to help
29:55 - if i need it
29:57 - because i know you know i'm asking this
29:59 - question because i know that uh kind of
30:01 - like in a side note a bit um
30:03 - there is a lot of emphasis from current
30:06 - professionals in the
30:07 - in developer roles where they will say
30:09 - that even though
30:11 - there is this sort of conflict in
30:12 - interest where you are eager to start a
30:15 - role
30:15 - whatever it is and at the same time they
30:17 - will say
30:18 - your first role matters because if you
30:21 - especially as a junior in an internship
30:23 - apprenticeship
30:24 - a junior role being in a place where
30:26 - they would allow you to kind of like
30:28 - feel comfortable and understand your
30:30 - limitations and help you
30:31 - grow and help you become the developer
30:34 - that you want to become and that
30:35 - professional
30:36 - going to the full role of a developer
30:39 - it seems like that conversation always
30:41 - happens kind of like back and forth but
30:42 - it's like
30:43 - it really matters that you find a place
30:45 - where like you mentioned
30:47 - people understand that you have you know
30:49 - their limits to what you know and they
30:50 - are they accommodate those limitations
30:52 - and at the same time you might be
30:54 - feeling like
30:54 - look whoever calls me first that's
30:57 - that's the job i'm upset
30:59 - so like did you feel a little bit of
31:01 - that tension like i know that you said
31:02 - that that was very aligned for you that
31:04 - when you felt job ready was at the same
31:05 - time code economy was looking for
31:06 - apprenticeships
31:07 - sort of like felt like a straight line
31:09 - but did you
31:10 - have that conversation that monologue
31:12 - internally saying
31:14 - you know how much does it matter where i
31:17 - get a job i just need a job a job
31:19 - whatever it is did you
31:20 - do you had that moment of just thinking
31:23 - you know whatever it is i'm fine with it
31:26 - i have had fears that i would have to
31:30 - select
31:31 - a job that i could take um
31:34 - whatever it is but i have also heard
31:37 - that
31:38 - you don't want to do that depending on
31:41 - okay
31:41 - so if you're going to interview and the
31:44 - interview is going okay
31:46 - and then you're finding out maybe things
31:48 - that you you don't feel that would be a
31:50 - good fit with that company
31:52 - not saying that the company is bad but
31:54 - maybe you don't fit very well with the
31:56 - company
31:57 - but you take it anyway because you feel
31:59 - like that's the only
32:01 - job that you can get you might
32:04 - you might kind of burn out
32:09 - depending on i guess i i'm just
32:12 - i'm just saying this hypothetically
32:14 - because i'm not in that situation but i
32:15 - feel like i
32:16 - might burn out if it wasn't a good
32:19 - culture fit
32:20 - um other things might be going on i
32:22 - don't know if i would
32:23 - feel like i belong and that could leave
32:26 - like a bad taste in
32:27 - my mouth if it was my first role and
32:31 - i just didn't feel like i fit in
32:34 - would that would that prevent me from
32:37 - wanting to
32:38 - further pursue engineering i i don't
32:41 - know
32:42 - um but i have i have multiple times
32:45 - thought about i'm gonna have to apply to
32:49 - multiple places i'm just gonna get the
32:50 - first one that accepts me
32:52 - um i do hear that a lot actually okay
32:56 - so so it sounds like
33:00 - yes so it sounds like you're leaning
33:03 - more towards the part of saying
33:04 - even if you're desperate for a job and
33:06 - you just want to accept any job
33:08 - it really does matter like uh like for
33:10 - example if you're like if you try to
33:12 - hypothetically
33:13 - hypothetically imagine yourself in a
33:14 - role in a different company that's not
33:15 - code academy
33:16 - and you think about how you're going
33:18 - through it here at code academy
33:20 - you you realize there is so much value
33:23 - in in
33:24 - finding out the right fit for for what
33:26 - you're for that so like
33:28 - if you have to go back and do it again
33:29 - you'll probably try to find a company
33:32 - like that that has those rather than not
33:34 - right right and i would like to think
33:36 - that there's
33:37 - a lot of jobs out there looking for
33:40 - software engineers
33:41 - that you should be able to kind of pick
33:44 - and choose what
33:45 - what your fit is um i i couldn't
33:49 - imagine a different place working to be
33:51 - honest with
33:52 - you i feel very welcomed here and
33:55 - i feel very supported here if i have a
33:57 - question i could ask anybody
34:00 - there's there's no one here that will
34:03 - kind of shoot you away
34:05 - that's great that's awesome to hear um
34:08 - well we've been talking for a while and
34:09 - we've walked through your entire process
34:11 - that your journey
34:12 - from beginning to code and learning what
34:15 - programming is all the way to
34:16 - getting into a role that you're
34:18 - currently holding uh
34:20 - do you have any sort of like general
34:23 - advice
34:23 - or tips that you want to share with
34:26 - everyone that i
34:27 - that might be going through the same
34:28 - things that you were going of learning
34:30 - online
34:31 - being insecure not knowing which
34:33 - programming language to focus on what
34:35 - career to go
34:36 - not knowing when you are job ready you
34:38 - know i've gone through six months of
34:40 - tutorials is that good enough how many
34:42 - portfolio projects do i need two
34:44 - three uh is this a good enough portfolio
34:46 - project to be more involved like
34:48 - do you have any like general thoughts on
34:50 - on advice like if you had to go to a
34:52 - group of people and say
34:54 - you can be developers too here's some of
34:56 - the things that i learned along the way
34:58 - that could help you i think some of the
35:02 - advice i would give is one
35:05 - make sure you're learning something
35:06 - deeply not superficially and jumping
35:08 - around
35:09 - and whatever language that you pick it's
35:12 - it's fine
35:14 - and to definitely work on projects
35:18 - i had this bad habit of
35:22 - going through tutorials but not building
35:24 - my own projects
35:25 - and when you're building your own
35:27 - projects that's when you're really
35:28 - learning you're really trying to
35:31 - figure out how things might work not
35:34 - handed to you
35:36 - and really don't compare yourself
35:40 - because i personally felt that
35:44 - it took me a much longer time to
35:47 - understand a concept versus somebody
35:50 - else
35:51 - and if i kept comparing myself to other
35:54 - people
35:55 - maybe i feel like i wouldn't be good
35:57 - enough but
35:59 - i mean my role now kind of proves that i
36:02 - i can do it
36:02 - um and then just make sure you have a
36:06 - good network um
36:07 - i i believe networking is is key here uh
36:10 - making sure that you put yourself out
36:12 - there you meet new people
36:15 - learn about them
36:19 - having a support group and and learning
36:22 - with people
36:23 - just the community i can't say enough
36:26 - about
36:26 - learning in a community and learning
36:28 - publicly
36:30 - nice i like it i mean i'm in community
36:33 - all the time so i like that you're
36:34 - praising community so much that's a bit
36:36 - of a bias there for me
36:37 - um let's look at the chat see if anybody
36:40 - had any questions
36:41 - um okay so one of the users was asking
36:46 - can
36:46 - someone with no coding experience enter
36:48 - a coding bootcamp
36:49 - and become a software engineer in six
36:51 - months so do you think that
36:53 - it's possible in a six-month time frame
36:55 - to to learn coding and getting a boot
36:57 - camp
36:58 - and i guess landing a job i suppose
37:01 - i hear that all the time honestly i it
37:04 - it took me two years but i also wasn't
37:06 - doing this full time and
37:08 - i couldn't have done a boot camp because
37:10 - of the hours that were expected i have
37:12 - two young kids and so
37:14 - most of my time is spent with the
37:15 - children but yeah i hear
37:17 - i hear a lot about people who
37:21 - get into coding boot camps get a job in
37:24 - six months
37:25 - i don't know how common that is
37:28 - but i have heard about it you know some
37:30 - people might post on youtube that
37:32 - they got a job within six months i
37:35 - also um think that it depends on the
37:37 - person so
37:39 - for me i don't think i would have been
37:41 - able to do that because
37:42 - i needed some time to have concepts sink
37:45 - in
37:45 - so i felt like six months might not be a
37:47 - good a long enough time for myself
37:49 - but it could be for someone else okay
37:52 - that's fair
37:52 - yeah and i mean boot camps themselves
37:54 - they have different timelines the
37:55 - typical bootcamp might be three months
37:57 - but i've heard of boot camps that are a
37:58 - year long
37:59 - they put less hours every week and
38:01 - they're more accommodating on like if
38:02 - you already have a job
38:04 - or you know whatever life situation
38:05 - you're in so
38:07 - i suppose the answer is yes depends
38:11 - the answer depends like people have done
38:13 - it in six months
38:14 - so it's not impossible but it depends on
38:16 - your situation and what you're trying to
38:17 - achieve
38:18 - i suppose and everybody learns
38:19 - differently like you said so some people
38:21 - uh are quicker in some concepts and then
38:24 - they get stuck
38:25 - on react or all the framework and like
38:27 - that's it you get hit or wrap
38:29 - another question uh did you construct a
38:31 - resume of projects that you created to
38:34 - get the internship
38:35 - and how do you create your resume so
38:38 - that companies can see your experience
38:39 - in engineering
38:40 - so two parts of the question what about
38:44 - can you speak a little bit about the
38:45 - projects that you build
38:47 - yes i think that's a really good point
38:49 - uh two of the projects that i ended up
38:51 - putting on there
38:53 - i i added i added a python tetris game
38:57 - that
38:58 - i created and i put a why behind
39:01 - why i'm adding it to my portfolio and
39:04 - why i created it in the first place and
39:06 - the why was i wanted to
39:08 - help my kids learn how to play tetris
39:11 - and
39:12 - if i code it myself i could have certain
39:15 - pieces dropped so i started with the o
39:17 - and the eye pieces so that they can
39:19 - understand how it works and then
39:21 - over time you increase it so my
39:25 - reasoning was to help my kids ease into
39:28 - learning how to play tetris
39:30 - the second one as i already mentioned my
39:33 - education platform i created it to solve
39:36 - a problem that i had which was
39:38 - having everything in one place if you
39:40 - add that into your resume i think it
39:43 - would stand out
39:44 - um just so that they can see
39:49 - why you're building something i forget
39:52 - what the second part of the question was
39:54 - um the second part of the question uh
39:56 - was just wondering
39:57 - if you created a resume so that
39:59 - companies can see your experience in
40:01 - engineering so i'm
40:02 - i'm i'm not sure that the person meant
40:04 - the resume has in the the piece of paper
40:06 - or resume in the sense of like the
40:07 - projects that you were building
40:09 - if uh did you build your projects like
40:12 - thinking these are showcase projects to
40:14 - land a job or were you building projects
40:15 - for fun
40:16 - i think that might be more of the
40:18 - question that's a good
40:19 - point my first one was for fun but
40:22 - ended up being on my resume because i
40:25 - thought it was a good story
40:26 - and the second one was definitely
40:29 - something that i knew i wanted to put on
40:30 - a resume
40:32 - um if that helps answer the question
40:34 - okay
40:35 - one of the things that yeah one of the
40:37 - things to to keep in mind when you
40:39 - build your resume is to make sure you're
40:41 - looking at
40:42 - the job description of where you're
40:44 - applying to and make sure that there's
40:46 - keywords that are in the job description
40:48 - inside of your resume so that it can
40:51 - kind of get
40:52 - filtered through there so tailored
40:55 - tailor it tailor it to your to where
40:57 - you're applying and make sure that the
40:59 - keywords are right
41:00 - makes sense makes sense someone is
41:03 - curious to know how long it took you to
41:04 - create your first website
41:07 - oh well
41:11 - this is a very interesting question
41:13 - because i am
41:15 - very much back-end myself and
41:18 - so i would say my first website might
41:22 - be might actually be the
41:25 - the final project that i created uh for
41:28 - my
41:29 - for that bootcamp which really was like
41:33 - a little under two years after i started
41:36 - programming
41:37 - so it just it just kind of depends if
41:39 - you if you
41:40 - immediately start with front end which i
41:42 - did not do i didn't start with html css
41:44 - and javascript you you might
41:45 - create your first website in i don't
41:48 - know
41:49 - maybe a month i mean i'm not really sure
41:52 - i mean if you're talking about
41:53 - vanilla html you can create a website in
41:55 - five seconds
41:56 - just like the text document it's a
41:59 - website
42:00 - you can host that you can host an empty
42:03 - website in
42:03 - five seconds uh i'm going to answer this
42:06 - one are html and css necessary to learn
42:09 - when becoming a web dealer yes html css
42:11 - is everywhere on webs
42:12 - so you will need to know those how much
42:16 - use of them it depends on the frameworks
42:17 - and how they've written like
42:19 - ruby and rails or like react with
42:21 - node.js like
42:22 - uh how much html and css you touch
42:25 - personally depends on your role and what
42:26 - kind of developer you are
42:28 - but that's just the web the webs is
42:30 - built on those technologies so
42:32 - uh the answer is yes you you need to do
42:34 - html css
42:35 - um somebody was wondering about how you
42:38 - stay motivated
42:39 - when you were self-studying and i think
42:41 - you touched on how the community helped
42:43 - you
42:44 - the network that you work with yeah and
42:47 - and
42:48 - i actually started something very very
42:51 - cool
42:51 - and i highly recommend others to do this
42:53 - as well is i made a twitter account and
42:55 - i started 100 days of code
42:58 - and every day i would tweet about what i
43:01 - learned or what i did that day
43:04 - my tweets ended up going a different
43:06 - route where i started sharing my
43:08 - knowledge too and i think that really
43:09 - helped motivate me because i
43:11 - i wanted to be able to help other people
43:14 - follow what i was learning and so i
43:16 - would tweet something about
43:17 - maybe a ruby syntax or something about
43:20 - ruby
43:21 - a ruby tidbit and then
43:24 - just kind of learn publicly in that way
43:26 - and i think that really helped me
43:27 - because when people started seeing that
43:29 - i was doing this
43:30 - i was on it every single day i i would
43:33 - do something i would
43:34 - learn something and then i would tweet
43:36 - about it yeah and uh you know touching
43:39 - on that uh for anyone watching
43:41 - code academy has these amazing forums at
43:44 - discuss.codacademy.com
43:45 - and there's so many people looking for
43:47 - help and some people sharing their code
43:48 - and sharing their projects so
43:50 - go there to that go there and try to
43:52 - help someone and like you were saying
43:55 - uh helping people and looking at their
43:57 - code that's like a skill on its own and
43:58 - it also motivates you
43:59 - and you get more used to seeing other
44:01 - people's work in code uh
44:03 - so it has a lot of positives and you
44:05 - start meeting people you start seeing
44:07 - people online
44:08 - and like they're going through your
44:09 - journey with you and it has a lot of
44:11 - positive so i would say go explore
44:13 - communities
44:14 - and try to find someone there like some
44:17 - support
44:18 - uh i'm looking at the time it seems like
44:20 - uh it's the time flown by uh but we've
44:22 - been here for about
44:23 - for a while now so uh i think
44:26 - i just want to give you one last chance
44:28 - as any parting thoughts and to thank you
44:30 - for being here
44:32 - online with us i'm pretty sure that
44:34 - you've helped a lot of people today a
44:36 - lot of people that had
44:36 - the same questions that you had when you
44:38 - were going through your journey so thank
44:39 - you so much for sharing
44:41 - and the floor is yours i really don't
44:45 - have anything else to add um
44:47 - thank you so much for having me be on
44:49 - here i am really excited to
44:51 - hear our learners kind of follow in the
44:54 - same path and
44:55 - and get to where they want to be and i'm
44:57 - i'm just so excited to
44:59 - one be a part of codecademy's community
45:01 - as well as
45:02 - be a part of codecademy now
45:06 - okay well i think with that we
45:09 - are finished for today like i said thank
45:11 - you so much julie for stopping by
45:13 - i think um like i said i think you've
45:16 - helped a lot of people and maybe we'll
45:18 - help you again in the future if you have
45:19 - more to share i mean i'm very curious to
45:21 - know
45:22 - three months down the road what it's uh
45:24 - what it looks like so
45:26 - thank you and i'm going to stop the
45:28 - stream now
45:30 - okay all right so the stream is over
45:33 - youtube
45:34 - killed it so

Cleaned transcript:

okay going live and i believe we are live now so how are you doing today julie i'm doing well thank you how are you i'm doing great uh thank you for coming thank you for stopping by you know uh all learners are always eager to learn a lot of information when it comes to job jobs careers you know learning to tech tech in general so i know that your journey it's one of those unique ones that a lot of people can learn from and take advice from and that's why i was so excited to get you to talk to to us today um let's just get started with some of the basics so can you tell me a little bit about you your background what you do sure and thank you again for having me i'm really excited to be able to share my story hopefully it will help some of the learners out there to also um shoot for their dreams so my background i am a pharmacist and i'm also a mom who decided to switch gears and go into tech i felt that tech would be kind of have more doors open for me so i wanted to explore that further the reason why i had stepped down from my pharmacy role was to be home with my children and during that time i wanted to add some ad programming to my skill set to differentiate myself and after learning programming i i knew i just wanted to keep going and here i am um before uh before i had stepped down i also had various roles within pharmacy i started as a pharmacy clerk then intern pharmacist and i even landed a corporate role in pharmacy where i helped with a really big project on changing the pharmacy label and the label now includes a little dosing chart to help patients kind of see what time of day they should take their medications in that way if they have multiple of these prescriptions then they can line them up and be able to see which ones they should take in the morning and which ones in the evening because of that role i wanted to go go into tech and do something like that again where i could have such a big impact um where i could i could do something where it had an impact on millions of users and i think we might have lost fit a um video are you there mmhmm looks like we might have lost fitty hello hey can you hear me i can hear you my laptop completely shut down i'm sorry uh so i let's go let's just uh yeah it just decides to quit on me you know live stuff it happens that's awesome so can you just uh start from the beginning again just tell me you were telling i was asking you i wanted to ask you a pharmacist is something that was related to code and programming and like that's why you thought that programming was kind of like the natural uh progression for you is that is that were you using programming before as a pharmacist i was not using programming before as a pharmacist however as on the business side i did speak to developers to help i'm sorry if you didn't hear my story about working on the prescription label but when i when when our team had changed the prescription label we had to work with developers to work on uh some changes in our software in order for pharmacists to verify this new dosing chart and i wanted to be in that same role again i knew that i couldn't maintain that role with children because i wanted to stay home with my kids during that time so i had to leave and figured if i got into programming maybe i can go back and do something similar where i could have an impact and i could have a say and i could build something for millions of people no i mean you know it's interesting that you mentioned that you wanted to build things and be impactful because i feel like that's something that a lot of people go into when they're trying to go into tech they realize that you build things other people use and that's like very exciting and you work on problems and challenges that are very handson and sometimes uh other kinds of careers don't really give you that chance to be so close to what you're building and that you know that kind of uh like you you almost feel it every day like oh yeah i did that i coded that i built that so um i think that probably is going to resonate with a lot of people are that are interested in getting into tech do you um did you have any process when it came to what part of tech to focus on like did you how did you decided i'm going to go this route and not that route because a lot of our learners that come to code academy have that question a lot of people are saying hey should i do data science should i do web development should i do something else uh how do you decide that yes to be honest with you i fell into that same learner where i didn't know what i wanted to do i just first started picking a language making sure that i learned that language really well you want to be able to learn something deeply versus learning multiple languages but not really diving deep into something so once i felt comfortable in a language then i thought well maybe i might go into web development because there's a lot of jobs out there for web development i did not want to do data science because to be honest data scares me a little bit and so i would have to kind of ease into that but if i really wanted to get into data science i'm sure that's um something that could that could happen uh so did you go to any communities online or do you read anything about it like did you do the classic go to google like what's the best programming field to get into or what's the most jobs in demand in the main jobs like did you do you do anything like that actually i went when i first got exposure to programming i started with code academy and there is like a code academy quiz to find out like what kind of programmer you are and uh web development was was on there um but some of the some of the things that i would just do is kind of google and search like what kind of jobs are available that people are looking for around me just to kind of get an idea but one of my good friends told me what what are you passionate about and i felt that i didn't think that i could think about what i was passionate about i felt like it was just so hard for some people to get jobs that people might feel like i should just try to get anything that i can but when i really thought about what i was passionate about which is education and gamification that really narrowed my search for jobs eventually and so i ultimately just really wanted to work on something involving education or working on an education platform okay yeah that's useful i mean so people right now around the world are taking courses with code academy or any other platform online being able to say okay let me take a step back what is it that i'm interested in am i interested in this field or that field am i interested in this work or that work and then kind of like work way work your way backwards and say well if i want to get there what are the technologies that they use what is more typically used here or there and those are the technologies i need to focus in learning uh would you say that since you went through the process i guess of just exploring programming in general you went from zero to you know starting from zero um is it do you find it true that any programming language that you start with it sort of like builds up into your repertoire or just being good at coding in general like problem solving and looking at how code works like you know some people might argue hey you should go c plus plus we used to go python you should go like do you feel that regardless of the language you start with once you figure out hey that's the direction i want to go in and maybe it's a different language but it wasn't a waste of time learning a different language in the beginning right that is so interesting that you bring that up uh because when i first started learning programming i learned in ruby and after about a year of learning ruby i switched over to javascript because i was thinking of doing web development and at the time i was like gosh did i just waste a whole year of learning ruby if i'm not going to be using ruby and it really turns out that it really wasn't a waste of time because that was when i learned the fundamentals and the basic concepts that really applies to more difficult things and i have mentioned that i thought i had wasted my year but i really didn't because it was so much easier for me to pick up a new language having already had ruby under my belt and when i switched to so when i switched i had also did python i also did javascript and i was just learning a couple of new languages i also learned c and c was actually to me really helpful to learn because it helped me understand more of the computer science concepts uh really how the data is working kind of underneath the hood so oh yeah even though i don't use c i it was really helpful for me to to kind of learn it a little bit more deeply and that helps me with understanding how data kind of works and so it sounds like you have a very it sounds like you have a very background i mean a very diverse sort of background you touch a few languages and they all sort of like brought something different to the table like they just kind of like shine a different light into what it is to its coding and programming and kind of like the techniques behind it yeah absolutely i would recommend starting with any language first as long as it's something not too low level but starting with any language i started with ruby but i hear a lot of people starting with python or even javascript and then once you are comfortable with that i suggest learning something a little bit lower level like c or something similar just to get that computer science um background and and then just just keep going forward starting to learn a little you know a framework here and there and if you want to get into web development i started with node but now i'm working back in ruby and rails so you really you're really full circle exactly you're really going full circle where you're gonna end up do you um okay so let's back up for a moment and talk about uh you just talked about how you ended up using ruby which is now at your current position so let's talk about that journey and how you got there so you start zero it's day one julie decided she wants to be a programmer so can you kind of like try to summarize what it's like that whole journey of like this is how it started this is like how how often did you code every week how often was it in days was it did you measure in hours when i want to know when did you feel that you were job ready did you go to communities online to find like portfolio ideas did you build some ideas on github or do you have friends help you do you do any pure coding like i just want to understand what was the journey that you took that got you to be successful and get land the job that you have today sure and actually i had my first exposure to programming i believe when i was 17 in high school i took an intro to computer science course and failed miserably and so i hadn't looked at programming all these years until until i had stepped down from my pharmacy job when i spoke with a friend who loves his job as a software engineer and said that he he loves logic puzzles and solving problems and i said i love doing those things so that's when i decided uh go go to google one day and say how do i learn programming and code codecademy actually was the first thing that popped up so i made an account that day and i started learning and i will say that for the first year i was learning by myself solo i didn't join any groups i i had a rough time just trying to stay motivated without some support or a friend to be accountable with and so i only started learning about one hour a day at the time i also wasn't sure if this is just a hobby or if this is going to be a career so i started about one hour a day and i might go for a couple of weeks at a time here and there where i didn't do any programming and when i came back i realized how much i had forgotten so a good tip would be just make sure at least get in something every day even if it's just five minutes if you can and what was the tipping point when did you decide okay i'm going all in now that would happen when covid had began in 2020 and there's something called code in place where stanford computer science instructors has led a huge effort about 10 000 students 900 section leaders for something called code in place where we were going to learn the first five weeks of their intro to computer science course and the section leaders are there to meet with you every week to work on a computer science or one of the coding problems every week and after the five weeks was over you make a final project and and then you can kind of choose where you want to go from there and i felt like learning in a community was just so different from learning on my own when i learned in the community i was putting a lot more hours i would say at least three hours a day going through that course with now friends and just having that community having people to talk to and answer questions and also anybody who has questions you can help answer and it really made me feel good that i was able to contribute back it totally makes sense yeah i mean it's it's like anything right it's like going to the gym or any other project that you take like when you are in it with other people just there's like a little bit of extra motivation a little bit of extra camaraderie and talking to other people just kind of like keeps you going right like it's just to me it makes total sense that that you were sort of like dabbing into coding a bit and then once you found a community and a group that were saying yeah we are all on this together that that's when it sort of like clicked in your mind that yes uh this is something that uh that i want to put more time into more effort into um so and ever since then like and then what i was gonna say ever since then uh i only learned in communities pretty much so after after the stanford course i went on to do a harvard cs50 course also in a community that we built to complete that course and then after that i did kind of go a little bit onto web development on my own but earlier this year i joined a boot camp but it wasn't a boot camp that people may have heard of before it was called all aboard boot camp uh led by john crapezy and he wanted to help underrepresented groups break into tech so he decided that he was going to make a boot camp and after the boot camp was over you just do a final project and it wasn't really until that boot camp and doing that capstone project for the boot camp where i felt that maybe i am ready to to find a job and okay i yeah what was the what was your capstone project about did you use like a framework how involved was this yeah so the bootcamp was four weeks long and in the four weeks you're learning ruby rails a little bit of html css and javascript so my final project was a full stack project that and because i was so passionate about education i wanted to build something that would help me while learning in communities to have all of my materials in one location so since i learned in communities during this time there's always multiple apps that you might use to talk to somebody like slack and then there might be no uh announcements that would go through email and there might be assignments that are through another portal and so i created an education platform where users can go to whichever class they were enrolled in and then access all of those things in one location and i created a little chat thing in there too so that users can talk to each other wow um and just for the learners that might not be familiar with what when you say a full stack project but some some might not be familiar with that can you explain the kind of technologies and programming languages that you used sure so ruby would be like the backend language and then rails would be the framework uh for the back end but the way rails works you can kind of incorporate front end into it as well so you add your html and your css and your javascript all in one and you would be able to have a full stack project where in my case the identification platform will have let's say user data which would be in the back end in a database and the front end would be what you see on the page so users can click and add themselves into whichever of course that they want to enroll in wow that's awesome so if i understand it has i heard it um you build this project after boot camp and you realize you look you look at your work and you say wow i built all this from the back end full stack like i i feel like i know enough that it would be worth starting a prime for jobs so once that happens in your mind you say this might be the next step do you how do you go about learning how to write a resume learning how to do a good cover letter uh you know where you should be applying like there's so many companies you could be applying for like all the application process did you do any interview prep so what were the next steps that you took that's a really great question and to be honest with you i don't know if i ever felt job ready i felt like i was comfortable enough to find a place that at least provided mentorship so i really wanted to look for something like an apprenticeship or an internship to start because i didn't feel like i was ready just to be put in and then automatically start working so i focused my efforts on looking for people that were really hiring definitely junior roles but mainly apprentices okay and my my story with looking for a job is probably not your typical story that here because i really when i felt that i was ready i immediately went on to codecademy to like to see if they were hiring because i i knew i wanted to be there and luckily at the same time they were also hiring for apprenticeship roles and so i was like oh my gosh is this a sign like i i'm on this and i i focused all of my time crafting my cover letter for it uh codecademy codecademy's interview or application process it's very transparent so they ask you for like three questions and make sure you answer it in your cover letter so i didn't have to have a lot of my own material that i needed to add into a cover letter but i answered the three questions and i probably spent several days just rereading it okay and rewriting it and making sure that just because i knew like i'm curious to know that you have to use any like uh externals do you have any resources like maybe from your bootcamp or from the other courses that you took in communities were there any resources that you looked up like okay this is this is a typical junior level resume or this typical like cover letter like do you do you use any resources or did you just kind of like trust that your gut and said well this looks good and this is what i'm going to submit i do you have anyone like who's read it for example do you have anyone read it i feel like i must have googled a template like for example in the first progress paragraph you might just introduce yourself for something like that and then because it asked for the three questions it was really easy for me to just answer those three questions and then have a closing statement so i did google some and i might have read like what verbiage how you might want to present yourself um yeah i can't remember yeah i can't remember where what i looked at but definitely have multiple people proofread it for you um i think i had like five people proofread it for me so in different stages and my cover letter originally was two pages but i got it down to one page make sure your make sure your verbiage is direct and clear into the point so you don't want to fluff it with too many words okay and do you do any interview prep like once you submitted that the resume and your cover like once you submitted the application you you realize okay if this goes through the next step is gonna be they contact me and we go through questions so were you already sort of like thinking ahead and saying okay i'm gonna start looking around typical interview questions typical coding questions making sure that my github repo is clean and all everything very tied it up did you do any any of these kind of interview prep yeah good point i did take a data structures and algorithms course just to understand some of the basic data structures and algorithms that will help you solve for example lead code problems and i did do a few leak code problems just to make sure that i could solve some of the easy ones and i i felt like that course that i took was kind of gave me the basics but it didn't i didn't really get deep into the more complicated data structures which is okay because i didn't end up having to use much of it maybe indirectly i had to but for example for my interview here it was a pair programming session and so it wasn't your typical whiteboard session where they give you a problem and you whiteboarded it out and then you code it so it was a little bit different than that um i also uh as a part of being in wnb.rb which is a group that i'm in for women and nonbinary folks i started creating a interview prep kind of group where i would just meet with a few folks and we would solve leap code problems together oh okay that's smart awesome yeah i like to like i said i like to learn in a community and i love to collaborate so i wanted to have something that i could work on with with other folks who are kind of going through the same thing and so i mean it sounds like a fair statement that collaboration and working with others is what got you like at least half the way there like it sounds like you got really serious about learning to code when you got in a community with all the people that we're learning too and it sounds like you lean on that community for code practice collaboration projects like you you just kept coming back to that so it sounds fair to say that that that aspect of collaborating with others and finding a niche community or some group that can help you that that's that was one of the key to your success yeah i think so and also make sure ensure you making sure you have a good support system just within maybe you're not working with them but some close friends that will help you stay accountable and you can help them stay accountable as well just just having that support the community yeah really really excelled my learning anyway nice so i'm curious okay so we talked about your journey from xero to the boot camp learning to code feeling job ready you prepared the cover letter you prepared the resume submit it you went through interview and prep a little bit of interviewing prep so you get the call you've been accepted into the role and now we have a lot of learners that they i mean they say it's nerveracking because there's this thing imposter syndrome right that creeps on you and you feel like oh no like i learned like i didn't really like i didn't go i didn't get like a college degree on this you know i'm like i'm not that smart i don't really know that much what's gonna happen my first day they're gonna ask me questions that i don't know about it's gonna be a mess did you could you speak a little bit of like what it's like to get into your first role in tech and like kind of like checking your expectations checking yourself and like kind of believing a little bit yourself say hey if they invited me it must be that i'm good enough and like i'm just gonna take it one day at a time and keep growing and learning yeah i all of those things that you said resonated with me because i was very worried before i started my first role what what if i'm gonna be so stressed out that i i don't know anything and i'm gonna spend all my time googling and looking things up and will i have time to to complete all the tasks that they're asking of me and uh well i think it's very fair that your first role is probably either an apprenticeship role or a junior role and they know that you're still learning and they shouldn't expect you to have that to know everything i mean even seniors admit that they don't know everything and they also look things up so my experience with starting was actually and i still wear my imposter hat syndrome my imposter syndrome hat and i i every day i have to think about well i they they chose me because they believed in something in me they believed that i can figure things out and that's what i'm here to do i'm i'm here to to learn and help solve problems and there's there's people here that can help me whenever i need the the community at codecademy is very very supportive uh very friendly and always willing to help if i need it because i know you know i'm asking this question because i know that uh kind of like in a side note a bit um there is a lot of emphasis from current professionals in the in developer roles where they will say that even though there is this sort of conflict in interest where you are eager to start a role whatever it is and at the same time they will say your first role matters because if you especially as a junior in an internship apprenticeship a junior role being in a place where they would allow you to kind of like feel comfortable and understand your limitations and help you grow and help you become the developer that you want to become and that professional going to the full role of a developer it seems like that conversation always happens kind of like back and forth but it's like it really matters that you find a place where like you mentioned people understand that you have you know their limits to what you know and they are they accommodate those limitations and at the same time you might be feeling like look whoever calls me first that's that's the job i'm upset so like did you feel a little bit of that tension like i know that you said that that was very aligned for you that when you felt job ready was at the same time code economy was looking for apprenticeships sort of like felt like a straight line but did you have that conversation that monologue internally saying you know how much does it matter where i get a job i just need a job a job whatever it is did you do you had that moment of just thinking you know whatever it is i'm fine with it i have had fears that i would have to select a job that i could take um whatever it is but i have also heard that you don't want to do that depending on okay so if you're going to interview and the interview is going okay and then you're finding out maybe things that you you don't feel that would be a good fit with that company not saying that the company is bad but maybe you don't fit very well with the company but you take it anyway because you feel like that's the only job that you can get you might you might kind of burn out depending on i guess i i'm just i'm just saying this hypothetically because i'm not in that situation but i feel like i might burn out if it wasn't a good culture fit um other things might be going on i don't know if i would feel like i belong and that could leave like a bad taste in my mouth if it was my first role and i just didn't feel like i fit in would that would that prevent me from wanting to further pursue engineering i i don't know um but i have i have multiple times thought about i'm gonna have to apply to multiple places i'm just gonna get the first one that accepts me um i do hear that a lot actually okay so so it sounds like yes so it sounds like you're leaning more towards the part of saying even if you're desperate for a job and you just want to accept any job it really does matter like uh like for example if you're like if you try to hypothetically hypothetically imagine yourself in a role in a different company that's not code academy and you think about how you're going through it here at code academy you you realize there is so much value in in finding out the right fit for for what you're for that so like if you have to go back and do it again you'll probably try to find a company like that that has those rather than not right right and i would like to think that there's a lot of jobs out there looking for software engineers that you should be able to kind of pick and choose what what your fit is um i i couldn't imagine a different place working to be honest with you i feel very welcomed here and i feel very supported here if i have a question i could ask anybody there's there's no one here that will kind of shoot you away that's great that's awesome to hear um well we've been talking for a while and we've walked through your entire process that your journey from beginning to code and learning what programming is all the way to getting into a role that you're currently holding uh do you have any sort of like general advice or tips that you want to share with everyone that i that might be going through the same things that you were going of learning online being insecure not knowing which programming language to focus on what career to go not knowing when you are job ready you know i've gone through six months of tutorials is that good enough how many portfolio projects do i need two three uh is this a good enough portfolio project to be more involved like do you have any like general thoughts on on advice like if you had to go to a group of people and say you can be developers too here's some of the things that i learned along the way that could help you i think some of the advice i would give is one make sure you're learning something deeply not superficially and jumping around and whatever language that you pick it's it's fine and to definitely work on projects i had this bad habit of going through tutorials but not building my own projects and when you're building your own projects that's when you're really learning you're really trying to figure out how things might work not handed to you and really don't compare yourself because i personally felt that it took me a much longer time to understand a concept versus somebody else and if i kept comparing myself to other people maybe i feel like i wouldn't be good enough but i mean my role now kind of proves that i i can do it um and then just make sure you have a good network um i i believe networking is is key here uh making sure that you put yourself out there you meet new people learn about them having a support group and and learning with people just the community i can't say enough about learning in a community and learning publicly nice i like it i mean i'm in community all the time so i like that you're praising community so much that's a bit of a bias there for me um let's look at the chat see if anybody had any questions um okay so one of the users was asking can someone with no coding experience enter a coding bootcamp and become a software engineer in six months so do you think that it's possible in a sixmonth time frame to to learn coding and getting a boot camp and i guess landing a job i suppose i hear that all the time honestly i it it took me two years but i also wasn't doing this full time and i couldn't have done a boot camp because of the hours that were expected i have two young kids and so most of my time is spent with the children but yeah i hear i hear a lot about people who get into coding boot camps get a job in six months i don't know how common that is but i have heard about it you know some people might post on youtube that they got a job within six months i also um think that it depends on the person so for me i don't think i would have been able to do that because i needed some time to have concepts sink in so i felt like six months might not be a good a long enough time for myself but it could be for someone else okay that's fair yeah and i mean boot camps themselves they have different timelines the typical bootcamp might be three months but i've heard of boot camps that are a year long they put less hours every week and they're more accommodating on like if you already have a job or you know whatever life situation you're in so i suppose the answer is yes depends the answer depends like people have done it in six months so it's not impossible but it depends on your situation and what you're trying to achieve i suppose and everybody learns differently like you said so some people uh are quicker in some concepts and then they get stuck on react or all the framework and like that's it you get hit or wrap another question uh did you construct a resume of projects that you created to get the internship and how do you create your resume so that companies can see your experience in engineering so two parts of the question what about can you speak a little bit about the projects that you build yes i think that's a really good point uh two of the projects that i ended up putting on there i i added i added a python tetris game that i created and i put a why behind why i'm adding it to my portfolio and why i created it in the first place and the why was i wanted to help my kids learn how to play tetris and if i code it myself i could have certain pieces dropped so i started with the o and the eye pieces so that they can understand how it works and then over time you increase it so my reasoning was to help my kids ease into learning how to play tetris the second one as i already mentioned my education platform i created it to solve a problem that i had which was having everything in one place if you add that into your resume i think it would stand out um just so that they can see why you're building something i forget what the second part of the question was um the second part of the question uh was just wondering if you created a resume so that companies can see your experience in engineering so i'm i'm i'm not sure that the person meant the resume has in the the piece of paper or resume in the sense of like the projects that you were building if uh did you build your projects like thinking these are showcase projects to land a job or were you building projects for fun i think that might be more of the question that's a good point my first one was for fun but ended up being on my resume because i thought it was a good story and the second one was definitely something that i knew i wanted to put on a resume um if that helps answer the question okay one of the things that yeah one of the things to to keep in mind when you build your resume is to make sure you're looking at the job description of where you're applying to and make sure that there's keywords that are in the job description inside of your resume so that it can kind of get filtered through there so tailored tailor it tailor it to your to where you're applying and make sure that the keywords are right makes sense makes sense someone is curious to know how long it took you to create your first website oh well this is a very interesting question because i am very much backend myself and so i would say my first website might be might actually be the the final project that i created uh for my for that bootcamp which really was like a little under two years after i started programming so it just it just kind of depends if you if you immediately start with front end which i did not do i didn't start with html css and javascript you you might create your first website in i don't know maybe a month i mean i'm not really sure i mean if you're talking about vanilla html you can create a website in five seconds just like the text document it's a website you can host that you can host an empty website in five seconds uh i'm going to answer this one are html and css necessary to learn when becoming a web dealer yes html css is everywhere on webs so you will need to know those how much use of them it depends on the frameworks and how they've written like ruby and rails or like react with node.js like uh how much html and css you touch personally depends on your role and what kind of developer you are but that's just the web the webs is built on those technologies so uh the answer is yes you you need to do html css um somebody was wondering about how you stay motivated when you were selfstudying and i think you touched on how the community helped you the network that you work with yeah and and i actually started something very very cool and i highly recommend others to do this as well is i made a twitter account and i started 100 days of code and every day i would tweet about what i learned or what i did that day my tweets ended up going a different route where i started sharing my knowledge too and i think that really helped motivate me because i i wanted to be able to help other people follow what i was learning and so i would tweet something about maybe a ruby syntax or something about ruby a ruby tidbit and then just kind of learn publicly in that way and i think that really helped me because when people started seeing that i was doing this i was on it every single day i i would do something i would learn something and then i would tweet about it yeah and uh you know touching on that uh for anyone watching code academy has these amazing forums at discuss.codacademy.com and there's so many people looking for help and some people sharing their code and sharing their projects so go there to that go there and try to help someone and like you were saying uh helping people and looking at their code that's like a skill on its own and it also motivates you and you get more used to seeing other people's work in code uh so it has a lot of positives and you start meeting people you start seeing people online and like they're going through your journey with you and it has a lot of positive so i would say go explore communities and try to find someone there like some support uh i'm looking at the time it seems like uh it's the time flown by uh but we've been here for about for a while now so uh i think i just want to give you one last chance as any parting thoughts and to thank you for being here online with us i'm pretty sure that you've helped a lot of people today a lot of people that had the same questions that you had when you were going through your journey so thank you so much for sharing and the floor is yours i really don't have anything else to add um thank you so much for having me be on here i am really excited to hear our learners kind of follow in the same path and and get to where they want to be and i'm i'm just so excited to one be a part of codecademy's community as well as be a part of codecademy now okay well i think with that we are finished for today like i said thank you so much julie for stopping by i think um like i said i think you've helped a lot of people and maybe we'll help you again in the future if you have more to share i mean i'm very curious to know three months down the road what it's uh what it looks like so thank you and i'm going to stop the stream now okay all right so the stream is over youtube killed it so
