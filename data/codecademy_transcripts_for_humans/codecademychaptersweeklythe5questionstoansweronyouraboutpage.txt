00:02 - community manager
00:03 - with codecademy today's quick tip video
00:06 - is about the five questions
00:09 - you need to answer on your chapters
00:12 - about paige
00:14 - let me just get right to it those
00:15 - questions are when
00:17 - how what why and who
00:20 - totally the basics right but i think
00:22 - that there is
00:23 - power in doing the basics right so let's
00:25 - go through them
00:26 - when how often do you meet what schedule
00:30 - being regular about the time that you
00:33 - meet every two weeks
00:34 - every month on the last friday of the
00:36 - month being specific about that
00:38 - regularity will help somebody
00:40 - who is busy like so many of us are with
00:43 - our jobs and our lives
00:45 - decide okay this fits into my schedule
00:47 - or it doesn't
00:48 - quick decision to make how what's the
00:51 - format
00:52 - of your of your chapter and your meetup
00:54 - i know many of you are
00:55 - um hoping to figure that out in your in
00:58 - your first
01:00 - in your first meet up i think it's a
01:02 - great idea to just make that decision
01:04 - especially for your first meet up and
01:06 - then have that discussion
01:07 - with your chapter members after but
01:09 - having that decision made on your about
01:11 - page lets people know ah
01:13 - okay this is something organized and
01:15 - this will be worth my time
01:17 - what what topic will you cover i know
01:19 - this seems like a thing
01:21 - also to decide on with your group but
01:24 - follow what's interesting to you
01:27 - and we'll get to that now why
01:30 - the why this is number four why
01:33 - what is your purpose and your mission
01:35 - why is it important
01:37 - to you to build local community
01:40 - articulating that
01:41 - is definitely going to speak to somebody
01:43 - who is
01:45 - a good potential member and will agree
01:48 - they'll probably agree why it's a good
01:50 - reason to build local community a local
01:52 - coding community and you'll be able to
01:56 - recruit the um the right people that way
01:58 - finally
01:59 - who speaking of the right people being
02:03 - clear about
02:03 - who your chapter is for is as easy as a
02:07 - sentence with a format
02:08 - people learning x in y
02:12 - city so applied that would look like
02:13 - people learning react
02:15 - native in new york city i'm learning
02:18 - react native in new york city are you
02:20 - learning who's learning
02:21 - in new york city that's an easy one for
02:23 - people to be able to identify themselves
02:26 - with so i think that that's a really
02:28 - great
02:29 - place to start now i know i'm going to
02:31 - spend some time on who because i know
02:32 - that that sounds counter intuitive
02:35 - but i promise you from experience it is
02:38 - better to have
02:39 - especially when you're starting five
02:41 - people
02:42 - who are there for the right reasons
02:46 - because they're
02:46 - learning react native in new york city
02:48 - given that example than a hundred people
02:51 - who came to a meet up and they're not
02:54 - sure if they're
02:55 - interested in um python or maybe
02:58 - they're gonna go with javascript or
03:00 - maybe machine learning
03:02 - having those people who know why they
03:04 - are there gives them a reason to connect
03:06 - that those hundred people who aren't
03:08 - sure why they're there
03:10 - won't have they won't have that reason
03:12 - to connect that those
03:13 - the five people who fit the who
03:17 - description will have okay
03:20 - so recap when how on your about page

03:27 - members how often you'll meet
03:29 - to how what's the format do you have
03:32 - speakers are you going to do projects
03:33 - be clear this can change but being clear
03:36 - about it
03:37 - helps people make decisions what what
03:39 - topic will you cover
03:40 - are you about learning javascript are
03:42 - you running through the data science
03:43 - path
03:44 - the what is in a lot of ways the meat
03:48 - of of why somebody shows up why what's
03:51 - your mission what's your purpose
03:52 - why do you believe in building local
03:54 - coding communities
03:56 - probably you'll find some like-minded
03:58 - people that way and lastly
04:00 - who people learning x in
04:03 - y city or y university this is
