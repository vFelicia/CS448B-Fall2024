00:00 - hello my name is Farish and i'm a
00:02 - california-based developer and in this
00:04 - video we're gonna cover how to build a
00:07 - portfolio but before I get started I'm
00:10 - gonna take a moment to go over why a
00:12 - portfolio is valuable to have and you
00:14 - may be asking yourself why have a
00:16 - portfolio let me give you a few reasons
00:19 - why a portfolio is valuable perspective
00:22 - employers or clients want to see your
00:24 - current body of work
00:25 - just seeing trust me I can do this is it
00:28 - enough you're asking them to take a leap
00:30 - of faith without showing them you even
00:32 - know how to jump secondly a portfolio
00:35 - brings credibility because it showcases
00:37 - your work you are proving what you are
00:40 - capable of by taking your code and
00:42 - turning it into completed projects
00:45 - lastly this also has the benefit of
00:47 - being an online resume consider this to
00:50 - be a marketing tool
00:51 - when a person visually sees what you
00:53 - have accomplished that makes a greater
00:55 - impact than just reading about your
00:57 - skills through a resume do you make sure
00:59 - to put in your contact information
01:01 - social media and specialized skills
01:03 - let's treat the portfolio like a set of
01:06 - stairs as a beginner you may be
01:07 - concerned with where you should start so
01:09 - at the bottom step I'm gonna recommend
01:11 - codecademy projects they're already
01:13 - available for you to use and as you put
01:16 - them in your portfolio it shows your
01:17 - commitment to learning if you're unsure
01:19 - on what projects to choose just pick
01:22 - ones that catch your interests in your
01:24 - specific path or any of them in the
01:27 - catalog now after you've done that we're
01:29 - gonna head to the next step which is to
01:31 - build a project on your own try to pick
01:33 - something you're interested in and if
01:35 - you're not sure what you're interested
01:36 - in one thing I would recommend is to go
01:38 - to Google look at local businesses take
01:40 - a look at their websites and maybe
01:42 - redesign them I'm gonna do a quick
01:45 - overview on the redesign process first
01:47 - come up with a plan
01:49 - this site is outdated what modern look
01:51 - could I use to give the site a fresh
01:53 - design if I'm not sure I'm gonna look at
01:56 - comparable businesses any site that
01:58 - looks new and well built I'm gonna see
02:00 - what elements of that site I could fit
02:02 - in the theme of the business I'm
02:04 - redesigning I'm also gonna make sure to
02:06 - write this information down the worst
02:08 - thing that can happen is I find some
02:10 - inspiration but because they didn't
02:12 - write it down
02:13 - forgot where I saw it second let's start
02:16 - with wireframing
02:17 - consider wireframes to be outlines of
02:19 - your website they don't need to be
02:22 - perfect
02:22 - they're just general guidelines don't be
02:24 - afraid to make changes because of
02:26 - something that you end up not liking
02:28 - later on lastly don't be afraid to
02:31 - experiment or make mistakes play around
02:33 - with colors positioning CSS tricks and
02:37 - whatever else you may like to try this
02:39 - is all part of the learning process
02:41 - remember the long term goal here is
02:43 - improvement not perfection
02:45 - after you built your project on your own
02:47 - you may be wondering what to do next the
02:50 - answer is to keep building and I want to
02:52 - explain this further even though there
02:54 - is no fixed number having two to three
02:56 - projects that you have built on your own
02:57 - is a good starting point part of the
02:59 - value in doing your portfolio is to show
03:01 - improvement and growth with your skill
03:03 - set maybe after doing two to three
03:05 - projects you're having trouble with
03:06 - finding inspiration on project ideas a
03:09 - good alternative is to add features to
03:11 - your existing projects keep building can
03:14 - also mean keep iterating your first site
03:17 - could be built on HTML and CSS then
03:20 - you're feeling uninspired to build a
03:21 - second site take advantage of this site
03:24 - and add some vanilla JavaScript to this
03:26 - to expand your skill set then your next
03:28 - site may have all the features of this
03:30 - first site expand your skill set again
03:32 - by adding a framework like react now
03:35 - lastly you can take your react app move
03:37 - it to the next level by building it back
03:39 - in using nodejs whether it is through
03:42 - making new projects or adding to your
03:44 - existing ones the goal is to keep
03:47 - building so what happens when you reach
03:49 - the top of the stairs well that leads to
03:51 - the step of cleaning up and what I mean
03:53 - by that is we're gonna clean up your
03:55 - portfolio remove older projects that no
03:57 - longer reflect your skill level if you
03:59 - have too many projects your portfolio
04:01 - can be overwhelming plus you may not
04:03 - want to showcase that project you did
04:05 - four or five years ago there's nothing
04:07 - wrong with taking some time and
04:09 - refactoring your pro folio and making it
04:11 - more up-to-date and relevant with
04:13 - today's technology now what if you
04:15 - aren't doing front-end
04:16 - do you still need a portfolio well if
04:18 - you're doing Python data science or
04:21 - machine learning the earlier reasons to
04:23 - have a portfolio still apply
04:25 - you still
04:26 - pleated code online and you want to make
04:28 - sure to include detail instructions on
04:30 - how the program works and what is the
04:32 - expected output and I might want to
04:34 - recommend doing step-by-step write-ups
04:36 - with juniper notebooks I suppose she
04:39 - says you can share them with github if
04:40 - any of this has you concerned or scared
04:43 - please don't stress out this is all
04:45 - taught on the code Academy platform so
04:47 - now we need to discuss where we're gonna
04:48 - host our portfolio now the first option
04:51 - is standard web hosting also known as
04:54 - shared web hosting this is great for
04:56 - front-end web sites but it has many
04:58 - limitations you only get a small slice
05:00 - of the server resources clusters very
05:03 - limited back in support for example my
05:06 - shared hosting only supports node 1.0
05:09 - the current version of node is version
05:11 - 11 in return for these limitations
05:13 - usually shared hosting is the lowest
05:15 - cost and it is perfectly fine for
05:18 - hosting websites built on HTML CSS Anila
05:22 - javascript and jquery now the next type
05:24 - of web hosting is a VPS which stands for
05:28 - a virtual private server and what is
05:30 - being done here is you're renting out a
05:31 - small part of the server to get a bigger
05:34 - slice of resources this gives you more
05:36 - power than traditional web hosting you
05:38 - can host Brenden and back in
05:40 - applications the drawback is there's
05:42 - some configuration involved in some
05:45 - deployment knowledge that is needed some
05:47 - major players of VPS services are
05:49 - digitalocean Microsoft Azure and Amazon
05:53 - Web Services and the last type of
05:55 - hosting is dedicated and dedicate is
05:57 - renting a full server you aren't sharing
05:59 - any part of it as you can imagine this
06:02 - runs out the higher cost and requires a
06:05 - high level of deployment knowledge now
06:07 - we've just gone over a lot of hosting
06:09 - information and I'm not gonna recommend
06:11 - any of it to start out with really take
06:14 - a different direction but I wanted you
06:16 - to have the knowledge of what your
06:17 - options are now what I'm actually gonna
06:19 - recommend is github and github should
06:22 - already be used to host your code now
06:24 - don't let that statement stress you out
06:26 - this is depending on where you are for
06:28 - your development path and if you haven't
06:30 - gotten to that part of the path yet just
06:32 - be aware it is part of code Academy's
06:34 - curriculum the great thing about already
06:36 - having your code up on github is you can
06:38 - convert your front-end code
06:40 - into a github page and this is a free
06:43 - service for using github so you don't
06:45 - have to worry about any out-of-pocket
06:47 - cost for python and other related
06:49 - languages store your completed project
06:51 - code on github as I mentioned earlier
06:54 - make sure to include instructions on how
06:56 - to use your code and they expect it
06:58 - output from your program a great place
07:00 - to put this information would be in the
07:02 - readme file of your repository along
07:04 - with our github courses code Academy
07:06 - offers an additional course and article
07:08 - on how to deploy your code into a github
07:11 - page now the last reason why I recommend
07:13 - github is that almost every major tech
07:16 - company uses git this makes you more
07:18 - hireable you are putting your portfolio
07:20 - on a platform where many companies are
07:22 - already familiar with by doing this
07:24 - you've created an additional marketable
07:27 - skill why not take advantage of this
07:29 - platform and increase your skillset to
07:31 - add to your portfolio we've reached the
07:33 - end of our video let's do a quick recap
07:35 - of what was discussed first we talked
07:37 - about why you should have a portfolio a
07:39 - portfolio helps your marketability
07:41 - whether it is to be hired by employer or
07:44 - a client as a freelancer
07:46 - second we talked about what to put in
07:48 - your portfolio I gave them analogy of
07:50 - climbing the stairs to help you I gave a
07:52 - suggested starting point and discuss
07:54 - what to do when you got to the top what
07:56 - you do in the middle is up to you
07:58 - lastly we talked about hosting I went
08:00 - over different hosting options and in
08:02 - the end I recommended github I did so
08:05 - with the goal of market building in mind
08:06 - while hoping to direct you to another
08:08 - skill set that is commonly expected to
08:10 - have from prospective employers thanks
08:13 - for watching this is Farish from code

08:18 - conversation either subscribe to this
