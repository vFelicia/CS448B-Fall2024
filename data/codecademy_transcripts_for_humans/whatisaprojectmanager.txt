00:00 - hiyee this is Pat with Co Academy I'm a
00:02 - web developer based in Washington DC a
00:04 - project manager can seem like a pretty
00:06 - straightforward role but if you were
00:08 - like me you probably didn't know exactly
00:09 - what it was if you're not entirely sure
00:11 - what they do or just want a little bit
00:12 - more clarity you've come to the right
00:14 - place because in this video we'll
00:15 - discuss what a project manager is what
00:17 - is their day-to-day like what are their
00:19 - concerns what keeps them up at night how
00:21 - do they measure success and most
00:22 - importantly the difference between a
00:23 - product manager and a project manager I
00:26 - hope you're ready for us to clear this
00:27 - up once and for all let's get started
00:30 - oh right let's get to it in this video
00:32 - we're gonna cover three main sections
00:35 - the first is going to be a project
00:36 - manager's day-to-day and that's going to
00:38 - be how they translate the priorities
00:40 - into day-to-day tasks which of course
00:42 - means managing deadlines but it also
00:45 - means managing up because what happens
00:48 - on the lower level needs to be pushed up
00:50 - to the higher level for further context
00:52 - so in that will also talk about breaking
00:55 - down tasks and that's from the start to
00:57 - finish or from epic to story in agile
00:59 - development terms next its managing
01:02 - resources which means both time and
01:04 - development resources or design
01:06 - resources but it also means listening to
01:08 - the team lastly there's momentum and
01:11 - that means both blocking and unblocking
01:13 - but it also means elevating problems
01:15 - when things don't go as planned who's
01:17 - ready to get started with me so before
01:19 - we get too far ahead of ourselves a
01:22 - project manager is the person in charge
01:23 - of the team's day-to-day whereas a
01:26 - product manager is more high-level a
01:28 - project manager is down on the weeds
01:30 - with the workers that translate the
01:32 - goals into action items and make sure
01:33 - that everything actually gets
01:34 - accomplished if you're curious what a
01:36 - product manager is especially in Contra
01:39 - distinction - a project manager I'll
01:41 - link a video below that goes deeper into
01:43 - what a product manager has on their
01:45 - plates
01:46 - suffice it to say although product
01:48 - managers and project managers have
01:50 - confusing titles and a lot of
01:52 - overlapping focus there are subtle
01:54 - changes that make a big difference as to
01:56 - what their day-to-day look like but for
01:58 - us we're talking about project managers
02:00 - in this video so the first thing that is
02:03 - on their plate is going to be the
02:04 - priority translation in a lot of
02:06 - companies project managers work in agile
02:08 - development cycles where they typically
02:10 - have a week or two weeks or maybe even a
02:12 - month
02:13 - to plot out what can be realistically
02:15 - accomplished project managers take the
02:17 - vague high-level directives from product
02:20 - managers and translate them into
02:21 - step-by-step instructions for designers
02:24 - or engineers to work on it's important
02:26 - for a project manager to understand
02:28 - where a priority comes from to turn it
02:30 - into the proper steps sometimes the
02:32 - spirit of the task might involve more
02:34 - steps than usual or sometimes the
02:37 - priority might be more vague and need
02:38 - clarification for example we could say
02:42 - we need to make our customers happier a
02:44 - project manager needs to understand
02:46 - what's making customers unhappy so they
02:49 - can come up with a plan to make them
02:50 - happier and translate that plan into
02:52 - actionable steps next managing deadlines
02:56 - so a project manager is in charge of
02:58 - breaking down the tasks so they don't
03:00 - seem insurmountable
03:00 - for the teams working on the feature or
03:03 - application in a sense this means a
03:05 - typical day's distinguishing between the
03:07 - urgent and the important this is big
03:10 - because in the real world teams won't
03:13 - have infinite amounts of time to get it
03:15 - right or get things done but project
03:17 - managers have to do their best with what
03:19 - they have this might mean breaking down
03:21 - a task into iterations to achieve
03:24 - progress given limited resources
03:26 - deadlines are often subjective to what's
03:28 - happening relative to the rest of the
03:30 - company and whether that's an
03:32 - announcement coming up for marketing
03:33 - tradeshow where our company will demo
03:35 - their new capability or securing another
03:37 - round of funding if it's a start-up
03:39 - every company has a different set of
03:41 - priorities and those priorities means
03:43 - they have to be accomplished by a
03:44 - certain set of time so to accomplish
03:46 - this this is means prioritizing the
03:49 - sequence of tasks and making sure the
03:51 - most important parts are built first
03:53 - before jumping into the urgent urgent is
03:56 - tricky because it may mean it's a
03:58 - priority for some but not all where as
04:01 - important means everyone needs it done
04:03 - not just a select few so a project
04:05 - managers job is to separate what will
04:07 - really matter at the end of the day
04:09 - knowing it can't all be done at the same
04:11 - time sometimes this means managing up a
04:14 - project manager has to work with their
04:16 - managers above them to set the
04:17 - expectations may be a feature is taking
04:20 - longer to build after engineers discover
04:22 - problems in the
04:23 - build out phase or maybe a feature is
04:25 - unexpectedly complex and it needs to be
04:27 - addressed before a subsequent work is
04:29 - done a product managers focus needs to
04:31 - stay high level so they're counting on
04:33 - their project managers to tell them if
04:35 - they're on course or if something's come
04:36 - up it needs to be taken into account the
04:39 - goal here is to not be blindsided
04:40 - companies need to have the right people
04:42 - in place to flag when there are problems
04:44 - so that they can anticipate any
04:45 - challenges and budget for them and it's
04:47 - the project manager's job to push up the
04:49 - chain of command both good and
04:50 - complicating things to keep in mind when
04:53 - the courses are being said and promises
04:55 - are being made the next theme for
04:58 - project managers is going to be breaking
04:59 - down tasks breaking down tasks is the
05:02 - name of the game for a project manager
05:04 - in an agile development environment
05:06 - there are terms called epics and stories
05:09 - epics are much higher level tasks that
05:12 - can be sometimes a little bit more vague
05:13 - in what they need to accomplish and a
05:15 - story is a subset of that epic that is
05:17 - more specific as to what needs to happen
05:19 - let's revisit that example from before
05:22 - where we make our customers happier a
05:24 - project manager needs to understand
05:26 - what's making customers and Happy's they
05:28 - come up with a plan to make them happier
05:30 - and translate that plan as actual steps
05:32 - now this can involve determining where
05:34 - the users are getting frustrated
05:36 - deciding if a new feature needs to be
05:38 - built or how an existing feature can be
05:40 - tweaked and then delegating the build
05:42 - out to the right team members the
05:44 - project manager will make Story tickets
05:46 - that enumerate what needs to happen to
05:48 - address that priority next project
05:52 - managers have to manage their resources
05:53 - each team has a finite amount of
05:55 - designers and developers to accomplish
05:57 - any given task some developers and
05:59 - designers may be tied up in a previous
06:01 - task or maybe they specialize in an area
06:03 - that no one else can do so a project
06:06 - manager assigns tasks the team members
06:08 - based on their availability and
06:09 - capability given the realities of these
06:12 - teams and where they're at and you know
06:14 - this might mean reassigning team members
06:15 - to start on different stories or it
06:17 - could mean keeping them on the same
06:20 - thing so they have the required amount
06:22 - of time to complete it which is
06:23 - important for the next step because a
06:25 - project manager also needs to listen to
06:27 - their team a project manager can't
06:29 - manage expectations for the team if they
06:32 - don't know what's going on so they need
06:34 - to stay in close contact with her
06:36 - years and designers to know what's
06:38 - blocking them what resources they need
06:40 - and maybe who they're waiting on before
06:42 - they can proceed in our anti development
06:44 - model a project manager and the team
06:46 - accomplished this through daily
06:48 - stand-ups sometimes called scrums where
06:50 - team members list out their progress in
06:52 - any blocks they needed removed sometimes
06:54 - though for project managers this might
06:56 - also mean talking to individuals
06:58 - directly taking them to coffee or
06:59 - hearing them out in a different capacity
07:01 - project managers are there to move
07:03 - things along so they have to be the feet
07:05 - on the street knowing what's going on
07:06 - with the team they are the very best
07:08 - source of information about how much
07:09 - progress can actually be accomplished
07:12 - lastly a project manager focuses on
07:14 - momentum momentum means blocking or
07:16 - unblocking wherein a project manager
07:18 - will free up or security sources or by
07:20 - flagging other team members that they
07:22 - cannot progress until a previous stage
07:24 - is complete let's talk about unblocking
07:27 - maybe a developer or designer is waiting
07:29 - on approval for their work from someone
07:31 - else and they've just been too busy to
07:32 - get to it
07:33 - unblocking could also mean securing
07:35 - software licenses trainings or teachings
07:37 - it could also mean requesting a more
07:39 - senior team member to sit with someone
07:40 - to work through a problem that they're
07:42 - struggling with unblocking is less a
07:43 - function of capability just that a task
07:46 - could be accomplished faster if there
07:48 - are more experienced people looking at
07:50 - the problem together this is because
07:52 - there are still those deadlines and a
07:54 - project manager could have full faith
07:55 - that a team member is capable of solving
07:58 - that problem but they might just need to
08:00 - get it faster with a little bit of help
08:01 - the spirit of unblocking is to remove
08:04 - anything that's stopping a team member
08:05 - from accomplishing their job in a given
08:07 - amount of time conversely a project
08:10 - manager may have to halt a product or
08:13 - process to make sure that a subsequent
08:15 - or parallel task can be completed in
08:17 - this context maybe the order the
08:19 - operations was not forecast in the right
08:21 - order maybe a challenge has come up for
08:24 - a designer developer that needs to have
08:25 - someone else on a different team address
08:27 - it before they could finish their part
08:28 - of the task maybe a story is complete
08:31 - but it hasn't been tested yet so we
08:33 - can't release it with confidence knowing
08:34 - that it will work as intended a project
08:38 - manager's day-to-day is balanced and
08:40 - making sure that the sequence of getting
08:41 - stuff done happens in the right order if
08:44 - there are problems or major delays a
08:46 - project manager needs to keep the
08:48 - relevant stakeholders in
08:49 - included in the discussion this could be
08:51 - where a project manager or parallel
08:53 - departments like marketing finance or
08:55 - customer support are kept in the loop
08:57 - and informed higher-level departments
09:00 - like product managers chief marketing
09:02 - officers chief technologists are all
09:05 - counting on project managers to keep
09:06 - them informed of how the progress is
09:08 - going everybody wants to advance the
09:11 - progress that they are ultimately
09:12 - responsible for so it's important for
09:14 - them to be kept in the loop if there's
09:15 - something they can do to help out
09:17 - this can mean stepping in to outside
09:19 - vendors for services it could mean
09:21 - approving purchases like hardware or
09:22 - software but it could also mean that a
09:24 - higher-level discussion needs to be made
09:26 - in order for the project manager to set
09:28 - the right priorities given what needs to
09:30 - happen first project managers are the
09:33 - glue the help keep the company together
09:34 - and moving as one with the understanding
09:37 - that the team's challenges as well as
09:39 - the higher-level priorities are all tied
09:41 - together this is Pat with codecademy I
09:44 - hope I cleared up what a project manager
09:46 - is but did I answer all your questions

Cleaned transcript:

hiyee this is Pat with Co Academy I'm a web developer based in Washington DC a project manager can seem like a pretty straightforward role but if you were like me you probably didn't know exactly what it was if you're not entirely sure what they do or just want a little bit more clarity you've come to the right place because in this video we'll discuss what a project manager is what is their daytoday like what are their concerns what keeps them up at night how do they measure success and most importantly the difference between a product manager and a project manager I hope you're ready for us to clear this up once and for all let's get started oh right let's get to it in this video we're gonna cover three main sections the first is going to be a project manager's daytoday and that's going to be how they translate the priorities into daytoday tasks which of course means managing deadlines but it also means managing up because what happens on the lower level needs to be pushed up to the higher level for further context so in that will also talk about breaking down tasks and that's from the start to finish or from epic to story in agile development terms next its managing resources which means both time and development resources or design resources but it also means listening to the team lastly there's momentum and that means both blocking and unblocking but it also means elevating problems when things don't go as planned who's ready to get started with me so before we get too far ahead of ourselves a project manager is the person in charge of the team's daytoday whereas a product manager is more highlevel a project manager is down on the weeds with the workers that translate the goals into action items and make sure that everything actually gets accomplished if you're curious what a product manager is especially in Contra distinction a project manager I'll link a video below that goes deeper into what a product manager has on their plates suffice it to say although product managers and project managers have confusing titles and a lot of overlapping focus there are subtle changes that make a big difference as to what their daytoday look like but for us we're talking about project managers in this video so the first thing that is on their plate is going to be the priority translation in a lot of companies project managers work in agile development
