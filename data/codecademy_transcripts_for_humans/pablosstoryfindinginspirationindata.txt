00:01 - My name is Pablo, I live in Tampa, Florida,
00:03 - and I built a career as a QA Engineer
00:06 - by learning code from Codecademy.
00:10 - Before QA, I was doing customer support — 
00:13 - helping people with computer issues
00:15 - and software issues.
00:17 - I'm originally from Colombia
00:18 - and I ended up moving to the States
00:20 - right after I graduated. 
00:22 - I have a degree in Electrical Engineering,
00:24 - but I wasn't getting any chances as an Engineer.
00:27 - I was kind of stuck, basically.
00:29 - I wanted to get out of customer service.
00:31 - And someone offered me a chance with
00:33 - something called QA. 
00:34 - I didn't know what it was,
00:35 - but I wanted to move up so I just took it.
00:38 - But I knew I needed to expand
00:39 - my knowledge in automation —
00:41 - basically writing code to test code.
00:44 - So I found a course on Ruby on Codecademy.
00:46 - I was able to write a few Ruby scripts.
00:49 - I found that I was really good at finding issues.
00:52 - I see it as always trying to improve.
00:55 - My thought process is always, 
00:57 - "Why was this process designed this way?
00:59 - Is it really efficient?
01:01 - And what if I do this? What if I do that?
01:03 - How is it going to behave?"
01:06 - The way I got into racing —
01:08 - as a kid, I've always been into cars.
01:11 - And I had a little toy car. 
01:12 - I was always very curious.
01:13 - What was making it move?
01:15 - Why couldn't it go faster?
01:17 - So I took everything apart —
01:18 - sometimes I could put it back together,
01:20 - sometimes I could make it better.
01:22 - After I took the Python course on Codecademy,
01:25 - it helped me identify the data
01:28 - that I get from the race track.
01:30 - I coach other people in how to
01:32 - take their data, analyze it, so they can go faster.
01:35 - Whether you're applying too much
01:37 - brake pressure, how much throttle
01:39 - you're putting in, 
01:41 - is the APS kicking in,
01:42 - that kind of stuff.
01:43 - So, I used that to go into
01:45 - the car's computer, change some parameters,
01:48 - to make it go faster
01:49 - or make it so my application —
01:51 - this is how it works from the factory,
01:53 - I want to make it better.
01:56 - Going out there, driving,
01:58 - as fast as I can,
02:00 - everything just kind of disappears.
02:02 - I just feel at peace.
02:05 - In order to grow as a Developer,
02:07 - you need to practice.
02:08 - There's no way around it.
02:10 - Relate the code to something that's personal.
02:13 - Never give up.

My name is Pablo, I live in Tampa, Florida, and I built a career as a QA Engineer by learning code from Codecademy.
