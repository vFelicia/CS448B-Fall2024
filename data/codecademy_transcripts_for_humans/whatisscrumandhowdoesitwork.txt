00:00 - hi my name is Stephanie I'm a software
00:02 - developer based in Baltimore and in this
00:04 - video we're gonna go over what exactly
00:06 - is scrum how it's used on teams and what
00:09 - makes it effective scrum is a framework
00:12 - that teams use to operate and organize
00:14 - the work that they'll be doing it's the
00:16 - framework that teams follow to make sure
00:18 - that their work is best suited for
00:20 - achieving their goals before we go any
00:22 - further I want to quickly go over some
00:24 - roles you'll commonly see on a basic
00:26 - development team first up is the product
00:29 - owner who determines the products
00:31 - direction this person identifies what
00:33 - features should be prioritized and how
00:35 - the product should grow based on the
00:37 - business needs the product should
00:39 - address next is the developer developers
00:42 - make the magic happen and write the code
00:44 - to build out the features they'll work
00:46 - with a product owner to determine if the
00:48 - business requirements are realistic and
00:50 - how long they would take and lastly
00:53 - there's the scrum master this person
00:55 - makes sure that the team members are
00:56 - adhering the best scrum practices so
00:58 - that the team is working effectively
01:00 - together and benefiting from scrum
01:02 - principles already so we've covered
01:04 - roles in scrum now there's a notion of
01:07 - an artifact hang type these are the last
01:09 - few definitions we're going to go over
01:11 - and then we'll see how they all tie in
01:12 - together you can think of an artifact as
01:15 - anything that can represent the team's
01:17 - work and its progress towards their
01:19 - goals the main goal of artifacts is to
01:21 - give transparency so that team members
01:23 - are all on the same page on what needs
01:25 - to be done a product backlog is just a
01:28 - list of features user stories and bugs
01:31 - that are slated to be incorporated into
01:33 - future iterations of the product it's
01:36 - largely driven by the products business
01:37 - requirements so you'll generally see the
01:40 - product owner maintaining this backlog
01:42 - I'll drop a link in the description
01:43 - below for more information on user
01:45 - stories now the Sprint backlog is a list
01:48 - of tasks that the development team has
01:50 - agreed to tackle these tasks are taken
01:52 - from the product backlog and will take
01:54 - the product closer to the team sprinkle
01:56 - for more information on sprints feel
01:59 - free to click on the link of the
02:00 - description so the product increment is
02:03 - the next iteration or version that has
02:05 - all the features that were promised by
02:07 - the ended Sprint the next version of the
02:10 - product must be at a point where it's
02:12 - ready to be delivered to use
02:13 - this part can be a bit vague since what
02:16 - you perceive as complete may be
02:17 - different from what I perceive as
02:19 - complete that's why every team member
02:22 - needs to have the same understanding of
02:23 - what state the product needs to be in in
02:26 - order for it to be considered done for
02:28 - that sprint for example if my team's
02:30 - goal was to make lemonade for a lemonade
02:32 - stand does that mean that our sprinkle
02:35 - will be complete when we've made enough
02:36 - to serve 50 people or 1000 so now that
02:40 - we've gotten all our definitions out of
02:41 - the way I'm gonna go over how they all
02:43 - interact with each other and that's
02:45 - through ceremonies ceremonies are just
02:48 - meetings that are held on a regular
02:49 - basis throughout the Sprint the overall
02:52 - purpose of these meetings is to make
02:53 - sure that the team is on track for
02:55 - meeting their goals during backlog
02:58 - refinement the product owner will tidy
03:00 - up the team's backlog which is kind of
03:01 - like a laundry list of things the team
03:03 - needs to complete in order to meet the
03:05 - team's objectives
03:07 - as a product owner goes through each of
03:09 - the tasks they'll trim out the ones that
03:11 - are no longer relevant update the ones
03:13 - that address a change to business need
03:15 - and prioritize them sprint planning is
03:18 - where the team will review their goals
03:20 - and determine which ones to tackle for
03:22 - the upcoming sprint then they'll pull
03:25 - the items from the backlog that speak to
03:27 - the goal and commit to the ones that can
03:29 - be achieved during the Sprint this part
03:31 - can be a bit tricky since it's a little
03:34 - difficult to gauge how long it takes for
03:35 - a task to be done if we end up under
03:38 - promising and overachieving then we can
03:40 - always bring in more tasks from the
03:41 - backlog if we end up over promising and
03:44 - under then the leftover tasks will get
03:47 - cleaned up during backlog refinement the
03:50 - Sprint is when the developers get to
03:52 - work on the tasks in the sprint backlog
03:54 - don't forget there's a link in the
03:56 - description for more info on sprints
03:58 - during daily stand-up team members will
04:01 - take turns to stand up and talk about
04:03 - the things that they had completed in
04:05 - the previous day plan on completing over
04:07 - the course of the current day and if
04:09 - there's anything that is preventing them
04:11 - from being able to complete the work
04:13 - that they are slated to do I actually
04:15 - used to dread the ceremony because I
04:17 - initially thought it was a way for the
04:18 - team leader to micromanage me and make
04:21 - sure that I wasn't slacking off and so I
04:23 - felt a lot of pressure to take on more
04:24 - than I could handle but quite frankly I
04:27 - missed the whole point this ceremony is
04:29 - more about being transparent in order to
04:32 - help each other move roadblocks so that
04:34 - the team can reach their goals by this
04:36 - point this friend is pretty much over
04:38 - and Congrats your team has a new version
04:40 - of the product so it's time for the team
04:43 - and anyone whose work is impacted by the
04:45 - product to gather together and demo the
04:47 - new features during this time the team
04:50 - reflects over the last sprint and
04:51 - identify highs and lows things that went
04:54 - well and things that could be improved
04:56 - honesty is incredibly valuable here
04:59 - because we all have room for improvement
05:01 - and it's important to recognize what the
05:03 - team can do better in order to be more
05:05 - effective during the next sprint the
05:07 - point of the retro is to explore what
05:09 - happened during the sprint with the
05:11 - impact it had on the team and what can
05:13 - be done better next time
05:14 - actually the scrum master can help
05:17 - facilitate this meeting by helping the
05:19 - team compile
05:20 - two things that the team agrees to
05:21 - improve and what the team will do in
05:23 - order to make these improvements of
05:25 - reality these improvements can be
05:28 - anywhere from adding the task number to
05:30 - the pull request so that the reviewer
05:32 - can easily look up what the pull request
05:34 - is solving to introducing pizza
05:36 - Wednesdays to boost team morale every
05:39 - team has a unique dynamic and the nature
05:41 - of the project may also vary so things
05:43 - that work well and one team might not
05:45 - work for another but that's what's great
05:47 - about scrum it's flexible so that teams
05:49 - can take the parts that will best work
05:51 - for them and improve their productivity
05:53 - I had a scrum master that was coaching
05:56 - my team and another could currently and
05:58 - he had two different styles for our
05:59 - team's the other team was able to
06:02 - incorporate all parts of scrum right out
06:04 - of the box and thrived under a more
06:05 - rigid structure however my team found
06:08 - that we needed a looser structure
06:10 - particularly around how we were
06:12 - committing to our tasks so we ended up
06:14 - adopting a hybrid of scrum and Kanban
06:16 - for more details on Kanban I'll explain
06:19 - further in a separate video linked in
06:20 - the description below you'll often see
06:23 - scrum and agile used in the same context
06:25 - but they're not the same thing
06:27 - scrum is a structure that a team will
06:29 - follow whereas agile is more like a
06:32 - perspective that your team adopts to
06:34 - develop quickly and incrementally it's
06:36 - kind of like defensive driving the
06:38 - practices you follow to drive
06:40 - defensively is like scrum and safely
06:42 - driving on the road is like agile if
06:44 - you'd like a deeper dive into agile
06:46 - we've got a handy video linked in the
06:48 - description below and that pretty much
06:50 - sums up scrum thanks so much for
06:52 - watching please join the conversation by
06:54 - dropping a comment below and subscribing
06:56 - to this channel and if you're ready to
06:58 - take your skills to the next level you
07:00 - can start learning on coke atom II today
