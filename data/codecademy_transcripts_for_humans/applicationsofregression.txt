00:05 - So now that we understand exactly how linear regression works,
00:08 - we will take a look at why it so useful in so many different fields.
00:13 - Well, for one, it is rather simple.
00:16 - The math involved in finding the best fit regression line
00:18 - is not that complicated and it has been thoroughly studied over the years.
00:22 - In spite of being so simple, linear regression is in fact rather powerful.
00:27 - By modeling relationships between variables as straight lines or
00:30 - planes, regression produces a general solution
00:34 - which is not as prone to overfitting as many other techniques.
00:37 - Another feature of regression is that it is very versatile and
00:40 - can be used for
00:41 - various kinds of data, from predicting stock prices to estimating sea levels.
00:47 - The fact that regression is simple and well-studied means that there
00:50 - are multiple implementation techniques available in various languages.
00:54 - And in fact,
00:55 - regression happens to be the simplest of the machine learning algorithms.
01:00 - We will now zoom in on the applications of linear regression.
01:04 - One of the common use cases for
01:05 - regression is to explain the variance in the underlying data.
01:09 - For example, the price of a stock may be determined by multiple factors.
01:14 - This includes the health of the economy overall, and
01:17 - maybe even the price of oil or steel or many other commodities.
01:21 - But out of all these factors, there will be some which will
01:24 - explain the variance in the price of a stock much better than the others.
01:29 - So for example, if the particular stock you are tracking happens to be less
01:32 - sensitive to the health of the overall economy, and more sensitive to
01:36 - the price of oil, regression will help you determine this relationship.
01:40 - And of course,
01:41 - we have seen that regression can be used in order to make predictions
01:45 - when the value you need to predict happens to be a continuous variable.
01:49 - So, if you're using your regression model in order to estimate the price of
01:52 - a stock, you could for
01:53 - example change the value of one of the input variables.
01:57 - So if you'd like to determine the value of a stock
02:00 - if there is a 20% drop in the price of oil.
02:03 - You could make use of regression in order to make that estimation.
02:07 - When you are using regression in order to predict an outcome y
02:11 - given an input x, there are a few caveats.
02:14 - For instance, there needs to be a causal relationship between x and y and
02:18 - their values should not merely be correlated.
02:21 - For example, a cause can be the change in the quantity of rainfall
02:25 - in a particular region, and the effect will be a change in the yield of crop.
02:30 - It has been empirically proven that rainfall does effect the yield of crops,
02:35 - and it is not just that these two factors are correlated.
02:38 - Also, this is the case, where x causes y and not the other way around.
02:42 - That is, it is not a change in the crop yield which effects
02:45 - the quantity of rainfall.
02:48 - So if the relationship between rainfall and
02:50 - the crop yield can be represented by this straight line.
02:53 - Consider that the crop yield, which is measured in metric tons per hectare,
02:57 - can be calculated by a straight line equation, alpha + beta times x,
03:02 - where x represents a quantity of rainfall in inches.
03:06 - When presented with such a model,
03:08 - there are a few terms you need to be familiar with.
03:10 - For one, the term alpha in the equation is the y-intercept
03:14 - of the straight line.
03:15 - This represents the quantity of crop which will be produced even if there is
03:19 - no rainfall at all, and this is a very useful term in regression.
03:23 - And for that, consider that there are a number of farmers in the same
03:26 - geographical region who grow the same crop.
03:29 - If a regression line such as this one is generated for
03:31 - each of the farmers over a number of years, then the distinguishing factor
03:35 - between each of the farmers will often be the alpha number.
03:39 - This is because all of these farmers will get the same quantity of rain, but
03:43 - each of their individual techniques when growing the crop
03:46 - will be captured by the alpha value.
03:48 - And you could say that the farmer with the higher alpha
03:51 - happens to be a better farmer.
03:53 - And then there is the beta in the equation,
03:56 - which represents the slope of the line.
03:58 - This determines the sensitivity of the output,
04:01 - which is the crop yield, to the input, which is the quantity of rainfall.
04:05 - So when the input, which is the quantity of rainfall, increases by 1 unit,
04:09 - the output, which is the crop yield, increases by beta units.
04:13 - And of course, once we have this equation for
04:16 - the regression line, which is y is equal to alpha plus beta times x,
04:20 - we can use this in order to make predictions.
04:23 - So if the weather forecast predicts that for this region,
04:26 - there will be 13 inches of rain in the season, then a farmer can estimate
04:29 - that their crop yield will be 35 metric tons, and then plan accordingly.
