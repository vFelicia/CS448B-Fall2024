00:02 - i think we are live
00:03 - yeah i think we're probably good to go
00:06 - okay
00:07 - cool hello guys welcome back to
00:10 - our live series on creative decoding
00:12 - this is session three
00:13 - and today we have a new face
00:16 - who i will let her i will let them
00:19 - introduce themselves but
00:20 - before we do that my name is jiwan i am
00:22 - a curriculum developer
00:24 - at co academy and we also have
00:27 - hello i'm alex i'm also a person
00:28 - developer at codecademy
00:30 - super excited to have cassie here today
00:32 - um very fun to get some guests talking
00:34 - about creative coding
00:36 - um yeah so cassie do you want to
00:38 - introduce yourself
00:39 - yes um hi everyone i'm
00:43 - cassie tarakagian um i use they them
00:46 - pronouns
00:47 - and um i am just
00:50 - here to talk about a little bit about my
00:53 - work and then
00:54 - um a project i've been working on
00:57 - for uh five years now which is the
01:01 - p5 editor which is like a platform that
01:05 - will let you
01:05 - write p5 sketches in but i'll just kind
01:08 - of like introduce myself first so let me
01:10 - do the screen share thing
01:15 - and um play this
01:19 - did it work oh no it's thinking looks
01:21 - good to me
01:22 - oh there we go um so hi it's me
01:26 - um and so i am a like technologist
01:30 - and educator and artist musician so i
01:33 - kind of do like
01:34 - like a bunch of different things um
01:37 - i like i'm a technologist like i write
01:39 - code um
01:40 - i make this you know uh web editor for
01:44 - p5 i also have like a bunch of
01:47 - experience just like working on like
01:49 - different types of
01:50 - creative coding software in general i
01:52 - would say my work is really focused
01:54 - on like software for creation
01:57 - like i've worked on um i worked at um
02:00 - cycling 74 which is a company
02:02 - that makes software called maximus c
02:04 - which is like a different creative
02:06 - coding
02:06 - tool um and
02:10 - um yeah i also have just like worked as
02:12 - a worked as a web developer
02:14 - but i also do a lot of teaching so
02:15 - here's a picture of me teaching
02:17 - in the you know the before times um i
02:20 - was teaching a like max msp
02:22 - workshop here and um
02:26 - i also am an adjunct professor
02:30 - at nyu itp um teaching there
02:34 - this semester a class on like culture
02:37 - like internet culture
02:38 - and memes and that that kind of stuff
02:41 - online
02:42 - yeah class on like cursed content if
02:45 - you're familiar with cursed content
02:48 - um so that's really fun um and
02:51 - yeah i also have like some creative
02:53 - projects that i do
02:54 - that are kind of like in the space of
02:56 - like art and technology so
02:58 - i have this project a few years ago a
03:00 - few years ago
03:01 - called wiki sonnet which like generates
03:04 - which like scanned all of wikipedia and
03:06 - found like
03:07 - all of the sentences that people have
03:09 - written that were in iambic pentameter
03:11 - which is like a stress
03:12 - unstressed things you know like the form
03:16 - of the unstructured and then it like
03:19 - assembled them all into elizabethan
03:20 - sonnets so
03:22 - like sometimes they were kind of like
03:24 - nonsensical
03:25 - but you know just kind of i it's one of
03:28 - those
03:29 - things that like it's so difficult if
03:32 - you're like i want to sit down and write
03:34 - a sentence and i have a pentameter it's
03:36 - quite difficult to do but if you were
03:39 - like constantly doing it
03:40 - accidentally all the time and i think
03:42 - it's fun to um
03:44 - take like transform sentences that were
03:46 - like used for
03:48 - just to you know be information right
03:51 - like like wikipedia is a place to
03:53 - share information and then like re
03:54 - re-contextualize it it's like poetry
03:57 - um you know i really like proposal for a
03:59 - hypertext project is like i am i have a
04:02 - century
04:03 - um yeah unfortunately the project is
04:06 - like very it was like costly to like run
04:08 - and like generate these sonnets so it's
04:10 - like no longer
04:10 - a real website but you know that's just
04:14 - like a past project and
04:15 - this like was a web application that had
04:17 - like a whole server back in
04:18 - i was like you could generate some real
04:20 - time which was
04:22 - which is fun and maybe we should like
04:23 - try to just get the ones that we
04:24 - generated i was staying up but
04:27 - you know future um i also
04:30 - um have an app that i made that tells
04:32 - you whether or not you're holding your
04:33 - phone
04:37 - just more just like a dumb dumb kind of
04:39 - project this is this is part of um
04:42 - made the set like the stupid hackathon
04:44 - at nyu
04:45 - itv oh yeah yeah
04:49 - um i also had like a musical project i
04:51 - was part of called blob
04:52 - eyes for ai which is about like making
04:55 - music for like the
04:56 - the like machine learning artificial
04:58 - intelligent like children were bringing
05:00 - to the world like showing them how to
05:01 - like exist in the world and be like
05:03 - loving loving creatures um
05:06 - and i also just like want to give a
05:08 - shout out to like neopets because it's
05:10 - just
05:11 - like i think it's just like vitally
05:14 - important to like how i like experience
05:17 - computers i think it was like the first
05:19 - website that i like
05:20 - spent a lot of time on and like put a
05:22 - lot of energy into
05:24 - and it was also the first place that i
05:26 - ever learned how to write
05:28 - code like on this website you could um
05:31 - like you would have like a bunch of pets
05:32 - that you could like
05:33 - give them different like colors you can
05:35 - like build a home from them and have a
05:37 - shop there's like a stock market you can
05:39 - do so much on that
05:40 - website and um but you could make like a
05:44 - like a website for your pet and so they
05:47 - would just give you like this
05:48 - giant like text like no syntax
05:50 - highlighting just like
05:52 - literally like a text area or whatever
05:54 - and you would just like edit the html
05:56 - you like put any css like in line
06:00 - and that's how you would have your your
06:01 - web page and i like wish i had an
06:03 - example of one of the ones i made but
06:06 - when i like logged back into my account
06:08 - many years later
06:09 - it had like been hacked and like all my
06:11 - accounts were gone
06:15 - that's funny we hear i i feel like i've
06:16 - heard that story a couple of times
06:18 - that's really being like the
06:19 - introduction to coding i mean yeah
06:21 - i'm curious how so this is a this is a
06:24 - series for
06:25 - basically beginners to create coding
06:27 - where we're just introducing them to p5
06:29 - i'm curious like how
06:32 - how do you even get started with
06:34 - creative coding where you're talking
06:35 - about like oh i made this like
06:36 - silly app that's selling if i like i'm
06:38 - holding my phone or not or i'm
06:40 - you know i i have this cyanide
06:42 - contaminator
06:44 - generating thing how do you even like
06:46 - get into the community how do you
06:48 - like what would do you remember what
06:49 - your first like creative coding project
06:51 - was or how you even began
06:54 - i i don't remember
06:58 - um i'd have to like really oh you know
07:01 - actually i think that i i got into it um
07:04 - because i think i like you know i kind
07:06 - of would like make websites on neopets i
07:09 - also
07:10 - you know i think it's sort of like the
07:11 - same era was really into like making
07:13 - myself have like an
07:14 - awesome email uh an awesome emo myspace
07:17 - page
07:17 - you know that was like that was like my
07:19 - vibe and then
07:22 - sort of like i like studied um
07:25 - like engineering in undergrad and sort
07:29 - of that that felt really like
07:30 - divorced from that world where it was
07:32 - more like oh we're like learning
07:34 - we're just kind of like learning how to
07:35 - code but it wasn't as much focused on
07:37 - like
07:38 - output and like this is what we're like
07:40 - going to do with code
07:42 - and then i um i like
07:46 - ended up taking a course
07:49 - that was about making like computer
07:51 - music
07:52 - um because like i have like a background
07:54 - in music as well and i was just kind of
07:55 - like
07:56 - i don't know maybe i'll maybe i'll like
07:58 - see what this is and we used this
08:00 - um this like coding creative coding
08:03 - language called pure data which is kind
08:05 - of like the the predecessor
08:07 - to max msp and so that was that was like
08:10 - my first experience of creative coding
08:12 - was like using this tool and like what i
08:13 - would do with it
08:15 - is um kind of like jump between
08:17 - different like
08:18 - audio samples and like be processing
08:21 - audio
08:21 - and like cutting that up i also did a
08:24 - project where i like used
08:26 - like a like a wii like a wiimote as like
08:29 - a
08:29 - input on the so that was kind of like my
08:32 - start and then
08:33 - and then from there started like
08:35 - learning about um
08:37 - like processing um and then just like
08:40 - started making
08:41 - making sketches and that and just found
08:43 - it really like satisfying as opposed to
08:45 - like
08:46 - the type of software development work i
08:48 - was doing yeah i think it's interesting
08:50 - so i used i used to be a high school
08:52 - computer science teacher and i use p5
08:54 - all the time uh for like introducing
08:56 - people to programming and i i do think
08:58 - that
08:59 - no matter what the software is for you
09:01 - it was this
09:02 - this music program i think p5 is
09:04 - obviously like a really incredible
09:06 - um tool to get people into into coding
09:08 - but yeah
09:09 - it's for me it's just like getting that
09:12 - foot in the door and then as soon as you
09:14 - can make your first project you can take
09:15 - it in any sort of direction that you
09:16 - want to where it's like okay i'm into
09:18 - music let me like
09:18 - dive deep into how audio works encoding
09:21 - or p5 is
09:22 - obviously very visual but yeah being
09:24 - able to do something that is so
09:27 - like output focused rather than just
09:29 - learning to code to learn how to code
09:31 - i think is is great and it's one of the
09:33 - reasons why i love um
09:34 - that g1 that you made this this creative
09:36 - coding class
09:38 - but i also think there's a huge value in
09:41 - people seeing that coding isn't just
09:43 - something like scary that
09:45 - you know runs your computer which it
09:46 - does but like
09:48 - it does but like you know for an example
09:52 - of like neopets
09:54 - it kind of like really um makes coding
09:56 - to something like just a tool
09:58 - to make a little website for your pet
10:01 - for example so it gives you that purpose
10:02 - and it gives you that
10:04 - visual feedback of what you're doing
10:06 - with code and then it
10:08 - like i think when you put programming in
10:10 - that context it becomes a lot easier to
10:12 - digest and a lot like more interesting i
10:14 - think immediately
10:16 - for some people i'm not going to
10:18 - generalize it and say that everyone
10:19 - would feel that way
10:20 - but i think it's just a different
10:22 - perspective of like you might want to
10:24 - make something practical super practical
10:25 - and want to
10:26 - dig deeper into like web programming and
10:28 - want to like
10:29 - learn about back-end programming and all
10:31 - that kind of stuff but like
10:33 - if with creative coding it really is um
10:36 - not necessarily thinking about the end
10:38 - output but really like
10:40 - getting into that feeling of using
10:42 - coding to
10:43 - be more of a creative outlet totally
10:48 - cool should we move on from your pets
10:52 - you could talk about it all day yeah i
10:54 - kind of have like some slides about
10:57 - like the history of like processing and
10:59 - stuff
11:00 - um yeah so maybe we can um
11:04 - um give a little bit of a context cassie
11:06 - about like how we've been introducing
11:08 - creative coding and
11:09 - p5 basically in our first live series we
11:13 - talked we introduced
11:14 - p5 js is a javascript library
11:17 - right it's an open source javascript
11:18 - library that makes drawing with code
11:21 - really easy
11:22 - and actually one of the questions that
11:23 - we did get when we were talking about p5
11:25 - for the first time was
11:26 - someone in the chat asked how is this
11:28 - relevant to processing what is the
11:30 - difference between processing and p5
11:32 - and i did my attempt my best attempt at
11:34 - trying to answer that but i think you
11:36 - might have a lot more context about
11:38 - the history yeah i actually have like
11:40 - some really i like spent some time
11:42 - like looking at the history it's pretty
11:45 - fun um
11:46 - i like i think like i
11:48 - [Music]
11:49 - i just like in general and really
11:51 - interested about like
11:53 - you know how like just sort of seeing
11:55 - the evolution of technology and how that
11:58 - like
11:59 - impacts the sort of like things that
12:01 - people can make
12:02 - with with like computing or technology
12:04 - or whatever
12:05 - i'm sort of like how it's also entwined
12:07 - in like
12:08 - political things and stuff and stuff
12:11 - like that
12:11 - um but yeah so
12:14 - here i can like go go back to to
12:18 - slideland
12:19 - um so
12:22 - yeah like i think i think one one
12:25 - cool thing about what about processing
12:28 - is that i actually
12:29 - it comes from this like lab at the mit
12:33 - media lab called the aesthetics and
12:35 - computing
12:37 - lab and it was at the time and this was
12:38 - like in the late 90s
12:40 - early 2000s it was headed by this person
12:42 - named john mayda
12:43 - and um i don't
12:46 - know if he was specifically the person
12:49 - who like coined the term creative coding
12:51 - but definitely like
12:52 - was a person who uh he's still alive
12:55 - is a person
12:59 - he's very very much living um
13:02 - is a person who um i
13:05 - it was it was just like a figure in that
13:07 - way and just like advocating for
13:10 - creative coding and like using
13:11 - technology and like specifically using
13:14 - like
13:14 - code syntax as a medium for art not just
13:18 - like computers but like
13:19 - code syntax which i think is is really
13:22 - important
13:23 - when talking about processing in p5
13:25 - because like one of the big
13:27 - parts of it is that you're writing code
13:28 - syntax it's not just like you're
13:30 - connecting
13:31 - there's no like graphical interface
13:33 - right it's like it's like teaching you
13:34 - to interact with
13:35 - computers in that way or that's just is
13:37 - the medium
13:39 - so anyway um i came it came out of this
13:41 - laboratory
13:42 - um from two people who were um
13:45 - doing phds there casey reese and ben
13:47 - frye who now
13:48 - are my colleagues at processing
13:50 - foundation um
13:52 - and they the the first release
13:55 - of processing was actually august 9
13:58 - 2001 the um the executive director
14:02 - of pressing foundation dorothy told me
14:04 - this recently and she was like
14:06 - processing is a leo
14:09 - which i loved um
14:12 - yeah and it um it like kind of consists
14:15 - of like
14:16 - three different things um which are
14:19 - like this language which you can see
14:21 - like on the
14:23 - right here it has the specific type of
14:25 - syntax where you see like this void
14:27 - setup and like void draw and like it has
14:30 - this whole scaffolding
14:31 - of um like what like this specific code
14:34 - syntax of what
14:36 - it looks like to like draw images that
14:38 - look that you can see on the left
14:40 - you can see that this was actually like
14:41 - the beta version that's something like
14:43 - early version of processing which is
14:45 - pretty fun
14:46 - um so right you have like the like
14:49 - syntax of the language you have like the
14:51 - environment that it's in and that's like
14:53 - what this code is sitting in and like
14:55 - what it
14:56 - what um the code renders to right it's
14:58 - all part of this application
15:00 - that you download and then it like makes
15:02 - it simple to write this code and
15:04 - you know all of this was driven at the
15:06 - time by like
15:08 - you used to have have to have like
15:10 - really specialized knowledge
15:12 - in order to like use computers to make
15:14 - this kind of art
15:16 - and like at the time that ben and casey
15:19 - were working on processing it was like
15:21 - cheaper it was like the type of graphics
15:23 - hardware and the type of computers that
15:24 - you needed were getting
15:26 - much more accessible so it was sort of
15:28 - like at this at this perfect time to be
15:29 - like what if we
15:30 - tried to make a language that made these
15:33 - tools and like an environment that made
15:34 - these tools really accessible
15:36 - and like the last part of the last like
15:38 - really like big piece of this
15:40 - besides the environment and the language
15:41 - is like the community and they started
15:43 - off
15:43 - um just like the processing forum
15:46 - you can actually see that it's called
15:48 - like discourse which i think is like a
15:50 - um which is funny since now there's like
15:52 - this um
15:54 - i actually don't know if discourse is
15:56 - open source
15:57 - um might not be but there's like a the
16:00 - forum tool is now called discourse right
16:02 - full circle yeah it's like a really full
16:04 - circle
16:06 - but um i'm curious about um if you go
16:10 - back to that like
16:10 - the previous slide um what is the
16:13 - relationship between
16:15 - processing and java because when i used
16:17 - to i also used to
16:18 - teach with with processing and i used to
16:20 - say like okay p5
16:22 - is kind of this um javascript library
16:25 - um that you can add onto your to your
16:27 - normal javascript i always used to
16:28 - describe processing it's like
16:29 - processing is just java but with you
16:32 - know the setup
16:33 - function and the draw function and these
16:34 - like special little add-ons so
16:37 - is is processing its own unique language
16:39 - is it a
16:40 - like you know variant of java if for
16:43 - our viewers if you're watching this
16:44 - you'll see that you know the the things
16:46 - that stick out to this as being java
16:48 - like are the like
16:49 - square brackets to indicate an array um
16:52 - so yeah i guess i guess what's the
16:53 - relationship to java for processing
16:56 - yeah it's actually like processing is
16:58 - actually
17:00 - also like a library like it's a library
17:02 - for
17:03 - java um but i think what makes it like
17:07 - feel really different from p5 is that
17:09 - like
17:10 - it's not like the typical like
17:13 - environment
17:14 - that you would write java in they're all
17:16 - these different tools like one of the
17:18 - big ones is called
17:19 - um eclipse that people the environment
17:22 - that folks will write
17:23 - java in and um you know and the the
17:27 - reason is that like
17:28 - java i think in general is just like a
17:30 - more difficult um
17:32 - tool to use just because like the the
17:35 - way that you have to like connect all
17:37 - the libraries together and stuff
17:39 - and so like what this environment was
17:41 - created to do
17:42 - was to make that easier right is so that
17:45 - like you wouldn't have
17:46 - to be an expert about um you know how to
17:49 - like compile
17:50 - java code and like right when you're
17:52 - writing java code there's like a
17:53 - separate step
17:54 - of like translating this um
17:58 - this code into like the machine code
18:01 - like to the zeros and ones that like
18:03 - your computer can understand
18:05 - whereas like in javascript it like it
18:08 - like literally
18:09 - works differently where it like reads
18:11 - each singular line of code and like
18:13 - translates it to like
18:15 - the like zeros and ones like in real
18:17 - time
18:18 - so like because it has this like extra
18:20 - step of like compiling it all together
18:23 - you have to like pull in all these it
18:24 - like makes it harder to use
18:28 - right even getting that window with all
18:30 - the graphic stuff inside would be
18:32 - difficult to do if you were to do it
18:34 - from scratch
18:34 - using java so this was really like a
18:38 - hit i'd say when you could just download
18:40 - like a little software and you didn't
18:42 - have to worry about
18:43 - building your application application or
18:45 - anything you can just
18:46 - solely focus on creating visual things
18:48 - inside of it
18:49 - yeah i mean this is like incredible i
18:51 - mean like in 2001
18:53 - 2002 that you could like download this
18:55 - app and like make java and like at the
18:57 - time you could um
18:59 - you could run java in the browser you
19:02 - could make like java applets which
19:04 - now i think are um at this point are
19:07 - basically
19:08 - defunct um and no no one uses them
19:10 - anymore but it's kind of like the
19:11 - similar
19:12 - similar thing where it's like you could
19:13 - write code that like you could
19:15 - share in the same way and that that is
19:17 - so powerful
19:19 - um so
19:22 - yeah i think i think what also really
19:24 - like held the
19:26 - held the like processing together like
19:28 - was the community and having this space
19:30 - and i think
19:32 - um you know one of the one of the like
19:34 - main
19:35 - um sort of the canonical processing
19:39 - things that i always think about is like
19:41 - the the like one
19:43 - post on the board that's about like
19:44 - introducing yourself and like who you
19:46 - are
19:47 - um man i wish i had it i feel like dan
19:51 - schiffman um the creator of codingtrain
19:54 - has a really good
19:55 - email that he sent like when he like
19:58 - introduced himself to the processing
20:00 - community that's just like
20:01 - i live in new york with my like two cats
20:04 - and like
20:05 - it's something like that's really sweet
20:06 - [Laughter]
20:09 - it should be like a perma pinned on
20:11 - community processing
20:12 - no it's really it's really sweet um
20:16 - yeah and so like you know this community
20:20 - like stayed really strong and i i think
20:22 - um
20:23 - you know at this time a lot of the folks
20:25 - who were who were like
20:26 - using processing were um kind of like
20:30 - tied to the academic world
20:32 - and that's you know like uh like casey
20:35 - is like a professor
20:36 - at um ucla and had sort of like been
20:39 - able to
20:40 - keep like keep processing afloat like
20:42 - via all these like academic
20:44 - spaces and um you know so
20:48 - you know processing existed sort of had
20:50 - like a cult
20:51 - i mean i would call it like a cult
20:53 - following is really really like
20:55 - the way to put it um and then like this
20:58 - tool called processing.js
21:00 - came out and this is actually um
21:03 - not created by anyone at processing
21:06 - foundation
21:08 - though this time the foundation didn't
21:09 - exist but
21:11 - actually just someone named john
21:14 - resig took processing and basically just
21:16 - like translated the whole
21:18 - whole thing to javascript and you know
21:20 - this was in
21:21 - 2008 was the first release and you know
21:23 - it sort of marks a time when like folks
21:26 - were moving
21:26 - from java to to javascript
21:30 - is becoming a more and more popular
21:32 - language and um
21:34 - you know now it's like javascript is
21:36 - like the the most
21:38 - you know or it like literally is the
21:40 - most popular programming language um and
21:44 - uh yeah but this is this was this was
21:48 - created and maintained by
21:49 - someone not at um processing donation
21:52 - and um you know it's sort of it sort of
21:55 - marks like a clear
21:56 - denomination of like oh like folks are
21:59 - starting to move towards
22:00 - towards javascript and then in 2012 the
22:03 - foundation was created and i think that
22:05 - really the idea here
22:07 - was like there had been so much you know
22:10 - like
22:11 - uh like really what was like holding
22:12 - processing together was like
22:14 - academic support and like the foundation
22:18 - was a way to be able to expand that like
22:21 - having a non-profit entity that could
22:23 - then like
22:23 - fundraise and then be able to like pay
22:25 - people to like
22:26 - create um create new things and that's
22:30 - that's how um p5 came about is that like
22:33 - lauren lee
22:34 - mccarthy got um had a fellowship project
22:36 - in 2013 to like
22:38 - re-imagine um processing for the web
22:43 - and you know this is different from
22:46 - processing.js
22:47 - because like uh here
22:50 - yes this this i think describes it where
22:53 - um
22:54 - you know it says however this is a
22:57 - description on the
22:58 - p5 website about what p5 is but it says
23:01 - however you're not limited to your
23:03 - drawing canvas you can think of your
23:04 - whole browser page as your sketch
23:06 - including html
23:07 - html5 objects for text input video
23:10 - webcam and sound
23:11 - and so um the reason this is important
23:15 - is right if you look back at um
23:18 - processing you were you were like kind
23:19 - of tied to this like 2d
23:21 - canvas and the browser gives you like so
23:24 - many things
23:26 - beyond that and p5 is really about like
23:29 - reimagining what it could be like in in
23:32 - the context
23:33 - of a browser thus this project and so
23:36 - this project was started by lauren in
23:39 - beginning of 2013 and you can think of
23:41 - like p5
23:42 - js like just the library itself as
23:46 - you know if you look at the like
23:47 - language environment community part of
23:49 - this
23:50 - like the language you know there's also
23:53 - the community here but just just like
23:55 - the library itself is the language here
23:58 - right
23:59 - um and then you know as that
24:04 - is that uh you know that's where this
24:06 - project started to gain traction
24:08 - in 2015 there was a contributors
24:10 - conference and
24:12 - i marked this as something important
24:13 - because i think it it denotes
24:15 - a sort of like coming together of like a
24:19 - solid
24:20 - vision of what p5 is and one of the
24:23 - things that came out of this
24:24 - contributors conference
24:26 - um is this community statement which
24:28 - talks about like
24:30 - what p5 like what the community
24:33 - is right and it's
24:36 - not just about like folks gathering
24:39 - together on a forum it's about like
24:41 - creating a space for people and like i
24:46 - um you know i often think about this
24:48 - statement and often
24:50 - just like read it to like remember um
24:53 - the kind of space that's being created
24:56 - and like i kind of want to like go this
24:57 - picture for a moment because like
24:59 - when you know i think that a lot of
25:02 - folks
25:02 - have sort of like stereotypical ideas
25:05 - about like what it means to like work on
25:07 - technology and like who it's for and
25:09 - like some of these are enforced by like
25:11 - representation and like seeing and sort
25:13 - of like
25:15 - negative or just experiences in
25:18 - technology of it being like a group of
25:20 - like cis white men like working on like
25:22 - technology and making like cool stuff
25:25 - and like coming back to the community
25:28 - statement
25:28 - and like creating a space that
25:32 - um is about inclusion
25:35 - and like making people feel welcome um
25:38 - and just like yeah
25:42 - i might just i'm going to read this
25:45 - yeah so p5 is a community interested in
25:48 - exploring the creation of art
25:50 - and design with technology uh we are a
25:53 - community of
25:54 - and in solidarity with people from every
25:55 - gender identity and expression sexual
25:57 - orientation race ethnicity language
25:59 - neurotype size ability class religion
26:01 - culture subculture
26:03 - political opinion age skill level
26:04 - occupation background we acknowledge
26:06 - that not everyone has the time
26:08 - financial means or capacity to actively
26:10 - participate but
26:11 - we recognize and encourage involvement
26:12 - of all kinds we facilitate and foster
26:14 - access and empowerment we're all
26:16 - learners and like
26:18 - you know me sort of like coming upon p5
26:22 - i had like
26:22 - never read anything like this from
26:25 - a technology um
26:28 - space uh and
26:32 - i just really wanted to be part of this
26:35 - like who wouldn't want to be part of
26:37 - this sounds fun and like nice
26:38 - sounds like everyone's going to be nice
26:40 - to me it does it does
26:43 - do you feel like this has changed in the
26:45 - in the past five years you feel like
26:46 - more
26:47 - sub subsets of technology have like
26:50 - adopted
26:50 - you know missions or community
26:52 - statements like this or do you feel like
26:54 - p5 and creative coding at large are
26:56 - still pretty unique and like
26:58 - really making that a forefront of what
27:00 - you're doing
27:01 - i think that both of these things are
27:03 - true i think i still have yet to like
27:06 - really know about another community that
27:09 - puts like
27:10 - like inclusion and access and being
27:13 - beginner friendly like
27:14 - as the as like the most important thing
27:17 - um and i think that there are
27:21 - lots of spaces that are are really
27:23 - making an effort
27:24 - to um to like
27:27 - have a commitment to like making making
27:30 - a community that feels like
27:31 - uplifting and nourishing and welcoming
27:33 - and like full of care
27:38 - i have a maybe a little question um i
27:40 - wonder if
27:41 - this like openness of the community
27:43 - spirit i'd say
27:44 - um the p5.js has has anything to do with
27:47 - like how
27:48 - the tool itself is open source and so a
27:52 - little bit said going into that
27:53 - maybe we could also talk about what does
27:56 - that even mean what does
27:57 - open source even mean and how does that
27:59 - impact the kind of people that join
28:01 - the community as well totally yeah i
28:04 - definitely
28:06 - have like i kind of like have some
28:08 - slides about that
28:10 - [Laughter]
28:12 - i got you but yeah i want to talk about
28:14 - first like
28:16 - i think like one of the other really
28:18 - powerful things about
28:20 - p5 is like this concept
28:23 - of a contributor and i think that
28:26 - um again like lots of folks folks uh
28:30 - see contributing to code as like oh
28:33 - we're just contributing to a code
28:34 - library is like just
28:35 - writing code and i think one of the
28:39 - things that
28:40 - um lauren has has really developed
28:44 - is like this idea of contributing as
28:47 - something
28:48 - like more than just writing code you
28:50 - know like teaching documentation
28:52 - making art activism bug reporting
28:55 - outreach
28:56 - curating organizing it's so many
28:57 - different things and like these are
28:59 - all these are all different things that
29:02 - are part of the p5 community and like
29:04 - all of this work is important um
29:07 - and vital to this this project like
29:09 - staying alive
29:11 - and you know that is true for
29:15 - all open source libraries but i think
29:17 - especially
29:19 - um or i don't i don't even think it's
29:22 - like especially p5 but i
29:23 - appreciate that there is an emphasis and
29:26 - sort of like a
29:27 - a willingness to view contrib
29:29 - contribution to
29:31 - to a project as as this and
29:34 - um i'll talk a little bit more about
29:36 - like what like kind of like how
29:37 - open source functions but just to sort
29:40 - of like
29:41 - tie the loop of like my work on this
29:45 - and so like you know we had like i've
29:48 - like talked about like p5 as a language
29:50 - and p5 as a community and so sort of the
29:53 - missing piece
29:54 - of p5 was the environment right and so
29:57 - for a while there was a
29:59 - desktop editor for p5 um that originally
30:03 - was created by a person named sam levine
30:06 - and
30:07 - um this kind of became difficult
30:10 - to maintain like whenever you create
30:12 - like this was like an application that
30:14 - you could download
30:15 - and so it's it's difficult to maintain
30:18 - an application that you can download
30:19 - because it has to run on different
30:20 - operating systems like windows and mac
30:23 - and linux and also there are
30:26 - difficulties with
30:27 - um if you have it on like a school
30:30 - computer it's sometimes difficult to
30:31 - download software
30:33 - um and so it just like was
30:37 - um it just wasn't working for
30:40 - the to uphold the idea the like
30:43 - ideals of p5 of like making this tool
30:46 - accessible
30:47 - and so then in may
30:51 - 2016 i started making the
30:54 - web editor that was my my first commit
30:56 - which i think in the beginning looked
30:58 - something like this i don't know this
31:00 - had to be like the
31:02 - really early version because i think you
31:03 - couldn't even like log in or log out
31:08 - this must be like you know like august
31:12 - 2016 in july august 2016 i'm so curious
31:15 - how did you even
31:16 - start was it was it you completely by
31:18 - yourself were you like working with
31:20 - other people from the community like how
31:21 - did you even
31:22 - uh start this project cause it's
31:24 - obviously grown into
31:25 - this yeah we'll show off yeah uh well so
31:29 - it
31:29 - started through like the
31:33 - foundation fellowships i like applied
31:35 - for a
31:36 - fellowship that i didn't get but then i
31:40 - just had been in
31:41 - in contact with with dan
31:44 - and was like you know i just like really
31:46 - want to be involved in open source i
31:48 - think i had
31:49 - um i was like in a place where i felt
31:51 - really
31:52 - like frustrated with with tech
31:55 - communities because like i really wanted
31:57 - to be in a space that like
31:58 - uphol upheld things like this i felt
32:01 - like
32:01 - i was this person who was like asking
32:03 - all these questions and like everyone
32:05 - was like don't think about that and i
32:07 - was like no
32:08 - like i wanna i wanna be talking about
32:10 - this and thinking about this so
32:12 - um i was like in contact with dan and
32:14 - then
32:15 - you know he and lauren reached out to me
32:17 - and were like you know we have some
32:18 - funding
32:19 - from um nyu itp
32:22 - to um work on this tool like would you
32:25 - would you want to like work on it and it
32:28 - was
32:29 - it was like really exciting for me like
32:30 - i had never contributed to open source
32:33 - before
32:34 - and um was like had been working as a
32:37 - web developer for like a couple years
32:39 - and like still pretty new to me and i
32:42 - was like
32:42 - yeah sure i'll do it i don't really know
32:44 - what i'm getting myself into but
32:48 - i mean i mean i think that that
32:49 - underscores like the importance of
32:50 - community where the
32:51 - reason that or like one of the ways that
32:54 - you got really into the space was
32:55 - knowing other people from the community
32:57 - and so whether that's
32:58 - p5 and creative coding or other
33:00 - communities that people
33:02 - might be interested in the tech space
33:03 - just yet getting to know
33:06 - folks in the community can help you um
33:08 - totally
33:10 - yeah totally and and there's like so
33:12 - many spaces
33:13 - like online to do that just like get to
33:16 - know
33:17 - you know p5 people um and now
33:20 - the editor kind of looks something like
33:22 - this maybe the ui is more like
33:24 - refined whatever has more has more
33:26 - features
33:27 - um but yeah and you know now i've been
33:31 - like working on this for
33:32 - a few years and um
33:35 - [Music]
33:36 - it just like my like my my role
33:40 - is to just like keep keep it going and i
33:43 - think like
33:43 - uphold the values of like access defined
33:47 - as like
33:48 - accessibility and inclusion and like
33:50 - making making a tool that
33:52 - um can reach can reach people and like
33:54 - you can
33:56 - you know have the same environment that
33:58 - really feels you know
33:59 - i like to me it feels important to like
34:01 - leave leave the like remnants of
34:03 - processing in like this play button
34:06 - and like what like what is what is
34:09 - like processing or p5 without the play
34:12 - button the giant play button yeah
34:15 - and that color too yeah and the pink
34:18 - yeah i mean i think i think that um
34:22 - yeah it's like a friendly it's like a
34:24 - friendly color and i think that was a
34:25 - very
34:25 - very conscious choice of lauren but
34:29 - um i think one oh and then also like
34:32 - there's another contributors conference
34:34 - in in 2019
34:35 - and again like i think i think one of
34:37 - the things that that came out of this
34:38 - was really
34:40 - um centering adding features to
34:44 - 2p5 that are that are really based
34:46 - around like
34:47 - increasing access over like making a new
34:50 - like something that's like
34:51 - more optimized or like or like flashy or
34:54 - awesome
34:55 - um yeah and that's that's something
34:57 - that's really important to me and then i
34:58 - kind of have like
35:00 - some slides about how like open source
35:02 - works which is fun
35:04 - but yeah enough sure
35:07 - do we want to go into that do we want to
35:09 - stop and ask i don't know if you have
35:11 - any specific questions here if you want
35:12 - it's also
35:13 - time for uh if you're in the chat if
35:16 - you're in the youtube chat right now and
35:17 - you have
35:17 - questions for cassie um i think kind of
35:20 - the the plan for the rest of the session
35:21 - is to talk about open source in general
35:24 - we want to show off the p5 web editor
35:26 - because you want i think you're um
35:28 - uh you're going to be using it for the
35:30 - rest of the series hopefully introducing
35:32 - people to that but yeah any uh
35:34 - any questions from chat um that would be
35:36 - a good time i guess
35:37 - um or do you want if you have anything
35:41 - i'm eager to talk more about open source
35:45 - let's do it um i kind of have more like
35:47 - word slides i couldn't really find any
35:50 - like a lot of good images
35:51 - but um i think it's okay
35:54 - so like i like i
35:58 - i feel like i learned a lot about sort
36:01 - of like
36:01 - licensing and like how that kind of
36:03 - stuff
36:04 - fairly recently like within the last
36:06 - last year i never really like thought
36:08 - about it
36:09 - too much of the last like couple years
36:10 - um so like
36:12 - processing and p5 are it's you usually
36:15 - you use this abbreviation called
36:17 - floss which is like free slash libre
36:20 - open source software
36:22 - and the the reason that it's like free
36:25 - slash libre
36:26 - is because free does not mean free of
36:29 - cost
36:29 - it means like just it means it like
36:32 - implies like a freedom
36:34 - and so like what the what these tools
36:37 - what these things mean is right so like
36:38 - open source software is a type of
36:40 - computer software in which the source
36:42 - code right like the
36:43 - the like text that you're writing is
36:45 - released under a license
36:47 - in which the copyright holder grants the
36:49 - users the rights to use
36:50 - study change and distribute the software
36:52 - to anyone and for any purpose
36:53 - and the reason like you need a license
36:55 - is because when you write
36:57 - software it's actually protected under
37:00 - like
37:01 - um intellectual property law like it's
37:04 - it's something that you write and so
37:05 - if you don't have a license it's
37:07 - actually not
37:09 - it's protected by like the ip law so it
37:13 - would be
37:13 - um so like you can't actually like
37:16 - use that code and then repurpose it you
37:19 - need to actually give it a license in
37:20 - order to make in order to be able to
37:23 - um edit edit that source code so
37:27 - these types of licenses started coming
37:28 - up where um
37:31 - you could you could like attach this
37:33 - license to your source code and then
37:35 - folks could
37:36 - like remix that and like make their own
37:38 - versions and
37:40 - yeah i never knew that so without the
37:41 - license that's not in fact open source
37:43 - and you
37:44 - couldn't be able to have somebody else
37:46 - out of it or
37:48 - no interesting i never knew that yeah so
37:50 - like even this is true of of um code on
37:53 - github actually like if there is no
37:55 - license on your repository like
37:57 - technically
37:57 - it's like not open source
38:01 - uh that's just like a yeah just like the
38:05 - fun world of like
38:06 - intellectual property law
38:10 - i think i feel like this could be like a
38:11 - whole session on its own
38:13 - because there's so many much new ones
38:15 - into it and
38:16 - you know like there's different levels
38:18 - of how much freedom you can give
38:20 - people who use it as well but yeah
38:22 - exactly like
38:23 - there's different types of licenses i
38:25 - think one of the really
38:28 - um important ones is like this concept
38:31 - of like
38:32 - copy left which basically there were
38:34 - like certain types of licenses where you
38:35 - could like take the source code
38:37 - and like make your own copy of it and
38:39 - then make it like private again
38:42 - and what copy left does it makes it so
38:45 - like you can't
38:47 - then like change that license so it's
38:48 - like the code is private and that's sort
38:50 - of like an
38:51 - like enforcing of it being it being
38:54 - public
38:55 - um so that that was like a really
38:57 - important license that that came out
39:00 - um and then like there's also this
39:03 - concept of like
39:04 - free software and um this
39:07 - these are this comes from like the free
39:09 - software foundation
39:10 - and the term free software has like four
39:12 - essential freedoms which are
39:14 - to run the program to study and change
39:16 - the program in source code form to
39:18 - redistribute exact copies and to
39:20 - distribute
39:21 - modified versions and so this is about
39:24 - like
39:25 - how how you use the software and these
39:27 - are the things that make
39:28 - you know the abbreviation floss or
39:30 - whatever
39:32 - um and just you know there's just terms
39:34 - but
39:36 - and so and so you're saying something
39:37 - like p5 is both
39:39 - open source software and also free
39:41 - software
39:42 - yes exactly um and this is important
39:45 - and on purpose and i think um i have
39:49 - this
39:49 - quote from casey or this is pulled from
39:53 - a
39:54 - like a blog post he wrote about
39:56 - processing and why
39:57 - why it was floss and um i'm gonna read
40:00 - this
40:00 - this whole thing because i think i think
40:02 - it like really describes
40:04 - it well but um this is like from his
40:08 - his perspective talking about processing
40:10 - he says we believe
40:11 - visual artists and designers should be
40:13 - in control of their own software tools
40:16 - it's not enough to rely on corporations
40:18 - to make what we need
40:19 - the code and systems that we use shape
40:22 - our work um
40:25 - yeah i really like that i mean just just
40:28 - this so far like this this concept of
40:31 - being in control of the tools you use
40:33 - like if you think about
40:34 - you know getting a license from adobe or
40:37 - you know getting a license from
40:39 - um i don't know the company that makes
40:43 - maya but they're very expensive and like
40:45 - at any time
40:46 - the companies could like choose to shut
40:48 - down these tools and
40:51 - here is like showing a real dedication
40:53 - to being like we need to be in control
40:55 - of the tools that we make and shape them
40:57 - right so here when we release
40:59 - proprietary when companies release
41:01 - proprietary platforms and we use them we
41:03 - don't have the freedoms to modify and
41:04 - expand them
41:05 - as makers we feel it's essential to have
41:08 - have tools that we create ourselves
41:10 - tools that are shaped by the needs and
41:11 - desires of the communities and creators
41:13 - that use them
41:14 - and so open source is a way
41:17 - that allows folks to like have control
41:22 - of their tools
41:23 - and the community um and and that's
41:26 - that's really powerful
41:29 - this is a question that you might not
41:30 - not know the answer to
41:35 - i think alex froze a little bit
41:40 - we'll wait wait until he comes back
41:42 - [Laughter]
41:46 - hello yeah he's back froze for a moment
41:49 - so if he asked a question we don't know
41:50 - what it is
41:53 - it said my internet is on this table so
41:55 - hopefully i don't drop out again
41:57 - um cassie do you know of other
41:59 - communities in the tech space that
42:01 - are similarly like open source minded
42:04 - like
42:04 - have similar values like this or again
42:07 - is this
42:07 - something that seems pretty unique or
42:09 - pretty um yeah pretty unique to like
42:11 - creative coding
42:14 - i think blender is has a big open source
42:17 - community
42:18 - blender is maybe one of the most similar
42:22 - because i feel like blender just like
42:23 - has such a big community
42:25 - because i was just like thinking of like
42:27 - what are other tools that
42:29 - that feel that sort of have these these
42:32 - like three things the like language
42:34 - environment community
42:36 - and i feel like yeah i feel like blender
42:39 - blender is really rad
42:40 - tool for those of you who don't know
42:44 - what blender is just to really quickly
42:45 - say it
42:46 - it's an open source software they can do
42:48 - 3d environment creation
42:50 - in i think that's like a really small
42:53 - little thing that you can do with
42:54 - blender but basically
42:56 - um i think that their goal essentially
42:58 - is it aims you to go all the way from
43:00 - like creating your 3d
43:01 - um you know assets all the way into like
43:04 - reading like a whole scene and movie
43:06 - with your 3d um 3d
43:09 - what are they called product models
43:12 - models yeah products animations
43:15 - it's yeah it's a really cool tool
43:18 - um yeah oh man i forgot
43:22 - to say one really important thing about
43:24 - processing and p5
43:26 - is like one of the other
43:29 - like core values it's like the low
43:31 - what's called like low floor
43:33 - high ceiling and that like it's it's
43:35 - like
43:36 - you know tried to be like a low low
43:39 - barrier to entry but also
43:40 - um i think because it uses code syntax
43:44 - and it allows
43:44 - there are lots of folks who who write
43:46 - like add-on libraries and i think really
43:49 - really tied into this statement here of
43:52 - like
43:52 - you know the community being in control
43:54 - of the tool like you can make an add-on
43:56 - library and be like oh like p5 doesn't
43:58 - have this thing
43:58 - i wanna i wanna make like a text editing
44:02 - like a text manipulation
44:04 - library or like you know processing
44:05 - doesn't have this thing i'm i'm gonna
44:07 - work on it
44:08 - um and that's really powerful and that
44:10 - like
44:11 - you know if somehow p5 changes and your
44:15 - library
44:16 - breaks like you have a say in that
44:17 - process versus like
44:19 - you know if you wrote like an add-on for
44:22 - photoshop or something and like that
44:23 - changed it would just kind of be like
44:26 - you know and this i think an example of
44:28 - this happening
44:29 - is um like a lot of folks
44:32 - have made like like art twitter bots and
44:35 - like
44:36 - the sort of over the past few years the
44:38 - api for like using twitter
44:40 - has really changed and caused like cost
44:42 - a lot of
44:43 - um like art to just like
44:48 - perish
44:50 - i do want to make sure that we have some
44:52 - time to demo the web editor too
44:54 - yeah okay i'm going to go through the
44:56 - recipes
44:57 - real quick but i think another thing i
45:00 - want to talk about is just sort of like
45:02 - some of the pitfalls of open source
45:05 - um and just like some of the things i'm
45:06 - thinking about and so there's a survey
45:09 - in in 2017 from github about
45:11 - open source software and they found that
45:13 - the gender imbalance in open source
45:14 - software remains profound
45:16 - 95 for in the survey 95 of respondents
45:19 - for men
45:20 - just three percent for women and one
45:21 - percent are non-binary and
45:23 - like why is this you know i think i
45:26 - think there's
45:27 - lots of um not only gender disparity in
45:31 - in the tech world but
45:32 - it's it's like especially uh bad
45:36 - or especially uh prominent prominent
45:39 - yeah
45:40 - in in open source and like why is that
45:42 - and you know one of
45:44 - one of the reasons is that like there's
45:47 - sort of
45:47 - this this um implicit narrative of like
45:51 - unpaid labor in open source and if you
45:53 - think about like
45:54 - who has the time and like who has the
45:57 - privilege
45:58 - of like you know free time in order to
46:00 - work on open source
46:01 - it's like going to be predominantly
46:03 - people who are in a position of
46:05 - privilege and so
46:06 - this is this is pulled from a blog post
46:08 - called the ethics
46:10 - of unpaid labor in the open source
46:11 - software community and
46:13 - um just like pulls from some tweets
46:15 - where it says whether free time
46:17 - activities are called worker play
46:18 - the existence of free time to do them is
46:20 - a privilege
46:22 - and so when you when you have when you
46:24 - have a space
46:25 - that relies on free labor in order
46:29 - to do work it's going it's only going to
46:31 - be
46:32 - you know it's going to like perpetuate
46:34 - sort of like um
46:36 - structural inequalities and so
46:39 - um here's a tweet that lauren asked for
46:42 - she said
46:43 - how do you how do you make a volunteer
46:45 - based open source project sustainable
46:46 - is this even projectable or is this even
46:49 - possible i really need some help
46:50 - figuring this out
46:52 - and this is something that i think about
46:54 - a lot and you know have talked to
46:56 - talk to lauren about is like how do we
46:58 - make these projects sustainable we're
47:00 - like we're releasing the software
47:02 - free of cost and like you know lots of
47:05 - folks are using these tools for free and
47:08 - you know that that i think is one of the
47:09 - reasons for having like
47:11 - the foundation um but also just like a a
47:14 - real dedication
47:15 - to paying people for their work but
47:17 - they're also
47:18 - different types of giving people value
47:20 - for their contributions but
47:22 - i want to read this quote from lauren
47:23 - where she says
47:25 - um for me sustainability means not just
47:28 - preserving the sanity of the people in
47:29 - charge but also extending the
47:31 - opportunity to work on it to people who
47:33 - would
47:33 - love to be a part of the project if we
47:35 - could provide them a means of access
47:38 - um and so
47:41 - yeah i think to me to me this means like
47:44 - reaching out to people who are not
47:46 - represented or people
47:47 - who don't feel welcome and like giving
47:49 - them what they need whether it's like
47:51 - you know
47:52 - money or care or support or whatever
47:55 - whatever they need in order to support
47:56 - them
47:57 - um and i also like
48:01 - you know just to like sort of wrap wrap
48:03 - this up and then
48:04 - go go to the web editor like i was
48:06 - talking to someone about this project
48:09 - i don't know when it was like working
48:11 - the p5 web editor and they were like
48:13 - i was like talking about how i was still
48:14 - working on it and they were like well it
48:16 - works
48:17 - so like what like what else is there to
48:18 - do a lot
48:20 - so they meant it they meant it like
48:23 - really
48:24 - really genuinely it was it wasn't like a
48:27 - um
48:27 - like they were trying to be a backhanded
48:29 - compliment no no no it was like not
48:31 - intended to be like patronizing at all
48:34 - they meant it like totally genuinely and
48:35 - it sort of like made me think about the
48:37 - invisible work that goes into these
48:39 - projects
48:39 - you know whether it's like managing all
48:42 - the issues that come up on github
48:44 - or like you know for example this is
48:47 - some screenshot i took of like they're
48:48 - currently like over
48:49 - four million sketches on the web editor
48:53 - so it's like managing a huge amount of
48:55 - data
48:55 - and then also just like thinking about
48:58 - how to make these projects sustainable
48:59 - and creating a structure in place so
49:02 - like lauren made an open call for a new
49:05 - p5
49:06 - lead to sort of like replace her and
49:08 - like be a new steward for the project
49:10 - and so
49:10 - that's something i'm thinking about all
49:13 - the time but
49:14 - now let's talk about the web editor now
49:16 - that we know about open source
49:18 - um cassie before we before we go there i
49:20 - uh
49:21 - could you give a plug of like if people
49:23 - are watching this and feels
49:25 - like everything that you've said that
49:27 - really resonates with them
49:28 - like how do they get involved i feel
49:31 - like something that i feel a lot of the
49:33 - time is feeling intimidated by entering
49:34 - these communities feeling
49:35 - impostor syndrome all that kind of stuff
49:37 - so if somebody wants to
49:40 - get involved specifically in p5 and
49:42 - processing
49:43 - um what's the best way to do that yeah i
49:46 - mean what i would say
49:47 - i'm gonna share go to like a like a
49:50 - browser window
49:51 - i mean i think a great if you're like i
49:54 - don't know anything i mean
49:55 - obviously it would be like you know
49:58 - learning p5 from like the code academy
50:02 - it's a nice vlog it's great but also
50:06 - like our course is also free yeah that's
50:09 - true
50:09 - which is nice yeah but also like dan's
50:11 - youtube channel is i think a really
50:13 - accessible
50:15 - place um there's the
50:18 - five days or you know i think um
50:22 - like here here there's like a forum
50:26 - that you can ask questions on um
50:30 - and like
50:33 - yeah if you want to get help um
50:37 - yeah i think like also just looking on
50:39 - twitter and kind of like seeing what
50:40 - other people are up to
50:42 - um there's oh there's also um
50:46 - gotta move things around processing
50:49 - foundation there's also
50:50 - like a processing community day that
50:52 - happens um i think that's under
50:56 - uh yeah there's gonna be one this year
50:59 - like i think an official one in the
51:01 - summer
51:03 - but um yeah i think yeah and
51:06 - and we can put like all those links in
51:07 - the youtube description or
51:09 - if you want to i wonder if putting this
51:11 - kind of stuff in the
51:13 - codecademy course might be it might be
51:14 - helpful but
51:16 - yeah i think just like uh
51:19 - for me i would struggle to do this and i
51:22 - think i even do struggle with this where
51:23 - i don't really participate in as many
51:24 - open source products as i want to or
51:26 - like p5 i
51:27 - i love and i'm a huge advocate of but
51:30 - have like never interacted in the
51:31 - community so i think
51:32 - just encouraging folks to like take that
51:34 - first step and get involved in the
51:36 - community if this is something that
51:37 - speaks to you
51:38 - um just that for example is like
51:40 - probably the hardest part
51:42 - yeah and i mean i think getting involved
51:44 - is like as simple as using the tool
51:46 - you know like by using it like you're
51:49 - you're supporting
51:50 - you know like you're you're just like
51:52 - another person who can like
51:55 - then share your experience about like
51:57 - what it's like to learn this tool and
51:58 - like how to make it
51:59 - better and for better for me is like
52:01 - maybe more accessible
52:03 - and like more more stable and i think
52:05 - like
52:06 - that is really one of the the big parts
52:10 - of creating
52:11 - the web editor is um making it
52:15 - making it accessible right and one of
52:17 - one of like the cool things about the
52:19 - webinar is like basically you have
52:21 - this setup where you have like code on
52:23 - the left and like a preview on the right
52:25 - and then when you open it
52:27 - you get like a a sort of like generic
52:30 - gray square which is not that exciting
52:32 - but if you're like
52:33 - oh let me look at some other code you
52:36 - can go to the examples
52:37 - and
52:42 - i think i wanted this one
52:45 - yeah you can sort of like look at the
52:46 - other code that folks have made oh no
52:48 - that's not the one i wanted
52:50 - um
52:54 - oh no sorry examples
52:59 - examples um video
53:03 - um i think video pixels yeah
53:06 - you can sort of like see what it looks
53:09 - like so here's an example of one that is
53:11 - like
53:11 - pixelating a video and i can be like oh
53:14 - cool
53:14 - this this is fun but then if i'm like
53:17 - you know
53:18 - i want this to be um
53:22 - rather than it be this fingers one i
53:24 - want it to be like a
53:25 - webcam of me i can just easily like
53:28 - comment this out right and then make
53:31 - this
53:32 - rather than it being this video i can be
53:35 - like create
53:36 - capture video i think i have to do
53:41 - fingers dot size
53:44 - um 640
53:48 - oh wait yeah 320 240.
53:53 - right and then now i have this webcam
53:56 - that's like me
53:57 - right and so i can like
54:00 - right and then from here i could be like
54:02 - oh rather than all these dots being
54:05 - black i want them to be um
54:09 - where it could be um how would i do this
54:13 - darkness darkness but this is
54:16 - but the color i think is just being
54:18 - default black
54:20 - yeah why is this
54:23 - oh times darkness oh i could just do
54:25 - like fill
54:27 - 255. we can make it like red
54:32 - let's see if that works yeah right and
54:35 - so then i could start like playing
54:36 - around with this
54:37 - and like have my own version of this and
54:40 - i don't need to like
54:41 - download anything you know for so many
54:45 - coding languages it's like okay download
54:47 - a text editor
54:48 - then like add this library as a
54:51 - dependency or whatever and you're like
54:52 - what are these words
54:54 - um yeah and i think like all of the
54:57 - stuff of like getting p5 loaded into
54:59 - your sketch is really hidden
55:01 - and you know like once you make an
55:02 - account on the web editor then like all
55:04 - your work is saved so if i like
55:06 - save this now like now this is part of
55:09 - my account and then if i go to
55:11 - like my sketches i have like you know
55:14 - whatever
55:16 - [Laughter]
55:19 - yeah um and you can also
55:22 - you can you can like manipulate videos
55:24 - and images in here and so
55:25 - here i can um upload files
55:29 - to like images and stuff um i can also
55:32 - and the other cool thing is like i can
55:33 - share
55:34 - my work so let's say i was like i think
55:37 - this is
55:38 - great you know i can then like have this
55:41 - version
55:42 - that's just like this in frame or um
55:46 - the embed is really cool it looks like
55:47 - so you can embed that in
55:49 - your website if you have it or yeah
55:52 - um i think this is the one that
55:55 - just doesn't even have the bar like yeah
56:00 - can it's great for sharing um what else
56:02 - is really useful and then i guess you
56:04 - know the other
56:05 - you know there's like keyboard shortcuts
56:07 - you also can link there's a link to like
56:08 - the reference if you want to learn
56:10 - um get familiar with the p5 library
56:14 - itself
56:14 - um and then also like
56:18 - want to link to the um
56:22 - like report a bug and like the github
56:24 - repository
56:26 - because like one thing that you can do
56:28 - as a person
56:29 - you know contributing to p5 is to like
56:32 - report
56:32 - bugs and if like you notice that
56:34 - something is wrong
56:36 - like you can just be like hey i feel
56:38 - like this like this website isn't
56:39 - working as i think it should and
56:41 - like no one here is going to be like um
56:45 - you know and like maybe it is a bug or
56:47 - maybe it's you're not doing something
56:48 - right but like no one here is going to
56:49 - be like wow i can't believe you couldn't
56:51 - figure that out
56:52 - like it's like um you know i mean first
56:55 - of all it's going to be like me you're
56:56 - responding and
56:58 - i'm just gonna be here to like be be
57:01 - friendly and
57:02 - support support you but this is a really
57:04 - big way that you can contribute
57:06 - it's just by reporting bugs or just like
57:09 - putting ideas on here
57:10 - of things you would want to see and you
57:13 - know for example like and one thing that
57:15 - you could
57:16 - contribute is like there have been some
57:18 - folks who have been doing translations
57:19 - and so now
57:20 - it's in spanish and japanese and hindi
57:24 - so like the canal experience a lot
57:27 - better in hindi which is really cool
57:29 - um and that's the thing you can
57:30 - contribute
57:32 - yeah i think that's a really big thing
57:34 - though it really opens up this like
57:36 - not only just p5 web editor but like
57:38 - programming visual things in general to
57:41 - a wider community than people
57:42 - just speak english yeah yeah
57:45 - that example tab is amazing i want to go
57:47 - look at some of those other uh
57:49 - other example things and play around
57:51 - with it yeah and like all of them are
57:53 - pulled
57:54 - from like the website like the t5
57:57 - website
57:58 - but it's just here you can just quickly
58:00 - be like oh i actually want to change
58:01 - something and see how it looks and and
58:03 - that i think is the biggest
58:05 - that is like the fundamental way
58:09 - to learn how to do coding i think is to
58:12 - just
58:12 - take what other people have done and be
58:14 - like
58:15 - how can i change this and make this
58:17 - different like what does changing this
58:18 - number do
58:20 - you know that's the biggest thing
58:24 - i think it also like the thing that i
58:26 - really like u5
58:28 - web editor for is that not only can you
58:30 - share the code that you've written for
58:32 - someone else but also
58:33 - if you open the file tabs you see that
58:36 - it is still a web page that it is
58:38 - it has an index.html it has um sketch.js
58:42 - so it doesn't hide the fact
58:44 - that it is just like a little blank
58:46 - space but it shows you all the
58:48 - files that goes into creating that
58:50 - window in the preview
58:51 - yeah and like i think this is something
58:54 - that's like a little bit different from
58:55 - like
58:56 - other code editors like codepen i mean
58:59 - definitely on
59:00 - on glitch you can do this but to me to
59:03 - me like
59:04 - upholding this idea of like low floor
59:06 - high ceiling was like in the end i want
59:09 - to be able to
59:10 - like just download this sketch as a
59:11 - website like i could just download this
59:14 - and then i have a zip file that's like
59:16 - all of these
59:17 - files together and um then i could
59:20 - literally just take that
59:22 - and like put it on whatever hosting
59:24 - platform i want like if you could use um
59:26 - because it's all front end you can put
59:27 - it
59:28 - on github pages or whatever whatever you
59:30 - use
59:31 - neocities
59:34 - [Laughter]
59:35 - yeah i love i love neocities um
59:39 - yeah so yeah to me it's really important
59:42 - that like you can kind of see
59:43 - and really uphold that ideal of like
59:45 - when you're writing p5 or processing
59:47 - like you're writing code syntax
59:50 - yeah and like understanding that i think
59:53 - this is a great way to like if you if
59:55 - there's um people watching who are going
59:57 - through the learn p5.js course
59:59 - if you want to like really go deep down
60:01 - into um
60:02 - you know the creative coding and p5.js
60:05 - in general this is a great way to
60:06 - take your projects off of our
60:08 - codecapping platform and move your code
60:10 - into the v5 web editor
60:12 - so you can keep track of the different
60:13 - versions of the sketches that you are
60:15 - building
60:16 - you can you know even load your own
60:18 - sketch and then make a different version
60:19 - of that and try out different things
60:21 - with us you know same fundamental code
60:23 - but maybe doing different styles and
60:24 - things kind of
60:26 - things like that to it so i like i said
60:29 - i think did i mention this i forget
60:31 - but um from next live streaming series
60:34 - we're going to be using the p5 web
60:36 - editor to
60:36 - um work on so that you know what during
60:39 - the during our live series we'll start
60:41 - um programming from scratch on these
60:44 - on like a blank um the 5.js sketch on
60:46 - the web editor and then after the live
60:48 - stream we'll add the link
60:49 - to the web editor into the description
60:52 - of the youtube video
60:53 - so you guys can take that code and then
60:56 - remix it even further and make it your
60:58 - own if you want
60:59 - do you want what project are you working
61:01 - on next week next week we're going to be
61:03 - looking at what we call
61:04 - the um genitive art creator
61:07 - so we have these like little
61:09 - visualizations that you can trigger with
61:10 - a mouse press and then you can create
61:12 - your own
61:13 - little um generative art drawing and you
61:15 - can also click on the canvas and
61:17 - download that as an image file that you
61:18 - can use
61:19 - anywhere you want and we're going to
61:20 - build that on the web editor cool
61:24 - it's awesome cassie anything else you
61:26 - want to
61:27 - say or plug or tell people to check out
61:30 - or anything at all
61:31 - i guess the only other thing i want to
61:33 - plug
61:34 - is that there's currently a fellowship
61:37 - application open for the foundation it
61:40 - closes
61:42 - uh however long april
61:46 - but i wanna i wanna emphasize that like
61:48 - you don't need to be
61:50 - a coder in order to apply and it's open
61:54 - to any type of
61:55 - any type of work
61:58 - it's really just about being being part
62:01 - of
62:02 - it's just like an opportunity to get
62:04 - some money to be part of
62:06 - the community so if you're maybe like
62:10 - you
62:10 - are familiar with p5 but um
62:14 - you know wanting to get involved more
62:15 - this is a great way you're familiar with
62:17 - coding and not familiar with p5 it's a
62:19 - great way
62:20 - and this is how you got started right
62:21 - this is like similar to the fellowship
62:23 - yeah kind of
62:24 - i mean this is like how i got started
62:26 - yeah it's cool
62:29 - thank you so much cassie for being here
62:32 - with us today
62:33 - yeah thank you for having me so much fun
62:37 - cool okay well um yeah with that i guess
62:40 - we will be back
62:41 - uh next week for another another project
62:43 - that jivon's gonna walk through
62:44 - um yeah thanks so much cassie thank you
62:47 - talk to you all later
62:48 - thank you bye

Cleaned transcript:

i think we are live yeah i think we're probably good to go okay cool hello guys welcome back to our live series on creative decoding this is session three and today we have a new face who i will let her i will let them introduce themselves but before we do that my name is jiwan i am a curriculum developer at co academy and we also have hello i'm alex i'm also a person developer at codecademy super excited to have cassie here today um very fun to get some guests talking about creative coding um yeah so cassie do you want to introduce yourself yes um hi everyone i'm cassie tarakagian um i use they them pronouns and um i am just here to talk about a little bit about my work and then um a project i've been working on for uh five years now which is the p5 editor which is like a platform that will let you write p5 sketches in but i'll just kind of like introduce myself first so let me do the screen share thing and um play this did it work oh no it's thinking looks good to me oh there we go um so hi it's me um and so i am a like technologist and educator and artist musician so i kind of do like like a bunch of different things um i like i'm a technologist like i write code um i make this you know uh web editor for p5 i also have like a bunch of experience just like working on like different types of creative coding software in general i would say my work is really focused on like software for creation like i've worked on um i worked at um cycling 74 which is a company that makes software called maximus c which is like a different creative coding tool um and um yeah i also have just like worked as a worked as a web developer but i also do a lot of teaching so here's a picture of me teaching in the you know the before times um i was teaching a like max msp workshop here and um i also am an adjunct professor at nyu itp um teaching there this semester a class on like culture like internet culture and memes and that that kind of stuff online yeah class on like cursed content if you're familiar with cursed content um so that's really fun um and yeah i also have like some creative projects that i do that are kind of like in the space of like art and technology so i have this project a few years ago a few years ago called wiki sonnet which like generates which like scanned all of wikipedia and found like all of the sentences that people have written that were in iambic pentameter which is like a stress unstressed things you know like the form of the unstructured and then it like assembled them all into elizabethan sonnets so like sometimes they were kind of like nonsensical but you know just kind of i it's one of those things that like it's so difficult if you're like i want to sit down and write a sentence and i have a pentameter it's quite difficult to do but if you were like constantly doing it accidentally all the time and i think it's fun to um take like transform sentences that were like used for just to you know be information right like like wikipedia is a place to share information and then like re recontextualize it it's like poetry um you know i really like proposal for a hypertext project is like i am i have a century um yeah unfortunately the project is like very it was like costly to like run and like generate these sonnets so it's like no longer a real website but you know that's just like a past project and this like was a web application that had like a whole server back in i was like you could generate some real time which was which is fun and maybe we should like try to just get the ones that we generated i was staying up but you know future um i also um have an app that i made that tells you whether or not you're holding your phone just more just like a dumb dumb kind of project this is this is part of um made the set like the stupid hackathon at nyu itv oh yeah yeah um i also had like a musical project i was part of called blob eyes for ai which is about like making music for like the the like machine learning artificial intelligent like children were bringing to the world like showing them how to like exist in the world and be like loving loving creatures um and i also just like want to give a shout out to like neopets because it's just like i think it's just like vitally important to like how i like experience computers i think it was like the first website that i like spent a lot of time on and like put a lot of energy into and it was also the first place that i ever learned how to write code like on this website you could um like you would have like a bunch of pets that you could like give them different like colors you can like build a home from them and have a shop there's like a stock market you can do so much on that website and um but you could make like a like a website for your pet and so they would just give you like this giant like text like no syntax highlighting just like literally like a text area or whatever and you would just like edit the html you like put any css like in line and that's how you would have your your web page and i like wish i had an example of one of the ones i made but when i like logged back into my account many years later it had like been hacked and like all my accounts were gone that's funny we hear i i feel like i've heard that story a couple of times that's really being like the introduction to coding i mean yeah i'm curious how so this is a this is a series for basically beginners to create coding where we're just introducing them to p5 i'm curious like how how do you even get started with creative coding where you're talking about like oh i made this like silly app that's selling if i like i'm holding my phone or not or i'm you know i i have this cyanide contaminator generating thing how do you even like get into the community how do you like what would do you remember what your first like creative coding project was or how you even began i i don't remember um i'd have to like really oh you know actually i think that i i got into it um because i think i like you know i kind of would like make websites on neopets i also you know i think it's sort of like the same era was really into like making myself have like an awesome email uh an awesome emo myspace page you know that was like that was like my vibe and then sort of like i like studied um like engineering in undergrad and sort of that that felt really like divorced from that world where it was more like oh we're like learning we're just kind of like learning how to code but it wasn't as much focused on like output and like this is what we're like going to do with code and then i um i like ended up taking a course that was about making like computer music um because like i have like a background in music as well and i was just kind of like i don't know maybe i'll maybe i'll like see what this is and we used this um this like coding creative coding language called pure data which is kind of like the the predecessor to max msp and so that was that was like my first experience of creative coding was like using this tool and like what i would do with it is um kind of like jump between different like audio samples and like be processing audio and like cutting that up i also did a project where i like used like a like a wii like a wiimote as like a input on the so that was kind of like my start and then and then from there started like learning about um like processing um and then just like started making making sketches and that and just found it really like satisfying as opposed to like the type of software development work i was doing yeah i think it's interesting so i used i used to be a high school computer science teacher and i use p5 all the time uh for like introducing people to programming and i i do think that no matter what the software is for you it was this this music program i think p5 is obviously like a really incredible um tool to get people into into coding but yeah it's for me it's just like getting that foot in the door and then as soon as you can make your first project you can take it in any sort of direction that you want to where it's like okay i'm into music let me like dive deep into how audio works encoding or p5 is obviously very visual but yeah being able to do something that is so like output focused rather than just learning to code to learn how to code i think is is great and it's one of the reasons why i love um that g1 that you made this this creative coding class but i also think there's a huge value in people seeing that coding isn't just something like scary that you know runs your computer which it does but like it does but like you know for an example of like neopets it kind of like really um makes coding to something like just a tool to make a little website for your pet for example so it gives you that purpose and it gives you that visual feedback of what you're doing with code and then it like i think when you put programming in that context it becomes a lot easier to digest and a lot like more interesting i think immediately for some people i'm not going to generalize it and say that everyone would feel that way but i think it's just a different perspective of like you might want to make something practical super practical and want to dig deeper into like web programming and want to like learn about backend programming and all that kind of stuff but like if with creative coding it really is um not necessarily thinking about the end output but really like getting into that feeling of using coding to be more of a creative outlet totally cool should we move on from your pets you could talk about it all day yeah i kind of have like some slides about like the history of like processing and stuff um yeah so maybe we can um um give a little bit of a context cassie about like how we've been introducing creative coding and p5 basically in our first live series we talked we introduced p5 js is a javascript library right it's an open source javascript library that makes drawing with code really easy and actually one of the questions that we did get when we were talking about p5 for the first time was someone in the chat asked how is this relevant to processing what is the difference between processing and p5 and i did my attempt my best attempt at trying to answer that but i think you might have a lot more context about the history yeah i actually have like some really i like spent some time like looking at the history it's pretty fun um i like i think like i i just like in general and really interested about like you know how like just sort of seeing the evolution of technology and how that like impacts the sort of like things that people can make with with like computing or technology or whatever i'm sort of like how it's also entwined in like political things and stuff and stuff like that um but yeah so here i can like go go back to to slideland um so yeah like i think i think one one cool thing about what about processing is that i actually it comes from this like lab at the mit media lab called the aesthetics and computing lab and it was at the time and this was like in the late 90s early 2000s it was headed by this person named john mayda and um i don't know if he was specifically the person who like coined the term creative coding but definitely like was a person who uh he's still alive is a person he's very very much living um is a person who um i it was it was just like a figure in that way and just like advocating for creative coding and like using technology and like specifically using like code syntax as a medium for art not just like computers but like code syntax which i think is is really important when talking about processing in p5 because like one of the big parts of it is that you're writing code syntax it's not just like you're connecting there's no like graphical interface right it's like it's like teaching you to interact with computers in that way or that's just is the medium so anyway um i came it came out of this laboratory um from two people who were um doing phds there casey reese and ben frye who now are my colleagues at processing foundation um and they the the first release of processing was actually august 9 2001 the um the executive director of pressing foundation dorothy told me this recently and she was like processing is a leo which i loved um yeah and it um it like kind of consists of like three different things um which are like this language which you can see like on the right here it has the specific type of syntax where you see like this void setup and like void draw and like it has this whole scaffolding of um like what like this specific code syntax of what it looks like to like draw images that look that you can see on the left you can see that this was actually like the beta version that's something like early version of processing which is pretty fun um so right you have like the like syntax of the language you have like the environment that it's in and that's like what this code is sitting in and like what it what um the code renders to right it's all part of this application that you download and then it like makes it simple to write this code and you know all of this was driven at the time by like you used to have have to have like really specialized knowledge in order to like use computers to make this kind of art and like at the time that ben and casey were working on processing it was like cheaper it was like the type of graphics hardware and the type of computers that you needed were getting much more accessible so it was sort of like at this at this perfect time to be like what if we tried to make a language that made these tools and like an environment that made these tools really accessible and like the last part of the last like really like big piece of this besides the environment and the language is like the community and they started off um just like the processing forum you can actually see that it's called like discourse which i think is like a um which is funny since now there's like this um i actually don't know if discourse is open source um might not be but there's like a the forum tool is now called discourse right full circle yeah it's like a really full circle but um i'm curious about um if you go back to that like the previous slide um what is the relationship between processing and java because when i used to i also used to teach with with processing and i used to say like okay p5 is kind of this um javascript library um that you can add onto your to your normal javascript i always used to describe processing it's like processing is just java but with you know the setup function and the draw function and these like special little addons so is is processing its own unique language is it a like you know variant of java if for our viewers if you're watching this you'll see that you know the the things that stick out to this as being java like are the like square brackets to indicate an array um so yeah i guess i guess what's the relationship to java for processing yeah it's actually like processing is actually also like a library like it's a library for java um but i think what makes it like feel really different from p5 is that like it's not like the typical like environment that you would write java in they're all these different tools like one of the big ones is called um eclipse that people the environment that folks will write java in and um you know and the the reason is that like java i think in general is just like a more difficult um tool to use just because like the the way that you have to like connect all the libraries together and stuff and so like what this environment was created to do was to make that easier right is so that like you wouldn't have to be an expert about um you know how to like compile java code and like right when you're writing java code there's like a separate step of like translating this um this code into like the machine code like to the zeros and ones that like your computer can understand whereas like in javascript it like it like literally works differently where it like reads each singular line of code and like translates it to like the like zeros and ones like in real time so like because it has this like extra step of like compiling it all together you have to like pull in all these it like makes it harder to use right even getting that window with all the graphic stuff inside would be difficult to do if you were to do it from scratch using java so this was really like a hit i'd say when you could just download like a little software and you didn't have to worry about building your application application or anything you can just solely focus on creating visual things inside of it yeah i mean this is like incredible i mean like in 2001 2002 that you could like download this app and like make java and like at the time you could um you could run java in the browser you could make like java applets which now i think are um at this point are basically defunct um and no no one uses them anymore but it's kind of like the similar similar thing where it's like you could write code that like you could share in the same way and that that is so powerful um so yeah i think i think what also really like held the held the like processing together like was the community and having this space and i think um you know one of the one of the like main um sort of the canonical processing things that i always think about is like the the like one post on the board that's about like introducing yourself and like who you are um man i wish i had it i feel like dan schiffman um the creator of codingtrain has a really good email that he sent like when he like introduced himself to the processing community that's just like i live in new york with my like two cats and like it's something like that's really sweet [Laughter] it should be like a perma pinned on community processing no it's really it's really sweet um yeah and so like you know this community like stayed really strong and i i think um you know at this time a lot of the folks who were who were like using processing were um kind of like tied to the academic world and that's you know like uh like casey is like a professor at um ucla and had sort of like been able to keep like keep processing afloat like via all these like academic spaces and um you know so you know processing existed sort of had like a cult i mean i would call it like a cult following is really really like the way to put it um and then like this tool called processing.js came out and this is actually um not created by anyone at processing foundation though this time the foundation didn't exist but actually just someone named john resig took processing and basically just like translated the whole whole thing to javascript and you know this was in 2008 was the first release and you know it sort of marks a time when like folks were moving from java to to javascript is becoming a more and more popular language and um you know now it's like javascript is like the the most you know or it like literally is the most popular programming language um and uh yeah but this is this was this was created and maintained by someone not at um processing donation and um you know it's sort of it sort of marks like a clear denomination of like oh like folks are starting to move towards towards javascript and then in 2012 the foundation was created and i think that really the idea here was like there had been so much you know like uh like really what was like holding processing together was like academic support and like the foundation was a way to be able to expand that like having a nonprofit entity that could then like fundraise and then be able to like pay people to like create um create new things and that's that's how um p5 came about is that like lauren lee mccarthy got um had a fellowship project in 2013 to like reimagine um processing for the web and you know this is different from processing.js because like uh here yes this this i think describes it where um you know it says however this is a description on the p5 website about what p5 is but it says however you're not limited to your drawing canvas you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch including html html5 objects for text input video webcam and sound and so um the reason this is important is right if you look back at um processing you were you were like kind of tied to this like 2d canvas and the browser gives you like so many things beyond that and p5 is really about like reimagining what it could be like in in the context of a browser thus this project and so this project was started by lauren in beginning of 2013 and you can think of like p5 js like just the library itself as you know if you look at the like language environment community part of this like the language you know there's also the community here but just just like the library itself is the language here right um and then you know as that is that uh you know that's where this project started to gain traction in 2015 there was a contributors conference and i marked this as something important because i think it it denotes a sort of like coming together of like a solid vision of what p5 is and one of the things that came out of this contributors conference um is this community statement which talks about like what p5 like what the community is right and it's not just about like folks gathering together on a forum it's about like creating a space for people and like i um you know i often think about this statement and often just like read it to like remember um the kind of space that's being created and like i kind of want to like go this picture for a moment because like when you know i think that a lot of folks have sort of like stereotypical ideas about like what it means to like work on technology and like who it's for and like some of these are enforced by like representation and like seeing and sort of like negative or just experiences in technology of it being like a group of like cis white men like working on like technology and making like cool stuff and like coming back to the community statement and like creating a space that um is about inclusion and like making people feel welcome um and just like yeah i might just i'm going to read this yeah so p5 is a community interested in exploring the creation of art and design with technology uh we are a community of and in solidarity with people from every gender identity and expression sexual orientation race ethnicity language neurotype size ability class religion culture subculture political opinion age skill level occupation background we acknowledge that not everyone has the time financial means or capacity to actively participate but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds we facilitate and foster access and empowerment we're all learners and like you know me sort of like coming upon p5 i had like never read anything like this from a technology um space uh and i just really wanted to be part of this like who wouldn't want to be part of this sounds fun and like nice sounds like everyone's going to be nice to me it does it does do you feel like this has changed in the in the past five years you feel like more sub subsets of technology have like adopted you know missions or community statements like this or do you feel like p5 and creative coding at large are still pretty unique and like really making that a forefront of what you're doing i think that both of these things are true i think i still have yet to like really know about another community that puts like like inclusion and access and being beginner friendly like as the as like the most important thing um and i think that there are lots of spaces that are are really making an effort to um to like have a commitment to like making making a community that feels like uplifting and nourishing and welcoming and like full of care i have a maybe a little question um i wonder if this like openness of the community spirit i'd say um the p5.js has has anything to do with like how the tool itself is open source and so a little bit said going into that maybe we could also talk about what does that even mean what does open source even mean and how does that impact the kind of people that join the community as well totally yeah i definitely have like i kind of like have some slides about that [Laughter] i got you but yeah i want to talk about first like i think like one of the other really powerful things about p5 is like this concept of a contributor and i think that um again like lots of folks folks uh see contributing to code as like oh we're just contributing to a code library is like just writing code and i think one of the things that um lauren has has really developed is like this idea of contributing as something like more than just writing code you know like teaching documentation making art activism bug reporting outreach curating organizing it's so many different things and like these are all these are all different things that are part of the p5 community and like all of this work is important um and vital to this this project like staying alive and you know that is true for all open source libraries but i think especially um or i don't i don't even think it's like especially p5 but i appreciate that there is an emphasis and sort of like a a willingness to view contrib contribution to to a project as as this and um i'll talk a little bit more about like what like kind of like how open source functions but just to sort of like tie the loop of like my work on this and so like you know we had like i've like talked about like p5 as a language and p5 as a community and so sort of the missing piece of p5 was the environment right and so for a while there was a desktop editor for p5 um that originally was created by a person named sam levine and um this kind of became difficult to maintain like whenever you create like this was like an application that you could download and so it's it's difficult to maintain an application that you can download because it has to run on different operating systems like windows and mac and linux and also there are difficulties with um if you have it on like a school computer it's sometimes difficult to download software um and so it just like was um it just wasn't working for the to uphold the idea the like ideals of p5 of like making this tool accessible and so then in may 2016 i started making the web editor that was my my first commit which i think in the beginning looked something like this i don't know this had to be like the really early version because i think you couldn't even like log in or log out this must be like you know like august 2016 in july august 2016 i'm so curious how did you even start was it was it you completely by yourself were you like working with other people from the community like how did you even uh start this project cause it's obviously grown into this yeah we'll show off yeah uh well so it started through like the foundation fellowships i like applied for a fellowship that i didn't get but then i just had been in in contact with with dan and was like you know i just like really want to be involved in open source i think i had um i was like in a place where i felt really like frustrated with with tech communities because like i really wanted to be in a space that like uphol upheld things like this i felt like i was this person who was like asking all these questions and like everyone was like don't think about that and i was like no like i wanna i wanna be talking about this and thinking about this so um i was like in contact with dan and then you know he and lauren reached out to me and were like you know we have some funding from um nyu itp to um work on this tool like would you would you want to like work on it and it was it was like really exciting for me like i had never contributed to open source before and um was like had been working as a web developer for like a couple years and like still pretty new to me and i was like yeah sure i'll do it i don't really know what i'm getting myself into but i mean i mean i think that that underscores like the importance of community where the reason that or like one of the ways that you got really into the space was knowing other people from the community and so whether that's p5 and creative coding or other communities that people might be interested in the tech space just yet getting to know folks in the community can help you um totally yeah totally and and there's like so many spaces like online to do that just like get to know you know p5 people um and now the editor kind of looks something like this maybe the ui is more like refined whatever has more has more features um but yeah and you know now i've been like working on this for a few years and um it just like my like my my role is to just like keep keep it going and i think like uphold the values of like access defined as like accessibility and inclusion and like making making a tool that um can reach can reach people and like you can you know have the same environment that really feels you know i like to me it feels important to like leave leave the like remnants of processing in like this play button and like what like what is what is like processing or p5 without the play button the giant play button yeah and that color too yeah and the pink yeah i mean i think i think that um yeah it's like a friendly it's like a friendly color and i think that was a very very conscious choice of lauren but um i think one oh and then also like there's another contributors conference in in 2019 and again like i think i think one of the things that that came out of this was really um centering adding features to 2p5 that are that are really based around like increasing access over like making a new like something that's like more optimized or like or like flashy or awesome um yeah and that's that's something that's really important to me and then i kind of have like some slides about how like open source works which is fun but yeah enough sure do we want to go into that do we want to stop and ask i don't know if you have any specific questions here if you want it's also time for uh if you're in the chat if you're in the youtube chat right now and you have questions for cassie um i think kind of the the plan for the rest of the session is to talk about open source in general we want to show off the p5 web editor because you want i think you're um uh you're going to be using it for the rest of the series hopefully introducing people to that but yeah any uh any questions from chat um that would be a good time i guess um or do you want if you have anything i'm eager to talk more about open source let's do it um i kind of have more like word slides i couldn't really find any like a lot of good images but um i think it's okay so like i like i i feel like i learned a lot about sort of like licensing and like how that kind of stuff fairly recently like within the last last year i never really like thought about it too much of the last like couple years um so like processing and p5 are it's you usually you use this abbreviation called floss which is like free slash libre open source software and the the reason that it's like free slash libre is because free does not mean free of cost it means like just it means it like implies like a freedom and so like what the what these tools what these things mean is right so like open source software is a type of computer software in which the source code right like the the like text that you're writing is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants the users the rights to use study change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose and the reason like you need a license is because when you write software it's actually protected under like um intellectual property law like it's it's something that you write and so if you don't have a license it's actually not it's protected by like the ip law so it would be um so like you can't actually like use that code and then repurpose it you need to actually give it a license in order to make in order to be able to um edit edit that source code so these types of licenses started coming up where um you could you could like attach this license to your source code and then folks could like remix that and like make their own versions and yeah i never knew that so without the license that's not in fact open source and you couldn't be able to have somebody else out of it or no interesting i never knew that yeah so like even this is true of of um code on github actually like if there is no license on your repository like technically it's like not open source uh that's just like a yeah just like the fun world of like intellectual property law i think i feel like this could be like a whole session on its own because there's so many much new ones into it and you know like there's different levels of how much freedom you can give people who use it as well but yeah exactly like there's different types of licenses i think one of the really um important ones is like this concept of like copy left which basically there were like certain types of licenses where you could like take the source code and like make your own copy of it and then make it like private again and what copy left does it makes it so like you can't then like change that license so it's like the code is private and that's sort of like an like enforcing of it being it being public um so that that was like a really important license that that came out um and then like there's also this concept of like free software and um this these are this comes from like the free software foundation and the term free software has like four essential freedoms which are to run the program to study and change the program in source code form to redistribute exact copies and to distribute modified versions and so this is about like how how you use the software and these are the things that make you know the abbreviation floss or whatever um and just you know there's just terms but and so and so you're saying something like p5 is both open source software and also free software yes exactly um and this is important and on purpose and i think um i have this quote from casey or this is pulled from a like a blog post he wrote about processing and why why it was floss and um i'm gonna read this this whole thing because i think i think it like really describes it well but um this is like from his his perspective talking about processing he says we believe visual artists and designers should be in control of their own software tools it's not enough to rely on corporations to make what we need the code and systems that we use shape our work um yeah i really like that i mean just just this so far like this this concept of being in control of the tools you use like if you think about you know getting a license from adobe or you know getting a license from um i don't know the company that makes maya but they're very expensive and like at any time the companies could like choose to shut down these tools and here is like showing a real dedication to being like we need to be in control of the tools that we make and shape them right so here when we release proprietary when companies release proprietary platforms and we use them we don't have the freedoms to modify and expand them as makers we feel it's essential to have have tools that we create ourselves tools that are shaped by the needs and desires of the communities and creators that use them and so open source is a way that allows folks to like have control of their tools and the community um and and that's that's really powerful this is a question that you might not not know the answer to i think alex froze a little bit we'll wait wait until he comes back [Laughter] hello yeah he's back froze for a moment so if he asked a question we don't know what it is it said my internet is on this table so hopefully i don't drop out again um cassie do you know of other communities in the tech space that are similarly like open source minded like have similar values like this or again is this something that seems pretty unique or pretty um yeah pretty unique to like creative coding i think blender is has a big open source community blender is maybe one of the most similar because i feel like blender just like has such a big community because i was just like thinking of like what are other tools that that feel that sort of have these these like three things the like language environment community and i feel like yeah i feel like blender blender is really rad tool for those of you who don't know what blender is just to really quickly say it it's an open source software they can do 3d environment creation in i think that's like a really small little thing that you can do with blender but basically um i think that their goal essentially is it aims you to go all the way from like creating your 3d um you know assets all the way into like reading like a whole scene and movie with your 3d um 3d what are they called product models models yeah products animations it's yeah it's a really cool tool um yeah oh man i forgot to say one really important thing about processing and p5 is like one of the other like core values it's like the low what's called like low floor high ceiling and that like it's it's like you know tried to be like a low low barrier to entry but also um i think because it uses code syntax and it allows there are lots of folks who who write like addon libraries and i think really really tied into this statement here of like you know the community being in control of the tool like you can make an addon library and be like oh like p5 doesn't have this thing i wanna i wanna make like a text editing like a text manipulation library or like you know processing doesn't have this thing i'm i'm gonna work on it um and that's really powerful and that like you know if somehow p5 changes and your library breaks like you have a say in that process versus like you know if you wrote like an addon for photoshop or something and like that changed it would just kind of be like you know and this i think an example of this happening is um like a lot of folks have made like like art twitter bots and like the sort of over the past few years the api for like using twitter has really changed and caused like cost a lot of um like art to just like perish i do want to make sure that we have some time to demo the web editor too yeah okay i'm going to go through the recipes real quick but i think another thing i want to talk about is just sort of like some of the pitfalls of open source um and just like some of the things i'm thinking about and so there's a survey in in 2017 from github about open source software and they found that the gender imbalance in open source software remains profound 95 for in the survey 95 of respondents for men just three percent for women and one percent are nonbinary and like why is this you know i think i think there's lots of um not only gender disparity in in the tech world but it's it's like especially uh bad or especially uh prominent prominent yeah in in open source and like why is that and you know one of one of the reasons is that like there's sort of this this um implicit narrative of like unpaid labor in open source and if you think about like who has the time and like who has the privilege of like you know free time in order to work on open source it's like going to be predominantly people who are in a position of privilege and so this is this is pulled from a blog post called the ethics of unpaid labor in the open source software community and um just like pulls from some tweets where it says whether free time activities are called worker play the existence of free time to do them is a privilege and so when you when you have when you have a space that relies on free labor in order to do work it's going it's only going to be you know it's going to like perpetuate sort of like um structural inequalities and so um here's a tweet that lauren asked for she said how do you how do you make a volunteer based open source project sustainable is this even projectable or is this even possible i really need some help figuring this out and this is something that i think about a lot and you know have talked to talk to lauren about is like how do we make these projects sustainable we're like we're releasing the software free of cost and like you know lots of folks are using these tools for free and you know that that i think is one of the reasons for having like the foundation um but also just like a a real dedication to paying people for their work but they're also different types of giving people value for their contributions but i want to read this quote from lauren where she says um for me sustainability means not just preserving the sanity of the people in charge but also extending the opportunity to work on it to people who would love to be a part of the project if we could provide them a means of access um and so yeah i think to me to me this means like reaching out to people who are not represented or people who don't feel welcome and like giving them what they need whether it's like you know money or care or support or whatever whatever they need in order to support them um and i also like you know just to like sort of wrap wrap this up and then go go to the web editor like i was talking to someone about this project i don't know when it was like working the p5 web editor and they were like i was like talking about how i was still working on it and they were like well it works so like what like what else is there to do a lot so they meant it they meant it like really really genuinely it was it wasn't like a um like they were trying to be a backhanded compliment no no no it was like not intended to be like patronizing at all they meant it like totally genuinely and it sort of like made me think about the invisible work that goes into these projects you know whether it's like managing all the issues that come up on github or like you know for example this is some screenshot i took of like they're currently like over four million sketches on the web editor so it's like managing a huge amount of data and then also just like thinking about how to make these projects sustainable and creating a structure in place so like lauren made an open call for a new p5 lead to sort of like replace her and like be a new steward for the project and so that's something i'm thinking about all the time but now let's talk about the web editor now that we know about open source um cassie before we before we go there i uh could you give a plug of like if people are watching this and feels like everything that you've said that really resonates with them like how do they get involved i feel like something that i feel a lot of the time is feeling intimidated by entering these communities feeling impostor syndrome all that kind of stuff so if somebody wants to get involved specifically in p5 and processing um what's the best way to do that yeah i mean what i would say i'm gonna share go to like a like a browser window i mean i think a great if you're like i don't know anything i mean obviously it would be like you know learning p5 from like the code academy it's a nice vlog it's great but also like our course is also free yeah that's true which is nice yeah but also like dan's youtube channel is i think a really accessible place um there's the five days or you know i think um like here here there's like a forum that you can ask questions on um and like yeah if you want to get help um yeah i think like also just looking on twitter and kind of like seeing what other people are up to um there's oh there's also um gotta move things around processing foundation there's also like a processing community day that happens um i think that's under uh yeah there's gonna be one this year like i think an official one in the summer but um yeah i think yeah and and we can put like all those links in the youtube description or if you want to i wonder if putting this kind of stuff in the codecademy course might be it might be helpful but yeah i think just like uh for me i would struggle to do this and i think i even do struggle with this where i don't really participate in as many open source products as i want to or like p5 i i love and i'm a huge advocate of but have like never interacted in the community so i think just encouraging folks to like take that first step and get involved in the community if this is something that speaks to you um just that for example is like probably the hardest part yeah and i mean i think getting involved is like as simple as using the tool you know like by using it like you're you're supporting you know like you're you're just like another person who can like then share your experience about like what it's like to learn this tool and like how to make it better and for better for me is like maybe more accessible and like more more stable and i think like that is really one of the the big parts of creating the web editor is um making it making it accessible right and one of one of like the cool things about the webinar is like basically you have this setup where you have like code on the left and like a preview on the right and then when you open it you get like a a sort of like generic gray square which is not that exciting but if you're like oh let me look at some other code you can go to the examples and i think i wanted this one yeah you can sort of like look at the other code that folks have made oh no that's not the one i wanted um oh no sorry examples examples um video um i think video pixels yeah you can sort of like see what it looks like so here's an example of one that is like pixelating a video and i can be like oh cool this this is fun but then if i'm like you know i want this to be um rather than it be this fingers one i want it to be like a webcam of me i can just easily like comment this out right and then make this rather than it being this video i can be like create capture video i think i have to do fingers dot size um 640 oh wait yeah 320 240. right and then now i have this webcam that's like me right and so i can like right and then from here i could be like oh rather than all these dots being black i want them to be um where it could be um how would i do this darkness darkness but this is but the color i think is just being default black yeah why is this oh times darkness oh i could just do like fill 255. we can make it like red let's see if that works yeah right and so then i could start like playing around with this and like have my own version of this and i don't need to like download anything you know for so many coding languages it's like okay download a text editor then like add this library as a dependency or whatever and you're like what are these words um yeah and i think like all of the stuff of like getting p5 loaded into your sketch is really hidden and you know like once you make an account on the web editor then like all your work is saved so if i like save this now like now this is part of my account and then if i go to like my sketches i have like you know whatever [Laughter] yeah um and you can also you can you can like manipulate videos and images in here and so here i can um upload files to like images and stuff um i can also and the other cool thing is like i can share my work so let's say i was like i think this is great you know i can then like have this version that's just like this in frame or um the embed is really cool it looks like so you can embed that in your website if you have it or yeah um i think this is the one that just doesn't even have the bar like yeah can it's great for sharing um what else is really useful and then i guess you know the other you know there's like keyboard shortcuts you also can link there's a link to like the reference if you want to learn um get familiar with the p5 library itself um and then also like want to link to the um like report a bug and like the github repository because like one thing that you can do as a person you know contributing to p5 is to like report bugs and if like you notice that something is wrong like you can just be like hey i feel like this like this website isn't working as i think it should and like no one here is going to be like um you know and like maybe it is a bug or maybe it's you're not doing something right but like no one here is going to be like wow i can't believe you couldn't figure that out like it's like um you know i mean first of all it's going to be like me you're responding and i'm just gonna be here to like be be friendly and support support you but this is a really big way that you can contribute it's just by reporting bugs or just like putting ideas on here of things you would want to see and you know for example like and one thing that you could contribute is like there have been some folks who have been doing translations and so now it's in spanish and japanese and hindi so like the canal experience a lot better in hindi which is really cool um and that's the thing you can contribute yeah i think that's a really big thing though it really opens up this like not only just p5 web editor but like programming visual things in general to a wider community than people just speak english yeah yeah that example tab is amazing i want to go look at some of those other uh other example things and play around with it yeah and like all of them are pulled from like the website like the t5 website but it's just here you can just quickly be like oh i actually want to change something and see how it looks and and that i think is the biggest that is like the fundamental way to learn how to do coding i think is to just take what other people have done and be like how can i change this and make this different like what does changing this number do you know that's the biggest thing i think it also like the thing that i really like u5 web editor for is that not only can you share the code that you've written for someone else but also if you open the file tabs you see that it is still a web page that it is it has an index.html it has um sketch.js so it doesn't hide the fact that it is just like a little blank space but it shows you all the files that goes into creating that window in the preview yeah and like i think this is something that's like a little bit different from like other code editors like codepen i mean definitely on on glitch you can do this but to me to me like upholding this idea of like low floor high ceiling was like in the end i want to be able to like just download this sketch as a website like i could just download this and then i have a zip file that's like all of these files together and um then i could literally just take that and like put it on whatever hosting platform i want like if you could use um because it's all front end you can put it on github pages or whatever whatever you use neocities [Laughter] yeah i love i love neocities um yeah so yeah to me it's really important that like you can kind of see and really uphold that ideal of like when you're writing p5 or processing like you're writing code syntax yeah and like understanding that i think this is a great way to like if you if there's um people watching who are going through the learn p5.js course if you want to like really go deep down into um you know the creative coding and p5.js in general this is a great way to take your projects off of our codecapping platform and move your code into the v5 web editor so you can keep track of the different versions of the sketches that you are building you can you know even load your own sketch and then make a different version of that and try out different things with us you know same fundamental code but maybe doing different styles and things kind of things like that to it so i like i said i think did i mention this i forget but um from next live streaming series we're going to be using the p5 web editor to um work on so that you know what during the during our live series we'll start um programming from scratch on these on like a blank um the 5.js sketch on the web editor and then after the live stream we'll add the link to the web editor into the description of the youtube video so you guys can take that code and then remix it even further and make it your own if you want do you want what project are you working on next week next week we're going to be looking at what we call the um genitive art creator so we have these like little visualizations that you can trigger with a mouse press and then you can create your own little um generative art drawing and you can also click on the canvas and download that as an image file that you can use anywhere you want and we're going to build that on the web editor cool it's awesome cassie anything else you want to say or plug or tell people to check out or anything at all i guess the only other thing i want to plug is that there's currently a fellowship application open for the foundation it closes uh however long april but i wanna i wanna emphasize that like you don't need to be a coder in order to apply and it's open to any type of any type of work it's really just about being being part of it's just like an opportunity to get some money to be part of the community so if you're maybe like you are familiar with p5 but um you know wanting to get involved more this is a great way you're familiar with coding and not familiar with p5 it's a great way and this is how you got started right this is like similar to the fellowship yeah kind of i mean this is like how i got started yeah it's cool thank you so much cassie for being here with us today yeah thank you for having me so much fun cool okay well um yeah with that i guess we will be back uh next week for another another project that jivon's gonna walk through um yeah thanks so much cassie thank you talk to you all later thank you bye
