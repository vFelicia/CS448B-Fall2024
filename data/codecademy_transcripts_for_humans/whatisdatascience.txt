00:00 - hi i'm sophie i'm a curriculum developer
00:02 - at codecademy
00:03 - my specific job relates to data science
00:06 - curriculum
00:07 - so i'm trying to find what skills
00:10 - different industries require
00:12 - so that people can come to codecademy
00:14 - and
00:15 - learn the skills that they need i
00:18 - see data science kind of like the
00:20 - intersection between
00:22 - statistics and computer science
00:25 - people have been working with data and
00:26 - trying to learn from data for a really
00:28 - long time
00:29 - and there's a lot of different methods
00:31 - that people use to try to understand
00:33 - data
00:34 - and use it for different purposes like
00:37 - predicting something or understanding
00:40 - trends
00:41 - in over time or even just like
00:45 - visualizing a relationship between two
00:48 - things
00:49 - and as computers have become more
00:52 - powerful
00:53 - and as people have thought a little bit
00:55 - more about
00:56 - how different algorithms can be used to
01:00 - try to solve
01:01 - really hard problems that has kind of
01:04 - blossomed into this new field of data
01:06 - science which
01:07 - requires a little bit of statistics
01:09 - skills a little bit of computer science
01:11 - skills
01:12 - and a lot of other things kind of mixed
01:14 - in there
01:16 - there's a lot of different jobs within
01:18 - data science and
01:19 - of all the people that i know with
01:21 - positions
01:22 - called data science i think they're all
01:25 - doing very
01:26 - different things some jobs in data
01:28 - science i think are
01:29 - a lot about trying to understand
01:32 - consumers so like
01:33 - understand what types of people are
01:35 - using a product
01:36 - i know a lot of companies are doing kind
01:38 - of a b tests
01:40 - constantly trying to understand is this
01:42 - version of their website
01:43 - attracting more people than this other
01:45 - version
01:47 - sometimes data scientists are really
01:50 - working on
01:51 - prediction problems or understanding
01:54 - data that's coming in
01:56 - in order to address some problem like
01:59 - trying to predict whether people are
02:00 - cheating on an online test
02:02 - it kind of depends i think on the
02:05 - company that you work for
02:06 - the sector that you're in and then what
02:09 - your job function is within that company
02:11 - or what team you're working on
02:12 - and then also the age of the company
02:16 - the tools that people use change really
02:19 - quickly
02:20 - but right now i would say a lot of
02:23 - companies that i've seen are using
02:25 - python just because it's a
02:27 - general purpose language so it gets used
02:29 - for other things and so because there
02:31 - are really good libraries
02:32 - in python for doing a lot of data
02:35 - science
02:36 - things people have just kind of
02:39 - decided to use python since they're
02:41 - using it for other things as well
02:45 - i think the second most common language
02:47 - is probably
02:48 - r r was a programming language that was
02:50 - specifically designed for
02:52 - statistical computing and data science
02:55 - so
02:56 - a lot of things are easier
02:59 - to do and are and python requires
03:03 - additional libraries or additional tools
03:05 - to be loaded
03:07 - in order to do the same things
03:08 - personally i think the most important
03:10 - thing
03:11 - is to understand the
03:14 - theory behind what you're doing because
03:17 - if you kind of understand the idea
03:19 - of what you want to do then you can
03:21 - learn different tools
03:24 - data is everywhere like there are so
03:27 - many different ways that
03:31 - we create data every single day without
03:34 - realizing it
03:35 - by being on our phones by walking around
03:38 - town or
03:40 - by you know sending emails whatever
03:42 - we're doing
03:43 - and there are so many interesting
03:45 - questions out there
03:47 - so to have the power to like figure out
03:50 - how to collect the data that you need to
03:51 - answer the questions you want to answer
03:53 - is really really powerful when i got to
03:56 - the point where
03:57 - i could just like have a thought in my
03:59 - head in the middle of the night of like
04:01 - i wonder
04:02 - if there's a relationship between these
04:04 - two things and then just like
04:06 - had the skills to go online and try to
04:08 - answer my own
04:09 - question um that that was a really great
04:12 - moment
