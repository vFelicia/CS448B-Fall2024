00:00 - everyone my name is elisa and i'm a
00:01 - community manager with codecademy
00:03 - today's quick tip video is about
00:05 - communicating the purpose of your meetup
00:07 - rather than just the category
00:10 - of the get-together that it is um
00:13 - this is a more theoretical and less
00:15 - practical quick tip than i would usually
00:17 - share
00:18 - but it's still quick and very applicable
00:22 - and once i learned about it from
00:24 - actually this
00:25 - amazing book here i knew that
00:28 - it would make all of your meetup
00:30 - organizing lives better
00:31 - also so i had to share it um so
00:34 - what's this quick tip about a category
00:38 - of a gathering example as being like a
00:40 - wedding or a funeral or a coding meetup
00:43 - is not the same as the purpose
00:46 - of a gathering so like what's that mean
00:50 - i'm going to go example by example to
00:52 - share
00:53 - what that means and how this is going to
00:55 - help you be a better community organizer
00:58 - a wedding for example is a type of
01:01 - gathering
01:02 - but the purpose of the wedding could be
01:05 - to celebrate the love of two people who
01:07 - are starting their lives together
01:09 - or to celebrate to established families
01:11 - who are now blending together
01:14 - but the purpose is to celebrate love and
01:16 - that
01:17 - sets a tone for the type of event
01:21 - that we're going to have a funeral
01:25 - one of the other examples is a type of
01:27 - gathering
01:28 - but the purpose can be completely
01:30 - different depending
01:32 - on a few factors a funeral can be a time
01:35 - to support a family in a time of grief
01:37 - absolutely or if the recently deceased
01:40 - happens to have lived a really good life
01:44 - save some money and have a sense of
01:45 - humor that funeral
01:47 - would be a reason to have a really big
01:49 - party and to celebrate
01:50 - that life those different purposes don't
01:54 - fit the category per se
01:58 - so finally to land this example one last
02:00 - time
02:01 - a coding meetup a meetup is a category
02:05 - usually it's going to be about
02:07 - networking when you end up in a
02:09 - networking
02:10 - event you uh you sort of become robotic
02:13 - and you
02:13 - figure okay well i'm here to meet people
02:15 - so i'm going to hand out
02:17 - business cards but what is the purpose
02:21 - of
02:22 - meet up that's what you as a chapter
02:25 - leader get to decide so
02:27 - some examples of really great purposes
02:29 - that i've come across already and having
02:30 - conversations with you are like to
02:32 - give a safe place to practice
02:36 - uh a judgment-free song if you will to
02:38 - give a space
02:39 - for sharing ideas about technology
02:43 - um some have been really about the who
02:45 - we are
02:46 - this is a safe place for women and
02:49 - non-gender conforming people
02:51 - in tech that is excellent because
02:54 - we now know that the purpose is about
02:57 - this sort of
02:59 - safety that we are creating
03:02 - for those types there's still tons more
03:04 - purposes that you could
03:05 - choose out there but for what i've just
03:07 - stated the purpose is
03:09 - about creating a safe space judgment
03:12 - free
03:13 - everybody belongs here so
03:17 - as i said before a purpose can really
03:19 - help glue your attendees together
03:21 - because when we all know why we're here
03:23 - we actually want
03:24 - to be here versus like oh man i need to
03:28 - go to a
03:29 - birthday party for a three-year-old
03:32 - we're gonna be there and watch them eat
03:34 - cake or it just becomes formulaic and
03:36 - people fall
03:38 - into uh into a routine that has us
03:41 - playing a part
03:42 - rather than being ourselves and when we
03:45 - are playing
03:46 - a part not being ourselves it's
03:47 - difficult to connect so knowing a
03:49 - purpose gives us something to share
03:51 - with fellow attendees that gives us a
03:53 - reason to connect and
03:55 - i can't think of anything better than
03:57 - that so
03:58 - this has been your quick tip um i got
04:01 - the idea from this book again
04:03 - it's the art of gathering by priya
04:05 - parker
04:06 - she's a genius on gatherings in general
04:10 - and i hope that this little tidbit has
04:13 - been helpful
04:14 - for you have a great night
