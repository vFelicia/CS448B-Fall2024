00:00 - hi i'm xavier i'm an engineer at
00:02 - codecademy
00:03 - and i work on the conversion team the
00:06 - conversion team's mission
00:07 - is to improve the user experience when
00:10 - learners visit the site for the first
00:12 - time
00:14 - i'd say there's a common misconception
00:16 - that
00:17 - you maybe look at code or work or write
00:19 - code
00:20 - all day long but in reality there's
00:22 - there's a lot going on
00:24 - you are reviewing other people's code
00:27 - you're meeting with other people to talk
00:30 - about how to do things
00:32 - you're researching a lot and you're
00:35 - relying on a lot of people to do your
00:37 - job
00:37 - it's not just you coding by yourself but
00:41 - a designer a product manager
00:44 - a data scientist all of you work
00:47 - together to build something
00:49 - for for the user for the company
00:54 - yeah i don't think there are a lot of
00:56 - practical differences between a
00:58 - web developer or a software engineer or
01:00 - a programmer
01:02 - i've worked in places that use the title
01:04 - web developer
01:05 - some other places use front end engineer
01:07 - others use ui
01:08 - engineer or software engineer
01:12 - and i did the same thing at all those
01:14 - places
01:15 - at the end of the day we're all trying
01:18 - to
01:19 - solve business problems with code
01:24 - by writing code you're you're actually
01:26 - solving real problems in the world it's
01:28 - it's hard to see when you're in the code
01:32 - you're just you're kind of having fun as
01:35 - you write the code
01:36 - but as soon as you're done you're
01:39 - putting that code
01:40 - out there and you are solving a very
01:44 - complicated business problem
01:46 - for millions of people and
01:49 - another thing that i like about software
01:52 - is that
01:53 - there's a lot of demand for it so i can
01:56 - support myself
01:57 - and my family for years to come based on
02:00 - the skills that i've learned
02:02 - and that's that's a very important part
02:05 - of what we do this it's not just the
02:07 - flow state it's not just
02:09 - how you improve the world but also how
02:11 - you improve yourself and
02:13 - the people around you um so when you
02:15 - combine the three
02:16 - that that's that's how you know you have
02:18 - a good job
