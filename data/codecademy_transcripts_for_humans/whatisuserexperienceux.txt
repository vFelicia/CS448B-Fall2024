00:00 - hello my name is Stephanie I am a
00:02 - software developer based in Baltimore
00:04 - and today we're gonna go over what is
00:06 - user experience or more commonly known
00:08 - as UX UX is the part of design that is
00:13 - created to be meaningful and intuitive
00:15 - for users it adopts the users
00:17 - perspective and aims to answer the
00:18 - question how would a first time user
00:20 - approach this product it encompasses the
00:23 - part of the design from the search icon
00:25 - down to the animations that occur when a
00:27 - user makes a click there are many
00:29 - components to UX that will inform the
00:31 - design to enhance the users experience
00:34 - this is the user experience honeycomb
00:36 - developed by Peter morville Jesus UX
00:39 - hotshot and it pretty much lays down the
00:42 - foundation for good UX the honeycomb he
00:44 - developed identifies how each facet is
00:47 - important to answering the users needs
00:49 - given the product's technical
00:51 - limitations and capabilities while also
00:54 - driving business value it helps outline
00:56 - and build priorities for example in the
00:59 - first iteration should the product
01:01 - prioritize usefulness over usability
01:04 - have you ever used an application for
01:06 - the first time and you were able to
01:07 - navigate it without a guide
01:09 - you can thank good UX for that it can
01:12 - happen even when you don't even notice
01:13 - it it even starts as soon as you land on
01:15 - a website today a lot of websites have
01:18 - designed their loaders to be more user
01:20 - friendly so that the user feels engaged
01:22 - while the page is loading instead of
01:24 - feeling like they're wasting their time
01:25 - have you ever used something and thought
01:27 - why isn't it working
01:29 - and then for the next five minutes you
01:31 - get exponentially more and more
01:32 - frustrated as you wrestle with the
01:34 - application yeah that's probably bad UX
01:38 - it can overload the user with
01:39 - information as a result the user feels
01:42 - overwhelmed and skims over the
01:44 - information they're looking for
01:46 - bad UX can be particularly dangerous
01:49 - when it sends a confusing signal to the
01:51 - user and so the user ends up performing
01:54 - a permanent action they didn't want to
01:55 - perform one common misconception is to
01:59 - equate good visuals to good UX well it
02:03 - can be true that if you have a pretty
02:05 - design it can cover up some of the
02:07 - applications shortcomings but that
02:09 - doesn't necessarily mean that the user
02:11 - will walk away getting the MOE
02:12 - value out of the product like in the
02:15 - example menu here it is unique and
02:18 - pretty to see but it can be a bit
02:20 - confusing to others are the only options
02:22 - available what you see on the menu or
02:24 - are there more on the other half and how
02:27 - would you get to the other side do you
02:28 - have to swipe horizontally or in a
02:31 - curved pattern so there are a lot of
02:33 - questions that can't be immediately
02:35 - answered until the user experiments
02:36 - around so now you might be thinking okay
02:39 - if someone can pick this up instantly
02:41 - and know how to use it then we've got
02:43 - good UX but a particular design choice
02:46 - might not work in every case take these
02:49 - two types of menus you could argue that
02:51 - the hamburger menu is a better choice
02:53 - because it simplifies what the user sees
02:55 - but there are times when you can
02:57 - oversimplified the design and forcing
03:00 - the user to make more than one click can
03:02 - disincentivize them from using the menu
03:04 - actually there are many apps out there
03:06 - that initially employ the hamburger menu
03:08 - and then switch to the visible
03:09 - navigation believe it or not but their
03:12 - users ended up using the navigation
03:14 - feature when it was visible instead of
03:16 - hamburger style a large part of UX is
03:20 - knowing and understanding your users so
03:22 - in order to get good UX you're gonna
03:25 - want to go through several iterations of
03:27 - designing then getting user feedback
03:29 - then redesigning then getting more user
03:32 - feedback and so on and so UX determines
03:36 - how UI is implemented and together they
03:38 - drive front-end development for more
03:40 - information on UI or front-end
03:42 - development you can click on one of the
03:44 - links below and while you're down there
