00:00 - here are three projects you can build
00:01 - this week that will look great in your
00:03 - portfolio first you can build a
00:05 - personalized workout generator basically
00:07 - an app that generates custom exercise
00:09 - routines based on your preferences and
00:11 - fitness goals this will help you
00:13 - practice working with data structures
00:14 - and algorithms another idea is to build
00:17 - a password manager something where users
00:19 - can securely store all of their logins
00:21 - for all of their accounts this kind of
00:23 - project will help you learn how to work
00:25 - with encryption techniques and file
00:27 - handling and then lastly you can build a
00:29 - word guessing game kind of like wle but
00:32 - make sure you add your own spin to it
00:33 - maybe have all of the words revolve
00:35 - around a certain theme for example this
00:37 - project will help you practice working
00:39 - with strings loops and conditional
00:40 - statements make sure you follow for more
00:42 - coding project ideas
