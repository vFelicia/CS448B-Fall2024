02:45 - hi coma thanks for joining
02:48 - us great to be here and thank you for
02:50 - having me yeah so I wanted to start by
02:54 - asking you what do you think the most
02:56 - important soft skills for Success are in
02:59 - the tech industry
03:02 - specifically that's a good question I I
03:04 - think
03:05 - that um a power skill that never goes
03:08 - out of style is
03:10 - communication that often times you'll be
03:13 - called into explain things to audiences
03:17 - of varying degrees of Technical acument
03:19 - and
03:20 - experience and the worst thing that can
03:23 - happen is that maybe you feel like
03:25 - you're explaining something in a way
03:27 - that makes sense to you but it's not
03:28 - Landing for the person that you're
03:30 - trying to explain to lots of times you
03:34 - might be called in to communicate what's
03:36 - happening with the particular project
03:38 - perhaps it's a crisis where you're
03:39 - trying to explain what happened what the
03:41 - remediation strategy is what's the path
03:44 - of getting people back up and running or
03:46 - explaining features of a particular
03:48 - project that you're working on so people
03:50 - can understand why it's important how
03:51 - it's important and how you might consume
03:55 - information and make sense of
03:57 - information may not be the way that
03:58 - everybody else does so being able to
04:00 - work intentionally on communication
04:02 - skills when you're thinking about a
04:04 - workplace that is remote and in person
04:07 - or hybrid
04:09 - intergenerational people with different
04:11 - abilities and different gifts that they
04:14 - bring to the table it really is
04:16 - critically important to continue to
04:17 - refine communication skills because how
04:20 - you show up to different audiences is
04:22 - often times maybe a little different and
04:24 - being able to navigate those Landscapes
04:27 - can pay dividends and your ability to
04:30 - add value and support growth and support
04:32 - other people on your team in their own
04:35 - professional Journeys and their own
04:36 - growing Journeys I especially think also
04:39 - empathy leading with empathy um we we
04:43 - saw that the pandemic shifted a lot of
04:45 - norms in terms of how we work with each
04:47 - other what we're dealing with how we
04:48 - show up to work so I think that's also
04:51 - really making sure that you're showing
04:52 - up in a way that people find you to be
04:55 - authentic and invested in their Career
04:57 - Success um sometimes something as simple
05:00 - as just making sure you check in with
05:02 - folks on a regular basis making sure
05:03 - you're having one-on ones but those are
05:05 - places where it's in critically
05:06 - important to make sure that you're
05:08 - you're leading in a way where you're
05:09 - showing up for people they hopefully
05:11 - experience the real you and that they
05:14 - feel like you're invested in their
05:16 - success yeah yeah definitely and I think
05:19 - you brought up a great point which is
05:21 - just how much the pandemic has changed
05:24 - all of this um for people I wondered if
05:27 - we could talk about why there's an need
05:29 - for professional skills right now
05:34 - especially one of the peculiarities that
05:36 - came out of the pandemic although remote
05:38 - work is not something that is is
05:40 - relatively new the scale at which people
05:43 - were introduced to work remotely changed
05:46 - a lot of norms in terms of working with
05:49 - a team that may not be geographically
05:52 - close working with teams that are
05:54 - located in different countries with
05:56 - different cultures different time zones
05:59 - how do you you how do you get to know a
06:00 - team that you've never met in person um
06:03 - how do you work with a boss that you may
06:04 - never get to see um or you may see maybe
06:07 - twice a year so those are some things
06:10 - that that require sort of a
06:12 - reexamination of professional skills
06:14 - because a lot of those Norms that people
06:16 - with more experience in the workplace
06:17 - might have developed sort of fall apart
06:20 - uh something as simple as how do you do
06:21 - a job interview if you're used to
06:22 - showing up in person how do you do it
06:24 - remotely what are strategies to be able
06:26 - to put your best foot forward when
06:27 - you're not in the room with someone if
06:29 - you're used to working remotely how do
06:31 - you show up present in an environment
06:34 - where you're now interacting with people
06:36 - in person where you might be used to a
06:38 - different environment of re uh
06:39 - interacting with people remotely so it
06:41 - really is critical because what happens
06:43 - is when you have those gaps gaps
06:45 - sometimes create misunderstandings or
06:48 - the ability to not assume positive
06:51 - intent and those misunderstandings can
06:53 - fracture teams and personal
06:55 - relationships and professional
06:57 - relationships so now more than ever is
07:00 - critical to invest in those skills
07:01 - because those can be the make or break
07:03 - aspects of a team being able to deliver
07:05 - on time to be able to remediate things
07:07 - to be able to make sure everybody feels
07:09 - like they're included and that that
07:11 - became very difficult especially post
07:14 - pandemic in an environment where a lot
07:15 - of folks were not used to these Dynamics
07:18 - now being disrupted and how do you keep
07:20 - people together and motivated when the
07:22 - Norms that you might have been
07:24 - accustomed to are no longer the Norms of
07:27 - the professional environments that we're
07:29 - working in now right right um speaking
07:32 - of which I believe that we are having a
07:34 - bit of a technical difficulty connecting
07:36 - to the correct YouTube stream so we're
07:39 - gonna pause our conversation I feel like
07:41 - we were on such a great uh train of
07:43 - thought there but um just one second
07:46 - while we try and figure this out
07:50 - um I wish I had the statistics on hand
07:53 - but a lot of times those folks wind up
07:56 - leaving their roles because they don't
07:57 - feel like they're prepared they lose
07:59 - faith in the company they lose faith in
08:00 - their own abilities and then they go
08:03 - somewhere else so that's that's sort of
08:05 - a a misstep that can be easily remedied
08:07 - by investment in helping that person
08:10 - convert into that new role and give them
08:12 - the tools to be able to be successful on
08:14 - day one um I think another place where
08:18 - there's there's gaps is just you know
08:20 - critical and strategic thinking that it
08:22 - it's sometimes very difficult if you're
08:23 - used to being in an environment where
08:25 - you're focused on sort of the Tactical
08:27 - to be able to step back and be able to
08:29 - velop that strategic view how can you
08:31 - communicate the objectives of a
08:33 - companying to ways where your team
08:35 - understands this is how I fit this is
08:37 - why I'm doing what I'm doing and this is
08:39 - how my work fits into the broader hole
08:42 - and that's that's hard to think
08:43 - strategically when you've been used to a
08:45 - more sort of tactical environment and
08:47 - thinking about not just what's happening
08:49 - on my team but what's happening in the
08:50 - company what's a competitive landscape
08:52 - that we're working in what are other
08:54 - people in the space offering that we
08:55 - don't have just trying to to sort of
08:57 - wrap that rigor around those types of
08:59 - analyses is not something that comes
09:02 - naturally it's something that is
09:03 - practiced but it's the good news it's
09:04 - something that can be learned so just
09:06 - like a new manager doesn't have to
09:07 - magically have everything on day one
09:09 - these are skills that can be learned
09:10 - these are skills that can be practiced
09:12 - and as people evolve over their careers
09:15 - that will change in terms of their
09:16 - familiarity what they need to do and the
09:18 - new skills they need to acquire as they
09:20 - go along those Journeys totally and I
09:22 - think what
09:24 - is interesting is that it's not always
09:27 - like formally taught okay here's how to
09:28 - be a manager here's what to do when
09:30 - these things arise so often um like even
09:33 - from my own experience you're sort of
09:35 - just like observing how other people are
09:37 - and see like trying to emulate the parts
09:39 - that you think are successful or just
09:41 - you know uh maybe you have a mentor that
09:44 - would be an ideal scenario um who who
09:46 - teaches you these things but yeah a lot
09:48 - of people don't have that um and I
09:50 - wanted to ask you looking back at your
09:52 - own career how did you develop
09:54 - professional
09:55 - skills well it's a combination of I
09:59 - would say practical uh I would first I'd
10:02 - say um a combination of just learning
10:04 - courses that talk about leadership
10:06 - looking at different now blogs books uh
10:09 - opportunities to think about leadership
10:10 - as a discipline not as something that
10:12 - you have or you don't um mentors and
10:15 - people who could tap me on the shoulder
10:17 - and say I don't think that you handle
10:19 - that in the best way right and that's
10:21 - important to have people along the way
10:23 - uh you can call mentorship or your own
10:25 - personal board of directors where you
10:27 - can sit and share things and say hey I
10:29 - had this meeting and it really went
10:31 - badly so have any of you been in that
10:33 - situation and if so here's how I
10:36 - approached it would you have any insight
10:38 - on how to handle it differently and also
10:40 - being able to have people in various
10:42 - stages of their careers be able to give
10:44 - you that type of feedback because you're
10:46 - not going to learn it all on day one I
10:48 - remember looking at um I think it was a
10:50 - a corn fairy article on leadership and
10:52 - it's not about being a know it all it's
10:54 - about being a learn it all that you're
10:56 - going to be constantly learning and
10:58 - you're going going to be stepping into
11:00 - different environments with different
11:01 - types of people from different
11:03 - backgrounds you're not going to have
11:05 - everything on day one or day two but if
11:07 - you're open to learning and you have
11:09 - that growth mindset of continuous
11:11 - Improvement then it's more about being
11:14 - that learn it all because you'll at
11:15 - least be open to say okay this is now a
11:18 - gap and I need to fix it now how do I go
11:21 - about fixing it with the combination of
11:23 - stuff I might be reading podcasts that I
11:25 - listen to or just being able to have a
11:27 - trusted Mentor who's been there done
11:29 - that and say hey I kind of didn't do
11:31 - this as well or maybe it's hey I did
11:33 - this really really well how do I
11:35 - continue that aspect of my own
11:37 - leadership journey and how I want to be
11:39 - known so some of it especially when
11:42 - you're in the na the Navy you're kind of
11:44 - coming into the Navy as an officer with
11:46 - the expectation that you'll be managing
11:48 - people so part of that curriculum is
11:50 - very intentional but a lot of it was on
11:52 - the job with the mentor who would be
11:53 - able to say as you know me at the time
11:55 - as a junior officer like ma'am that
11:58 - wasn't exactly the way I would approach
11:59 - it and trusting that that person has my
12:02 - best interest at heart to be able to
12:05 - help shape and guide me so that right I
12:08 - don't make that same mistake again yeah
12:11 - yeah and I think um for other people
12:14 - like I think it's important to remember
12:16 - that you might have transferable
12:17 - experience from other jobs you've had
12:20 - you were in the Navy of course that's
12:21 - very specific but like even things like
12:24 - working in food service or Child Care
12:26 - there's stuff that you pick up about
12:27 - communicating or time management that um
12:30 - is really valuable so you shouldn't
12:32 - discount that just if you're absolutely
12:34 - yeah the the type of relationship
12:37 - management that somebody who is a
12:39 - Frontline person in retail has to do
12:42 - imagine the type of Crisis management
12:45 - that somebody who is working on a floor
12:48 - of a retail department store when it's
12:50 - during Peak holiday season there's a
12:53 - backlog stuff is is out of stock and you
12:56 - have to deal with that person represent
12:58 - knowing that you're represent both
12:59 - yourself the brand and the company
13:01 - because they're not going to see you
13:03 - know isolated say oh well well coma it's
13:06 - going to be whatever the big retailer
13:07 - that you're working for is well you know
13:09 - I had a very bad experience so those are
13:12 - of course transferable skills and I
13:14 - think that regardless of what you're
13:16 - working on or where you're working what
13:18 - type of Industry that you're in you're
13:20 - always practicing relationship
13:21 - management you're always practicing
13:23 - aspects of leadership you don't need to
13:25 - have a massive team to be able to
13:26 - practice leadership you're always
13:28 - leading with empathy something as simple
13:30 - as saying hey I noticed that you're a
13:32 - little down what's going on that's
13:33 - leading with empathy because that person
13:35 - again could be having a bad day at work
13:38 - they could have a parent who's sick they
13:40 - could have a you know um an issue with
13:42 - dropping their kid off at school but
13:44 - being empathetic leading from a place of
13:47 - empathy and trust versus huh look at you
13:49 - late again that's that's not a way of
13:52 - solving that problem and I think that to
13:54 - your point there's so many valuable
13:57 - Avenues to learn those skills and then
13:59 - it's about refining those skills and
14:01 - then applying them to the environment in
14:03 - which you find yourself yeah yeah um for
14:09 - people watching who maybe are in the
14:11 - process of looking for a new job maybe
14:14 - they've even landed some interviews and
14:16 - are going out on interviews um what are
14:18 - some ways that you can like talk about
14:20 - or showcase all of these transferable
14:23 - professional skills that you have um
14:29 - my opinion is what's important is being
14:30 - able to have concrete examples of how
14:33 - you're able to use one of these power
14:36 - skills apply the power skill to the
14:38 - particular situation and affect a better
14:41 - outcome because of your participation in
14:44 - that conversation or in that situation
14:46 - whether it's being able to communicate
14:49 - strategic priorities to the team so that
14:52 - they're more effective and more engaged
14:54 - that they're able to get projects done
14:55 - on or ahead of schedule because you are
14:57 - able to communicate effectively
14:59 - translate those strategic requirements
15:01 - being able to manage up and manage down
15:04 - um perhaps it's a situation where
15:07 - somebody on your team came to you and
15:08 - said listen I'm really unhappy with my
15:10 - role can you help me and being able to
15:12 - help that person through feedback
15:14 - through performance reviews be able to
15:16 - say okay here are your strengths here
15:18 - are the things you need to work on
15:19 - here's how we can align you to different
15:22 - experiences so that you are continuing
15:24 - to Forest those goals so it's really
15:26 - important to have those those stories at
15:29 - the ready that demonstrate the skill how
15:32 - you applied the skill the situation in
15:35 - which you applied the skill and the
15:36 - favorable outcome that you were able to
15:40 - facilitate because you are able to do
15:42 - such a good job with that power skill um
15:45 - I know that for me it's it's important
15:47 - and I mentioned communication because uh
15:50 - there are very few things that you don't
15:52 - need to work with somebody else to
15:54 - actually get done and being able to
15:56 - communicate to various audiences is is a
15:59 - really critical skill um being able to
16:03 - to understand and analyze things to be
16:06 - able to figure out so the what went
16:08 - wrong and how do we fix it is also a
16:09 - very valuable skill and the ability to I
16:13 - think be a team player if you're going
16:14 - to be working on a team being able to
16:16 - find a role contribute to that role and
16:18 - again a lot of it is are you able to
16:21 - articulate the skill show how that skill
16:24 - was applied and show the favorable
16:26 - outcome that you were able to support by
16:28 - virtue of you being able to properly and
16:32 - efficiently and effectively apply that
16:34 - skill yeah yeah um so interesting when
16:38 - you were talking about communication I
16:40 - was thinking you know at skillsoft at
16:42 - code academy we are remote we people all
16:45 - over the place is there anything any
16:47 - strategies that you use to make sure
16:50 - that there's clear and effective
16:51 - communication within your team
16:54 - especially being distributed around the
16:57 - world
16:59 - yeah it's it's tough um sometimes you
17:01 - know in certain ccum cases you're going
17:03 - to you have to sacrifice time zones
17:05 - sometimes get a little in my case a
17:06 - little bit earlier if you're if you have
17:08 - time zones you know in Europe or or Asia
17:12 - but I think some of it is you have to be
17:13 - very intentional yeah because once upon
17:15 - a time you could depend on ohy you want
17:18 - to go grab a coffee oh hey I saw someone
17:20 - on the way to the the break room maybe
17:23 - we should have a chat or just be able to
17:25 - stop by somebody's desk and or office
17:27 - and be able to say hey can I just drop
17:29 - in in chat I think with remote work you
17:32 - have to be very intentional about
17:34 - communication whether it's scheduling a
17:37 - half hour standup or a 15minute stand up
17:40 - however you want to do it scheduling
17:41 - weekly meetings with your direct reports
17:43 - and maybe bi-weekly meetings with their
17:45 - direct reports you have to be
17:48 - intentional about those Avenues of
17:49 - communication and especially as you
17:51 - become more senior to an organization
17:52 - people may not feel comfortable just
17:53 - knocking on your door you might say oh I
17:55 - have an open door policy but then is
17:57 - somebody really going to knock on it
17:58 - right so how do you facilitate either
18:01 - groups or informal chats or you know
18:05 - forums where people can access you in a
18:07 - real and authentic way and not feel like
18:09 - they're always on display or I have to
18:11 - tell them about this amazing project
18:12 - that I did because no it's about getting
18:15 - to know people and I think one of the
18:17 - difficulties with being in a hybrid and
18:19 - remote environment is that if you're
18:21 - hybrid sometimes a tendency is for the
18:24 - in office people to get more attention
18:26 - than the remote people sometimes if you
18:29 - have a completely hybrid environment
18:30 - perhaps folks who are in favorable time
18:32 - zones to your own time zone get more of
18:34 - you than folks who are in time zones
18:36 - that might be half a world away so those
18:38 - are aspects where I think especially now
18:41 - intentional communication whether it's
18:43 - you know Zoom or or slack or whatever it
18:46 - is that you have to be very deliberate
18:48 - about it because those incidental
18:50 - opportunities for contact have
18:53 - diminished especially in a place where
18:55 - most of us or many of us are not working
18:58 - side by side in the physical environment
19:01 - with people for whom we depend on a lot
19:04 - of things to get done so really for me
19:07 - the biggest thing has been the
19:08 - intentionality not that you don't want
19:10 - to speak to people all the time but I
19:12 - don't I can't depend on popping into the
19:16 - coffee area and then seeing the person
19:18 - that I need to talk to or being able to
19:20 - go around the corner and pop by
19:22 - somebody's desk because I'm in physical
19:24 - proximity totally totally um I did want
19:27 - to there was a question question that is
19:29 - relevant to what we're talking about in
19:31 - in the chat um someone is asking how do
19:34 - I upscale my abilities to get a remote
19:36 - job what tips could help us um I'm
19:40 - assuming that person is a job seeker and
19:42 - is is hoping to to succeed in a remote
19:45 - environment so totally along the lines
19:47 - of what we were just
19:49 - discussing right so I think that because
19:51 - one of the Tendencies and of course
19:53 - there's a lot of sort of changes in
19:55 - thought is with a remote worker how do I
19:58 - make sure that they're going to be able
20:00 - to get their work done how do I make
20:01 - sure that they stay connected to the
20:03 - rest of the team how do I make sure that
20:06 - person doesn't feel isolated so I think
20:09 - in terms of the interview process
20:11 - perhaps discussing the ways that you
20:13 - intentionally working with if you're a
20:15 - current remote worker looking for
20:17 - another remote job or uh you know in a
20:20 - in a situation where this may be a new
20:21 - remote opportunity the ways that you as
20:25 - a potential candidate intentionally stay
20:27 - connected and intentionally stay
20:30 - informed and feel comfortable working
20:32 - with minimal supervision because of
20:34 - course you don't have that person who
20:36 - pops byy and says hey how's how are
20:38 - things going do you have any questions
20:39 - about this project so I think those are
20:41 - very important skills to be able to
20:43 - articulate and then examples about how
20:46 - you've been able to to apply those
20:48 - skills to stay connected to stay up
20:50 - toate to stay in a place where you feel
20:53 - like you are able to get the relevant
20:55 - information that you need to do your job
20:57 - and feeling comfortable that if you're
20:58 - if you're not getting that information
21:00 - demonstrating that you're the type of
21:02 - person I like to call it polite
21:03 - persistence to be able to go out and
21:05 - find that information so that you have
21:07 - what you need to be able to get done
21:09 - what you need to get done yeah
21:12 - absolutely um I'm also curious from your
21:14 - perspective as someone who has
21:16 - interviewed candidates for roles before
21:19 - um what makes someone stand out it can
21:22 - be such a stressful thing no matter the
21:25 - circumstances but especially when you're
21:26 - in a virtual setting um yeah anything
21:29 - that jumps out to you or or things that
21:32 - you look
21:35 - for it goes back
21:37 - to the examples yeah that it's it's
21:42 - tough when somebody
21:45 - presents a particular skill or an
21:48 - experience and they can't speak to it in
21:50 - a concrete way right where if they
21:53 - mention a project that they've worked on
21:55 - or they mention a specific goal that
21:58 - they achieved being able to say things
22:01 - like well this is the goal this is how
22:03 - we set the goal here are the things that
22:05 - led to the goal here are the things that
22:07 - maybe were going to trip us up along the
22:09 - way and here's how we all came together
22:11 - to be able to keep everything on track
22:13 - if you're not able to provide relevant
22:15 - examples to speak to the items in your
22:17 - CV and your resume that you've that you
22:19 - provided it makes for a much more
22:21 - difficult conversation because often
22:23 - times there's obviously going to be the
22:25 - technical aspect of are you able to
22:27 - demonstrate this specific technical
22:29 - skills that are requirement for this job
22:31 - but also if there's additional skills
22:34 - like
22:35 - um those technical uh projects may
22:39 - require um being able to distill
22:41 - business requirements be able to analyze
22:43 - particular things it's not just the
22:45 - tools that you use to do it but it's the
22:47 - how in the process so being able to
22:49 - articulate that effectively and then
22:51 - connect that thread and connect that
22:52 - storyline is going to be really
22:55 - important um different interviewers may
22:57 - have different areas so if it's
22:58 - technical interview obviously you're
23:00 - going to want to emphasize that aspect
23:01 - if it's behavioral emphasize that aspect
23:04 - if it's a case study a lot of it's going
23:05 - to be sort of the process to which you
23:07 - go um to to arrive at determining what a
23:12 - feasible answer or approach could be but
23:14 - in all those situations it's important
23:16 - to be able to connect those dots and
23:18 - connect those dots in a way that tells
23:20 - your story and builds your brand and
23:22 - articulates why you are the right
23:24 - candidate for that role because without
23:26 - you that project might not have been is
23:28 - successful that person might not have
23:30 - been able to realize that outcome so it
23:32 - really is about how you're able to tell
23:34 - that story provide relevant examples and
23:36 - articulate that as a reflection of you
23:39 - and why you're you're the best candidate
23:41 - for that role and why you'd be a great
23:43 - value add to that organization or that
23:45 - team yeah um we got another question
23:49 - from our viewers that is relevant um
23:53 - what tips do you have if you've only
23:55 - done skill training privately but have
23:58 - never worked with it on the job um like
24:00 - how would you come up with an example I
24:02 - guess if you never had a um technical
24:05 - job
24:07 - before maybe that goes back to what we
24:09 - were saying about transferable skills
24:11 - right I think so if I understand the
24:13 - correction um of the question you it it
24:16 - may not be that you have had the
24:18 - experience but you can speak to if I
24:21 - were to encounter this problem here's
24:23 - how I would go about solving it so it
24:26 - may be less about the fact that you have
24:28 - a whole don't think you have a whole you
24:30 - may think you have a whole in the resume
24:32 - but it could be that okay I haven't done
24:34 - this specific thing but I've done
24:36 - something like it and here's how I
24:37 - approached it or even though I haven't
24:40 - done this thing based upon my experience
24:43 - and my understanding of the particular
24:45 - problem you want to solve or the
24:46 - specific here's how I would go about it
24:49 - and then you tell that story that
24:50 - connects to dots because I think one of
24:53 - the things that we have to be careful
24:54 - about is just because you haven't done
24:56 - it doesn't mean you can't do it so if
24:58 - you have the skills you have the
25:00 - training you have the will even if that
25:02 - particular area may not be exactly what
25:05 - you know they may ask you a question you
25:07 - think oh my gosh they threw me a
25:08 - curveball I've never done this
25:09 - before you probably have the building
25:11 - blocks to be able to solve it or be able
25:13 - to approach it so you know calm that
25:16 - little nerve that's probably saying oh
25:18 - no I'm about to blow it take a deep
25:20 - breath and draw on the pieces that you
25:23 - have that you could solve the puzzle if
25:25 - you were presented with the puzzle
25:27 - rather than focusing on on the fact that
25:29 - o I've never seen that puzzle before you
25:31 - probably have in a different flavor but
25:33 - you can approach it of well even though
25:35 - I haven't had Direct experience with
25:37 - this based upon my knowledge and
25:39 - experience this is how I would go about
25:41 - it yeah that's great advice filing that
25:45 - one
25:46 - away
25:47 - um I am curious Switching gears a little
25:51 - bit um what do you think the key
25:54 - qualities of an effective leader are
26:00 - so one of my favorite books is called
26:05 - Unleashed by Francis fry Dr Francis fry
26:08 - and Anne Morris um Dr Fry is a professor
26:12 - at Harvard Business School and an is
26:14 - sort of a professional like highlevel
26:17 - organizational strategist and and change
26:19 - agent they also have a podcast called
26:21 - fixable so you can tell I'm I'm a pretty
26:23 - big Fang girl of these folks um but they
26:27 - talk about this concept of a trust
26:31 - triangle and that it all begins with
26:33 - trust and in that trust triangle there
26:35 - are sort of um three main components um
26:40 - one is logic sort of do I understand
26:42 - where you're going with this
26:45 - authenticity um are you showing up as
26:48 - the real you and I'm just trying to
26:50 - remember the the third one I think it's
26:53 - um um empathy
26:55 - but it it's one of these situ ation
26:58 - where if you lack a piece of that
27:00 - triangle then people aren't going to be
27:02 - able to follow you they're not going to
27:04 - be able to experience um the real you
27:07 - and they're not going to understand kind
27:08 - of where you're going with where you're
27:10 - going if that makes sense so I think
27:13 - that those
27:14 - are critical elements where if you're
27:18 - able to show up as the real you and are
27:21 - you able to show up in a way that is um
27:24 - authentic that people feel like that
27:26 - they're experiencing you that show up
27:29 - with empathy that you're invested in
27:31 - their success and show up with logic
27:33 - where they get where you're coming from
27:35 - they understand how you put together the
27:37 - dots then that will help you be more
27:40 - successful I think the other piece of of
27:42 - being a good leader is admitting when
27:46 - you're
27:47 - wrong um you're you're never going to
27:50 - get it right all the time if if that
27:52 - were the case then you should be picking
27:54 - lottery numbers and you should be
27:55 - beating the stock market but if you're
27:58 - in a place where you can accept that
28:02 - there's going to be times when you
28:03 - didn't get it right it goes back to that
28:05 - learn it all are you a note all which
28:07 - means I have nothing to learn you can't
28:09 - teach me anything and I have to be right
28:12 - 100% of the time or are you a learn it
28:14 - all where you recognize that at various
28:17 - stages you might not have gotten it
28:19 - right so how can you gather the
28:22 - knowledge to be able to get it right the
28:24 - next time right so those are places
28:26 - where I think in terms of just the basis
28:28 - of leadership it's not about you know
28:30 - putting on a fancy outfit and getting in
28:32 - front of people and of course public
28:34 - speaking could be part of it and as you
28:36 - get more more senior organization you
28:38 - may have to make presentations in front
28:40 - of smaller teams bigger teams larger
28:42 - organizations are you doing like
28:44 - Keynotes are you going to be in front of
28:45 - cameras you going be blasted so all
28:48 - those things could happen but
28:49 - fundamentally in my opinion it comes
28:51 - down to those those those three things
28:54 - um that are in that book but I I found
28:56 - it really resonant because if you have
28:59 - this triangle you have logic you have um
29:03 - empathy and you have
29:05 - authenticity if one of those pieces of
29:07 - the triangle falls apart you got a
29:10 - problem and I think it's one of those
29:12 - things to your point that people people
29:14 - build that up and people might think oh
29:16 - I have to act like this person right you
29:19 - don't you can take elements of what that
29:22 - person brings to the table but you're
29:24 - you you're a unique human being with a
29:27 - whole whole bunch of gifts and a whole
29:29 - bunch of things that you do well and a
29:31 - whole bunch of things that you don't do
29:32 - well and that is okay and then being
29:35 - able to build a leadership style that
29:37 - speaks to that will help you feel more
29:39 - confident in your leadership and help
29:41 - you navigate challenges and and sort of
29:44 - build that resilience because things are
29:46 - going to go wrong projects are going to
29:48 - get messed up code's not going to work
29:51 - um you know things are it it happens but
29:54 - I feel like if you've got that triangle
29:56 - then you can build the resilience you
29:57 - can build the problem solving you can
29:58 - build all those things but also
30:01 - remembering that you don't have to be
30:02 - like anybody else you got to be yourself
30:05 - and that's the authenticity the empathy
30:06 - and logic if you're trying to act like
30:08 - this person out there that person out
30:09 - there maybe there things to emulate like
30:12 - wow that person really commands an
30:13 - audience well that person's really able
30:15 - to distill things in a way that multiple
30:17 - people can understand but you got to be
30:20 - you you you have to be you and adopt
30:22 - your own leadership style and your own
30:24 - way of of showing up for people don't
30:27 - try to be anybody else be you yes I love
30:31 - that framework and just to reiterate
30:34 - that book was called
30:35 - Unleashed yes by Dr Francis fry and an
30:39 - Morris so if anybody wants to go check
30:41 - that out definitely do um sort of
30:45 - related I was wondering like what things
30:49 - people can do when they're at like an
30:51 - individual contributor level um to take
30:55 - on leadership opportunities um like what
30:58 - would that even look like for someone
30:59 - who maybe is at the start of their
31:01 - career
31:03 - um it doesn't like leadership doesn't
31:05 - always have to be this like big splashy
31:08 - thing yeah it could be oh I'll take
31:12 - responsibility for that piece of that
31:14 - project or I'll take responsibility for
31:18 - you know investigating something new
31:20 - that we might want to look at so some of
31:22 - those things can be very small but very
31:24 - impactful and it helps build your
31:27 - confidence and your tool set so that you
31:30 - feel comfortable taking on more
31:32 - responsibility or more opportunities to
31:34 - do things so I think it's an individual
31:36 - contributor there's always ways of
31:38 - finding small pieces of puzzles finding
31:41 - small opportunities to sort of take
31:44 - charge of something and sort of be
31:47 - responsible for driving it to the the
31:50 - goal that you've set for yourself or set
31:52 - for the team but it doesn't always have
31:54 - to be massive that as you start sort of
31:58 - those skills there could be places where
31:59 - you feel comfortable being present being
32:02 - a leader and some places you're like nah
32:04 - you know what I'm good so really being
32:06 - able to find that balance and I mean
32:08 - some folks are very very happy being
32:09 - individual contributors and that's and
32:11 - being selective about what they do in
32:12 - terms of cross functional leadership is
32:15 - there a particular working group or an
32:16 - initiative where you have to pull
32:17 - together a bunch of people solve a
32:19 - problem and then that working group goes
32:21 - back to what they were doing but you've
32:23 - had that experience and opportunity to
32:24 - do something with a group of people who
32:26 - may not be your direct managers but
32:28 - you're taking responsibility to lead a
32:31 - particular team or group in in pursuit
32:33 - of a goal so I think as an IC there's
32:36 - lots of opportunities to do that and
32:38 - perhaps it's just a matter of picking
32:40 - something that resonates seeing how that
32:42 - goes and then kind of reevaluating and
32:44 - say okay how how did that go do I want
32:45 - that experience again do I want
32:47 - something different or you know what
32:48 - that was really great and I'm just going
32:50 - to focus on on the stuff that I need to
32:53 - get done and maybe in six months I'll
32:54 - look for another opportunity to do that
32:57 - yeah yeah great apologies for my dog
33:00 - barking he's still working on his
33:02 - communication skills hopefully oh we we
33:04 - can't we can't hear it great um there
33:07 - was another question from the chat that
33:09 - I wanted to ask um which is how can you
33:14 - get better at your communication skills
33:16 - as an
33:18 - introvert very relatable I think yeah
33:21 - yeah um I I mean I I would say some of
33:27 - it just has to do with picking and
33:29 - choosing where you choose to practice
33:31 - those skills so you don't become
33:33 - depleted by pretending that you're an
33:35 - extrovert when you're not um it could be
33:39 - in a meeting giving like setting a goal
33:42 - that you're going to you're going to
33:43 - articulate a few points or if you feel
33:48 - uncomfortable about being in that
33:49 - meeting and you have a good relationship
33:52 - with the person who's leading it maybe
33:54 - checking in with them to say hey there's
33:57 - a couple things that I'd like to bring
33:58 - up in this meeting but sometimes I don't
34:01 - feel like I can interject or join the
34:03 - conversation and working with that
34:05 - person develop a strategy where you feel
34:07 - comfortable becoming part of the
34:08 - conversation without being you know
34:11 - overcome by anxiety that you're in this
34:14 - situation and now you don't feel
34:15 - comfortable being part of the
34:17 - conversation and I also think that it
34:20 - has to do with again being authentic to
34:21 - yourself if you're not an introvert
34:23 - maybe you're not going to be the one
34:24 - who's talking the most but where you
34:26 - choose to engage you're able to create
34:30 - the type of insightful opinion or being
34:32 - able to be impactful to the conversation
34:35 - so you don't feel like the spotlight is
34:36 - always on you but you do feel like you
34:38 - can pick and choose where you want to
34:40 - participate but recognizing that you
34:42 - don't have to feel obligated to
34:44 - participate so those are I think a few
34:46 - things that might be sort of near-term
34:49 - strategies that might be able to help
34:51 - because you know for an introvert you
34:53 - know that's part of your gifts that's
34:55 - part of what makes you special so trying
34:58 - to pretend that you're an extrovert is
35:00 - exhausting and anxiety inducing so being
35:04 - able to pick and choose where you want
35:05 - to interject and perhaps if you feel
35:07 - good about the person who's having the
35:09 - meeting you say hey look there's a few
35:10 - things I'd like to bring up how can we
35:12 - create the space where I can bring those
35:14 - up and feel like I can be you know
35:15 - authentic without feeling
35:17 - anxious yeah and if I can plug a book um
35:21 - there's a book called quiet the power of
35:23 - introverts in a world that can't stop
35:24 - talking um by Susan Kane and it's very
35:27 - popular um so maybe worth checking that
35:30 - out too I will put that on my list yeah
35:33 - um we had another question that sort of
35:37 - is similar to what we were talking about
35:38 - about being in a
35:42 - interview being in a doob interview and
35:45 - um talking about uh past experience that
35:49 - you've had um but is there any way to
35:51 - convey that like on a resume or
35:55 - CV and I can repeat that question if it
35:58 - wasn't clear so talking about a past
36:00 - experience and if you don't have on the
36:03 - job
36:04 - experience oh
36:07 - um I think I'm trying to think uh if
36:11 - you're early in your career and you
36:12 - don't have specific on the job
36:13 - experience um maybe if this is somebody
36:18 - who's recently finishing you know an
36:20 - academic career maybe it's just
36:22 - highlighting relevant coursework
36:24 - relevant um topics that you discussed uh
36:28 - you know things like that if your if
36:29 - your work history isn't that long then
36:32 - you could highlight areas or coursework
36:35 - that you've done that you feel like
36:37 - articulates things that are necessary
36:39 - for the job that you're applying to so
36:41 - at least it demonstrates that you have
36:43 - some sort of experience with it even if
36:45 - it's not specific practical experience
36:47 - um that you might be able to to
36:49 - demonstrate that you have the aptitude
36:51 - if you were able to apply those skills
36:53 - um also if there's any opportunities to
36:56 - become you know a book involved in like
36:58 - side projects or maybe your own projects
37:02 - where you might be able to explore
37:03 - certain areas or or demonstrate certain
37:07 - you know specific technical Concepts or
37:09 - or um Frameworks that you'd like to use
37:11 - on the job maybe small side projects
37:14 - might be able to help where you can
37:15 - demonstrate here's how I went about
37:16 - solving the problem here's what I built
37:18 - and even if it's not something that's in
37:20 - Market or is is a product that is out
37:23 - there you at least went through the
37:24 - intellectual rigor and the discipline to
37:26 - create that that that project and that
37:29 - can also showcase your ability both from
37:31 - a technical aspect and from a problem
37:33 - solving aspect that you know how to
37:35 - solve problems like this and you solved
37:38 - a hypothetical problem like this and
37:39 - you're able to discuss it when you get
37:41 - into the job interview so that you have
37:42 - something relevant and applicable that
37:45 - you can bring up yeah and and another
37:48 - plug we have so many projects in the
37:50 - code academy um library that you can
37:53 - start doing and for exactly this um so
37:56 - definitely check those out if you
37:58 - haven't um great okay I think we are
38:04 - just about ready to wrap up coma was
38:07 - there anything we didn't talk about that
38:08 - you think is important or that you would
38:10 - want people to
38:12 - know well I think when you're going into
38:14 - a job interview believing that you can
38:18 - get the job and having the confidence to
38:20 - present your best self can go a long way
38:23 - that if you make it past sort of the
38:25 - gatekeeper of the hiring manager or the
38:27 - the software that you know sorts things
38:29 - into piles of yay and nay um just show
38:32 - up recognizing that you can do the job
38:35 - you've got the confidence you've got the
38:36 - abilities and maybe you don't have
38:40 - everything but being eager being um you
38:44 - know showing those no those learn it all
38:45 - qualities and being genuinely interested
38:48 - in the company and the role that you're
38:50 - applying for can go a long way in terms
38:53 - of communicating the enthusiasm that you
38:55 - have to be part of this team or part
38:57 - part of the company even if there might
38:59 - be one or two things on their resume
39:01 - that may not allying to their job
39:03 - description because remember a job
39:05 - description is the perfect world in a
39:07 - perfect world you would have this purple
39:08 - sparkly unicorn that has all these
39:11 - qualities and um is able to just do all
39:15 - the things and and Achieve that Master
39:17 - like obviously if they had the purple
39:18 - unicorn they wouldn't be looking for
39:20 - somebody to fill those roles right so
39:22 - just because you can't tick all those
39:24 - boxes if you think you can tick enough
39:26 - of those boxes and you have the aptitude
39:28 - to demonstrate the enthusiasm and the
39:31 - willingness to learn that can go a long
39:34 - way so I would say don't count yourself
39:37 - out if you see something go for it have
39:40 - the confidence when you're in there to
39:41 - demonstrate why you're the best
39:42 - candidate and why you think you can make
39:44 - a difference and even if you don't know
39:46 - everything or don't take every box
39:48 - that's okay the enthusiasm the
39:50 - willingness to learn and the the genuine
39:53 - interest can go a long way so you don't
39:56 - have to be the sparkly purple unicorn
39:59 - just get in there and do your best and
40:01 - eventually the right opportunity and you
40:04 - will
40:05 - align I love that I love that thank you

but professional skills are hugely important right now research out of the world economic Forum recently identified the most critical skills for people in the workforce and they were analytical and

management and so much more let me tell you a little bit about coma previously coma was code Academy's vice president and head of curriculum coma started her leadership Journey as an officer in the US Navy serving on both active duty and in the Navy Reserve and completed several deployments coma brings extensive experience in Aerospace and defense and was part of initiatives and projects focused on biometric technology and in cyber security coma has also worked in financial services in leaders leadership capacities at both Morgan Stanley and ey formerly earnst and young hi coma thanks for joining us great to be here and thank you for having me yeah so I wanted to start by asking you what do you think the most important soft skills for Success are in the tech industry specifically that's a good question I I think that um a power skill that never goes out of style is communication that often times you'll be called into explain things to audiences of varying degrees of Technical acument and experience and the worst thing that can happen is that maybe you feel like you're explaining something in a way that makes sense to you but it's not Landing for the person that you're trying to explain to lots of times you might be called in to communicate what's happening with the particular project perhaps it's a crisis where you're trying to explain what happened what the remediation strategy is what's the path of getting people back up and running or explaining features of a particular project that you're working on so people can understand why it's important how it's important and how you might consume information and make sense of information may not be the way that everybody else does so being able to work intentionally on communication skills when you're thinking about a workplace that is remote and in person or hybrid intergenerational people with different abilities and different gifts that they bring to the table it really is critically important to continue to refine communication skills because how you show up to different audiences is often times maybe a little different and being able to navigate those Landscapes can pay dividends and your ability to add value and support growth and support other people on your team in their own professional Journeys and their own growing Journeys I especially think also empathy leading with empathy um we we saw that the pandemic shifted a lot of norms in terms of how we work with each other what we're dealing with how we show up to work so I think that's also really making sure that you're showing up in a way that people find you to be authentic and invested in their Career Success um sometimes something as simple as just making sure you check in with folks on a regular basis making sure you're having oneon ones but those are places where it's in critically important to make sure that you're you're leading in a way where you're showing up for people they hopefully experience the real you and that they feel like you're invested in their success yeah yeah definitely and I think you brought up a great point which is just how much the pandemic has changed all of this um for people I wondered if we could talk about why there's an need for professional skills right now especially one of the peculiarities that came out of the pandemic although remote work is not something that is is relatively new the scale at which people were introduced to work remotely changed a lot of norms in terms of working with a team that may not be geographically close working with teams that are located in different countries with different cultures different time zones how do you you how do you get to know a team that you've never met in person um how do you work with a boss that you may never get to see um or you may see maybe twice a year so those are some things that that require sort of a reexamination of professional skills because a lot of those Norms that people with more experience in the workplace might have developed sort of fall apart uh something as simple as how do you do a job interview if you're used to showing up in person how do you do it remotely what are strategies to be able to put your best foot forward when you're not in the room with someone if you're used to working remotely how do you show up present in an environment where you're now interacting with people in person where you might be used to a different environment of re uh interacting with people remotely so it really is critical because what happens is when you have those gaps gaps sometimes create misunderstandings or the ability to not assume positive intent and those misunderstandings can fracture teams and personal relationships and professional relationships so now more than ever is critical to invest in those skills because those can be the make or break aspects of a team being able to deliver on time to be able to remediate things to be able to make sure everybody feels like they're included and that that became very difficult especially post pandemic in an environment where a lot of folks were not used to these Dynamics now being disrupted and how do you keep people together and motivated when the Norms that you might have been accustomed to are no longer the Norms of the professional environments that we're working in now right right um speaking of which I believe that we are having a bit of a technical difficulty connecting to the correct YouTube stream so we're gonna pause our conversation I feel like we were on such a great uh train of thought there but um just one second while we try and figure this out um I wish I had the statistics on hand but a lot of times those folks wind up leaving their roles because they don't feel like they're prepared they lose faith in the company they lose faith in their own abilities and then they go somewhere else so that's that's sort of a a misstep that can be easily remedied by investment in helping that person convert into that new role and give them the tools to be able to be successful on day one um I think another place where there's there's gaps is just you know critical and strategic thinking that it it's sometimes very difficult if you're used to being in an environment where you're focused on sort of the Tactical to be able to step back and be able to velop that strategic view how can you communicate the objectives of a companying to ways where your team understands this is how I fit this is why I'm doing what I'm doing and this is how my work fits into the broader hole and that's that's hard to think strategically when you've been used to a more sort of tactical environment and thinking about not just what's happening on my team but what's happening in the company what's a competitive landscape that we're working in what are other people in the space offering that we don't have just trying to to sort of wrap that rigor around those types of analyses is not something that comes naturally it's something that is practiced but it's the good news it's something that can be learned so just like a new manager doesn't have to magically have everything on day one these are skills that can be learned these are skills that can be practiced and as people evolve over their careers that will change in terms of their familiarity what they need to do and the new skills they need to acquire as they go along those Journeys totally and I think what is interesting is that it's not always like formally taught okay here's how to be a manager here's what to do when these things arise so often um like even from my own experience you're sort of just like observing how other people are and see like trying to emulate the parts that you think are successful or just you know uh maybe you have a mentor that would be an ideal scenario um who who teaches you these things but yeah a lot of people don't have that um and I wanted to ask you looking back at your own career how did you develop professional skills well it's a combination of I would say practical uh I would first I'd say um a combination of just learning courses that talk about leadership looking at different now blogs books uh opportunities to think about leadership as a discipline not as something that you have or you don't um mentors and people who could tap me on the shoulder and say I don't think that you handle that in the best way right and that's important to have people along the way uh you can call mentorship or your own personal board of directors where you can sit and share things and say hey I had this meeting and it really went badly so have any of you been in that situation and if so here's how I approached it would you have any insight on how to handle it differently and also being able to have people in various stages of their careers be able to give you that type of feedback because you're not going to learn it all on day one I remember looking at um I think it was a a corn fairy article on leadership and it's not about being a know it all it's about being a learn it all that you're going to be constantly learning and you're going going to be stepping into different environments with different types of people from different backgrounds you're not going to have everything on day one or day two but if you're open to learning and you have that growth mindset of continuous Improvement then it's more about being that learn it all because you'll at least be open to say okay this is now a gap and I need to fix it now how do I go about fixing it with the combination of stuff I might be reading podcasts that I listen to or just being able to have a trusted Mentor who's been there done that and say hey I kind of didn't do this as well or maybe it's hey I did this really really well how do I continue that aspect of my own leadership journey and how I want to be known so some of it especially when you're in the na the Navy you're kind of coming into the Navy as an officer with the expectation that you'll be managing people so part of that curriculum is very intentional but a lot of it was on the job with the mentor who would be able to say as you know me at the time as a junior officer like ma'am that wasn't exactly the way I would approach it and trusting that that person has my best interest at heart to be able to help shape and guide me so that right I don't make that same mistake again yeah yeah and I think um for other people like I think it's important to remember that you might have transferable experience from other jobs you've had you were in the Navy of course that's very specific but like even things like working in food service or Child Care there's stuff that you pick up about communicating or time management that um is really valuable so you shouldn't discount that just if you're absolutely yeah the the type of relationship management that somebody who is a Frontline person in retail has to do imagine the type of Crisis management that somebody who is working on a floor of a retail department store when it's during Peak holiday season there's a backlog stuff is is out of stock and you have to deal with that person represent knowing that you're represent both yourself the brand and the company because they're not going to see you know isolated say oh well well coma it's going to be whatever the big retailer that you're working for is well you know I had a very bad experience so those are of course transferable skills and I think that regardless of what you're working on or where you're working what type of Industry that you're in you're always practicing relationship management you're always practicing aspects of leadership you don't need to have a massive team to be able to practice leadership you're always leading with empathy something as simple as saying hey I noticed that you're a little down what's going on that's leading with empathy because that person again could be having a bad day at work they could have a parent who's sick they could have a you know um an issue with dropping their kid off at school but being empathetic leading from a place of empathy and trust versus huh look at you late again that's that's not a way of solving that problem and I think that to your point there's so many valuable Avenues to learn those skills and then it's about refining those skills and then applying them to the environment in which you find yourself yeah yeah um for people watching who maybe are in the process of looking for a new job maybe they've even landed some interviews and are going out on interviews um what are some ways that you can like talk about or showcase all of these transferable professional skills that you have um my opinion is what's important is being able to have concrete examples of how you're able to use one of these power skills apply the power skill to the particular situation and affect a better outcome because of your participation in that conversation or in that situation whether it's being able to communicate strategic priorities to the team so that they're more effective and more engaged that they're able to get projects done on or ahead of schedule because you are able to communicate effectively translate those strategic requirements being able to manage up and manage down um perhaps it's a situation where somebody on your team came to you and said listen I'm really unhappy with my role can you help me and being able to help that person through feedback through performance reviews be able to say okay here are your strengths here are the things you need to work on here's how we can align you to different experiences so that you are continuing to Forest those goals so it's really important to have those those stories at the ready that demonstrate the skill how you applied the skill the situation in which you applied the skill and the favorable outcome that you were able to facilitate because you are able to do such a good job with that power skill um I know that for me it's it's important and I mentioned communication because uh there are very few things that you don't need to work with somebody else to actually get done and being able to communicate to various audiences is is a really critical skill um being able to to understand and analyze things to be able to figure out so the what went wrong and how do we fix it is also a very valuable skill and the ability to I think be a team player if you're going to be working on a team being able to find a role contribute to that role and again a lot of it is are you able to articulate the skill show how that skill was applied and show the favorable outcome that you were able to support by virtue of you being able to properly and efficiently and effectively apply that skill yeah yeah um so interesting when you were talking about communication I was thinking you know at skillsoft at code academy we are remote we people all over the place is there anything any strategies that you use to make sure that there's clear and effective communication within your team especially being distributed around the world yeah it's it's tough um sometimes you know in certain ccum cases you're going to you have to sacrifice time zones sometimes get a little in my case a little bit earlier if you're if you have time zones you know in Europe or or Asia but I think some of it is you have to be very intentional yeah because once upon a time you could depend on ohy you want to go grab a coffee oh hey I saw someone on the way to the the break room maybe we should have a chat or just be able to stop by somebody's desk and or office and be able to say hey can I just drop in in chat I think with remote work you have to be very intentional about communication whether it's scheduling a half hour standup or a 15minute stand up however you want to do it scheduling weekly meetings with your direct reports and maybe biweekly meetings with their direct reports you have to be intentional about those Avenues of communication and especially as you become more senior to an organization people may not feel comfortable just knocking on your door you might say oh I have an open door policy but then is somebody really going to knock on it right so how do you facilitate either groups or informal chats or you know forums where people can access you in a real and authentic way and not feel like they're always on display or I have to tell them about this amazing project that I did because no it's about getting to know people and I think one of the difficulties with being in a hybrid and remote environment is that if you're hybrid sometimes a tendency is for the in office people to get more attention than the remote people sometimes if you have a completely hybrid environment perhaps folks who are in favorable time zones to your own time zone get more of you than folks who are in time zones that might be half a world away so those are aspects where I think especially now intentional communication whether it's you know Zoom or or slack or whatever it is that you have to be very deliberate about it because those incidental opportunities for contact have diminished especially in a place where most of us or many of us are not working side by side in the physical environment with people for whom we depend on a lot of things to get done so really for me the biggest thing has been the intentionality not that you don't want to speak to people all the time but I don't I can't depend on popping into the coffee area and then seeing the person that I need to talk to or being able to go around the corner and pop by somebody's desk because I'm in physical proximity totally totally um I did want to there was a question question that is relevant to what we're talking about in in the chat um someone is asking how do I upscale my abilities to get a remote job what tips could help us um I'm assuming that person is a job seeker and is is hoping to to succeed in a remote environment so totally along the lines of what we were just discussing right so I think that because one of the Tendencies and of course there's a lot of sort of changes in thought is with a remote worker how do I make sure that they're going to be able to get their work done how do I make sure that they stay connected to the rest of the team how do I make sure that person doesn't feel isolated so I think in terms of the interview process perhaps discussing the ways that you intentionally working with if you're a current remote worker looking for another remote job or uh you know in a in a situation where this may be a new remote opportunity the ways that you as a potential candidate intentionally stay connected and intentionally stay informed and feel comfortable working with minimal supervision because of course you don't have that person who pops byy and says hey how's how are things going do you have any questions about this project so I think those are very important skills to be able to articulate and then examples about how you've been able to to apply those skills to stay connected to stay up toate to stay in a place where you feel like you are able to get the relevant information that you need to do your job and feeling comfortable that if you're if you're not getting that information demonstrating that you're the type of person I like to call it polite persistence to be able to go out and find that information so that you have what you need to be able to get done what you need to get done yeah absolutely um I'm also curious from your perspective as someone who has interviewed candidates for roles before um what makes someone stand out it can be such a stressful thing no matter the circumstances but especially when you're in a virtual setting um yeah anything that jumps out to you or or things that you look for it goes back to the examples yeah that it's it's tough when somebody presents a particular skill or an experience and they can't speak to it in a concrete way right where if they mention a project that they've worked on or they mention a specific goal that they achieved being able to say things like well this is the goal this is how we set the goal here are the things that led to the goal here are the things that maybe were going to trip us up along the way and here's how we all came together to be able to keep everything on track if you're not able to provide relevant examples to speak to the items in your CV and your resume that you've that you provided it makes for a much more difficult conversation because often times there's obviously going to be the technical aspect of are you able to demonstrate this specific technical skills that are requirement for this job but also if there's additional skills like um those technical uh projects may require um being able to distill business requirements be able to analyze particular things it's not just the tools that you use to do it but it's the how in the process so being able to articulate that effectively and then connect that thread and connect that storyline is going to be really important um different interviewers may have different areas so if it's technical interview obviously you're going to want to emphasize that aspect if it's behavioral emphasize that aspect if it's a case study a lot of it's going to be sort of the process to which you go um to to arrive at determining what a feasible answer or approach could be but in all those situations it's important to be able to connect those dots and connect those dots in a way that tells your story and builds your brand and articulates why you are the right candidate for that role because without you that project might not have been is successful that person might not have been able to realize that outcome so it really is about how you're able to tell that story provide relevant examples and articulate that as a reflection of you and why you're you're the best candidate for that role and why you'd be a great value add to that organization or that team yeah um we got another question from our viewers that is relevant um what tips do you have if you've only done skill training privately but have never worked with it on the job um like how would you come up with an example I guess if you never had a um technical job before maybe that goes back to what we were saying about transferable skills right I think so if I understand the correction um of the question you it it may not be that you have had the experience but you can speak to if I were to encounter this problem here's how I would go about solving it so it may be less about the fact that you have a whole don't think you have a whole you may think you have a whole in the resume but it could be that okay I haven't done this specific thing but I've done something like it and here's how I approached it or even though I haven't done this thing based upon my experience and my understanding of the particular problem you want to solve or the specific here's how I would go about it and then you tell that story that connects to dots because I think one of the things that we have to be careful about is just because you haven't done it doesn't mean you can't do it so if you have the skills you have the training you have the will even if that particular area may not be exactly what you know they may ask you a question you think oh my gosh they threw me a curveball I've never done this before you probably have the building blocks to be able to solve it or be able to approach it so you know calm that little nerve that's probably saying oh no I'm about to blow it take a deep breath and draw on the pieces that you have that you could solve the puzzle if you were presented with the puzzle rather than focusing on on the fact that o I've never seen that puzzle before you probably have in a different flavor but you can approach it of well even though I haven't had Direct experience with this based upon my knowledge and experience this is how I would go about it yeah that's great advice filing that one away um I am curious Switching gears a little bit um what do you think the key qualities of an effective leader are so one of my favorite books is called Unleashed by Francis fry Dr Francis fry and Anne Morris um Dr Fry is a professor at Harvard Business School and an is sort of a professional like highlevel organizational strategist and and change agent they also have a podcast called fixable so you can tell I'm I'm a pretty big Fang girl of these folks um but they talk about this concept of a trust triangle and that it all begins with trust and in that trust triangle there are sort of um three main components um one is logic sort of do I understand where you're going with this authenticity um are you showing up as the real you and I'm just trying to remember the the third one I think it's um um empathy but it it's one of these situ ation where if you lack a piece of that triangle then people aren't going to be able to follow you they're not going to be able to experience um the real you and they're not going to understand kind of where you're going with where you're going if that makes sense so I think that those are critical elements where if you're able to show up as the real you and are you able to show up in a way that is um authentic that people feel like that they're experiencing you that show up with empathy that you're invested in their success and show up with logic where they get where you're coming from they understand how you put together the dots then that will help you be more successful I think the other piece of of being a good leader is admitting when you're wrong um you're you're never going to get it right all the time if if that were the case then you should be picking lottery numbers and you should be beating the stock market but if you're in a place where you can accept that there's going to be times when you didn't get it right it goes back to that learn it all are you a note all which means I have nothing to learn you can't teach me anything and I have to be right 100% of the time or are you a learn it all where you recognize that at various stages you might not have gotten it right so how can you gather the knowledge to be able to get it right the next time right so those are places where I think in terms of just the basis of leadership it's not about you know putting on a fancy outfit and getting in front of people and of course public speaking could be part of it and as you get more more senior organization you may have to make presentations in front of smaller teams bigger teams larger organizations are you doing like Keynotes are you going to be in front of cameras you going be blasted so all those things could happen but fundamentally in my opinion it comes down to those those those three things um that are in that book but I I found it really resonant because if you have this triangle you have logic you have um empathy and you have authenticity if one of those pieces of the triangle falls apart you got a problem and I think it's one of those things to your point that people people build that up and people might think oh I have to act like this person right you don't you can take elements of what that person brings to the table but you're you you're a unique human being with a whole whole bunch of gifts and a whole bunch of things that you do well and a whole bunch of things that you don't do well and that is okay and then being able to build a leadership style that speaks to that will help you feel more confident in your leadership and help you navigate challenges and and sort of build that resilience because things are going to go wrong projects are going to get messed up code's not going to work um you know things are it it happens but I feel like if you've got that triangle then you can build the resilience you can build the problem solving you can build all those things but also remembering that you don't have to be like anybody else you got to be yourself and that's the authenticity the empathy and logic if you're trying to act like this person out there that person out there maybe there things to emulate like wow that person really commands an audience well that person's really able to distill things in a way that multiple people can understand but you got to be you you you have to be you and adopt your own leadership style and your own way of of showing up for people don't try to be anybody else be you yes I love that framework and just to reiterate that book was called Unleashed yes by Dr Francis fry and an Morris so if anybody wants to go check that out definitely do um sort of related I was wondering like what things people can do when they're at like an individual contributor level um to take on leadership opportunities um like what would that even look like for someone who maybe is at the start of their career um it doesn't like leadership doesn't always have to be this like big splashy thing yeah it could be oh I'll take responsibility for that piece of that project or I'll take responsibility for you know investigating something new that we might want to look at so some of those things can be very small but very impactful and it helps build your confidence and your tool set so that you feel comfortable taking on more responsibility or more opportunities to do things so I think it's an individual contributor there's always ways of finding small pieces of puzzles finding small opportunities to sort of take charge of something and sort of be responsible for driving it to the the goal that you've set for yourself or set for the team but it doesn't always have to be massive that as you start sort of those skills there could be places where you feel comfortable being present being a leader and some places you're like nah you know what I'm good so really being able to find that balance and I mean some folks are very very happy being individual contributors and that's and being selective about what they do in terms of cross functional leadership is there a particular working group or an initiative where you have to pull together a bunch of people solve a problem and then that working group goes back to what they were doing but you've had that experience and opportunity to do something with a group of people who may not be your direct managers but you're taking responsibility to lead a particular team or group in in pursuit of a goal so I think as an IC there's lots of opportunities to do that and perhaps it's just a matter of picking something that resonates seeing how that goes and then kind of reevaluating and say okay how how did that go do I want that experience again do I want something different or you know what that was really great and I'm just going to focus on on the stuff that I need to get done and maybe in six months I'll look for another opportunity to do that yeah yeah great apologies for my dog barking he's still working on his communication skills hopefully oh we we can't we can't hear it great um there was another question from the chat that I wanted to ask um which is how can you get better at your communication skills as an introvert very relatable I think yeah yeah um I I mean I I would say some of it just has to do with picking and choosing where you choose to practice those skills so you don't become depleted by pretending that you're an extrovert when you're not um it could be in a meeting giving like setting a goal that you're going to you're going to articulate a few points or if you feel uncomfortable about being in that meeting and you have a good relationship with the person who's leading it maybe checking in with them to say hey there's a couple things that I'd like to bring up in this meeting but sometimes I don't feel like I can interject or join the conversation and working with that person develop a strategy where you feel comfortable becoming part of the conversation without being you know overcome by anxiety that you're in this situation and now you don't feel comfortable being part of the conversation and I also think that it has to do with again being authentic to yourself if you're not an introvert maybe you're not going to be the one who's talking the most but where you choose to engage you're able to create the type of insightful opinion or being able to be impactful to the conversation so you don't feel like the spotlight is always on you but you do feel like you can pick and choose where you want to participate but recognizing that you don't have to feel obligated to participate so those are I think a few things that might be sort of nearterm strategies that might be able to help because you know for an introvert you know that's part of your gifts that's part of what makes you special so trying to pretend that you're an extrovert is exhausting and anxiety inducing so being able to pick and choose where you want to interject and perhaps if you feel good about the person who's having the meeting you say hey look there's a few things I'd like to bring up how can we create the space where I can bring those up and feel like I can be you know authentic without feeling anxious yeah and if I can plug a book um there's a book called quiet the power of introverts in a world that can't stop talking um by Susan Kane and it's very popular um so maybe worth checking that out too I will put that on my list yeah um we had another question that sort of is similar to what we were talking about about being in a interview being in a doob interview and um talking about uh past experience that you've had um but is there any way to convey that like on a resume or CV and I can repeat that question if it wasn't clear so talking about a past experience and if you don't have on the job experience oh um I think I'm trying to think uh if you're early in your career and you don't have specific on the job experience um maybe if this is somebody who's recently finishing you know an academic career maybe it's just highlighting relevant coursework relevant um topics that you discussed uh you know things like that if your if your work history isn't that long then you could highlight areas or coursework that you've done that you feel like articulates things that are necessary for the job that you're applying to so at least it demonstrates that you have some sort of experience with it even if it's not specific practical experience um that you might be able to to demonstrate that you have the aptitude if you were able to apply those skills um also if there's any opportunities to become you know a book involved in like side projects or maybe your own projects where you might be able to explore certain areas or or demonstrate certain you know specific technical Concepts or or um Frameworks that you'd like to use on the job maybe small side projects might be able to help where you can demonstrate here's how I went about solving the problem here's what I built and even if it's not something that's in Market or is is a product that is out there you at least went through the intellectual rigor and the discipline to create that that that project and that can also showcase your ability both from a technical aspect and from a problem solving aspect that you know how to solve problems like this and you solved a hypothetical problem like this and you're able to discuss it when you get into the job interview so that you have something relevant and applicable that you can bring up yeah and and another plug we have so many projects in the code academy um library that you can start doing and for exactly this um so definitely check those out if you haven't um great okay I think we are just about ready to wrap up coma was there anything we didn't talk about that you think is important or that you would want people to know well I think when you're going into a job interview believing that you can get the job and having the confidence to present your best self can go a long way that if you make it past sort of the gatekeeper of the hiring manager or the the software that you know sorts things into piles of yay and nay um just show up recognizing that you can do the job you've got the confidence you've got the abilities and maybe you don't have everything but being eager being um you know showing those no those learn it all qualities and being genuinely interested in the company and the role that you're applying for can go a long way in terms of communicating the enthusiasm that you have to be part of this team or part part of the company even if there might be one or two things on their resume that may not allying to their job description because remember a job description is the perfect world in a perfect world you would have this purple sparkly unicorn that has all these qualities and um is able to just do all the things and and Achieve that Master like obviously if they had the purple unicorn they wouldn't be looking for somebody to fill those roles right so just because you can't tick all those boxes if you think you can tick enough of those boxes and you have the aptitude to demonstrate the enthusiasm and the willingness to learn that can go a long way so I would say don't count yourself out if you see something go for it have the confidence when you're in there to demonstrate why you're the best candidate and why you think you can make a difference and even if you don't know everything or don't take every box that's okay the enthusiasm the willingness to learn and the the genuine interest can go a long way so you don't have to be the sparkly purple unicorn just get in there and do your best and eventually the right opportunity and you will align I love that I love that thank you so much coma for
