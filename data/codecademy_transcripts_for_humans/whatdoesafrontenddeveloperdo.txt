00:13 - being a front-end engineer is the
00:15 - perfect role for you a common thing that
00:17 - front-end engineers do
00:18 - is you're working with program managers

00:23 - what's the best way to implement a
00:25 - solution for a
00:26 - customer problem my favorite part
00:30 - about being a friend engineer is being
00:32 - able to work directly with customers and
00:34 - designers

00:36 - should be a certain color a certain size
00:38 - like all those fine details that ends up
00:40 - creating the best user experience
00:42 - that's one of the most uh rewarding
00:44 - aspects of being a front end
00:45 - engineer one easy way to get started is
00:48 - just to build
00:49 - your own personal website uh your
00:51 - website can be a expression of who you
00:53 - are or like what you want to do

00:57 - awesome way to start marketing yourself
00:59 - saying hey look i built this awesome
01:01 - website imagine what i can build for you
01:04 - next
01:05 - so i wanted to go to art school um but
01:08 - my
01:09 - parents strongly urged me not to go to
01:10 - art school so i ended up
01:12 - picking mechanical engineering i went to
01:15 - a hackathon
01:15 - because being a college student free
01:17 - food and swag that's awesome
01:19 - but i ended up staying and joining a
01:20 - team to make a game
01:22 - and they needed someone to make the art
01:23 - assets so i was like cool
01:25 - i get to do some art stuff well while
01:28 - being here
01:28 - but then uh i needed to put our assets
01:31 - into the game somehow so
01:32 - i had to learn how to program our assets
01:35 - into the game
01:36 - so that got me hooked into programming
01:38 - and then i eventually learned that
01:39 - front-end engineering is a thing
01:40 - so it's a great combination of like
01:42 - being artistic and also
01:44 - being able to program
