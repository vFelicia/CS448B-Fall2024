00:03 - youtube tell it to go live
00:06 - and bam so now we are live on youtube
00:08 - for posterity welcome everybody to the
00:12 - community hackathon number two where we
00:15 - test people with building a
00:18 - app using swift ui
00:20 - we have two teams today competing and
00:22 - i'm gonna let them introduce you
00:24 - themselves uh you wanna go ahead and go
00:26 - first sadish

00:39 - member his name is salil bajaj
00:43 - and we both are part of newbies team
00:46 - and we joined this uh
00:49 - hackathon to build an ius uh application
00:53 - using swift ui
00:55 - uh for both of us this swift ui
00:57 - programming language is new
01:00 - and
01:01 - we have learned a little bit of it from
01:04 - this
01:05 - learning path provided by code academy
01:08 - and excited to share what we have built
01:12 - awesome thank you sadish what about you
01:15 - alex
01:17 - oh yeah
01:18 - so my name is alex on i am from sweden
01:21 - and
01:22 - this is my first time
01:25 - joining the code academy hackathon and
01:28 - i'm very excited to present what
01:31 - we've accomplished in
01:34 - these two weeks that we had to learn
01:37 - swift ui and to build an app
01:40 - okay and we also have two judges for
01:44 - suite ui
01:45 - with us we have the once and only's
01:47 - curriculum developers can you go ahead
01:50 - and introduce yourselves please kalina
01:52 - you go first sure um my name is galena
01:55 - i'm a curriculum developer at good
01:57 - academy i work on the mobile team
01:58 - alongside ben on our ios and swift
02:01 - content and i'm super excited to be here
02:04 - and see where you go
02:07 - i'm ben excited to be here as well a
02:09 - senior curriculum developer at
02:10 - codecademy also working on our mobile
02:12 - stuff got a lot of great stuff on our
02:13 - platform uh swiss content intermediate
02:15 - swift content so if you like content so
02:18 - excited to see what um
02:20 - teams here have made today and hoping
02:21 - that more people will come and check out
02:23 - what content we have
02:25 - awesome well thank you everybody for
02:27 - being here so i'm going to explain the
02:29 - format for anyone that is new to how our
02:32 - community hackathons work
02:34 - the way it works is we had a kickoff two
02:36 - weeks ago where we introduced the judges
02:39 - and we posted the topic of the hackathon
02:41 - this time around was swift ui
02:43 - and we have we give the teams two weeks
02:47 - to either
02:48 - learn the material they need to use for
02:50 - the hackathon and build the app or just
02:52 - go build the app if they already know
02:53 - the material and after two weeks which
02:56 - is today monday they come back and
02:58 - present what they accomplish with during
03:00 - those two weeks and the judges will
03:03 - score them based on four categories
03:06 - those categories are difficulty
03:08 - creativity the design quality and the
03:11 - live demo because they're going to be
03:13 - demoing today what they worked on so
03:16 - without any more preambles let's get
03:19 - right into it
03:20 - who wants to go first which team wants
03:22 - to present first
03:25 - uh i would like to represent first
03:28 - okay alex four is yours feel free to
03:30 - share your screen okay so the first
03:33 - thing i'm gonna do is i'm going to open
03:35 - a powerpoint presentation that i've
03:38 - created on google docs
03:40 - but first i have to share my screen
03:44 - let's hope it worked does it work
03:50 - yes i see your screen
04:02 - okay so
04:04 - so my team name is team shahia and we
04:08 - have built a simple to-do list in
04:12 - xcode uh so uh my team is uh
04:17 - it uh composed of uh
04:20 - which is me i'm from sweden uh op which
04:23 - is also known as alex
04:26 - he is from usa
04:28 - and time traveler is from the uk and
04:31 - stepper girl is from
04:33 - mongolia
04:35 - unfortunately she
04:37 - dropped out so
04:39 - let's continue
04:41 - so the procedure how we created the app
04:43 - so first thing we began is
04:47 - yeah we
04:48 - started with brainstorming like
04:52 - we came up with different ideas
04:54 - and
04:55 - we choose the
04:57 - yeah it just happened to be the to-do
04:58 - list
05:00 - and so afterwards we started learning
05:02 - swift ui about one or two weeks
05:05 - and after that we
05:08 - we went into since we were sure
05:11 - we were very sure of time we had like
05:13 - one day
05:14 - so
05:15 - we decided to use um
05:17 - a kind of a base app that was already
05:21 - built
05:22 - and
05:23 - what we did was we added new views
05:26 - one view which is called detail view and
05:28 - new features like edit to do and add due
05:31 - date
05:32 - and
05:33 - also did some redesign of the app
05:37 - so
05:39 - so while we were doing that we had
05:41 - different challenges
05:43 - uh as you can see
05:44 - all the to do's or somehow this
05:48 - every time i clicked on the edit button
05:49 - they just stack together like
05:52 - like it is shown in this picture
05:55 - and here is uh
05:56 - how it looks after we fixed it
06:01 - and
06:03 - yeah some of the challenges was learning
06:05 - swift without the mac and that means
06:07 - that i could not program on
06:10 - or i could just read like the content
06:12 - but afterwards i
06:15 - i managed to get hold of a computer and
06:17 - then we had dropouts and we found some
06:20 - base apps that was not updated and
06:25 - and also it was like
06:27 - learning two things at once learning how
06:29 - to use the computer and also learning
06:31 - swift ui
06:34 - so uh
06:36 - so a quick introduction of how the app
06:38 - looks so this is the landing screen so
06:40 - when you
06:41 - enter the app this is what you see
06:44 - and after the loading screen
06:47 - we have the
06:49 - add item screen
06:51 - which is the screen where you add the
06:53 - title of the to-do and the description
06:57 - and
06:58 - we also so we have added the feature of
07:02 - a due date and the description
07:06 - and this is how it looks after
07:08 - adding a to do
07:11 - and if you want to edit your to-do you
07:12 - can just click on it to do and you'll
07:14 - get into the detail view
07:16 - where you'll see the title the
07:18 - description and the due date
07:20 - and also the button where you can mark
07:22 - it
07:23 - complete
07:25 - or
07:26 - finished
07:30 - uh here's the home screen
07:32 - when there are no tasks
07:35 - and here's how it looks like when you
07:39 - when you're deleting an item
07:42 - so you basically click on edit and
07:44 - and the red button and delete
07:48 - and we are back with no items
07:52 - uh so
07:54 - yeah before i summarize i i want to give
07:57 - you a live preview of how the app works
08:01 - and uh
08:04 - and it looks uh kind of different from
08:06 - the powerpoints
08:10 - let's see where can i find it
08:25 - there you go so as you see um
08:28 - we also changed the background color to
08:30 - yellow because the
08:32 - in order to uh because we thought that
08:35 - uh black text with the yellow background
08:38 - kind of fits the
08:41 - the ui
08:43 - okay so the first feature i want to show
08:45 - is ads
08:52 - okay i don't know why it corrects
08:54 - probably i'm using another language but
08:58 - i'm just gonna demonstrate that it works
09:01 - and also let's choose a due date
09:05 - click
09:06 - save let's scroll down and here is how
09:09 - to do
09:12 - and the editing feature we click on to
09:15 - do we get into the detail view
09:18 - it's right uh
09:20 - yeah changed
09:23 - too
09:26 - and also i want to finish the to-do
09:31 - and as you can see all the changes is
09:33 - applied to the to-do
09:36 - and now i want to remove the tattoo
09:45 - and it's gone
09:52 - so let's summarize
09:54 - uh so uh what we have learned from uh
09:57 - doing the hackathon is some swift and
09:59 - some swifty i we've created a to-do list
10:03 - made some new friends
10:06 - extended on ios app with some new
10:08 - features
10:10 - and
10:11 - yeah changing the color
10:14 - and here is a list of
10:18 - basically the things we did
10:22 - and uh
10:24 - yeah of course so
10:26 - we want to thank code academy for
10:28 - hosting the event
10:30 - and also swiftly thinking for uh
10:33 - because that's where we got our base app
10:35 - and google for making life easier you
10:37 - can basically google anything and github
10:40 - because that's where we store a project
10:42 - so
10:44 - yeah thanks for listening
10:47 - do you have any questions
10:50 - thank you alex
10:51 - yeah so uh i have a couple questions and
10:53 - that way the judges can like write down
10:55 - any notes or start filling out their
10:57 - score cards for the categories uh i
10:59 - wanted to ask you so you live in sweden
11:02 - that means uh english is not your first
11:04 - language right
11:05 - no it's not
11:06 - all right and you're presented in
11:08 - english anyway so whatever yeah great um
11:11 - so
11:13 - the app you decide to make a yellow
11:15 - because it looks better in the in the
11:17 - black text were you trying to make it
11:20 - look like uh post-it notes like the
11:22 - sticky notes that you can write
11:24 - to those with was that the idea
11:28 - um
11:29 - well
11:30 - it uh now that you mentioned it kind of
11:32 - looks like to-do list and uh
11:36 - i guess it's one one thing that i think
11:38 - makes it
11:40 - fit okay and also you mentioned
11:44 - also you mentioned that you didn't have
11:45 - a mac to program this and then you got
11:48 - one later is that what it was you got a
11:50 - hold of a mac so you could code this
11:52 - yeah basically bought the new macbook
11:54 - air you just you bought the macbook okay
11:57 - you just bought the computer yes i was
11:59 - in need of a laptop anyway and i
12:00 - couldn't choose between windows or mac
12:02 - and now i have a need of mac so i bought
12:04 - it
12:05 - okay
12:06 - yeah
12:07 - great
12:08 - uh i don't have any other questions uh
12:10 - judges if you have any general questions
12:12 - you can ask them now otherwise we'll
12:13 - wait until the end that way it's kind of
12:15 - like a fair ground for both teams uh
12:18 - going through the same process do you
12:19 - have anything in general that you want
12:21 - to ask or
12:22 - add
12:26 - uh we can we can we can hold everything
12:28 - until after unless uh sorry you had
12:30 - something out
12:34 - no uh
12:35 - not right now
12:36 - okay yeah then then we're good to see uh
12:39 - other things and uh thanks for
12:41 - presenting that there i think the this
12:43 - is cool to see extending something that
12:44 - exists already with some of your own
12:46 - tweaks on it if we have time afterwards
12:48 - we'll have to get more into how you're
12:49 - thinking about the edit feature
12:53 - sure if you guys want to see the code i
12:54 - can show you later
12:56 - all right
12:58 - awesome well let's move on to satish and
13:02 - team newbies uh alex you can stop
13:05 - sharing your screen there perfect so
13:06 - swish whenever you're ready
13:09 - okay
13:22 - uh is my screen visible now
13:25 - yep you're good
13:27 - okay
13:28 - so we have built a
13:30 - app which is a stop watch
13:33 - it's a basic application uh stop watch
13:37 - and uh
13:39 - we we have used four tools uh
13:42 - now while learning swift ui one is the x
13:46 - code itself
13:47 - and then
13:49 - there's a simulator
13:52 - which will show the mobile uh
13:54 - how the actual device looks like the app
13:58 - is
13:58 - it's just like a simulator how you can
14:02 - simulate your app
14:04 - on a different models of iphone so that
14:07 - is a simulator that is one tool i used
14:10 - and the other one is
14:12 - i used this
14:14 - profiler
14:15 - this profile
14:17 - to find out uh
14:20 - where something is going wrong
14:23 - uh
14:24 - why the cpu utilization is high and
14:27 - while i was
14:29 - building this app trying to use xcode
14:31 - the simulator my mac got my mac heated
14:35 - up i don't know why
14:36 - but this consumes these apps consumes a
14:39 - lot of battery power of the mac
14:42 - i'm not sure if you guys have faced that
14:44 - issue
14:45 - and the other uh
14:50 - app i used was sf symbols
14:53 - so
14:54 - uh this was like uh
14:57 - because i found out this from the
14:59 - documentation of apple as well this is
15:02 - the symbols which you can use
15:05 - in the code
15:06 - uh to get
15:09 - the buttons
15:11 - like the system name you can view the
15:12 - system name and it will render that
15:16 - so
15:17 - i am going to
15:19 - resume this
15:21 - now
15:31 - my mac is already heated up
15:37 - it's taking a while
15:43 - okay so this is how the app looks like
15:46 - it is a it is having a text button which
15:48 - shows
15:49 - the number of minutes colon the number
15:52 - of seconds
15:53 - this is the
15:55 - right arrow button the blue triangle to
15:59 - start the timer
16:00 - and
16:01 - this is the backward
16:03 - and on to reset the timer
16:06 - so i'm going to uh preview
16:10 - start the preview with
16:14 - of this uh stopwatch okay
16:17 - so when i hit uh click on this start
16:20 - button the timer starts
16:27 - and then when it reaches 59
16:31 - it will become 0 and then 1 is
16:35 - one will come here in the minutes place
16:38 - and then you can stop the
16:41 - timer you can also reset it
16:45 - so uh this is all this is what i have
16:48 - read
16:50 - this
16:51 - view
16:52 - it it works perfectly when
16:55 - i preview this which is inside the
16:57 - explode
16:59 - however
17:02 - when i
17:03 - run this on a simulator when i run this
17:06 - on a simulator
17:07 - uh
17:08 - the
17:09 - text does not get
17:11 - gets updated i don't know why i was
17:14 - trying to
17:17 - read about this state and binding and
17:20 - i'm not sure
17:22 - how the
17:23 - um
17:24 - binding works maybe because it's swift
17:27 - ui
17:28 - language is new i also uh
17:31 - read about
17:32 - you know saw the different code which is
17:34 - provided by
17:36 - uh the code academy in the learning part
17:38 - and i was trying to figure out how to
17:40 - use the environment object
17:42 - how to use the
17:44 - state variable and the binding
17:47 - um
17:48 - however in the simulator the
17:52 - values do not get refreshed
17:54 - as in when the seconds change
17:57 - uh so i have to look into that
18:01 - maybe
18:03 - practice more or read the documentation
18:06 - and then
18:07 - fix that
18:08 - issue
18:11 - this is all
18:13 - i have
18:14 - thank you
18:15 - [Music]
18:18 - all right thank you so much satish thank
18:20 - you for the demo and yeah those
18:21 - questions that you were having a binding
18:23 - on the state like i'm sure that uh
18:25 - i mean i'm sure that you're gonna keep
18:26 - learning this after we're done with the
18:28 - hackathon you're gonna keep uh getting
18:30 - better so
18:31 - i'm sure this app is gonna look great in
18:33 - like with another two weeks
18:35 - so uh
18:36 - now we are going to the q a with the
18:39 - judges and both teams are here to
18:42 - present both
18:43 - uh i'll let you
18:45 - uh run with it galena and ben whatever
18:47 - questions you want to ask either team
18:54 - uh first just want to say that i think
18:55 - those are both
18:57 - very different in terms of like how
18:58 - they're scoped and conceptualized but
19:00 - you know it's it's tough so there's so
19:02 - many new things like both of you are
19:03 - talking about that you had to like
19:05 - figure out through the process so just
19:06 - being able to like set up the
19:08 - environment get running start messing
19:10 - around with things start like adding to
19:12 - and playing around with it exactly like
19:14 - why we try to structure these so i'm
19:16 - really impressed to see like a lot of
19:18 - like the great work happening so i just
19:19 - want to leave with that
19:21 - um and then going back to what i was
19:23 - talking about a little earlier with uh
19:25 - team shuhiya uh so you could you
19:28 - mentioned you had that starting to do
19:29 - app base that you were working on and
19:31 - then we're coming up with the edit
19:33 - feature from it
19:34 - what did you find was challenging when
19:36 - you're trying to implement that edit
19:37 - feature
19:38 - did something not work as intended or
19:40 - was it kind of smooth sailing
19:41 - it was the date uh
19:44 - so uh
19:46 - so one of the features though if i was
19:48 - missing was a due date
19:50 - what to do without the due date is like
19:52 - uh
19:53 - it's like very low probability that
19:55 - or at least for me that i will finish it
19:58 - so
19:59 - i i googled the date uh the date picker
20:02 - and i added it to the
20:05 - to one of the
20:07 - or maybe it's easier if you just share
20:09 - screen
20:13 - see
20:25 - uh could you repeat the question again i
20:27 - i'm very bad at remembering
20:30 - no worries i was just asking what did
20:31 - you find interesting when you're
20:32 - building the edit feature
20:36 - so
20:39 - well the interesting part was how
20:42 - finding out how the app works how it's
20:44 - structured
20:46 - and
20:47 - the guy that built the app he used uh
20:50 - something called uh i don't remember but
20:54 - uh
20:56 - have you guys heard of like one-way data
20:58 - flow like uh redux for example
21:01 - [Music]
21:05 - so uh basically he uh
21:07 - okay
21:08 - every time i read that i i think of
21:10 - javascript but the let's in swift it's a
21:13 - constant
21:14 - so basically yeah so every time we kind
21:17 - of we want to do a change to a to-do
21:19 - list we cannot change it directly by
21:21 - assigning id
21:22 - and that was a very challenging problem
21:24 - for me at least uh
21:26 - uh
21:27 - i i had to like i had to kind of create
21:30 - a new to-do for every small change that
21:33 - i did to it and then remove the old one
21:35 - and
21:37 - replace it with the new one
21:41 - gotcha that makes sense
21:47 - and also how the
21:50 - how we style things
21:53 - that the order is uh
21:55 - important
21:59 - yeah that's a really good takeaway to
22:00 - have for swift ui for those modifiers it
22:03 - kind of sneaks up on you but the order
22:05 - will change the way that things look
22:07 - especially if you're trying to change
22:09 - the theming around
22:12 - yeah and i was talking about the date
22:14 - picker
22:16 - i remember now so uh the
22:18 - something cost uh it was something about
22:20 - the date pick where that caused the
22:22 - entire app to somehow collapse into one
22:24 - to do and
22:27 - that was one of the hardest challenging
22:29 - i think uh i had
22:31 - so we had this space app that worked so
22:33 - we implemented a feature
22:35 - and
22:37 - for some reason we didn't like commit
22:39 - until we made like a lot of changes
22:43 - and so we couldn't really roll back so
22:45 - instead i just copied and
22:47 - like i just
22:49 - took the base app and then rebuilt it
22:51 - from the ground until i found the bug
22:57 - that must have been very time consuming
23:00 - i thought it would
23:02 - yeah i i thought so too but
23:05 - but i found the bug pretty quickly
23:08 - because uh it was only one
23:11 - i could some i i knew which which of
23:13 - these files the problem was uh
23:18 - uh
23:19 - yeah which uh which file the problem was
23:22 - where the problem
23:23 - was on and then i could somehow
23:27 - then i added like components to
23:28 - component until the entire thing
23:30 - collapsed so
23:31 - gadget i think i think it was fun
23:34 - yeah definitely well thanks for getting
23:35 - interested because yeah that gives us a
23:37 - much better sense of like kind of what
23:38 - you're thinking around i'm looking at
23:40 - then i had one more for uh satish and
23:43 - team newbies
23:44 - uh
23:45 - what how did you implement like um the
23:48 - ticking up so like to make it so that
23:50 - the timer worked at all because i know
23:52 - you mentioned that there's some
23:53 - challenges between the simulator and the
23:55 - preview but like how did you make it so
23:57 - that every second the number would
23:59 - change
24:02 - uh yes so when i thought about this uh
24:05 - stopwatch uh that was all always there
24:08 - in the back of mind i was thinking uh
24:11 - how i would do that how should i do that
24:13 - because it's a
24:15 - new programming language i'm learning uh
24:18 - so i was uh it was always there in the
24:21 - back of mind
24:22 - that uh how i should be implementing
24:24 - that
24:25 - but i uh i did not work on that
24:28 - initially i started working on
24:30 - the views uh to first keep the
24:34 - uh
24:36 - initially how i started off i thought
24:38 - i'll uh
24:40 - uh i know what i want on my stopwatch
24:44 - stopwatch i need a text box and then i
24:47 - need a two buttons just like how we have
24:49 - a stopwatch on every iphone
24:53 - so
24:54 - that is how i visualize
24:56 - i want it to be
24:58 - but then slowly slowly when i started uh
25:01 - uh
25:02 - seeing the final project of code history
25:05 - which is there on the
25:06 - uh learning path then i realized that is
25:10 - not how
25:12 - uh
25:13 - views are done and i also watch some of
25:15 - the videos
25:17 - uh provided by apple in the developer uh
25:21 - portal
25:23 - and i also saw there there there is one
25:26 - other project provided by code academy
25:28 - that is address
25:30 - book
25:31 - uh
25:32 - address book uh project
25:35 - so
25:36 - it's kind of a different
25:38 - way of
25:40 - building or
25:42 - you visualize your app but
25:44 - the way you implement it is a bit
25:46 - different however it is quite uh
25:49 - interesting
25:50 - to build uh apps with swift ui there are
25:53 - there are many
25:55 - classes many a lot of functionality
25:57 - provided placement so
25:59 - how i thought of
26:01 - ticking this timer is like
26:03 - i was uh
26:05 - reading through the documentation to
26:06 - find out
26:08 - uh
26:09 - if there is any
26:10 - timer related uh
26:12 - object or a class which is provided by
26:15 - the
26:16 - framework
26:17 - and i did find one video
26:20 - where
26:22 - one of the apple engineer is
26:25 - uh
26:27 - you know a building a a
26:29 - podcast player for the
26:31 - uh for the watch apple watch
26:35 - so there uh a code code was provided
26:39 - which was related to a health kit but
26:42 - that did not fit into
26:45 - the project where i am trying to do a
26:46 - simple one
26:48 - and then so i was
26:51 - i used the documentation and then
26:53 - uh made that logic
26:55 - that i know okay first it has to come to
26:58 - when that even
27:00 - it's it's a simple uh uh
27:03 - published timer wherein you have to
27:05 - check
27:06 - uh if it becomes 59 then you have to
27:09 - increase one minute and then reset the
27:12 - seconds to zero again count
27:17 - i think that makes sense i think using
27:18 - the like timer that then publish is
27:20 - exactly how i would have done that as
27:22 - well and i love how when you're
27:24 - explaining how you're trying to find
27:25 - resources your kind of resourcefulness
27:28 - and looking at everything we have on our
27:29 - platform and then also looking at like
27:31 - the wwdc videos and the documentation
27:34 - because those are all very good sources
27:36 - for trying to find out different ways of
27:38 - writing that so appreciate that answer
27:40 - thank you
27:41 - judges uh we have a chat a question from
27:43 - the chat uh somebody's asking well
27:46 - basically complaining
27:48 - that apple makes you use a mac to code
27:50 - in xcode can you explain why is that a
27:52 - compilation thing like the processor
27:55 - hardware
27:56 - what's what's keeping people from
27:58 - running xcoding windows
28:00 - i guess the real question is why would
28:02 - apple spend resources to let people do
28:04 - it on windows
28:05 - and you know like i think alex is a
28:08 - great example of this saying like well i
28:10 - want to do mac development so i was
28:11 - debating between windows and the mac so
28:14 - i decided to end up getting a mac
28:16 - and that's pretty much exactly what
28:18 - apple wants people to do is
28:20 - say well if you want to do ios
28:22 - development you can go ahead and this is
28:24 - what we allow it to be used on so they
28:26 - really just don't have any interest in
28:28 - letting you do it on other platforms
28:30 - and they can get away with it i guess
28:32 - like theoretically android could try
28:34 - doing the same thing too but you can do
28:36 - all kinds of android development that
28:38 - you want to the kind of other broader
28:41 - answers like windows is a little bit
28:43 - more particular as like an operating
28:45 - system than like some of the unix-based
28:47 - ones so you have to do things a little
28:49 - bit differently if you're not building
28:50 - for it initially and apple just has no
28:52 - interest in investing in it
28:54 - so you're right that it's annoying
28:56 - though it's hard to get into if you
28:57 - don't already have access to a mac
28:59 - okay
29:01 - all right so
29:03 - do you have any other do you have any
29:05 - questions galena
29:06 - um no i i think i'm i think i'm good
29:11 - all right well then i guess we are uh
29:13 - ready for some of the judging and the
29:15 - feedback uh
29:17 - you both have listened to the
29:18 - presentations you've bought got some
29:20 - questions in and heard their logic
29:22 - behind how they built the apps and why
29:24 - they did it that way
29:25 - we've heard both satish and alex say
29:28 - that they've had to look for resources
29:30 - outside and that most of the time not
29:32 - most of the time but often they had to
29:34 - you know go around the internet and
29:36 - research stuff so they definitely put
29:38 - the effort and the time and now would
29:40 - love to hear any feedback or any
29:42 - thoughts you have on this
29:44 - actually freddie i'm so sorry to
29:45 - interrupt you can i jump in with one
29:47 - quick question yeah okay i'm very very
29:50 - curious uh why
29:52 - you guys chose to build the app that you
29:54 - chose so uh satish why a stopwatch and
29:57 - alex why a to-do list
30:04 - i wanted to uh
30:06 - build a simple app uh
30:09 - why i chose is because uh it was it's
30:12 - there on my phone i have an iphone and
30:15 - uh i have used a stopwatch
30:18 - so i wanted to build a stopwatch because
30:21 - it's also an ios application
30:29 - okay so
30:31 - i think the first reason why i chose or
30:34 - we didn't really bother we the team
30:35 - voted and
30:37 - we chose the to-do list and i thought it
30:41 - was a
30:42 - great idea because i used to do this all
30:45 - the time i used to do east and uh
30:50 - and i thought that
30:52 - it should be pretty easy to create
30:55 - something that you already know how it
30:57 - works and
30:58 - you might have something
31:00 - maybe i might add something that i'm
31:02 - missing from other to do is to do this
31:05 - as well
31:07 - so that's why i
31:09 - i was motivated on doing the to-do list
31:17 - all right
31:18 - awesome i mean i think another way of
31:20 - putting it uh you're saying you know it
31:22 - should be easy to do i think um another
31:24 - way of thinking about it is you know you
31:25 - have a time constraint and that there's
31:27 - a lot to do so sometimes uh you're
31:29 - looking for easy things to do not
31:31 - because they're easy but because they're
31:32 - going to be
31:33 - better to it's going to be better to
31:35 - structure them and to get them done in
31:37 - the time that you have
31:38 - so
31:41 - all right so uh
31:43 - back to the judges galena and ben
31:46 - feel free to share any feedback you have
31:48 - with every team each team any thoughts
31:50 - uh maybe
31:52 - how they could take the apps uh next
31:54 - from here they want to keep working on
31:55 - them
31:56 - any recommendations the floor is yours
32:01 - uh great so next steps good things uh i
32:04 - guess i'm uh newbies so
32:07 - figuring out how to like what that
32:09 - simulator bug is
32:11 - is probably a good place to start on
32:12 - that and like for specific resources
32:14 - since you
32:15 - if you don't have the code up on like
32:17 - github or something i would just push it
32:19 - up there so other people might be able
32:20 - to access it and then in our discord
32:23 - channel we have an ios specific thing
32:25 - that i think some people might have
32:26 - found each other at so that might be a
32:28 - good starting point for saying like
32:30 - posting and saying hey can you take a
32:31 - look at this and let us see like what
32:34 - the challenge is i try to take a look so
32:35 - if you get that there i would love to go
32:37 - and take a look for figuring out why
32:39 - it's not working the same way on
32:41 - simulator as it is in the preview so i
32:44 - think that's going to be your first next
32:45 - step i think of a great base to be
32:46 - working from
32:47 - uh in order to kind of like be building
32:50 - that kind of stopwatch app like i think
32:51 - you did a really good job of identifying
32:53 - the right set of features to be starting
32:55 - with like you need to start you need to
32:57 - pause you need to reset that's exactly i
32:59 - think how i started as well and then you
33:01 - can start looking at building out other
33:03 - features from there like you know having
33:05 - multiple different like like timers or
33:08 - counting down instead of off and whatnot
33:10 - once you figure out what that bug looks
33:11 - like
33:13 - that's my that's my newbie feedback i
33:14 - know if i gleam of notes on the shoe
33:17 - yeah that you want to go over
33:20 - um you know i think ben you had a lot of
33:22 - great points uh yep would love to see
33:24 - you take this a step further see if you
33:27 - can implement a feature where the
33:29 - um
33:31 - the minutes are decreasing or the
33:32 - seconds are decreasing would love to
33:34 - also see some design around it it would
33:36 - be cool if you can implement
33:38 - uh just add like a title heading uh
33:40 - something of um
33:43 - aesthetic
33:44 - uh
33:45 - aesthetically pleasing like
33:46 - visualization uh that would be really
33:48 - cool too so
33:49 - yeah we'd love to see where you take
33:50 - this further
33:53 - and then on shuhiya i think starting
33:56 - with a like to do app from like an
33:58 - existing framework and building on it is
33:59 - a great way to kind of like get a
34:02 - understanding about like what is this
34:03 - framework like what can you do in it so
34:05 - i think that's a great place to get
34:06 - started what i'd recommend that you do
34:08 - is kind of like a next step is to take
34:10 - that as a base of inspiration and then
34:13 - try to go off and build something where
34:14 - you aren't starting with a template
34:16 - because you can start figuring out a lot
34:18 - of like what did the template need and
34:20 - what did it not need and start piecing
34:22 - together a lot more of like how that's
34:24 - built together but i love like being
34:26 - able to just say like hey we know this
34:28 - works we're gonna go ahead and get
34:29 - running with this and then figure out
34:30 - how to tweet something is a great place
34:32 - to start on that so i like that you're
34:33 - able to kind of like say like hey we
34:35 - don't have a lot of time how can we
34:36 - start making some tweaks or something to
34:38 - get something accomplished there so
34:39 - that's kind of my recommendation for
34:41 - next steps as i start building out kind
34:43 - of like a
34:44 - simpler version that you own all the
34:46 - like parts of so that you're not using
34:47 - that boilerplate for it uh and then i
34:50 - love some of the work that you're doing
34:51 - around like the editing that you
34:52 - mentioned like i think that you're a
34:54 - really creative solution for figuring
34:55 - out how to adjust and you know they have
34:58 - this whole complex like redux like
35:00 - management thing for storage and like
35:02 - you figured out how to actually make the
35:04 - edits you wanted and purchase those
35:05 - which i think is great and then add that
35:08 - theme as well and mess around with a lot
35:09 - of those dude modifiers
35:14 - yeah and i i thought that
35:16 - um it was a great looking app um i think
35:19 - that the due date is going to be super
35:21 - helpful for anybody uh that's using a
35:23 - to-do list application um
35:26 - so i noticed that you had some cool
35:27 - shadow on some of the buttons so a lot
35:29 - of minor intricacies that uh stood out
35:32 - and yeah i mean it's it's awesome that
35:34 - you're also able to
35:36 - um
35:37 - get started on a mac and not only learn
35:40 - xcode and swift and swift ui and
35:42 - everything that comes with the ios
35:43 - system but also a completely new machine
35:46 - so
35:51 - all right well uh thank you for the
35:53 - feedback uh now the moment that we've
35:56 - all been waiting for uh i don't know if
35:58 - you lena ben want to talk to each other
36:01 - uh or slack or something for a minute
36:03 - and try to decide um
36:06 - you know
36:07 - on your scorecards and final thoughts
36:10 - while you do that i'll just uh be
36:12 - following up with alex and satish here
36:14 - i think um you got guys you both said
36:18 - that uh did you have any background in
36:20 - coding
36:22 - before you were doing this hackathon
36:24 - either of you do you have a background
36:26 - have you coded in other programming
36:27 - languages
36:29 - yeah
36:31 - okay
36:32 - uh one at a time so satish what uh what
36:34 - background do you have in programming
36:37 - yeah sorry for that alex uh in java
36:39 - programming
36:41 - okay java um
36:43 - and you alex what do you
36:45 - what kind of programming do you do
36:47 - um
36:49 - so
36:50 - well from the university i also have
36:52 - java programming
36:54 - but from high school i had c sharp
36:57 - programming and then
36:59 - right now i've programmed with html
37:02 - yeah the oh the frontend stack like css
37:06 - javascript react
37:09 - okay good
37:10 - cool so i guess uh swift was sort of uh
37:13 - new new for both of you
37:16 - um and i guess you both had kind of like
37:17 - a basic understanding of programming so
37:20 - you could hit the ground running
37:23 - based on
37:25 - the
37:26 - content of the swift ui coursework that
37:28 - you had access to
37:30 - and how much you had to go outside to
37:32 - look for resources or look for their
37:34 - information to build your app uh what
37:37 - would you say that is the ratio like did
37:38 - you find yourself having to go
37:40 - outside of the program like frequently
37:43 - did you find the content that that was
37:45 - in the culture for sweep ui very useful
37:47 - i want to hear your thoughts on
37:49 - anything that you said that you think
37:50 - that might have been missing or that
37:52 - could be improved
37:59 - well
38:01 - one thing that i'm missing is like
38:03 - usually when i study at code academy i
38:06 - can like
38:07 - read some read something about code and
38:09 - then i can code and then
38:12 - and then like do it all again but on
38:15 - on swift ui it seems like you have you
38:17 - need a mac in order to follow the course
38:19 - or else you just end up reading
38:20 - everything and forgetting about
38:23 - a lot of it
38:25 - that's what happened for me at least so
38:27 - i ended up looking at the different
38:28 - sites like apple and
38:31 - well usually i google i don't really
38:33 - remember all the different sites i've
38:35 - been to one of them had the date picker
38:38 - and uh
38:40 - but the ratio i would say like uh
38:44 - maybe 50 because i also went back to
38:46 - course and looked for
38:48 - for example what the v stack does
39:00 - okay uh so the learning path which was
39:03 - provided to us uh
39:06 - the swift ui learning path uh it is good
39:08 - it is very comprehensive and it has a
39:11 - lot of text
39:12 - one thing i appreciate about uh code
39:15 - academy is
39:16 - uh there are no
39:18 - uh videos everything is text so
39:22 - you so
39:24 - whoever is taking the course
39:26 - uh he he or she
39:29 - has to read
39:31 - has to understand and then try to
39:34 - implement it so that is one good thing i
39:37 - know i i have taken lot of courses
39:40 - uh in coursera however
39:43 - what happens is you tend to
39:46 - i know when you're watching a video
39:49 - uh like a training video
39:51 - uh you cannot sit in front of the
39:54 - computer for a long time you have to
39:56 - take breaks
39:58 - but uh
39:59 - with uh
40:01 - code academy everything is text based
40:05 - and you can also
40:07 - take it on your mobile phone
40:09 - and you can read
40:11 - and you can understand you can
40:14 - try to recollect whatever you read so
40:18 - when you're reading so you also tend to
40:22 - keep in mind some of the terminologies
40:25 - of that programming language which is
40:27 - being used so there's uh it's a good
40:29 - thing
40:30 - uh i went to
40:32 - i chose to go for a lot of other
40:34 - resources outside of code academy
40:37 - because uh
40:39 - we were short of time
40:41 - and i remember last monday when ben said
40:44 - you can jump in and
40:46 - see the final project and get some idea
40:49 - so that is how i started off and then
40:52 - saw different projects how it how the
40:54 - views are
40:56 - developed to make a full single ios
41:00 - application
41:01 - so
41:02 - uh it's good
41:04 - though there are no videos in code
41:06 - academy
41:07 - that's fine but uh
41:10 - it's good and uh the developer
41:12 - documentation wwc dc videos are
41:16 - they are not very lengthy though they uh
41:21 - it just they ex the apple engineers uh
41:24 - now make it a point to explain the
41:26 - concepts very simple and straightforward
41:30 - uh
41:30 - within a half an hour uh window 30
41:33 - minute video window
41:37 - okay yeah so it sounds like you went for
41:39 - outside resources when you were looking
41:40 - for very specific to answer very
41:43 - specific questions because you probably
41:45 - didn't know what part of the course work
41:47 - in swift ui data and that question was
41:49 - so
41:50 - rather than taking the time to go
41:51 - through the entire course to see where
41:52 - that where that question is you can just
41:55 - go to the internet and go to other
41:56 - resources where you can search for the
41:58 - specific problem that you're having or
42:00 - the specific thing that you're trying to
42:01 - solve so that makes sense
42:04 - okay um
42:05 - yeah judges how are you doing
42:08 - have you arrived at a conclusion
42:10 - we believe we have we're we're doing
42:13 - good
42:15 - okay
42:17 - so without without further ado here
42:20 - uh
42:21 - we have uh the the winner of our ios uh
42:24 - hackathon the code academy hackathon
42:26 - number two is team newbies
42:31 - came down to the wire
42:33 - thank you
42:35 - so talking over at high level i think we
42:37 - like that you kind of picked something
42:38 - that was a little bit challenging that
42:40 - you know we didn't have in any of our
42:42 - materials so trying to figure some of
42:43 - that concept out uh you kind of came up
42:45 - with your own idea of what you wanted to
42:47 - do there you said as galena mentioned
42:49 - the comments there's definitely some
42:51 - more work you can do around design
42:53 - quality and what that looks like so
42:54 - that's kind of like a good growth area
42:56 - as you start exploring more on that
42:58 - um and then also fixing that one uh like
43:01 - simulator bug that you have there
43:03 - uh and then team chuhia we thought you
43:05 - did great work on this so again this
43:06 - came down to a point to the rubric that
43:08 - we had um we think that like the demo
43:11 - that you had was really great for going
43:12 - over kind of like in a lot of detail on
43:15 - the slides like how you conceptualized
43:17 - your work how you're kind of like
43:18 - identifying what you're building there
43:20 - we really like for the design aspect of
43:22 - it how you're tweaking that and trying
43:24 - to add
43:25 - like you know playing around the
43:26 - modifiers making it adds to kind of what
43:28 - your own like take would be like um that
43:31 - you picked some interesting features to
43:32 - work on um but brought down a little bit
43:35 - for creativity mainly because there's a
43:37 - different app that you're kind of
43:38 - starting from and then moving forwards
43:39 - on
43:40 - um which again it's a great thing to do
43:42 - from learning so there's
43:44 - i think across the board like great for
43:47 - diving into new frameworks and was
43:48 - really impressed with a lot of the work
43:49 - that we saw especially this is coming
43:51 - into like
43:52 - not knowing anything about the framework
43:54 - and then taking two weeks to build it
43:56 - together super impressive so really
43:58 - appreciate all the work that everyone
43:59 - did as part of this and uh it was really
44:02 - great to look and see these projects
44:05 - awesome
44:06 - well thank you both um
44:08 - i'm hoping that station alex you got
44:10 - some good feedback from the judges and
44:11 - some areas of growth to focus and keep
44:14 - if you keep developing the swift ui apps
44:17 - um
44:18 - i think uh the only thing left to say is
44:21 - congratulations to the winning team and
44:23 - you know don't be demoralized for the
44:24 - losing team uh like the judges said it
44:26 - was close
44:28 - so you you know it was it was right
44:29 - there i think uh at the end of the day
44:31 - just the point of hackathons is to learn
44:33 - and to push yourself to learn something
44:34 - new so everybody wins in that regard
44:36 - exactly
44:37 - yeah i think that uh
44:40 - well i like that satish win and also
44:42 - because uh
44:44 - sounds very determined or uh
44:47 - like uh
44:49 - i don't really know how but i get a good
44:51 - vibe from uh satish
44:53 - nice
44:54 - maybe you you guys should stay in touch
44:56 - maybe you should stay in touch and
44:58 - participate together in hackathon number
45:00 - three when it comes up
45:01 - maybe you two can come up with a winning
45:04 - team for the next one
45:05 - um
45:06 - okay then i'll send everybody off uh
45:09 - we've been here for a while live so

Cleaned transcript:

youtube says that we're good they're receiving the data so i'm gonna click youtube tell it to go live and bam so now we are live on youtube for posterity welcome everybody to the community hackathon number two where we test people with building a app using swift ui we have two teams today competing and i'm gonna let them introduce you themselves uh you wanna go ahead and go first sadish hi my name is sadish i am from india and i am representing team newbies and in my team there is another member his name is salil bajaj and we both are part of newbies team and we joined this uh hackathon to build an ius uh application using swift ui uh for both of us this swift ui programming language is new and we have learned a little bit of it from this learning path provided by code academy and excited to share what we have built awesome thank you sadish what about you alex oh yeah so my name is alex on i am from sweden and this is my first time joining the code academy hackathon and i'm very excited to present what we've accomplished in these two weeks that we had to learn swift ui and to build an app okay and we also have two judges for suite ui with us we have the once and only's curriculum developers can you go ahead and introduce yourselves please kalina you go first sure um my name is galena i'm a curriculum developer at good academy i work on the mobile team alongside ben on our ios and swift content and i'm super excited to be here and see where you go i'm ben excited to be here as well a senior curriculum developer at codecademy also working on our mobile stuff got a lot of great stuff on our platform uh swiss content intermediate swift content so if you like content so excited to see what um teams here have made today and hoping that more people will come and check out what content we have awesome well thank you everybody for being here so i'm going to explain the format for anyone that is new to how our community hackathons work the way it works is we had a kickoff two weeks ago where we introduced the judges and we posted the topic of the hackathon this time around was swift ui and we have we give the teams two weeks to either learn the material they need to use for the hackathon and build the app or just go build the app if they already know the material and after two weeks which is today monday they come back and present what they accomplish with during those two weeks and the judges will score them based on four categories those categories are difficulty creativity the design quality and the live demo because they're going to be demoing today what they worked on so without any more preambles let's get right into it who wants to go first which team wants to present first uh i would like to represent first okay alex four is yours feel free to share your screen okay so the first thing i'm gonna do is i'm going to open a powerpoint presentation that i've created on google docs but first i have to share my screen let's hope it worked does it work yes i see your screen okay so so my team name is team shahia and we have built a simple todo list in xcode uh so uh my team is uh it uh composed of uh which is me i'm from sweden uh op which is also known as alex he is from usa and time traveler is from the uk and stepper girl is from mongolia unfortunately she dropped out so let's continue so the procedure how we created the app so first thing we began is yeah we started with brainstorming like we came up with different ideas and we choose the yeah it just happened to be the todo list and so afterwards we started learning swift ui about one or two weeks and after that we we went into since we were sure we were very sure of time we had like one day so we decided to use um a kind of a base app that was already built and what we did was we added new views one view which is called detail view and new features like edit to do and add due date and also did some redesign of the app so so while we were doing that we had different challenges uh as you can see all the to do's or somehow this every time i clicked on the edit button they just stack together like like it is shown in this picture and here is uh how it looks after we fixed it and yeah some of the challenges was learning swift without the mac and that means that i could not program on or i could just read like the content but afterwards i i managed to get hold of a computer and then we had dropouts and we found some base apps that was not updated and and also it was like learning two things at once learning how to use the computer and also learning swift ui so uh so a quick introduction of how the app looks so this is the landing screen so when you enter the app this is what you see and after the loading screen we have the add item screen which is the screen where you add the title of the todo and the description and we also so we have added the feature of a due date and the description and this is how it looks after adding a to do and if you want to edit your todo you can just click on it to do and you'll get into the detail view where you'll see the title the description and the due date and also the button where you can mark it complete or finished uh here's the home screen when there are no tasks and here's how it looks like when you when you're deleting an item so you basically click on edit and and the red button and delete and we are back with no items uh so yeah before i summarize i i want to give you a live preview of how the app works and uh and it looks uh kind of different from the powerpoints let's see where can i find it there you go so as you see um we also changed the background color to yellow because the in order to uh because we thought that uh black text with the yellow background kind of fits the the ui okay so the first feature i want to show is ads okay i don't know why it corrects probably i'm using another language but i'm just gonna demonstrate that it works and also let's choose a due date click save let's scroll down and here is how to do and the editing feature we click on to do we get into the detail view it's right uh yeah changed too and also i want to finish the todo and as you can see all the changes is applied to the todo and now i want to remove the tattoo and it's gone so let's summarize uh so uh what we have learned from uh doing the hackathon is some swift and some swifty i we've created a todo list made some new friends extended on ios app with some new features and yeah changing the color and here is a list of basically the things we did and uh yeah of course so we want to thank code academy for hosting the event and also swiftly thinking for uh because that's where we got our base app and google for making life easier you can basically google anything and github because that's where we store a project so yeah thanks for listening do you have any questions thank you alex yeah so uh i have a couple questions and that way the judges can like write down any notes or start filling out their score cards for the categories uh i wanted to ask you so you live in sweden that means uh english is not your first language right no it's not all right and you're presented in english anyway so whatever yeah great um so the app you decide to make a yellow because it looks better in the in the black text were you trying to make it look like uh postit notes like the sticky notes that you can write to those with was that the idea um well it uh now that you mentioned it kind of looks like todo list and uh i guess it's one one thing that i think makes it fit okay and also you mentioned also you mentioned that you didn't have a mac to program this and then you got one later is that what it was you got a hold of a mac so you could code this yeah basically bought the new macbook air you just you bought the macbook okay you just bought the computer yes i was in need of a laptop anyway and i couldn't choose between windows or mac and now i have a need of mac so i bought it okay yeah great uh i don't have any other questions uh judges if you have any general questions you can ask them now otherwise we'll wait until the end that way it's kind of like a fair ground for both teams uh going through the same process do you have anything in general that you want to ask or add uh we can we can we can hold everything until after unless uh sorry you had something out no uh not right now okay yeah then then we're good to see uh other things and uh thanks for presenting that there i think the this is cool to see extending something that exists already with some of your own tweaks on it if we have time afterwards we'll have to get more into how you're thinking about the edit feature sure if you guys want to see the code i can show you later all right awesome well let's move on to satish and team newbies uh alex you can stop sharing your screen there perfect so swish whenever you're ready okay uh is my screen visible now yep you're good okay so we have built a app which is a stop watch it's a basic application uh stop watch and uh we we have used four tools uh now while learning swift ui one is the x code itself and then there's a simulator which will show the mobile uh how the actual device looks like the app is it's just like a simulator how you can simulate your app on a different models of iphone so that is a simulator that is one tool i used and the other one is i used this profiler this profile to find out uh where something is going wrong uh why the cpu utilization is high and while i was building this app trying to use xcode the simulator my mac got my mac heated up i don't know why but this consumes these apps consumes a lot of battery power of the mac i'm not sure if you guys have faced that issue and the other uh app i used was sf symbols so uh this was like uh because i found out this from the documentation of apple as well this is the symbols which you can use in the code uh to get the buttons like the system name you can view the system name and it will render that so i am going to resume this now my mac is already heated up it's taking a while okay so this is how the app looks like it is a it is having a text button which shows the number of minutes colon the number of seconds this is the right arrow button the blue triangle to start the timer and this is the backward and on to reset the timer so i'm going to uh preview start the preview with of this uh stopwatch okay so when i hit uh click on this start button the timer starts and then when it reaches 59 it will become 0 and then 1 is one will come here in the minutes place and then you can stop the timer you can also reset it so uh this is all this is what i have read this view it it works perfectly when i preview this which is inside the explode however when i run this on a simulator when i run this on a simulator uh the text does not get gets updated i don't know why i was trying to read about this state and binding and i'm not sure how the um binding works maybe because it's swift ui language is new i also uh read about you know saw the different code which is provided by uh the code academy in the learning part and i was trying to figure out how to use the environment object how to use the state variable and the binding um however in the simulator the values do not get refreshed as in when the seconds change uh so i have to look into that maybe practice more or read the documentation and then fix that issue this is all i have thank you all right thank you so much satish thank you for the demo and yeah those questions that you were having a binding on the state like i'm sure that uh i mean i'm sure that you're gonna keep learning this after we're done with the hackathon you're gonna keep uh getting better so i'm sure this app is gonna look great in like with another two weeks so uh now we are going to the q a with the judges and both teams are here to present both uh i'll let you uh run with it galena and ben whatever questions you want to ask either team uh first just want to say that i think those are both very different in terms of like how they're scoped and conceptualized but you know it's it's tough so there's so many new things like both of you are talking about that you had to like figure out through the process so just being able to like set up the environment get running start messing around with things start like adding to and playing around with it exactly like why we try to structure these so i'm really impressed to see like a lot of like the great work happening so i just want to leave with that um and then going back to what i was talking about a little earlier with uh team shuhiya uh so you could you mentioned you had that starting to do app base that you were working on and then we're coming up with the edit feature from it what did you find was challenging when you're trying to implement that edit feature did something not work as intended or was it kind of smooth sailing it was the date uh so uh so one of the features though if i was missing was a due date what to do without the due date is like uh it's like very low probability that or at least for me that i will finish it so i i googled the date uh the date picker and i added it to the to one of the or maybe it's easier if you just share screen see uh could you repeat the question again i i'm very bad at remembering no worries i was just asking what did you find interesting when you're building the edit feature so well the interesting part was how finding out how the app works how it's structured and the guy that built the app he used uh something called uh i don't remember but uh have you guys heard of like oneway data flow like uh redux for example so uh basically he uh okay every time i read that i i think of javascript but the let's in swift it's a constant so basically yeah so every time we kind of we want to do a change to a todo list we cannot change it directly by assigning id and that was a very challenging problem for me at least uh uh i i had to like i had to kind of create a new todo for every small change that i did to it and then remove the old one and replace it with the new one gotcha that makes sense and also how the how we style things that the order is uh important yeah that's a really good takeaway to have for swift ui for those modifiers it kind of sneaks up on you but the order will change the way that things look especially if you're trying to change the theming around yeah and i was talking about the date picker i remember now so uh the something cost uh it was something about the date pick where that caused the entire app to somehow collapse into one to do and that was one of the hardest challenging i think uh i had so we had this space app that worked so we implemented a feature and for some reason we didn't like commit until we made like a lot of changes and so we couldn't really roll back so instead i just copied and like i just took the base app and then rebuilt it from the ground until i found the bug that must have been very time consuming i thought it would yeah i i thought so too but but i found the bug pretty quickly because uh it was only one i could some i i knew which which of these files the problem was uh uh yeah which uh which file the problem was where the problem was on and then i could somehow then i added like components to component until the entire thing collapsed so gadget i think i think it was fun yeah definitely well thanks for getting interested because yeah that gives us a much better sense of like kind of what you're thinking around i'm looking at then i had one more for uh satish and team newbies uh what how did you implement like um the ticking up so like to make it so that the timer worked at all because i know you mentioned that there's some challenges between the simulator and the preview but like how did you make it so that every second the number would change uh yes so when i thought about this uh stopwatch uh that was all always there in the back of mind i was thinking uh how i would do that how should i do that because it's a new programming language i'm learning uh so i was uh it was always there in the back of mind that uh how i should be implementing that but i uh i did not work on that initially i started working on the views uh to first keep the uh initially how i started off i thought i'll uh uh i know what i want on my stopwatch stopwatch i need a text box and then i need a two buttons just like how we have a stopwatch on every iphone so that is how i visualize i want it to be but then slowly slowly when i started uh uh seeing the final project of code history which is there on the uh learning path then i realized that is not how uh views are done and i also watch some of the videos uh provided by apple in the developer uh portal and i also saw there there there is one other project provided by code academy that is address book uh address book uh project so it's kind of a different way of building or you visualize your app but the way you implement it is a bit different however it is quite uh interesting to build uh apps with swift ui there are there are many classes many a lot of functionality provided placement so how i thought of ticking this timer is like i was uh reading through the documentation to find out uh if there is any timer related uh object or a class which is provided by the framework and i did find one video where one of the apple engineer is uh you know a building a a podcast player for the uh for the watch apple watch so there uh a code code was provided which was related to a health kit but that did not fit into the project where i am trying to do a simple one and then so i was i used the documentation and then uh made that logic that i know okay first it has to come to when that even it's it's a simple uh uh published timer wherein you have to check uh if it becomes 59 then you have to increase one minute and then reset the seconds to zero again count i think that makes sense i think using the like timer that then publish is exactly how i would have done that as well and i love how when you're explaining how you're trying to find resources your kind of resourcefulness and looking at everything we have on our platform and then also looking at like the wwdc videos and the documentation because those are all very good sources for trying to find out different ways of writing that so appreciate that answer thank you judges uh we have a chat a question from the chat uh somebody's asking well basically complaining that apple makes you use a mac to code in xcode can you explain why is that a compilation thing like the processor hardware what's what's keeping people from running xcoding windows i guess the real question is why would apple spend resources to let people do it on windows and you know like i think alex is a great example of this saying like well i want to do mac development so i was debating between windows and the mac so i decided to end up getting a mac and that's pretty much exactly what apple wants people to do is say well if you want to do ios development you can go ahead and this is what we allow it to be used on so they really just don't have any interest in letting you do it on other platforms and they can get away with it i guess like theoretically android could try doing the same thing too but you can do all kinds of android development that you want to the kind of other broader answers like windows is a little bit more particular as like an operating system than like some of the unixbased ones so you have to do things a little bit differently if you're not building for it initially and apple just has no interest in investing in it so you're right that it's annoying though it's hard to get into if you don't already have access to a mac okay all right so do you have any other do you have any questions galena um no i i think i'm i think i'm good all right well then i guess we are uh ready for some of the judging and the feedback uh you both have listened to the presentations you've bought got some questions in and heard their logic behind how they built the apps and why they did it that way we've heard both satish and alex say that they've had to look for resources outside and that most of the time not most of the time but often they had to you know go around the internet and research stuff so they definitely put the effort and the time and now would love to hear any feedback or any thoughts you have on this actually freddie i'm so sorry to interrupt you can i jump in with one quick question yeah okay i'm very very curious uh why you guys chose to build the app that you chose so uh satish why a stopwatch and alex why a todo list i wanted to uh build a simple app uh why i chose is because uh it was it's there on my phone i have an iphone and uh i have used a stopwatch so i wanted to build a stopwatch because it's also an ios application okay so i think the first reason why i chose or we didn't really bother we the team voted and we chose the todo list and i thought it was a great idea because i used to do this all the time i used to do east and uh and i thought that it should be pretty easy to create something that you already know how it works and you might have something maybe i might add something that i'm missing from other to do is to do this as well so that's why i i was motivated on doing the todo list all right awesome i mean i think another way of putting it uh you're saying you know it should be easy to do i think um another way of thinking about it is you know you have a time constraint and that there's a lot to do so sometimes uh you're looking for easy things to do not because they're easy but because they're going to be better to it's going to be better to structure them and to get them done in the time that you have so all right so uh back to the judges galena and ben feel free to share any feedback you have with every team each team any thoughts uh maybe how they could take the apps uh next from here they want to keep working on them any recommendations the floor is yours uh great so next steps good things uh i guess i'm uh newbies so figuring out how to like what that simulator bug is is probably a good place to start on that and like for specific resources since you if you don't have the code up on like github or something i would just push it up there so other people might be able to access it and then in our discord channel we have an ios specific thing that i think some people might have found each other at so that might be a good starting point for saying like posting and saying hey can you take a look at this and let us see like what the challenge is i try to take a look so if you get that there i would love to go and take a look for figuring out why it's not working the same way on simulator as it is in the preview so i think that's going to be your first next step i think of a great base to be working from uh in order to kind of like be building that kind of stopwatch app like i think you did a really good job of identifying the right set of features to be starting with like you need to start you need to pause you need to reset that's exactly i think how i started as well and then you can start looking at building out other features from there like you know having multiple different like like timers or counting down instead of off and whatnot once you figure out what that bug looks like that's my that's my newbie feedback i know if i gleam of notes on the shoe yeah that you want to go over um you know i think ben you had a lot of great points uh yep would love to see you take this a step further see if you can implement a feature where the um the minutes are decreasing or the seconds are decreasing would love to also see some design around it it would be cool if you can implement uh just add like a title heading uh something of um aesthetic uh aesthetically pleasing like visualization uh that would be really cool too so yeah we'd love to see where you take this further and then on shuhiya i think starting with a like to do app from like an existing framework and building on it is a great way to kind of like get a understanding about like what is this framework like what can you do in it so i think that's a great place to get started what i'd recommend that you do is kind of like a next step is to take that as a base of inspiration and then try to go off and build something where you aren't starting with a template because you can start figuring out a lot of like what did the template need and what did it not need and start piecing together a lot more of like how that's built together but i love like being able to just say like hey we know this works we're gonna go ahead and get running with this and then figure out how to tweet something is a great place to start on that so i like that you're able to kind of like say like hey we don't have a lot of time how can we start making some tweaks or something to get something accomplished there so that's kind of my recommendation for next steps as i start building out kind of like a simpler version that you own all the like parts of so that you're not using that boilerplate for it uh and then i love some of the work that you're doing around like the editing that you mentioned like i think that you're a really creative solution for figuring out how to adjust and you know they have this whole complex like redux like management thing for storage and like you figured out how to actually make the edits you wanted and purchase those which i think is great and then add that theme as well and mess around with a lot of those dude modifiers yeah and i i thought that um it was a great looking app um i think that the due date is going to be super helpful for anybody uh that's using a todo list application um so i noticed that you had some cool shadow on some of the buttons so a lot of minor intricacies that uh stood out and yeah i mean it's it's awesome that you're also able to um get started on a mac and not only learn xcode and swift and swift ui and everything that comes with the ios system but also a completely new machine so all right well uh thank you for the feedback uh now the moment that we've all been waiting for uh i don't know if you lena ben want to talk to each other uh or slack or something for a minute and try to decide um you know on your scorecards and final thoughts while you do that i'll just uh be following up with alex and satish here i think um you got guys you both said that uh did you have any background in coding before you were doing this hackathon either of you do you have a background have you coded in other programming languages yeah okay uh one at a time so satish what uh what background do you have in programming yeah sorry for that alex uh in java programming okay java um and you alex what do you what kind of programming do you do um so well from the university i also have java programming but from high school i had c sharp programming and then right now i've programmed with html yeah the oh the frontend stack like css javascript react okay good cool so i guess uh swift was sort of uh new new for both of you um and i guess you both had kind of like a basic understanding of programming so you could hit the ground running based on the content of the swift ui coursework that you had access to and how much you had to go outside to look for resources or look for their information to build your app uh what would you say that is the ratio like did you find yourself having to go outside of the program like frequently did you find the content that that was in the culture for sweep ui very useful i want to hear your thoughts on anything that you said that you think that might have been missing or that could be improved well one thing that i'm missing is like usually when i study at code academy i can like read some read something about code and then i can code and then and then like do it all again but on on swift ui it seems like you have you need a mac in order to follow the course or else you just end up reading everything and forgetting about a lot of it that's what happened for me at least so i ended up looking at the different sites like apple and well usually i google i don't really remember all the different sites i've been to one of them had the date picker and uh but the ratio i would say like uh maybe 50 because i also went back to course and looked for for example what the v stack does okay uh so the learning path which was provided to us uh the swift ui learning path uh it is good it is very comprehensive and it has a lot of text one thing i appreciate about uh code academy is uh there are no uh videos everything is text so you so whoever is taking the course uh he he or she has to read has to understand and then try to implement it so that is one good thing i know i i have taken lot of courses uh in coursera however what happens is you tend to i know when you're watching a video uh like a training video uh you cannot sit in front of the computer for a long time you have to take breaks but uh with uh code academy everything is text based and you can also take it on your mobile phone and you can read and you can understand you can try to recollect whatever you read so when you're reading so you also tend to keep in mind some of the terminologies of that programming language which is being used so there's uh it's a good thing uh i went to i chose to go for a lot of other resources outside of code academy because uh we were short of time and i remember last monday when ben said you can jump in and see the final project and get some idea so that is how i started off and then saw different projects how it how the views are developed to make a full single ios application so uh it's good though there are no videos in code academy that's fine but uh it's good and uh the developer documentation wwc dc videos are they are not very lengthy though they uh it just they ex the apple engineers uh now make it a point to explain the concepts very simple and straightforward uh within a half an hour uh window 30 minute video window okay yeah so it sounds like you went for outside resources when you were looking for very specific to answer very specific questions because you probably didn't know what part of the course work in swift ui data and that question was so rather than taking the time to go through the entire course to see where that where that question is you can just go to the internet and go to other resources where you can search for the specific problem that you're having or the specific thing that you're trying to solve so that makes sense okay um yeah judges how are you doing have you arrived at a conclusion we believe we have we're we're doing good okay so without without further ado here uh we have uh the the winner of our ios uh hackathon the code academy hackathon number two is team newbies came down to the wire thank you so talking over at high level i think we like that you kind of picked something that was a little bit challenging that you know we didn't have in any of our materials so trying to figure some of that concept out uh you kind of came up with your own idea of what you wanted to do there you said as galena mentioned the comments there's definitely some more work you can do around design quality and what that looks like so that's kind of like a good growth area as you start exploring more on that um and then also fixing that one uh like simulator bug that you have there uh and then team chuhia we thought you did great work on this so again this came down to a point to the rubric that we had um we think that like the demo that you had was really great for going over kind of like in a lot of detail on the slides like how you conceptualized your work how you're kind of like identifying what you're building there we really like for the design aspect of it how you're tweaking that and trying to add like you know playing around the modifiers making it adds to kind of what your own like take would be like um that you picked some interesting features to work on um but brought down a little bit for creativity mainly because there's a different app that you're kind of starting from and then moving forwards on um which again it's a great thing to do from learning so there's i think across the board like great for diving into new frameworks and was really impressed with a lot of the work that we saw especially this is coming into like not knowing anything about the framework and then taking two weeks to build it together super impressive so really appreciate all the work that everyone did as part of this and uh it was really great to look and see these projects awesome well thank you both um i'm hoping that station alex you got some good feedback from the judges and some areas of growth to focus and keep if you keep developing the swift ui apps um i think uh the only thing left to say is congratulations to the winning team and you know don't be demoralized for the losing team uh like the judges said it was close so you you know it was it was right there i think uh at the end of the day just the point of hackathons is to learn and to push yourself to learn something new so everybody wins in that regard exactly yeah i think that uh well i like that satish win and also because uh sounds very determined or uh like uh i don't really know how but i get a good vibe from uh satish nice maybe you you guys should stay in touch maybe you should stay in touch and participate together in hackathon number three when it comes up maybe you two can come up with a winning team for the next one um okay then i'll send everybody off uh we've been here for a while live so thank you everybody for watching on youtube and if you're going to be watching this into in the future remember that you can check us out at codeacademy.com to learn all the coursework and if you're interested in the next hackathon go to our community page community.codeacademy.com and find the hackathon chapter that's the one where we publish all the hackathons with all the information and we'll see you on the next hackathon thank you everybody for coming bye bye i'm going okay
