00:00 - hello my name is Farish and i'm a
00:02 - california-based developer and in this
00:05 - video we're continuing off of my
00:08 - previous video on how to build a
00:09 - portfolio and we're gonna dig a little
00:12 - deeper and go a little farther and talk
00:14 - about hosting and showcasing your
00:16 - portfolio in in a way we're gonna talk
00:19 - about marketing yourself so let's get
00:22 - started to start things off I've created
00:25 - a wireframe example of a portfolio site
00:28 - and in this site I'm gonna mention what
00:30 - to include that potential employers and
00:32 - clients might be looking for then I want
00:36 - to go over finding inspiration for your
00:38 - portfolio site and what looking for
00:40 - inspiration I'm gonna discuss the
00:42 - potential mental traps to avoid also
00:46 - these sites are a great way to market
00:47 - yourself they don't talk about LinkedIn
00:51 - if it's available in your country as a
00:53 - way to market yourself and showcase your
00:55 - site I'm gonna go over hosting your site
00:59 - via github and if you like using
01:02 - traditional hosting for the same result
01:07 - lastly I'm going to discuss some options
01:10 - when you want to host something that
01:12 - isn't just plain HTML CSS and JavaScript
01:16 - let's head on over to the wireframe I'm
01:21 - over here at figma calm and figma is a
01:24 - wire framing site to help you make
01:27 - mock-ups it's free so if you're ever
01:30 - curious about wire framing I would
01:32 - suggest checking it out so I'm gonna
01:36 - start off by making disclaimer here this
01:39 - is not a discussion about what your site
01:41 - should look like but more of what I
01:43 - believe it should include if you're
01:46 - intimidated by looking up other
01:48 - developers portfolio sites there's
01:51 - nothing wrong to make something as
01:53 - simple as being Illustrated here the
01:55 - point is to get something up and running
01:57 - as your skills grow there's nothing
02:00 - wrong with then changing your site to
02:02 - demonstrate your latest skills so let's
02:04 - start by exploring this wireframe and as
02:08 - you can see here this is my intro or
02:10 - home page I did include a home link
02:13 - obviously you should have one there's
02:16 - not any major information here I just
02:19 - mentioned a couple hobbies and not much
02:21 - else you could treat this like about
02:23 - page you don't have to follow this style
02:26 - right whatever you're comfortable with
02:28 - now if you notice here I have a contact
02:32 - link and I have a contact page and what
02:36 - I recommend is that you don't use your
02:39 - regular email account because when this
02:41 - is on a public-facing website
02:44 - you're gonna hit with a lot of spam I
02:46 - would create a separate gmail or hotmail
02:49 - or whatever you prefer for this now if
02:52 - you want to put your phone number that's
02:54 - perfectly fine I would recommend getting
02:57 - a new one from Google Voice it is a free
03:01 - service and if it isn't available in
03:03 - your country I would use a messaging
03:06 - service like whatsapp or telegram and be
03:09 - sure to include which program you're
03:11 - using and what is your ID and don't
03:14 - forget to add any social media accounts
03:16 - you're heavily active with now the next
03:19 - page is the skills section and let me
03:22 - tell you the story which has always led
03:25 - me to say put your strongest skill first
03:27 - so I have a friend who is a senior level
03:31 - Ruby on Rails developer and he likes to
03:35 - put his skills in alphabetical order he
03:39 - had applied for a job and got a email
03:41 - back from the company that said that
03:44 - they felt he wouldn't be good fit he was
03:46 - kind of in shock because he was more
03:48 - than qualified for the position so he
03:51 - emailed back and finally got a phone
03:54 - meeting with their technical recruiter
03:56 - and the recruiter told him you posted
04:00 - CSS HTML and JavaScript before Ruby on
04:04 - Rails and the recruiter thought that he
04:06 - was employing that Ruby on Rails was
04:08 - this wicked skill level always place
04:12 - your strongest skill first if it's Ruby
04:16 - enrolls do that and even if it's not
04:20 - your strongest skill if this is the job
04:23 - you're applying for I still would put it
04:25 - first and let them know that you feel
04:27 - your call
04:27 - fight for the job show confidence even
04:30 - in your portfolio and resume now let's
04:35 - talk about your portfolio as you can see
04:38 - I have a portfolio link and I'm gonna go
04:40 - ahead and click on the profile link page
04:42 - and what I did here was I had taken
04:45 - screenshots of a couple sites no I did
04:47 - not do these sites I have my own but for
04:50 - demonstration purposes I would do the
04:53 - same thing and that's that's how I would
04:55 - approach it but I would put a couple
04:59 - screenshots of the site she done I would
05:02 - usually include at least three projects
05:04 - that's a good number to me I feel it
05:07 - gets things across I would go by order
05:10 - of difficulty your most advanced project
05:13 - first along with a couple others and as
05:18 - a beginner you may not have many options
05:20 - but you still want to show some growth
05:23 - then lastly I have a github link and I
05:27 - would make sure that's on there and I
05:29 - would also have a notable projects list
05:32 - and what I mean by that is if you have
05:35 - like six summer projects pick your three
05:38 - best ones and have them there and you
05:40 - might be asking isn't the same as the
05:43 - portfolio yes and no the portfolio links
05:46 - to the actual site sometimes Tech
05:48 - recruiters don't care about looks or
05:50 - seeing the actual site they're gonna
05:52 - find out within your code what you can
05:54 - do and they don't always have time to go
05:56 - through your whole github so you want to
05:59 - kind of guide them to your best projects
06:01 - I feel this is a really good practice
06:03 - for you and don't worry as a beginner
06:05 - they're not expecting that much they
06:08 - just want to see if your code matches
06:10 - what they're looking for now let's talk
06:13 - about finding inspiration for your
06:16 - portfolio site and how that can lead you
06:18 - into an imposter syndrome trap and as
06:22 - you can see I'm over here at Google and
06:24 - it is really easy to search for
06:26 - developer portfolio inspiration here
06:28 - let's take a look at one of the sites
06:30 - I've found and do a walk-through now I'm
06:34 - over here on Matt's site and it's a
06:37 - really nice site and if you notice in
06:39 - the beginning he has a little
06:40 - introduction
06:41 - like I did in the wireframe and if we
06:44 - scroll down some more
06:45 - he gives additional information here it
06:48 - talks about his experience you scroll
06:50 - down some more he shows his skills
06:52 - levels and there's a lot of information
06:55 - here and this is a point where I don't
06:57 - want you to start getting intimidated
06:59 - because you can't fill it up as much as
07:01 - this guy has one thing I want you
07:04 - understand right here is that you're not
07:06 - competing with them when starting your
07:09 - portfolio nobody expects you to have the
07:11 - level of information that this site has
07:13 - the role trap is when you search for
07:16 - inspiration on Google usually the better
07:19 - sites come up first you expect these
07:22 - sites to be better than what you can
07:24 - produce in the beginning what we want to
07:27 - avoid is letting imposter syndrome and
07:30 - fear cause you to avoid starting your
07:32 - portfolio site so keep that in the back
07:35 - of your mind when you're searching for
07:36 - inspiration you expect the best to come
07:39 - up in the search results
07:41 - don't let that ruin your confidence
07:43 - because you're not at the point to
07:45 - achieve something similar use these
07:48 - sites to search for what you can achieve
07:50 - in the future and also for potential
07:53 - informational ideas to put in now I'm
07:57 - going to talk about two other resources
07:59 - you can use to find inspiration for your
08:01 - portfolio website and we're going to
08:03 - start with dribble I'm over here at
08:06 - dribble and it is a community / social
08:10 - media network for designers I felt it
08:13 - was important to show you this site
08:15 - because even though this video is about
08:17 - portfolios you can find a lot of
08:20 - inspiration here there are a lot of
08:23 - cutting edge trends to be discovered and
08:25 - for example I'm going to click on this
08:28 - site over here and it has the look and
08:30 - feel of industrial design using CSS grid
08:34 - and if you notice the designer put an
08:37 - email address Skype and telegram ID here
08:40 - so as you grow and experience this is
08:43 - also a great place to market your skills
08:46 - now I'm going to search for a portfolio
08:48 - here but I'm not going to go into each
08:51 - one of these the idea here is that you
08:54 - should
08:55 - click on a design that catches your
08:57 - attention and see what ideas you can
08:59 - borrow from it now let's head on over to
09:02 - the awards website I'm over here at the
09:06 - awards site and I will have a direct
09:08 - link to this interval in the show notes
09:10 - below
09:11 - unlike durable this is a competition
09:14 - site websites are submitted to be scored
09:17 - and reviewed but the reason I'm showing
09:20 - you this site is as an additional
09:22 - resource for inspiration and there are
09:25 - different categories to search through I
09:27 - happen to be in the portfolio section
09:29 - and this designers website has caught my
09:32 - eye so I'm going to click on that and
09:34 - see what it looks like up close so in
09:38 - this first section of this website the
09:40 - developer has contact information and
09:43 - social media if I scroll down a little
09:46 - farther you'll notice a list of projects
09:49 - and links to them and if I go past the
09:53 - project section he has a list of his
09:55 - skills so I'm gonna go back to what I
09:58 - stated earlier these are some of the
10:01 - items you should always include with
10:03 - your site and as you progress in your
10:05 - skill level don't be afraid to submit
10:07 - some sites here I'm working on a project
10:10 - that should be completed by the end of
10:12 - the year and I'm gonna submit it here
10:14 - and the reason being is I believe the
10:16 - design is competitive and I really have
10:19 - nothing to lose the worst thing that can
10:22 - happen is you don't get award so what if
10:25 - you get a high score or award that could
10:29 - be career changing now we're gonna talk
10:31 - about marketing yourself and showcasing
10:34 - your portfolio on LinkedIn so I'm over
10:37 - here at LinkedIn and the first thing I
10:39 - like to say is whatever you're planning
10:41 - on a career choice how you're gonna
10:43 - approach it etc you should make a
10:46 - LinkedIn page for yourself unlike other
10:49 - social media platforms chop myrrh cumin
10:52 - is heavily integrated here now I'm gonna
10:56 - use my profile to cover some of the
10:58 - items you should do on here and
10:59 - something you shouldn't do which I
11:02 - actually did so starting off you will
11:07 - know
11:07 - is this contact info link and when you
11:11 - click on it you'll see that it has my
11:13 - website email address and Twitter handle
11:16 - that's all good but let's talk about my
11:19 - mistake here my website isn't up I
11:23 - pulled it off the internet about 6
11:25 - months ago before the making of this
11:27 - video now I've been working on revamping
11:30 - it but life happens and you get
11:32 - sidetracked because you're too busy and
11:36 - one of my biggest issues is I never
11:38 - really liked my site I just needed
11:41 - something up and running back around
11:43 - 2015 I shoulda never pulled my site down
11:47 - I shall lift it up and maybe at worse
11:51 - putting a new site coming soon message
11:54 - or pop-up I created a big hole in my
11:57 - portfolio and profile because I pulled
12:01 - my site down that might have been more
12:04 - vanity on my part but it's something
12:06 - important to remember now I'm going to
12:09 - point out a couple other things here
12:11 - first in this section there's an
12:13 - introduction area and as part of this
12:16 - area there's a option to include some
12:19 - links on here I included my most recent
12:23 - video for code Academy a start up event
12:27 - where I was featured as a guest speaker
12:29 - on react native and one of my older
12:33 - YouTube videos as you're starting out
12:37 - this would be a good place to put links
12:38 - to projects you have worked on don't
12:41 - worry about the skill level in the
12:42 - beginning just show that's your coding
12:46 - now the other item I like to point out
12:49 - is this section that's a little farther
12:51 - down here you will see some recent
12:54 - profile views and search results and
12:57 - this is why I stated earlier you should
13:00 - start your LinkedIn account now even if
13:02 - you're not ready to put your portfolio
13:04 - up I get about three to five recruitment
13:07 - messages a week and these are
13:09 - opportunities that won't exist anywhere
13:12 - else now in case you're wondering what
13:15 - is triggering these search results
13:17 - really I mentioned to make sure you have
13:19 - a list of skills in your portfolio
13:21 - you want to have those same skills
13:23 - listed on LinkedIn these search results
13:26 - are happening whenever somebody searches
13:28 - for react developers in the LA area so
13:32 - when you update your portfolio consider
13:35 - to update your information over here
13:37 - skills and links to recent projects can
13:40 - get you help found in this system now
13:44 - let's go on over and talk about github
13:46 - and some hosting options no I'm over
13:49 - here at github and I'm already assuming
13:52 - that you know the basics of get if you
13:55 - don't don't worry just visit the code
13:57 - Academy course on using the command line
14:00 - and get now to set up your free site
14:02 - hosting all you have to do is make a new
14:05 - repository and with that repository you
14:08 - have to name it a specific way your
14:10 - username which in this case is Farish
14:12 - cash plus dot github dot
14:17 - any files you push to this repo will be
14:21 - available at the URL your username
14:25 - github dot IL to demonstrate this I am
14:30 - currently pushing an index.html file to
14:34 - this repository now I'm going to hit
14:36 - reload and we can see the file is there
14:40 - now I'm going to go to the address bar
14:42 - and type the name of the repo as a URL
14:45 - now I'm gonna go ahead and type Farish
14:49 - cache dot github dot
14:54 - let's give this a moment to load and as
14:58 - you can see I have a very plain text web
15:00 - site here the good news is github is now
15:04 - ready to be used to host your portfolio
15:06 - so the next thing I like to discuss is
15:10 - what if you want a little bit more
15:11 - control and maybe your own domain name
15:14 - along with the email address well this
15:18 - is where web hosting would be used
15:19 - instead let's talk about that some over
15:24 - here at my web hosting service and the
15:27 - area I'm ian is called the cPanel and I
15:30 - have some items blurred off for privacy
15:32 - reasons but what I really want to point
15:35 - out here is the item called email
15:38 - accounts as long as I own a domain name
15:42 - I could generate as many email accounts
15:45 - for that domain as I like that's part of
15:48 - this service and this is a major
15:51 - advantage over github since github
15:54 - doesn't even offer email as a service
15:56 - and if you care about branding and maybe
16:00 - what would be considered to be a more
16:01 - professional look having your own domain
16:04 - name and email address is an advantage
16:08 - over github pages and Gmail in this
16:12 - regards but let me emphasize this this
16:16 - is based on your goals and your budget
16:19 - considerations in the beginning there's
16:22 - nothing wrong with not spending money
16:24 - and using github in Gmail especially
16:28 - when getting started now github and web
16:31 - hosting is great for hosting websites
16:34 - that are just vanilla HTML CSS
16:37 - JavaScript and maybe some jQuery what if
16:40 - you need to host something more advanced
16:42 - let's talk about that so to start off
16:47 - one thing I like to point out is that
16:49 - once you get into more advanced projects
16:51 - you're free options start to become
16:54 - limited and in case you're wondering
16:59 - couldn't you just
17:01 - host react and few GS projects on github
17:05 - well you can but if the project is more
17:10 - than just a single page app additional
17:13 - complications can occur and sometimes
17:16 - all this extra work is not worth it
17:19 - especially considering the other options
17:22 - out there so I'm going to start with the
17:25 - front end right now and talk about
17:27 - Search Search is a site we use for our
17:30 - react intents of course it is free and
17:33 - it is easy to use you just run the npm
17:36 - command to install surge and then you go
17:39 - to your project directory and you run
17:41 - the search command in there search will
17:44 - give you a URL for your project you just
17:47 - have to link that URL to your portfolio
17:49 - and then you're done now two sites that
17:53 - are so long to search is the net liffe I
17:56 - and Zeit both are free and they both
18:01 - offer a similar type of deployment
18:04 - experience and I do think this is easier
18:07 - than dealing with potential issues using
18:09 - github pages especially with multi-page
18:13 - applications using reactive UJS now with
18:18 - back in or full stack free choices
18:21 - become very limited yep Heroku which
18:25 - allows you to have five web apps and
18:28 - these apps will become suspended after
18:31 - not being used for 30 minutes so when
18:34 - somebody visits your app there'll be a
18:36 - delay due to spin up time
18:40 - now there's firebase which is owned by
18:44 - Google and firebase offers free database
18:47 - and hosting service firebase will give
18:50 - you limited bandwidth into space but it
18:52 - should be good enough for most portfolio
18:55 - use cases then there's Amazon Web
18:59 - Services and they offer a free tier for
19:02 - one year and this is basically a VPS
19:05 - virtual private server and this requires
19:08 - some configuration to use now there may
19:12 - be other free services out there but
19:15 - I'm listing out the ones that are
19:17 - well-known now with these services there
19:20 - is some configuration involved and it
19:22 - can be complicated at times so in this
19:25 - case when you're setting this up you're
19:28 - learning deployment at the same time
19:31 - now if these free surfaces do not offer
19:35 - enough for your situation you should
19:37 - consider getting a VPS one of the more
19:41 - popular providers this digital ocean and
19:44 - the reason being is that they offer
19:46 - templates to help set up your VPS now I
19:50 - do believe if you're gonna go into this
19:52 - direction you should take some time to
19:55 - see if you can learn how to do your own
19:57 - deployment it is a great skill set to
20:00 - add to your resume now in this video we
20:03 - covered a lot so let's do a recap here
20:06 - now I'm doing a different kind of recap
20:09 - for this video and the reason being is
20:11 - that you know we went over five sections
20:14 - and there was a lot of material I
20:16 - covered in this video but truth be told
20:19 - I could have spent hours on each section
20:21 - and the main goal here is to give you
20:25 - some sort of guidance and a path to
20:27 - follow if you're unsure what to do but
20:30 - even if you don't agree with what I
20:33 - suggest maybe it makes you uncomfortable
20:34 - signing up with a LinkedIn or going on
20:38 - to your Bowl in the word site and
20:40 - putting your material out there do
20:43 - something it's better than doing nothing
20:46 - and that's the most important message I
20:49 - can convey to you in this video now if
20:54 - you have any questions make sure to
20:55 - leave a comment below and don't forget
20:57 - to Like and subscribe for future videos
21:00 - thanks for watching happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

hello my name is Farish and i'm a californiabased developer and in this video we're continuing off of my previous video on how to build a portfolio and we're gonna dig a little deeper and go a little farther and talk about hosting and showcasing your portfolio in in a way we're gonna talk about marketing yourself so let's get started to start things off I've created a wireframe example of a portfolio site and in this site I'm gonna mention what to include that potential employers and clients might be looking for then I want to go over finding inspiration for your portfolio site and what looking for inspiration I'm gonna discuss the potential mental traps to avoid also these sites are a great way to market yourself they don't talk about LinkedIn if it's available in your country as a way to market yourself and showcase your site I'm gonna go over hosting your site via github and if you like using traditional hosting for the same result lastly I'm going to discuss some options when you want to host something that isn't just plain HTML CSS and JavaScript let's head on over to the wireframe I'm over here at figma calm and figma is a wire framing site to help you make mockups it's free so if you're ever curious about wire framing I would suggest checking it out so I'm gonna start off by making disclaimer here this is not a discussion about what your site should look like but more of what I believe it should include if you're intimidated by looking up other developers portfolio sites there's nothing wrong to make something as simple as being Illustrated here the point is to get something up and running as your skills grow there's nothing wrong with then changing your site to demonstrate your latest skills so let's start by exploring this wireframe and as you can see here this is my intro or home page I did include a home link obviously you should have one there's not any major information here I just mentioned a couple hobbies and not much else you could treat this like about page you don't have to follow this style right whatever you're comfortable with now if you notice here I have a contact link and I have a contact page and what I recommend is that you don't use your regular email account because when this is on a publicfacing website you're gonna hit with a lot of spam I would create a separate gmail or hotmail or whatever you prefer for this now if you want to put your phone number that's perfectly fine I would recommend getting a new one from Google Voice it is a free service and if it isn't available in your country I would use a messaging service like whatsapp or telegram and be sure to include which program you're using and what is your ID and don't forget to add any social media accounts you're heavily active with now the next page is the skills section and let me tell you the story which has always led me to say put your strongest skill first so I have a friend who is a senior level Ruby on Rails developer and he likes to put his skills in alphabetical order he had applied for a job and got a email back from the company that said that they felt he wouldn't be good fit he was kind of in shock because he was more than qualified for the position so he emailed back and finally got a phone meeting with their technical recruiter and the recruiter told him you posted CSS HTML and JavaScript before Ruby on Rails and the recruiter thought that he was employing that Ruby on Rails was this wicked skill level always place your strongest skill first if it's Ruby enrolls do that and even if it's not your strongest skill if this is the job you're applying for I still would put it first and let them know that you feel your call fight for the job show confidence even in your portfolio and resume now let's talk about your portfolio as you can see I have a portfolio link and I'm gonna go ahead and click on the profile link page and what I did here was I had taken screenshots of a couple sites no I did not do these sites I have my own but for demonstration purposes I would do the same thing and that's that's how I would approach it but I would put a couple screenshots of the site she done I would usually include at least three projects that's a good number to me I feel it gets things across I would go by order of difficulty your most advanced project first along with a couple others and as a beginner you may not have many options but you still want to show some growth then lastly I have a github link and I would make sure that's on there and I would also have a notable projects list and what I mean by that is if you have like six summer projects pick your three best ones and have them there and you might be asking isn't the same as the portfolio yes and no the portfolio links to the actual site sometimes Tech recruiters don't care about looks or seeing the actual site they're gonna find out within your code what you can do and they don't always have time to go through your whole github so you want to kind of guide them to your best projects I feel this is a really good practice for you and don't worry as a beginner they're not expecting that much they just want to see if your code matches what they're looking for now let's talk about finding inspiration for your portfolio site and how that can lead you into an imposter syndrome trap and as you can see I'm over here at Google and it is really easy to search for developer portfolio inspiration here let's take a look at one of the sites I've found and do a walkthrough now I'm over here on Matt's site and it's a really nice site and if you notice in the beginning he has a little introduction like I did in the wireframe and if we scroll down some more he gives additional information here it talks about his experience you scroll down some more he shows his skills levels and there's a lot of information here and this is a point where I don't want you to start getting intimidated because you can't fill it up as much as this guy has one thing I want you understand right here is that you're not competing with them when starting your portfolio nobody expects you to have the level of information that this site has the role trap is when you search for inspiration on Google usually the better sites come up first you expect these sites to be better than what you can produce in the beginning what we want to avoid is letting imposter syndrome and fear cause you to avoid starting your portfolio site so keep that in the back of your mind when you're searching for inspiration you expect the best to come up in the search results don't let that ruin your confidence because you're not at the point to achieve something similar use these sites to search for what you can achieve in the future and also for potential informational ideas to put in now I'm going to talk about two other resources you can use to find inspiration for your portfolio website and we're going to start with dribble I'm over here at dribble and it is a community / social media network for designers I felt it was important to show you this site because even though this video is about portfolios you can find a lot of inspiration here there are a lot of cutting edge trends to be discovered and for example I'm going to click on this site over here and it has the look and feel of industrial design using CSS grid and if you notice the designer put an email address Skype and telegram ID here so as you grow and experience this is also a great place to market your skills now I'm going to search for a portfolio here but I'm not going to go into each one of these the idea here is that you should click on a design that catches your attention and see what ideas you can borrow from it now let's head on over to the awards website I'm over here at the awards site and I will have a direct link to this interval in the show notes below unlike durable this is a competition site websites are submitted to be scored and reviewed but the reason I'm showing you this site is as an additional resource for inspiration and there are different categories to search through I happen to be in the portfolio section and this designers website has caught my eye so I'm going to click on that and see what it looks like up close so in this first section of this website the developer has contact information and social media if I scroll down a little farther you'll notice a list of projects and links to them and if I go past the project section he has a list of his skills so I'm gonna go back to what I stated earlier these are some of the items you should always include with your site and as you progress in your skill level don't be afraid to submit some sites here I'm working on a project that should be completed by the end of the year and I'm gonna submit it here and the reason being is I believe the design is competitive and I really have nothing to lose the worst thing that can happen is you don't get award so what if you get a high score or award that could be career changing now we're gonna talk about marketing yourself and showcasing your portfolio on LinkedIn so I'm over here at LinkedIn and the first thing I like to say is whatever you're planning on a career choice how you're gonna approach it etc you should make a LinkedIn page for yourself unlike other social media platforms chop myrrh cumin is heavily integrated here now I'm gonna use my profile to cover some of the items you should do on here and something you shouldn't do which I actually did so starting off you will know is this contact info link and when you click on it you'll see that it has my website email address and Twitter handle that's all good but let's talk about my mistake here my website isn't up I pulled it off the internet about 6 months ago before the making of this video now I've been working on revamping it but life happens and you get sidetracked because you're too busy and one of my biggest issues is I never really liked my site I just needed something up and running back around 2015 I shoulda never pulled my site down I shall lift it up and maybe at worse putting a new site coming soon message or popup I created a big hole in my portfolio and profile because I pulled my site down that might have been more vanity on my part but it's something important to remember now I'm going to point out a couple other things here first in this section there's an introduction area and as part of this area there's a option to include some links on here I included my most recent video for code Academy a start up event where I was featured as a guest speaker on react native and one of my older YouTube videos as you're starting out this would be a good place to put links to projects you have worked on don't worry about the skill level in the beginning just show that's your coding now the other item I like to point out is this section that's a little farther down here you will see some recent profile views and search results and this is why I stated earlier you should start your LinkedIn account now even if you're not ready to put your portfolio up I get about three to five recruitment messages a week and these are opportunities that won't exist anywhere else now in case you're wondering what is triggering these search results really I mentioned to make sure you have a list of skills in your portfolio you want to have those same skills listed on LinkedIn these search results are happening whenever somebody searches for react developers in the LA area so when you update your portfolio consider to update your information over here skills and links to recent projects can get you help found in this system now let's go on over and talk about github and some hosting options no I'm over here at github and I'm already assuming that you know the basics of get if you don't don't worry just visit the code Academy course on using the command line and get now to set up your free site hosting all you have to do is make a new repository and with that repository you have to name it a specific way your username which in this case is Farish cash plus dot github dot any files you push to this repo will be available at the URL your username github dot IL to demonstrate this I am currently pushing an index.html file to this repository now I'm going to hit reload and we can see the file is there now I'm going to go to the address bar and type the name of the repo as a URL now I'm gonna go ahead and type Farish cache dot github dot let's give this a moment to load and as you can see I have a very plain text web site here the good news is github is now ready to be used to host your portfolio so the next thing I like to discuss is what if you want a little bit more control and maybe your own domain name along with the email address well this is where web hosting would be used instead let's talk about that some over here at my web hosting service and the area I'm ian is called the cPanel and I have some items blurred off for privacy reasons but what I really want to point out here is the item called email accounts as long as I own a domain name I could generate as many email accounts for that domain as I like that's part of this service and this is a major advantage over github since github doesn't even offer email as a service and if you care about branding and maybe what would be considered to be a more professional look having your own domain name and email address is an advantage over github pages and Gmail in this regards but let me emphasize this this is based on your goals and your budget considerations in the beginning there's nothing wrong with not spending money and using github in Gmail especially when getting started now github and web hosting is great for hosting websites that are just vanilla HTML CSS JavaScript and maybe some jQuery what if you need to host something more advanced let's talk about that so to start off one thing I like to point out is that once you get into more advanced projects you're free options start to become limited and in case you're wondering couldn't you just host react and few GS projects on github well you can but if the project is more than just a single page app additional complications can occur and sometimes all this extra work is not worth it especially considering the other options out there so I'm going to start with the front end right now and talk about Search Search is a site we use for our react intents of course it is free and it is easy to use you just run the npm command to install surge and then you go to your project directory and you run the search command in there search will give you a URL for your project you just have to link that URL to your portfolio and then you're done now two sites that are so long to search is the net liffe I and Zeit both are free and they both offer a similar type of deployment experience and I do think this is easier than dealing with potential issues using github pages especially with multipage applications using reactive UJS now with back in or full stack free choices become very limited yep Heroku which allows you to have five web apps and these apps will become suspended after not being used for 30 minutes so when somebody visits your app there'll be a delay due to spin up time now there's firebase which is owned by Google and firebase offers free database and hosting service firebase will give you limited bandwidth into space but it should be good enough for most portfolio use cases then there's Amazon Web Services and they offer a free tier for one year and this is basically a VPS virtual private server and this requires some configuration to use now there may be other free services out there but I'm listing out the ones that are wellknown now with these services there is some configuration involved and it can be complicated at times so in this case when you're setting this up you're learning deployment at the same time now if these free surfaces do not offer enough for your situation you should consider getting a VPS one of the more popular providers this digital ocean and the reason being is that they offer templates to help set up your VPS now I do believe if you're gonna go into this direction you should take some time to see if you can learn how to do your own deployment it is a great skill set to add to your resume now in this video we covered a lot so let's do a recap here now I'm doing a different kind of recap for this video and the reason being is that you know we went over five sections and there was a lot of material I covered in this video but truth be told I could have spent hours on each section and the main goal here is to give you some sort of guidance and a path to follow if you're unsure what to do but even if you don't agree with what I suggest maybe it makes you uncomfortable signing up with a LinkedIn or going on to your Bowl in the word site and putting your material out there do something it's better than doing nothing and that's the most important message I can convey to you in this video now if you have any questions make sure to leave a
