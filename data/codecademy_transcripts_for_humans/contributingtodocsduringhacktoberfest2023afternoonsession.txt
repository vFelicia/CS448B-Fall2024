00:48 - you going to be covering today
00:50 - So today we're going to be covering on
00:52 - how to contribute to co-academy docs as
00:54 - a contributor
00:55 - and we're gonna go into like a brief
00:57 - overview about what code camping talks
00:59 - is hacktoberfest and then we're going to
01:01 - continue to the workshop where
01:03 - Christina's gonna share her screen and
01:06 - I'm gonna navigate to what you're gonna
01:08 - do when you try to contribute
01:11 - fantastic well uh the floor is yours
01:16 - so hi everyone how you doing
01:20 - um we're gonna
01:21 - start off with talking about exactly
01:24 - what co-academy docs is
01:28 - so
01:29 - second
01:32 - so kokomi Dax is in online reference for
01:37 - coding Concepts and terms we rely
01:39 - heavily on the community to contribute
01:43 - to our documentation So today we're
01:46 - going to show you exactly how you can do
01:47 - that yourself
01:48 - so but first we're going to talk about
01:51 - like what hacktoberfest really is so
01:54 - it's an annual month-long celebration
01:57 - hosted by digitalocean during the month
02:00 - of October where contributors can get
02:03 - digital rewards from completing pull
02:06 - requests
02:07 - so um to participate in hacktoberfest
02:11 - individuals need to register on the
02:13 - official hacktober website and they can
02:17 - contribute to a public repository on
02:20 - GitHub once they're registered so the
02:23 - first 50 000 to get their first pull
02:27 - request pulled and merged we'll get a
02:29 - tree planted in their name and then
02:31 - there's other digital rewards available
02:34 - afterwards so you can go on to
02:38 - oktoberfest.com to learn more about it
02:43 - um so why is this a great time to
02:44 - contribute to co-academy docs in
02:46 - particular
02:48 - um well it's always a great time to
02:50 - contribute but since it's October you
02:52 - can get the benefits of Oktoberfest all
02:55 - in one so we have a bunch of um good
03:00 - first issues which is great for
03:02 - first-time contributors they're the
03:06 - issues are typically meant to be
03:07 - relatively simple or more well defined
03:10 - which makes them a good entry point for
03:12 - individuals who are new to a project or
03:16 - open source development in general
03:18 - so we're gonna go through that process
03:23 - um in a second
03:26 - so
03:31 - we're gonna show you exactly
03:34 - um everything from the contribution
03:36 - guide which is on the cocammy docs
03:39 - website and it's also linked in the
03:41 - description
03:43 - of the um live stream so once you go to
03:47 - the guide you'll be able to see the
03:49 - contribution guide and we always
03:50 - recommend you viewing the guide first
03:53 - before any work we also recommend you
03:57 - having some basic understanding
04:01 - uh get
04:03 - in GitHub we also recommend you um
04:06 - knowing markdown a little bit and also
04:09 - the command line too so we're gonna have
04:12 - like all that
04:13 - in the um description linked out
04:18 - so once you're feel comfortable enough
04:21 - to start contributing then we can next
04:25 - go into what you should do first
04:28 - so I'm gonna give Christine a moment to
04:33 - bring up the GitHub repo
04:37 - so we can show you what it looks like so
04:39 - this is the GitHub repo so first what
04:43 - you're going to do is you're going to
04:44 - try to look for an issue to work on
04:48 - so we do that by going to the issues tab
04:53 - within the issues tab we're going to get
04:55 - a list of issues and we're gonna
04:58 - specifically if this is your first time
05:00 - contributing look for a good first issue
05:04 - it'll be labeled you can also filter by
05:08 - that label by pressing on the label at
05:11 - the top and then putting in good first
05:13 - issue
05:15 - you can also filter by Noah signee
05:18 - you're going to make sure no one's
05:19 - assigned to it so you'll go to assignee
05:21 - press assign to nobody
05:23 - and then scroll do which issues
05:27 - you'll like so when you find one that
05:30 - you come upon that you really like you
05:32 - can just press on the issue
05:35 - in this case we're going to use the
05:36 - hectograph S1 we're going to redo the
05:39 - description make sure everything looks
05:42 - okay we understand what it's asking for
05:45 - if there's something that seems amiss or
05:48 - we just don't understand too well then
05:50 - you can comment within just asking a
05:54 - maintainer say hey I don't understand
05:56 - this can you please explain and I will
05:59 - get back to you once um we see your
06:02 - message if not if everything seems okay
06:05 - and you want to continue on just ask to
06:08 - be assigned we this is like a crucial
06:11 - step we ask everyone to
06:13 - be acts to be assigned because just to
06:16 - ensure no one else is working on an
06:18 - issue too so then once you send that
06:21 - comment then please wait for a
06:24 - maintainer to assign you or assign you
06:27 - and we'll send you a message saying that
06:30 - you're assigned and then once you're
06:31 - assigned you can move on to creating
06:34 - your entry
06:36 - so the first thing we recommend when
06:39 - going to create your entry is just to
06:42 - have your computer set up already so
06:45 - we're gonna go through that process a
06:47 - little bit now
06:48 - so first you're going to Fork the code
06:51 - academy docs repo you do this by going
06:55 - to the main repo page you'll see a fork
06:59 - in the corner you're gonna press on that
07:02 - fork and then once you're forged you're
07:04 - going to get a message saying that the
07:07 - repository is forked then you can go to
07:11 - your profile page
07:13 - and then go to your list of repos and
07:17 - you're going to find that the code
07:20 - company docs repost forked you press on
07:22 - that then within there you're gonna get
07:26 - the URL to your freshly forged repo you
07:29 - go to code
07:31 - you copy that URL
07:35 - and then once you have that copy you're
07:37 - gonna move on to your terminal or
07:40 - command line depending on your operating
07:43 - system you're going to change
07:44 - directories into where you want your
07:47 - local repo to live
07:50 - once you change directories then you can
07:52 - clone the repo using get clone followed
07:57 - by the URL
08:00 - once that's completed then you're going
08:03 - to see that the repo lives on your
08:05 - desktop
08:07 - so now that it is you can change
08:09 - directories into the Repository
08:16 - and you successfully have a clone now so
08:19 - once you change directories we always
08:22 - say to change your branch
08:26 - um never work on your main branches
08:28 - especially like when you're
08:28 - collaborating with others so we want you
08:31 - to change branches in this case we're
08:33 - just going to create a branch called
08:35 - um Oktoberfest
08:37 - yeah
08:41 - and once we create it then we can check
08:44 - out into the Oktoberfest branch
08:52 - and then great we now we have our
08:54 - Oktoberfest branch that now we can work
08:56 - on and make changes to so the first
08:59 - thing we're going to have to do is now
09:01 - we can create our markdown file with the
09:04 - entry in it
09:06 - so in our case we've made our markdown
09:09 - file just for a sake of time and we
09:14 - did it based on the documentation as
09:17 - also linked in the issues so when you're
09:19 - on your issue there's going to be
09:20 - documentation we suggest that you read
09:23 - through the concept entry template the
09:26 - content standards and the markdown style
09:28 - guide to make sure that you're following
09:31 - what exactly we're looking for this
09:33 - saves a lot on the review process time
09:36 - if you you know exactly what you're
09:38 - doing so we recommend that you just go
09:41 - through it
09:42 - make sure you understand and then you
09:44 - can create your entry and then so our
09:47 - entry is based off of all these
09:48 - standards so we can go back to our
09:51 - markdown well first let's take the file
09:53 - path actually sorry the file path is
09:57 - where we're going to want the place
09:59 - our um document
10:01 - so we're gonna take that and we're going
10:04 - to replicate that in our local repo
10:11 - so in our case we're going to be using a
10:14 - visual Studios they get to
10:17 - the file path so we're going to go to
10:20 - General
10:24 - and then we're going to go to Concepts
10:26 - and then within that we're gonna put our
10:29 - hacktoberfest
10:32 - um folder
10:34 - I have to recreate that then we can
10:36 - place our markdown file within the
10:39 - folder
10:42 - okay so we have the file place where we
10:45 - want it now
10:46 - so we can see using our terminal that
10:50 - we've made changes to the branch we
10:53 - created
10:54 - so we need to do that by using get
10:56 - status
10:57 - we can see that the file is ready to add
11:00 - so we can add it using get add followed
11:04 - by the file path which we can copy and
11:06 - paste
11:09 - and then we use get status to see that
11:12 - it's ready for commit so then we can
11:14 - commit using git commit followed by our
11:18 - message which we can call hacktoberfest
11:21 - entry
11:26 - great and then we can do git status
11:28 - again the C that is committed
11:31 - and then afterwards we can just push up
11:34 - our changes now so we're going to get
11:37 - push we're going to set our Upstream to
11:40 - our local repo because that's where we
11:42 - want it to go
11:44 - and then we're going to use put our
11:47 - Branch name
11:49 - and then we're gonna push so
11:52 - once we push we see that our pull
11:54 - request was created there's a message
11:56 - and then so we can go back
11:59 - to our forked repo see that there's a
12:02 - compare and pull request at the top for
12:05 - hacktoberfest we're going to click on
12:07 - compare and pull requests
12:10 - and then our we can see that our entry
12:14 - is here so we can go through make sure
12:17 - everything's okay we can change our
12:19 - title to whatever we want
12:22 - in this case we could just leave it that
12:25 - seems fine we can look at our
12:27 - descriptions see if everything's okay
12:31 - put in a description saying that this is
12:33 - the entry for Oktoberfest
12:39 - then the scroll then we can
12:43 - um delete what's not relevant so in this
12:46 - case we're
12:48 - just gonna delete everything that's not
12:50 - relevant and then we're gonna go down
12:53 - and check off all boxes that pertain to
12:55 - us
12:57 - in this case we can check off all these
12:59 - boxes
13:02 - and then we after we check we can
13:05 - scroll through and then go to the bottom
13:09 - where we can see our file
13:13 - everything looks okay so then we can go
13:15 - ahead
13:16 - and create our pull request
13:22 - so once we've created we get to this
13:24 - screen where I'll pull requester here
13:27 - um everything looks good so right now if
13:31 - you're a new contributor just so you
13:34 - know there's going to be a message
13:36 - asking you to sign the CLA agreement
13:41 - so um please make sure you sign that we
13:44 - ask that you signed that first before we
13:46 - start making the review process
13:49 - so you were just clicking and you'll go
13:51 - through the steps that are mentioned
13:53 - there and it is pretty easy so it'll
13:57 - only take you about like less than two
13:59 - minutes so make sure you do that and
14:02 - then when you go back there's nothing
14:04 - else for you to do at that point so you
14:07 - can just
14:09 - um wait for a maintainer to review your
14:12 - entry
14:13 - um after they make a review then you can
14:16 - add changes we could show you real quick
14:19 - right now
14:21 - um an example of this from already
14:24 - merged
14:25 - entry
14:28 - but um but exactly what we're just gonna
14:31 - have you wait and then once you
14:34 - I mean once you make your changes then
14:37 - there's going to be a second review
14:38 - typically
14:41 - um after that if everything's approved
14:44 - and it looks good then we can go ahead
14:47 - and merge an entry
14:49 - uh we also asked that you please be
14:52 - patient with us with um reviews just
14:55 - because especially Oktoberfest coming up
14:57 - now
14:58 - it's going to be a large volume of pull
15:01 - requests we're expecting
15:03 - so just be patient uh we'll get to you
15:07 - as soon as possible and we appreciate
15:09 - when you're
15:11 - yeah when you're patient assistant and
15:14 - and also
15:15 - um when you're on here you can so that
15:18 - you know you can see your file at all
15:21 - times by going to the files change
15:24 - section at the top so you're just press
15:27 - on that and then you can review your
15:29 - file
15:30 - and then you can also make changes to
15:32 - that in this case that there was a
15:35 - change by a maintainer
15:37 - um as you can see and yeah so you'll see
15:40 - all your changes there and you will also
15:42 - see
15:43 - um comments from retainers there
15:47 - so yeah
15:48 - um that's pretty much everything for
15:51 - going through pull requests so
15:55 - now we can open the floor to any
15:59 - questions
16:01 - that anyone might have
16:06 - let's see
16:17 - I see a question saying what is the best
16:20 - way to learn everything about code
16:22 - academy including viewing videos from
16:24 - previous webinars in case someone wants
16:27 - to review them again
16:29 - so um for that we also uh recommend like
16:34 - you going over any documentation that we
16:37 - mentioned during this so
16:40 - um the contribution guide
16:42 - um you can also go through all the the
16:44 - style sheets and the templates which are
16:48 - in the issues that we showed where the
16:51 - links were before
16:52 - you can also
16:54 - um re-watch just live stream too so
16:58 - um later on it will be posted so you can
17:01 - go back to that if need be we also do
17:04 - recommend again
17:07 - um using the git and GitHub course that
17:10 - is a great place to start or even go
17:14 - back to if you just can't remember like
17:16 - what commands to use
17:19 - um
17:22 - are there python docs to work on oh yeah
17:24 - Chris I see adult put in the comment for
17:28 - that yeah so we're always creating
17:30 - um new issues too so
17:34 - um if there's no python
17:37 - entries to work on right now there
17:39 - definitely will be in the future
17:41 - uh we're constantly changing the issues

19:50 - gone stale just because the author ran
19:53 - into an issue and they couldn't figure
19:55 - it out and it just sat there and instead
19:58 - of reaching out to us
20:00 - um they just let us sit so we ask that
20:03 - if there's something like uh pertaining
20:06 - like a personal issue or anything of
20:08 - that sort that you just can't figure out

20:33 - difficult but we can definitely help you
20:36 - out so like don't be afraid
20:39 - nice
20:41 - um when you ask I know that repos have
20:43 - like a discussion board or something is
20:45 - that where people usually ask questions
20:47 - or
20:48 - what kind of like the the way that
20:50 - people or do you like submit a ticket
20:53 - yeah so typically like if it's specific
20:55 - to your pull requests or issue then just
20:58 - put a comment in that or if there's a
21:01 - like a general question you want to just
21:03 - ask everyone then we do there is a uh
21:07 - discussions tab in the GitHub repo it's
21:11 - at the top it'll say discussions and you
21:14 - can put in uh like a general discussion
21:17 - comment and it's open for anyone in the
21:20 - repo to look at and respond to
21:24 - um if if we don't respond to it first
21:26 - nice and when it comes to I know I see
21:30 - some comments here ask about Oktoberfest
21:32 - in the chat and what it is
21:34 - um so I don't know people know about
21:36 - Octoberfest yeah I think it started in
21:38 - 2013 this is the 10th year that it's
21:41 - running
21:43 - um and I think somebody already
21:44 - mentioning that I think it might have
21:46 - been you that hot offs is just this sort
21:50 - of
21:51 - call to action for everybody online to
21:53 - say hey let's pick one month a year
21:56 - where we all take extra care or like
21:58 - focus our energy more on contributing to
22:00 - uh open projects on GitHub so if anybody
22:06 - in the chat right now is wondering what
22:07 - is a hackover first why should I care um
22:10 - it's just it's just something that we're
22:11 - tagging along in this big Global
22:13 - movement of coders and developers online
22:16 - that just take more time this month to
22:18 - contribute to open open projects so
22:20 - things like code code can be docs it's
22:22 - pretty cool
22:24 - um when it comes to
22:27 - um I know that uh some of the viewers
22:29 - that we have today might be beginners or
22:31 - people that maybe don't feel
22:34 - uh as if they know enough to contribute
22:37 - but I know that code academy docs is
22:39 - sort of like Wikipedia where you always
22:41 - know something that somebody else
22:43 - doesn't and I know that we have a lot of
22:45 - open issues and stuff so
22:48 - um what are some of the tips that you
22:49 - have for when people feel like maybe
22:50 - they just oh I just don't know enough
22:52 - like I guess how do you overcome that
22:55 - sort of fear that maybe you don't know
22:57 - enough about something to to be uh to
22:59 - make a meaningful meaningful
23:00 - contribution to dogs
23:02 - yeah for something like that I also
23:05 - really recommend like looking through
23:08 - like the courses the free courses that
23:10 - we have because if there's a language
23:13 - just say you don't feel like you know
23:15 - enough about it I feel like our free
23:17 - courses does a great job with explaining
23:21 - um everything that you need to know so
23:23 - in
23:24 - that case if you don't feel like you
23:26 - know enough you can do that but you can
23:28 - also like look around look for other
23:30 - resources that you feel comfortable with
23:32 - or that you like

Cleaned transcript:

okay and we are live hello everybody hello Internet hello Academy users we are back again Live on YouTube to bring you more awesome we are here with Tyra and Christine from the curriculum team and they're going to be using their awesome knowledge on Academy docs and sprinkle that with a little bit of October 1st 2023 to bring you new cool ways to make contributions to open projects like Academy docs so hello Cara hey how you doing today all right I'm doing great uh what are you going to be covering today So today we're going to be covering on how to contribute to coacademy docs as a contributor and we're gonna go into like a brief overview about what code camping talks is hacktoberfest and then we're going to continue to the workshop where Christina's gonna share her screen and I'm gonna navigate to what you're gonna do when you try to contribute fantastic well uh the floor is yours so hi everyone how you doing um we're gonna start off with talking about exactly what coacademy docs is so second so kokomi Dax is in online reference for coding Concepts and terms we rely heavily on the community to contribute to our documentation So today we're going to show you exactly how you can do that yourself so but first we're going to talk about like what hacktoberfest really is so it's an annual monthlong celebration hosted by digitalocean during the month of October where contributors can get digital rewards from completing pull requests so um to participate in hacktoberfest individuals need to register on the official hacktober website and they can contribute to a public repository on GitHub once they're registered so the first 50 000 to get their first pull request pulled and merged we'll get a tree planted in their name and then there's other digital rewards available afterwards so you can go on to oktoberfest.com to learn more about it um so why is this a great time to contribute to coacademy docs in particular um well it's always a great time to contribute but since it's October you can get the benefits of Oktoberfest all in one so we have a bunch of um good first issues which is great for firsttime contributors they're the issues are typically meant to be relatively simple or more well defined which makes them a good entry point for individuals who are new to a project or open source development in general so we're gonna go through that process um in a second so we're gonna show you exactly um everything from the contribution guide which is on the cocammy docs website and it's also linked in the description of the um live stream so once you go to the guide you'll be able to see the contribution guide and we always recommend you viewing the guide first before any work we also recommend you having some basic understanding uh get in GitHub we also recommend you um knowing markdown a little bit and also the command line too so we're gonna have like all that in the um description linked out so once you're feel comfortable enough to start contributing then we can next go into what you should do first so I'm gonna give Christine a moment to bring up the GitHub repo so we can show you what it looks like so this is the GitHub repo so first what you're going to do is you're going to try to look for an issue to work on so we do that by going to the issues tab within the issues tab we're going to get a list of issues and we're gonna specifically if this is your first time contributing look for a good first issue it'll be labeled you can also filter by that label by pressing on the label at the top and then putting in good first issue you can also filter by Noah signee you're going to make sure no one's assigned to it so you'll go to assignee press assign to nobody and then scroll do which issues you'll like so when you find one that you come upon that you really like you can just press on the issue in this case we're going to use the hectograph S1 we're going to redo the description make sure everything looks okay we understand what it's asking for if there's something that seems amiss or we just don't understand too well then you can comment within just asking a maintainer say hey I don't understand this can you please explain and I will get back to you once um we see your message if not if everything seems okay and you want to continue on just ask to be assigned we this is like a crucial step we ask everyone to be acts to be assigned because just to ensure no one else is working on an issue too so then once you send that comment then please wait for a maintainer to assign you or assign you and we'll send you a message saying that you're assigned and then once you're assigned you can move on to creating your entry so the first thing we recommend when going to create your entry is just to have your computer set up already so we're gonna go through that process a little bit now so first you're going to Fork the code academy docs repo you do this by going to the main repo page you'll see a fork in the corner you're gonna press on that fork and then once you're forged you're going to get a message saying that the repository is forked then you can go to your profile page and then go to your list of repos and you're going to find that the code company docs repost forked you press on that then within there you're gonna get the URL to your freshly forged repo you go to code you copy that URL and then once you have that copy you're gonna move on to your terminal or command line depending on your operating system you're going to change directories into where you want your local repo to live once you change directories then you can clone the repo using get clone followed by the URL once that's completed then you're going to see that the repo lives on your desktop so now that it is you can change directories into the Repository and you successfully have a clone now so once you change directories we always say to change your branch um never work on your main branches especially like when you're collaborating with others so we want you to change branches in this case we're just going to create a branch called um Oktoberfest yeah and once we create it then we can check out into the Oktoberfest branch and then great we now we have our Oktoberfest branch that now we can work on and make changes to so the first thing we're going to have to do is now we can create our markdown file with the entry in it so in our case we've made our markdown file just for a sake of time and we did it based on the documentation as also linked in the issues so when you're on your issue there's going to be documentation we suggest that you read through the concept entry template the content standards and the markdown style guide to make sure that you're following what exactly we're looking for this saves a lot on the review process time if you you know exactly what you're doing so we recommend that you just go through it make sure you understand and then you can create your entry and then so our entry is based off of all these standards so we can go back to our markdown well first let's take the file path actually sorry the file path is where we're going to want the place our um document so we're gonna take that and we're going to replicate that in our local repo so in our case we're going to be using a visual Studios they get to the file path so we're going to go to General and then we're going to go to Concepts and then within that we're gonna put our hacktoberfest um folder I have to recreate that then we can place our markdown file within the folder okay so we have the file place where we want it now so we can see using our terminal that we've made changes to the branch we created so we need to do that by using get status we can see that the file is ready to add so we can add it using get add followed by the file path which we can copy and paste and then we use get status to see that it's ready for commit so then we can commit using git commit followed by our message which we can call hacktoberfest entry great and then we can do git status again the C that is committed and then afterwards we can just push up our changes now so we're going to get push we're going to set our Upstream to our local repo because that's where we want it to go and then we're going to use put our Branch name and then we're gonna push so once we push we see that our pull request was created there's a message and then so we can go back to our forked repo see that there's a compare and pull request at the top for hacktoberfest we're going to click on compare and pull requests and then our we can see that our entry is here so we can go through make sure everything's okay we can change our title to whatever we want in this case we could just leave it that seems fine we can look at our descriptions see if everything's okay put in a description saying that this is the entry for Oktoberfest then the scroll then we can um delete what's not relevant so in this case we're just gonna delete everything that's not relevant and then we're gonna go down and check off all boxes that pertain to us in this case we can check off all these boxes and then we after we check we can scroll through and then go to the bottom where we can see our file everything looks okay so then we can go ahead and create our pull request so once we've created we get to this screen where I'll pull requester here um everything looks good so right now if you're a new contributor just so you know there's going to be a message asking you to sign the CLA agreement so um please make sure you sign that we ask that you signed that first before we start making the review process so you were just clicking and you'll go through the steps that are mentioned there and it is pretty easy so it'll only take you about like less than two minutes so make sure you do that and then when you go back there's nothing else for you to do at that point so you can just um wait for a maintainer to review your entry um after they make a review then you can add changes we could show you real quick right now um an example of this from already merged entry but um but exactly what we're just gonna have you wait and then once you I mean once you make your changes then there's going to be a second review typically um after that if everything's approved and it looks good then we can go ahead and merge an entry uh we also asked that you please be patient with us with um reviews just because especially Oktoberfest coming up now it's going to be a large volume of pull requests we're expecting so just be patient uh we'll get to you as soon as possible and we appreciate when you're yeah when you're patient assistant and and also um when you're on here you can so that you know you can see your file at all times by going to the files change section at the top so you're just press on that and then you can review your file and then you can also make changes to that in this case that there was a change by a maintainer um as you can see and yeah so you'll see all your changes there and you will also see um comments from retainers there so yeah um that's pretty much everything for going through pull requests so now we can open the floor to any questions that anyone might have let's see I see a question saying what is the best way to learn everything about code academy including viewing videos from previous webinars in case someone wants to review them again so um for that we also uh recommend like you going over any documentation that we mentioned during this so um the contribution guide um you can also go through all the the style sheets and the templates which are in the issues that we showed where the links were before you can also um rewatch just live stream too so um later on it will be posted so you can go back to that if need be we also do recommend again um using the git and GitHub course that is a great place to start or even go back to if you just can't remember like what commands to use um are there python docs to work on oh yeah Chris I see adult put in the comment for that yeah so we're always creating um new issues too so um if there's no python entries to work on right now there definitely will be in the future uh we're constantly changing the issues and adding up more so yeah so stay tuned if you don't see any right now is there any other questions let me give it a second to see if anyone else has any questions or okay well if there's no more questions I guess we can yeah I guess we can um end the live stream here thank you for all the um positive comments guys I really appreciate it and yeah I guess we can get going on Friday is there anything you want to say before we leave I'll jump back in hey uh thank you for the demo on how to use git and how to contribute to Academy dogs uh maybe we can go to since we have a few extra minutes do you have any FAQs that come into mind people that you know might be asking questions that people in my ass all the time about dogs or contributing or I don't know some helpful tips you might have for people yeah so um helpful tips would be like if especially like if you run into an issue that's specific like if you can't figure it out do get in the GitHub course or you can't figure out do our documentation just always feel free to reach out to us asking for help because we'll be willing to help you there have been times where um pull requests have gone stale just because the author ran into an issue and they couldn't figure it out and it just sat there and instead of reaching out to us um they just let us sit so we ask that if there's something like uh pertaining like a personal issue or anything of that sort that you just can't figure out just yeah just send us a message in the um in your pull requests I'm asking for help and we're sure we'll get back to you as soon as we can and most times like if it's a problem that you're facing like other people faced it before so we definitely know how to deal with it so it's not is it might seem really difficult but we can definitely help you out so like don't be afraid nice um when you ask I know that repos have like a discussion board or something is that where people usually ask questions or what kind of like the the way that people or do you like submit a ticket yeah so typically like if it's specific to your pull requests or issue then just put a comment in that or if there's a like a general question you want to just ask everyone then we do there is a uh discussions tab in the GitHub repo it's at the top it'll say discussions and you can put in uh like a general discussion comment and it's open for anyone in the repo to look at and respond to um if if we don't respond to it first nice and when it comes to I know I see some comments here ask about Oktoberfest in the chat and what it is um so I don't know people know about Octoberfest yeah I think it started in 2013 this is the 10th year that it's running um and I think somebody already mentioning that I think it might have been you that hot offs is just this sort of call to action for everybody online to say hey let's pick one month a year where we all take extra care or like focus our energy more on contributing to uh open projects on GitHub so if anybody in the chat right now is wondering what is a hackover first why should I care um it's just it's just something that we're tagging along in this big Global movement of coders and developers online that just take more time this month to contribute to open open projects so things like code code can be docs it's pretty cool um when it comes to um I know that uh some of the viewers that we have today might be beginners or people that maybe don't feel uh as if they know enough to contribute but I know that code academy docs is sort of like Wikipedia where you always know something that somebody else doesn't and I know that we have a lot of open issues and stuff so um what are some of the tips that you have for when people feel like maybe they just oh I just don't know enough like I guess how do you overcome that sort of fear that maybe you don't know enough about something to to be uh to make a meaningful meaningful contribution to dogs yeah for something like that I also really recommend like looking through like the courses the free courses that we have because if there's a language just say you don't feel like you know enough about it I feel like our free courses does a great job with explaining um everything that you need to know so in that case if you don't feel like you know enough you can do that but you can also like look around look for other resources that you feel comfortable with or that you like um learning from too and you can use that in your process of writing an entry I mean everyone starts out somewhere and we we like to have this platform here so that you can begin your start at um contributing to open source so we are here to help you too so if there's something that you just really just don't know just reach out to us we'll help you out there but um it's especially and I also make really make use of the good first issue label because those are the ones that you're going to want to go for if you know that you're just starting out nice yeah so I guess that's a good way to close this off uh reminding people that the labels on GitHub are super important and code academy docs has two labels going on this month that you should be paying attention to which is good first issue in Octoberfest if you're participating in October Fest I guess uh look for those under the issues Tab and that's your point of entry for all things Academy docs see you in the discussion board and I want to thank everybody for stopping by listening to Kyra and Christine driving in the back the presentation thank you for your questions and if you know somebody that wants to learn more about GitHub and git and to Academy and Oktoberfest we also have another session on Wednesday in the morning so it's a different it might catch a different time zone might be more convenient for some people so if you know anybody that could benefit from this don't forget to invite them over to check out the code YouTube channel and follow us on socials for more Live Events into the future thank you for stopping by and have a great day bye okay so we just
