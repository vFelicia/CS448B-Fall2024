00:02 - hi I'm Laura and I'd like to welcome you
00:05 - to code Cadmus data science path where
00:07 - we'll be giving you the tools you need
00:08 - to become a data engineer or an analyst
00:11 - or a visualization developer businesses
00:13 - around the world are collecting a lot of
00:15 - data these days but that data is
00:17 - meaningless unless we're able to find
00:19 - patterns and insights in it for that
00:21 - reason Harvard Business Review has
00:22 - called data science the most important
00:24 - job market of the 21st century big data
00:26 - is taking over the world and in this
00:28 - path we'll take you on an educational
00:30 - journey that you can move through at
00:31 - your own pace with step by step
00:33 - instructions and you'll complete
00:35 - milestones along the way to demonstrate
00:37 - your skills and hone your analytical
00:39 - thinking you'll learn Python a
00:40 - programming language loved by data
00:42 - scientists birds power its flexibility
00:44 - and it's versatile libraries you'll also
00:46 - learn sequel a language that's used for
00:48 - getting and manipulating data that's
00:50 - stored in databases and will teach you
00:52 - key statistics and analysis techniques
00:54 - and how to create charts and graphs to
00:56 - illustrate your findings you'll explore
00:58 - the principles of machine learning that
00:59 - will enable you to build predictive
01:01 - models to explain the complex world
01:03 - around us by the end of the path you'll
01:05 - be developing machine learning
01:06 - algorithms to extract insights from
01:08 - large data sets get ready to start
01:10 - seeing data everywhere you look and I
01:12 - can't wait to see what you discover
