00:00 - I think for a lot of self-taught
00:02 - developers or career switchers or just
00:04 - people who don't have an advanced degree
00:07 - it can feel really daunting or just like
00:09 - totally Out Of Reach
00:11 - um so I was wondering like what are the
00:12 - most important skills for developers to
00:13 - have now if they aspire to work in AI my
00:17 - suspicion is that AI is going to make
00:20 - software development more valuable I
00:22 - think one story you can tell is that oh
00:24 - maybe this is actually a good thing for
00:26 - the experienced developers but actually
00:27 - bad for juniors because it's like Junior
00:29 - developers are now kind of getting
00:30 - replaced with AI I think it's actually
00:32 - going to help out Junior developers more
00:34 - because I think a lot of the value from
00:36 - senior developers comes from having a
00:38 - vast kind of repository of knowledge of
00:40 - like oh I know how to do this I've seen
00:42 - this before AI now can kind of Outsource
00:45 - some of that knowledge where it's like
00:47 - oh I don't know how to do something but
00:49 - I can still do it quickly because I just
00:51 - asked chat CPT to write the code
00:53 - obviously chat gbt can't do complex
00:55 - things but for quick and dirty things
00:57 - it's actually a fantastic tool
