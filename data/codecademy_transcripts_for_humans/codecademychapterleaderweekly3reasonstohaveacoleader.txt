00:00 - community manager with codecademy and
00:02 - today's quick tip video for
00:04 - chapter leaders is three reasons
00:08 - why you might consider having a
00:10 - co-leader
00:11 - a co-leader for your chapter is totally
00:14 - optional
00:14 - and not necessary but i have seen some
00:17 - really cool stuff
00:18 - happening in the chapters that have
00:20 - co-leaders so
00:21 - i thought that i would bring those
00:23 - observations out and share them with you
00:25 - so number one reason to have a co-leader
00:28 - for your chapter is
00:30 - planning and promoting those are two
00:33 - separate
00:34 - jobs and two pretty big jobs
00:37 - planning your actual event is obviously
00:41 - something that you want to do every
00:42 - single time because you want to have
00:43 - that information listed on your agenda
00:45 - so that
00:46 - people can make decisions about coming
00:48 - to your meetup
00:49 - and then promoting it holy smokes that
00:51 - has to happen in
00:53 - partnership with hq but then also on
00:55 - your own social medias i'm seeing
00:56 - fantastic
00:57 - stuff happening with people who are
00:59 - creating instagram accounts and twitter
01:00 - accounts and
01:01 - um while one person can totally do this
01:04 - and have
01:05 - a lot of fun doing it i think it would
01:06 - be or i think it can be
01:09 - a really great thing um to split up
01:11 - between two people so that's number one
01:13 - planning and promoting
01:14 - number two moderating a meetup um
01:18 - i am sure you can imagine i've been
01:21 - a participant and a
01:25 - moderator for a number of virtual events
01:28 - and can't stress enough
01:32 - the sense of relief and having somebody
01:36 - to co-moderate um usually or at least
01:40 - lately that's been either lil or mike
01:42 - whom you've met in the process of
01:44 - becoming a chapter leader
01:45 - and i'm so grateful for them so i just
01:48 - want to share that from my own personal
01:51 - experience having a co-moderator
01:53 - for an event whether that person is on
01:55 - screen or not
01:58 - is a really nice feeling to have and
02:01 - then finally
02:02 - the third reason is around asynchronous
02:05 - communication so
02:06 - your meetups happen monthly um part of
02:08 - being a chapter leader
02:10 - means you'll also get a discord channel
02:13 - in our discord server but there's all
02:15 - kinds of asynchronous communication that
02:17 - you can also have with your chapter
02:18 - members be that
02:19 - through email or a whatsapp group or
02:22 - however you choose to
02:24 - organize yourselves for conversation
02:27 - in between your meetups that
02:29 - asynchronous communication
02:31 - once you get more members once you get
02:33 - your groove and more people showing up
02:36 - can become kind of a lot again a lot
02:39 - is good when it starts to happen this is
02:42 - not a problem this is a
02:44 - benefit um but i think that also
02:47 - it's a lot easier to welcome more
02:51 - when you have a co-leader so how do you
02:53 - get a co-leader
02:54 - that part's pretty straightforward uh if
02:57 - you need
02:58 - support adding somebody else as a
03:00 - co-leader to
03:01 - your chapter always reach out to myself
03:05 - or mike or lil in our
03:08 - uh in our discord server we'll be happy
03:11 - to help add somebody
03:12 - if you're not able to do it yourself and
03:14 - we can also help you on board that
03:15 - person
03:17 - i hope that this is helpful and i hope
03:18 - that you have a fantastic start to your
03:20 - week
03:21 - talk to you soon
