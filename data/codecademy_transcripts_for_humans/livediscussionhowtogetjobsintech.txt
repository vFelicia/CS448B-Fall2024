01:59 - of like a three-part discussion where we
02:01 - talk about uh how you find jobs or where
02:04 - is the best places that you can do right
02:05 - now that you can go right now to find
02:07 - your tech jobs uh how once you found
02:10 - those jobs how you stand out from the
02:13 - competition for all the people that are
02:14 - applying for the same jobs and finally
02:16 - part three which is sort of
02:19 - okay so if you've if you already know
02:22 - where to look for jobs and you already
02:23 - know how to stand out or how to be a
02:25 - good candidate then
02:26 - how do you know what job to apply for
02:28 - because at the end of the day it's as
02:30 - much a question of where you want to
02:32 - work as is a question of how good of a
02:33 - candidate you are so let's get started
02:36 - the three of you with uh where to look
02:38 - for jobs what would you say
02:40 - dying to know what are the best places
02:42 - to look for jobs is there any job board
02:44 - that is killing it right now is there
02:45 - any place any website you know word of
02:48 - mouth if your uncle works somewhere is
02:50 - that the best is that
02:52 - um i want to learn
02:56 - i'm interested in her neat and well what
02:58 - do you guys think on this uh because i
03:00 - think referrals are the best you know
03:02 - like you said your uncle works here your
03:04 - cousin choice removed um i'm going to
03:07 - say that referral base goes a long way i
03:09 - always check referrals first um
03:12 - when through applications or if somebody
03:14 - you know has i have this great candidate
03:17 - um so i'm interested what you guys have
03:18 - to say about the job awards well in her
03:20 - meeting i would agree i i would agree
03:22 - victoria definitely you know referrals
03:24 - definitely stand out they go to the top
03:25 - of the pile um in terms of who you're
03:27 - going to check out and you know give a
03:29 - consideration to usually they'll at
03:30 - least get a phone call so yeah you know
03:32 - personal networks and stuff like that
03:34 - definitely um
03:35 - a great place to look in terms of you
03:37 - know asking around seeing if people can
03:39 - forward resumes on and stuff like that
03:41 - um because yeah whenever they come
03:42 - across our desk it's definitely
03:44 - something that stands out to me um
03:46 - personally i spent a lot of time on
03:47 - linkedin um you know just searching and
03:50 - so i know that like codecademy we post
03:52 - our jobs on linkedin as well as our
03:53 - career page so like you know if a job
03:56 - seeker is looking you know they know hey
03:58 - this is a company i definitely want to
03:59 - work for it like
04:00 - any any major company that has an online
04:02 - presence will have a careers page where
04:04 - they can go that'll have
04:05 - active job postings and usually those
04:07 - will link right to you know the they'll
04:10 - come right to our desks basically you
04:11 - know when when we get a uh
04:14 - applicant or a referral they'll come to
04:16 - one of our systems that kind of comes
04:18 - right to our inbox and so whether you
04:19 - apply
04:20 - i mean that's a debate like whether you
04:22 - want to apply on a job board or whether
04:23 - you want to apply directly through a
04:25 - company's website i don't know if it
04:27 - matters too much but usually you know
04:29 - between linkedin or definitely the
04:31 - careers pages that's that's usually what
04:33 - i'd be kind of looking um to source
04:35 - candidates from anyways i don't know
04:37 - hermit what about what are you thinking
04:39 - yeah i think you both hit on great
04:41 - points um referrals are huge for sure
04:44 - if you know someone who works at a place
04:47 - that you really want to work at
04:49 - that's probably your best way to at
04:51 - least get your foot in the door get an
04:53 - interview get like the first interview
04:55 - right so
04:57 - everyone's got an uncle an aunt or a
05:00 - friend
05:01 - or you know you'll walk someone's dog on
05:04 - occasion whatever it may be
05:06 - really scour through your network to
05:08 - leverage anybody who can help you out um
05:12 - you know a good thing is to like connect
05:14 - with all those people too on linkedin
05:15 - because if you're looking at jobs on
05:17 - linkedin and you see that one of your
05:19 - connections works there
05:21 - why not ask them hey like i'm looking at
05:23 - this job
05:25 - could you help me out would you be able
05:27 - to refer me
05:28 - the worst that they can say is no
05:30 - so
05:31 - you got to try
05:33 - any turnover any stone possible so
05:37 - those two linkedin and referrals are
05:39 - huge
05:40 - um google searches for sure just google
05:43 - search like
05:44 - the types of jobs you want at the
05:46 - companies that you want that's going to
05:47 - be huge as well it's a great avenue but
05:50 - leveraging your personal networks is
05:52 - probably your best bet um and if you
05:56 - don't have a personal network try
05:58 - building it you know go to events
06:01 - go to conferences there's a lot of free
06:03 - events and conferences
06:04 - and just talk to people
06:07 - um and it'll be really easy to talk to
06:09 - people if you're going to events that
06:10 - you're actually
06:11 - personally interested in right so it's
06:14 - not like you're
06:15 - it makes it just makes it a little
06:17 - easier when you know about the subject
06:19 - matter and you can strike a conversation
06:20 - that way
06:22 - right i agree i mean
06:23 - it's interesting that you guys bring up
06:25 - this point of referrals because um
06:27 - i know i know that a lot of times we mix
06:29 - up the two of how you showcase your
06:31 - portfolio and how you get experience if
06:34 - you've never worked as a debt before and
06:36 - it's kind of like the problem like i
06:37 - don't have experience i can't get the
06:39 - job and i can't get the job if i don't
06:40 - have the experience and oftentimes i
06:42 - hear that
06:43 - the solution to this is kind of a
06:45 - combination of participating communities
06:47 - or online open source projects that will
06:49 - give you some exposure to what would
06:52 - look like experience and then at the
06:53 - same time you get to meet the people in
06:56 - those communities that might have jobs
06:57 - in tech companies or might have you know
06:59 - a food already in the door and they can
07:00 - help you if you make a good impression
07:02 - with them so it's sort of uh it seems
07:04 - that we are we are talking about
07:05 - different things but it really it's all
07:07 - connected in like how it all plays out
07:09 - in your favor at the end
07:11 - for sure for sure i think i think you
07:13 - definitely nailed it especially with
07:14 - like you know what harmee was saying
07:15 - because
07:16 - as you're getting started you know i
07:18 - remember when i was early on in my
07:19 - recruiting career i didn't know any
07:21 - software engineers and i had to meet
07:22 - them online or i had to meet them
07:24 - through conferences or i had to go to
07:27 - networking events and you know over time
07:29 - over years it eventually you know the
07:30 - network gets bigger but when you find
07:33 - those commonalities things you have in
07:34 - common with people like you went to the
07:36 - same conference
07:37 - it's okay to reach out to them even on
07:39 - linkedin and say hey you know looking to
07:41 - build my professional network i'm not
07:42 - saying spam random people that's not a
07:44 - good idea you'll not get the
07:47 - success you're looking for that way but
07:48 - if you find people that either went to
07:50 - the same boot camp that you did or that
07:52 - went to a conference that you did you
07:54 - know finding those commonalities and
07:56 - then just being proactive and reaching
07:57 - out even if you've never had a
07:59 - one-on-one conversation um sometimes
08:01 - just you know building those linkedin
08:03 - networks because when we post a job they
08:06 - like if i post a job today it'll get
08:08 - posted to my immediate network and then
08:10 - some more of like their first degree
08:12 - connections and so the more connections
08:14 - you have you know even if you don't know
08:16 - these people directly the more
08:17 - opportunities you're gonna see
08:19 - just different jobs different other
08:20 - people to connect to um it really can
08:23 - kind of snowball but but yeah the
08:24 - networking is something that never
08:26 - really stops but it's it's it's daunting
08:28 - to start but once you just get it
08:30 - snowballing it gets easier i assure you
08:35 - well i mean
08:37 - i think uh some of the questions that
08:38 - people tend to have are things like well
08:41 - i don't want to cross any red lines i
08:43 - don't have any red flags like if i know
08:45 - someone at the company and i ask them
08:47 - how the recruiting process is is that a
08:48 - red flag is that
08:50 - you know something is it inappropriate
08:52 - it seems like sometimes people have this
08:53 - kind of fear of like not asking too many
08:55 - questions or trying to be too prodding
08:57 - because it might come across as a bad
08:59 - sign
09:00 - and i guess that's just kind of like a
09:02 - hard line to it depends on each company
09:04 - i guess it has different policies on
09:06 - this and how transparent they are with
09:07 - the application process
09:10 - yeah definitely i think
09:13 - a lot of different companies have a lot
09:14 - of different strategies for us at co
09:16 - academy specifically we're very much
09:19 - willing to like let you know
09:21 - what's involved in the interview process
09:23 - what the next step is going to look like
09:25 - and we often do prep calls for final
09:28 - interviews as well so
09:30 - for us we're very very open in terms of
09:33 - the process and
09:34 - uh there are a lot of companies who are
09:36 - open to letting you know about the
09:38 - process and what's involved in the
09:40 - interview um loop for that particular
09:43 - company but there there are some
09:45 - companies maybe they won't
09:47 - give too much information or divulge but
09:50 - the only way you're going to find out is
09:51 - if you ask so don't be afraid to ask
09:55 - all right
09:56 - that's uh i'll take that in mind uh keep
09:58 - that in mind so
10:01 - so we're talking about gel boards and it
10:03 - seems like linkedin it's a pretty strong
10:05 - tool right now um
10:07 - how does that compare to other
10:09 - competitors that they might have like a
10:11 - zip recruiter or
10:13 - indeed or like you you mentioned google
10:15 - like that's an aggregate right like if
10:18 - you go to google search jobs near me the
10:20 - list that is polling is from all these
10:21 - other sites right like you're going to
10:23 - see from every other job board
10:25 - so
10:26 - it's a better just go to one of these
10:27 - aggregates like sometimes you know one
10:29 - question i often have with these boards
10:31 - is you see jobs that are posted 20 days
10:33 - ago 25 days ago 30 plus days ago is that
10:37 - should people
10:38 - filter the results that they're finding
10:40 - in job boards for the most recent ones
10:41 - or is it fairly common to have job
10:43 - postings open for a while
10:47 - i think in tech it's very common to have
10:50 - job postings open for a while
10:53 - um
10:54 - i just it's it's a hot industry right
10:57 - the market's really hot right now
10:59 - whatever you are in your career right
11:01 - like whether you're more
11:03 - junior engineer or whether you're
11:04 - looking for like
11:05 - i mean i think your engineering manager
11:07 - has been open for 30 plus days right
11:11 - um i don't think that's a red flag i
11:12 - just think that it means that hey the
11:15 - role's still open we're still looking
11:16 - for the right fit for the company
11:19 - um
11:20 - i don't know if you guys have anything
11:20 - else to add to that i feel like
11:22 - candidates feel like that they're like
11:23 - oh man the job has been open for
11:25 - 90 days plus that means that they
11:27 - probably have people in final stages
11:28 - yeah maybe we do
11:30 - but i don't also
11:32 - i don't think that's also a deterrent it
11:34 - just means maybe we opened the posting
11:36 - before we had an interview process put
11:38 - in place right so we wanted to get the
11:40 - traction so it took maybe uh you know a
11:42 - couple weeks to get the interview going
11:44 - you know the process in place and
11:46 - training that was the case for me in
11:47 - security i had an opening that i mean
11:50 - it's been open for a while but i didn't
11:52 - have a process in place so we couldn't
11:54 - bring people in because i didn't have an
11:56 - interview
11:57 - process in place so i don't think that's
11:59 - a deterrent
12:00 - um it could be i mean it could be we can
12:02 - have people in final stages but
12:04 - i don't
12:05 - i would say
12:06 - jobs
12:07 - i mean how how likely do you guys think
12:08 - that is uh when you apply for a job and
12:10 - it might not be available anymore for
12:12 - the company to sort of reroute the
12:14 - candidate to something else like is that
12:16 - is that fairly a fairly common practice
12:18 - in companies where they would say oh you
12:20 - apply for this we feel that rule but
12:23 - here is this other opportunity or
12:26 - yeah yeah yeah no for sure like
12:27 - internally both here as well as you know
12:29 - other companies i've worked at if a role
12:31 - gets closed down and there are other
12:32 - active candidates that either have
12:34 - applied or they might be in mid stages
12:36 - if there's another role like another
12:38 - full stack roll for a similar full stack
12:39 - position we will 100 roll those
12:42 - candidates over and then try to see if
12:43 - if that would be of interest you know
12:45 - usually it'll be a little bit of a
12:46 - different team and maybe a different
12:48 - scope and so obviously it would be a
12:50 - question for the candidate if it aligns
12:52 - with what they'd be wanting to do as
12:53 - well but but yeah if if someone's
12:56 - already in process um and there's more
12:58 - roles to fill
13:00 - they'll definitely have a chance at
13:02 - other opportunities and usually even
13:03 - some opportunities might be
13:05 - a little outside their comfort zone
13:07 - usually that's how it works it's rare
13:09 - that we find you know a perfect fit i
13:10 - think in general it's sometimes you know
13:12 - hey you know we think you might be
13:14 - interested in something like this would
13:15 - you be willing to take this on or you
13:18 - know here's an interview loop would you
13:19 - be interested in sort of tackling that
13:20 - and so being open to and being flexible
13:24 - with interview processes will definitely
13:26 - i think be uh
13:28 - an attribute to have in terms of you
13:30 - know
13:30 - just getting a variety of opportunities
13:32 - and seeing what fits the best
13:34 - just to piggyback off that because that
13:37 - was really well said i think
13:39 - like to add to that like
13:41 - recruiters
13:43 - you know we we do this we we help people
13:45 - match up with the job and a lot of the
13:48 - time a lot of recruiters have a lot of
13:50 - tenure and experience doing that and so
13:52 - when you get that recommendation or
13:55 - suggestion
13:56 - trust in that recommendation or
13:58 - suggestion or at least enough to
14:01 - experience the interview loop learn more
14:03 - about it and see if it's a fit for you
14:05 - um because at the end of the day we want
14:07 - to provide people opportunities that's a
14:09 - good fit um it doesn't make sense for
14:12 - any recruiter to bring someone into a
14:14 - role that's not a good fit so usually
14:16 - when you get that suggestion it's coming
14:18 - from a good place it's coming from oh i
14:20 - think your skill set might match with x
14:23 - so if you're interested let's let's
14:25 - let's try it out
14:27 - the worst that happen is you find out
14:29 - it's not a fit
14:31 - yeah i guess so i mean uh you know you
14:33 - miss 100 of the shots you don't take
14:35 - right uh sort of thing so mentality i
14:37 - suppose uh i think that's a good segue
14:39 - we're talking about uh recommendations
14:41 - and how people uh you might apply for a
14:43 - job they tell you hey this is filled or
14:44 - maybe this is not the right fit for you
14:46 - but there's this other one that it is
14:48 - um if you get to that position you're a
14:50 - candidate that has shown some potential
14:52 - at least to the point where a recruiter
14:54 - will get back to you uh because you know
14:56 - a lot of times you don't hear a lot like
14:58 - that the process is not very transparent
14:59 - sometimes you just get a generic email
15:01 - saying we're moving on without you right
15:03 - or like there was a lot of competition
15:04 - there's a lot of applicants whatever
15:06 - unfortunately this unfortunately that so
15:09 - if you get to that point you're like
15:10 - okay yeah i got a shot how do you stand
15:12 - out as an applicant what do you do
15:14 - to say
15:16 - i should get this rule is there
15:18 - any
15:19 - top you know recommendations that you
15:21 - have things that you think that work
15:22 - really well like
15:24 - links to portfolios maybe asking the
15:27 - right questions
15:29 - mentioning certain like keywords like do
15:31 - recruiters listen for keywords like you
15:33 - say certain buzzwords that are aligned
15:34 - with the job
15:35 - is that a plus one how do you stand out
15:43 - yeah um are you for somebody to go i
15:45 - know i know
15:47 - we didn't establish a good speaker i'll
15:48 - get i'll i'll get this started and then
15:50 - uh kick it over you go first yeah um but
15:53 - yeah so i think just in terms of
15:54 - standing out you know
15:56 - asking questions is a great place to
15:57 - start i think you know victoria harmeet
15:59 - and i you know
16:00 - when we're hiring for active roles you
16:02 - know we're talking to a fair amount of
16:03 - folks throughout the day you know our
16:05 - portion tends to be a little bit similar
16:06 - we're obviously talking about the role
16:08 - in the company the one thing the thing
16:10 - that stands out for me with candidates
16:11 - is the ones that do ask questions
16:13 - especially questions that aren't just
16:14 - like the boilerplate um you know stock
16:17 - questions that you know you might read
16:19 - on like a top 10 google search questions
16:21 - of what to ask a recruiter you know
16:23 - asking real questions about like you
16:24 - know hey i noticed you just started
16:26 - working there three months ago how's
16:27 - that been going for you like asking a
16:29 - real question like personal experience
16:31 - of how has my time here been going is a
16:33 - great question to ask for a candidate
16:35 - because it's a way to get some honest
16:37 - feedback on someone who's recently come
16:38 - aboard but it also shows me as the
16:40 - recruiter that they're thinking about
16:42 - you know wanting to be here for the
16:43 - right reasons and so i think asking
16:45 - questions is just a great way to stand
16:47 - out once you get on the phone with
16:49 - recruiters and uh and again that's not
16:51 - to say just ask a bunch of boilerplate
16:53 - questions but especially when you're
16:54 - talking to a company that you really
16:55 - want to work at think about why you want
16:57 - to work there and you know this is a
16:59 - chance to learn a little bit about it so
17:01 - i would definitely say early on asking
17:03 - those those good questions is an awesome
17:05 - place to start
17:06 - okay
17:07 - asking questions a lot of questions but
17:09 - questions that make sense not yeah
17:12 - questions like oh what is the thing that
17:14 - you like the least oh
17:16 - working that's so try not to be too
17:19 - cliche okay
17:20 - right
17:21 - okay i think i think for me yes big on
17:24 - the questions
17:26 - i think we're
17:28 - i think we're all human and i feel like
17:29 - sometimes recruiting can see as transact
17:32 - like be seen as transactional you get a
17:34 - candid email um you know you talk to a
17:37 - maybe a recruiter that is newer in the
17:39 - space and they're asking you more of
17:41 - those generic questions so for me
17:43 - honestly candidates that stand out are
17:45 - people who like line up with our mission
17:47 - right so somebody who's done some
17:48 - research you know we have a conversation
17:50 - during the conversation i get to learn a
17:52 - little bit more aside from just like the
17:54 - tech skills about how this person works
17:56 - with other teams and other people and
17:58 - i'm i'm assessing like oh are you a good
18:00 - fit for
18:02 - x team or maybe this team right um so
18:05 - for me it's kind of like that human that
18:08 - human touch you don't need to you know
18:10 - have like a list of your answers written
18:12 - down and be reading from a script um
18:15 - it's really finding that like
18:17 - right fit and i don't know if that's
18:19 - like a really like i feel like it's a
18:21 - vague answer to give
18:23 - i think it's it's a good answer if we
18:26 - put it in the context of when you apply
18:28 - for a role you should there should be a
18:30 - reason you're applying for this role in
18:31 - particular right i feel like a lot of
18:33 - beginners apply for any role because all
18:35 - they're trying to do is get a job
18:37 - anywhere any way they can right and the
18:39 - problem with that approach is that you
18:41 - it's really hard to stand out when
18:43 - you're just trying it's just one in a
18:44 - million right um so i feel like those
18:47 - kind of questions right like you can
18:48 - only ask the right questions if it's
18:51 - something that is really interesting to
18:52 - you like you've looked at code academy
18:54 - for example you've looked at what we
18:55 - work on the courses and you're like yeah
18:57 - i'm really interested in participating
18:59 - in this team success in these projects
19:01 - and tackling these issues right uh and
19:04 - then you get to ask those questions
19:05 - because you know like you know why you
19:07 - are there
19:08 - so
19:09 - i guess that's it's kind of like what
19:11 - you're saying is to ask those right
19:13 - questions
19:14 - it also has to make sense to you the
19:15 - candidate right
19:17 - yeah exactly
19:19 - anything to add to me
19:22 - it's a tough act to follow they they
19:24 - covered it pretty well
19:26 - if it comes from a genuine interest
19:29 - you will want to go out of your way to
19:31 - research the company and look up things
19:33 - that the company is doing and then you
19:34 - can bring that up too
19:36 - um i guess the only thing i can add to
19:39 - this is like listen to what the
19:40 - recruiter says about the role if they
19:42 - give you an explanation of the role
19:44 - listen to what they're looking for in
19:46 - the role and then when it's time for you
19:49 - to answer
19:50 - the recruiter or to talk about your
19:52 - experience and some of the things you do
19:54 - try to make it match up as close as you
19:58 - can obviously you don't want to
20:00 - um
20:01 - stretch the boundaries and
20:04 - maybe fib about your experience like
20:06 - don't do that
20:07 - talk to your experience and your
20:08 - experience only but see if there's a way
20:11 - to frame it
20:12 - in a way that makes sense based on what
20:14 - the recruiter is looking for in the role
20:16 - and what the like what a successful
20:19 - candidate might look like in that role
20:20 - too and that might be a good question
20:22 - too to ask what if um what if i take a
20:24 - step back army what if we go to the very
20:27 - beginning like you're not talking to the
20:28 - recruiter yet you're applying for the
20:30 - job how do you stand out there you
20:32 - haven't talked to the person you don't
20:33 - get to use your charms and your smile
20:37 - and your smart questions about code
20:39 - academy like how do you stand out then
20:41 - like is there um
20:42 - is this more of a
20:44 - game of keywords is it
20:47 - is there certain things like
20:48 - you have to tailor your portfolio to the
20:50 - role you're looking for or you have to
20:53 - apply in the right
20:54 - places or
20:56 - how how heavy you know how much weight
20:58 - does your cover letter have in that
21:01 - right like there's a lot of questions
21:02 - that surround how to stand out at the
21:04 - very beginning where you're just a
21:05 - number in someone's list right
21:08 - how do you how would you say what would
21:09 - you say in your experience you three
21:11 - are things that make people stand out
21:13 - more is it like restaurants are very
21:15 - clean links to their linkedin pages in
21:18 - the rasmus or is it like mentions to
21:20 - portfolios is it the verbs they use in
21:22 - resumes action verbs or passive things
21:25 - like that like what would you say that's
21:26 - like the most things that you usually
21:28 - find at work
21:33 - yeah i would say in terms of
21:35 - the resume
21:37 - and tailoring it that is something i
21:39 - tell everyone you should definitely
21:42 - tailor your resume towards the job
21:43 - description you're applying to
21:45 - if you just send a cookie cutter resume
21:47 - odds are you're probably
21:50 - not going to get as many responses back
21:53 - as you'd like
21:54 - so take a look at the job description
21:56 - look at all the words that they use and
21:58 - look at what they list out the most i'm
22:00 - pretty sure you can get a sense of like
22:02 - what this job is really looking for
22:04 - based on how many times they repeat
22:07 - something or how many times something's
22:09 - listed multiple times
22:11 - so you can get a sense of that you can
22:13 - also get a sense of what the company's
22:14 - looking for by looking at like they're
22:17 - about us
22:18 - seeing their values
22:20 - seeing what they care about you know if
22:21 - they do pro bono work as well you know
22:24 - there's so much you can learn from just
22:25 - exploring and researching the company
22:28 - page what they do
22:30 - what they've been up to in terms of the
22:32 - news and so incorporating all of that
22:34 - information into
22:36 - your resume or your portfolio
22:39 - and
22:40 - i would say
22:42 - there's some things that you can tailor
22:44 - in terms of your experience in terms of
22:45 - verbiage explaining it away there's so
22:48 - many ways to explain one thing that
22:50 - you've done
22:51 - so try and get creative with it maybe
22:54 - like
22:54 - have a google draft of like different
22:56 - ways to explain the same bullet in your
22:59 - experience for one of your jobs right so
23:02 - the more you get used to that the the
23:04 - more you can kind of
23:06 - um tailor your resume and your portfolio
23:09 - towards a job
23:11 - i'm gonna plus one to that for me i feel
23:14 - like
23:14 - the challenge is when you're writing
23:16 - your resume or your linkedin profile is
23:19 - like you are you assume that people know
23:22 - by one bullet what you're doing and the
23:25 - thing is is like for us who are doing
23:27 - searches saying the linkedin like maybe
23:30 - i'm my search is a little different than
23:32 - like will search right and i'm using a
23:33 - different word and you just didn't
23:35 - rewrite that bullet three times and now
23:38 - you lost your chance because you you
23:40 - assumed that this would cover everything
23:43 - you're like oh just because i wrote you
23:45 - know that i work with
23:47 - um you know javascript it's assumed that
23:49 - i'm working with uh different you know
23:51 - frameworks of it like angular and uh you
23:54 - know react um but don't don't assume
23:57 - that and i i can't i can't plus one
23:58 - enough like you want to rewrite
24:01 - the same thing you're doing in a couple
24:02 - different ways because you don't know
24:04 - how you're going to come up in that
24:05 - search
24:07 - yep yep and then yeah there's lastly one
24:09 - thing that i agree just in terms of how
24:10 - you frame the resume is super important
24:12 - for the jobs you're searching but you
24:14 - know especially if you're even early on
24:16 - and you don't have a lot of those
24:17 - bullets to even write you know you're
24:18 - just getting started in your career you
24:20 - know as in you know as a technology
24:22 - recruiter you know have looking at
24:24 - people's you know active githubs or you
24:26 - know personal sites if you're a mobile
24:28 - developer like have you published
24:29 - something to the app store like if you
24:31 - don't have the actual career experience
24:34 - but can still show that you're actively
24:36 - coding or if you're a designer you're
24:38 - actively designing stuff you know having
24:41 - a body of work to show that hey this is
24:43 - more this is not only a passion for me
24:45 - but this is something that i spend hours
24:47 - doing um is a great indicator of just
24:50 - how committed you would be you know
24:51 - obviously you're getting paid for it too
24:53 - so i think just having some of those
24:55 - open source contributions and you know
24:57 - personal projects definitely githubs for
24:59 - engineers you know those things will
25:01 - help you to get that you know especially
25:04 - early on when you maybe don't have some
25:06 - of the years of experience so definitely
25:08 - you know be working on the side projects
25:09 - too as much as you can
25:11 - they're fun and uh i think they'll also
25:13 - be super helpful
25:16 - yeah i mean um i feel like a lot of
25:18 - people forget that if you're recruiting
25:20 - for a junior role the expectations are
25:22 - set for a junior role too i feel like
25:24 - sometimes people there's this huge
25:26 - impostor syndrome around the tech
25:28 - community where it's like i haven't
25:29 - built enough portfolio projects i don't
25:31 - know enough javascript i don't know
25:33 - enough about all of this i don't i
25:35 - definitely don't know enough react right
25:36 - like they there's always this kind of
25:38 - like thought of negative thoughts of
25:40 - like i'm not good enough for this and
25:42 - people kind of like keep themselves from
25:44 - applying for jobs because they just
25:46 - don't think that they're going to
25:46 - qualify or they're good enough for this
25:48 - so the whole idea of
25:51 - you know you take you take your
25:52 - portfolio and you showcase what you have
25:54 - and just kind of like take a chance and
25:56 - understand that the recruiters on the
25:57 - other side also understand that they're
25:59 - hiring someone with no experience so
26:01 - they're looking for other things right
26:03 - they're not looking for you to say you
26:04 - have five years to experience this
26:05 - because then it wouldn't be a junior
26:06 - role right like this the expectations
26:09 - come from both sides right so when
26:11 - you're building your projects when
26:12 - you're building your resume it's kind of
26:14 - like you and they also understand where
26:16 - you're coming from
26:17 - it's not unreasonable right people have
26:19 - been unreasonable
26:22 - all right well let's say
26:24 - that okay so we talked about how how to
26:27 - stand out a little bit i feel like uh to
26:29 - close this off and go for the q a let's
26:32 - talk about what's out there okay so
26:33 - full-time part-time freelance contracts
26:36 - uh open source um your recruiters you
26:39 - browse the internet all the time you've
26:41 - gone through linkedin billion times what
26:43 - is out there
26:44 - to
26:45 - get people started in their tech careers
26:48 - in the tech journalists you could be a
26:49 - career switcher right now you could be a
26:51 - teacher accountant you could be somebody
26:53 - right now
26:54 - starbucks
26:55 - like
26:56 - how do you get started with this how do
26:58 - you get the ball rolling what's the best
26:59 - places or what are the best things that
27:01 - you think are out there for this
27:04 - taking some courses on codecademy of
27:06 - course
27:10 - all right
27:11 - well
27:12 - that's it that's the live stream thank
27:14 - you
27:17 - no but dabbling you know like dabbling
27:19 - into seeing what you're interested in i
27:21 - have uh like a fun story at my previous
27:24 - company i hired a bi engineer uh one
27:27 - um
27:28 - and this person this candidate was a
27:32 - manager of a movie theater for most of
27:34 - their career um
27:37 - and it was just a passion she ended up
27:40 - taking a bunch of different courses
27:42 - um and was like i really want to get
27:44 - into tech like i really want to do that
27:46 - and so one of the questions i asked when
27:48 - you know we're going through the
27:48 - interview process i was like why
27:51 - business intelligence well
27:53 - you know there's so much you could have
27:54 - been you know a full stack engineer you
27:56 - could have done database right which i
27:58 - know it kind of falls into that space
28:00 - but like what made you choose this and
28:01 - she was like honestly
28:03 - i
28:04 - did a couple different like courses
28:07 - and she ended up doing this boot camp
28:08 - but before the boot camp she was like i
28:09 - did a little like i dabbled and this was
28:11 - the thing that kept drawing me so i
28:13 - think just like exploring your options
28:15 - right like maybe you know you tinker
28:18 - around with some front end and you're
28:20 - like ah not really for me i would like
28:22 - doing the back end stuff or this
28:24 - language is you know drawing me and
28:26 - again i feel like i'm giving very vague
28:27 - answers but i think the passions kind of
28:29 - come out as you
28:31 - dabble which is why i love codecademy so
28:33 - much because
28:34 - you can go on to our site for free right
28:37 - um or pay for the pro and look at the
28:39 - different options that you have and
28:40 - you're like maybe i'm doing some
28:43 - you know i'm learning some react or some
28:47 - you know angular on the front end and
28:49 - you're like ah
28:50 - you know what i don't really feel like
28:51 - this is fun or interesting and so you
28:54 - move to you know machine learning or
28:56 - data science and you're like wow cool i
28:58 - love math and statistics this is great
29:02 - and hopefully that's a good answer
29:05 - the answer is a good answer
29:07 - yeah
29:07 - i i agree with you victoria because when
29:09 - i
29:10 - talking to candidates for so long i feel
29:11 - like you know especially senior
29:13 - engineers engineers that have you know
29:14 - been around the block for a couple years
29:16 - you know they're there you know scoping
29:18 - projects they're doing more architecture
29:19 - you know when they're going through the
29:21 - interview process and i talked to them
29:22 - about you know how did you get started
29:23 - in engineering they always talk about it
29:25 - being more of a passion pull than
29:27 - anything else you know they were either
29:28 - in a cs program or they were you know
29:31 - doing a career switch but you know
29:32 - something particular you know fascinated
29:35 - them and that's what they were drawn to
29:36 - and that's what they were willing to
29:37 - spend the extra hours studying and
29:39 - getting really good at and i think
29:41 - that's the one thing there's a lot of
29:42 - jobs out there today you know especially
29:44 - when it comes to engineering but it's
29:45 - also pretty competitive and i would say
29:47 - that like finding a way to really be
29:49 - that expert in you know either if it's
29:51 - front-end development or if it's you
29:53 - know the specific database or whatever
29:55 - um having finding what your passion is
29:57 - and then just diving into that um is
30:00 - really what'll help you down the line be
30:02 - able to actually you know land those
30:03 - jobs you want because it's going to be
30:05 - very competitive and so i think you know
30:08 - just following your passions is a great
30:09 - place to to start and then once you kind
30:12 - of figure out what you know you really
30:14 - like you know it might be hard to land
30:15 - that full-time job right away like
30:17 - realistically that's just going to be
30:18 - hard especially if you don't have a ton
30:20 - of like direct experience in that role
30:22 - um so you know picking up freelance
30:24 - opportunities or you know even if it's
30:26 - contract or part-time work like i know
30:28 - here at codecademy we have different
30:30 - options on that side but also a lot of
30:32 - other companies do too there's different
30:34 - services out there that'll offer you
30:35 - just straight freelance work and so
30:38 - like there's options out there to to
30:40 - play around with but um it's it's a lot
30:42 - easier to do if you love what you're
30:44 - doing versus just trying to do it
30:46 - because you think it's going to pay you
30:46 - a bunch of money down the line so
30:48 - definitely finding out what that is is
30:50 - super important i would agree or like
30:52 - help a buddy out with a website like
30:54 - everybody's online now so like even if
30:57 - you're maybe not getting paid
30:59 - you know like you said well like all of
31:01 - this money for it like if you have the
31:03 - passion there you know help your friend
31:05 - make a website for their business like
31:07 - um
31:08 - it's like photographers you're getting
31:09 - paid in exposure right yeah
31:13 - no but you put that on your resume you
31:15 - put that on your resume
31:21 - i feel like a lot of our users uh
31:22 - especially the beginners are the ones
31:24 - who look in four career searching into
31:26 - tech um i always like to explain this
31:29 - when they walk when we're going around
31:30 - the community and is look at businesses
31:33 - that do this for a living right that get
31:35 - people into their living like boot camps
31:38 - uh when you're in a boot camp you go
31:39 - through an intense 12 weeks and by week
31:42 - six or seven they're already telling you
31:43 - to start writing your resume down so
31:46 - if those people feel that they are ready
31:48 - if those people feel those candidates
31:49 - feel like hey you know i've learned
31:50 - enough or i've done enough or this is my
31:52 - portfolio and i'm good to go if that's
31:54 - what it takes for them to feel ready
31:56 - then that should be what it takes for
31:57 - anyone to feel that they're ready so
31:59 - even if you're learning on your own code
32:00 - academy you go through the full stack
32:01 - path or whatever
32:03 - just think back of like okay if this was
32:05 - a bootcamp what would be my next step
32:06 - they would be telling me to start
32:08 - sending applications out they'll be
32:10 - telling me to start connecting i'm
32:11 - building my network they'll they would
32:13 - be telling me to make sure that my
32:14 - portfolio is posted on github and
32:16 - sharing it right so
32:17 - sometimes i like to come to compare to
32:19 - those because
32:21 - it's you are doing the same thing you
32:23 - just don't have the bootcamp name behind
32:24 - you and people sort of like lose
32:26 - perspective of like that's what it takes
32:29 - you do these things and people are
32:30 - landing jobs right now so why wouldn't
32:32 - you right this there's no difference
32:35 - i mean you you guys are recruiters uh do
32:37 - you feel like when you see someone
32:39 - coming from a boot camp it gives them
32:40 - like a plus one or something is that
32:42 - like a like a strong differentiator
32:48 - i think it definitely helps compared to
32:50 - like absolutely nothing like i think you
32:52 - know in general i like you know when i'm
32:55 - most of the roles that i've worked on
32:56 - you know historically you know there are
32:58 - tend to be a little more on the senior
33:00 - side but when you're looking at entry
33:01 - level or mid-level you know a boot camp
33:03 - is as good as any cs degree but as long
33:06 - as like the experience matches up and
33:08 - like you know the timelines do as well
33:10 - you know i think realistically you can
33:12 - get a lot of the important information
33:13 - and get job ready at those boot camps
33:15 - but like what have you done with that
33:16 - did you use that to you know build up
33:18 - this awesome open source contribution
33:20 - that thousands of people are using or
33:22 - did you spend weeks building out this
33:24 - awesome project on github that you can
33:26 - show me to show my engineering manager
33:28 - to explain hey candidate x doesn't have
33:30 - you know three years of experience but
33:32 - look what they built like if you can use
33:34 - that boot camp knowledge to your
33:36 - advantage just the way you could use
33:38 - like a cs degree to your advantage um
33:40 - you could still land that job but it's
33:41 - just kind of like what you do with it
33:43 - not necessarily like i i don't know some
33:45 - people might you know be
33:47 - i know some companies in some hiring
33:48 - manners maybe aren't as
33:50 - hot to trot on boot camps as you know a
33:52 - cs degree per se but in reality if you
33:54 - can code and you can write it like
33:56 - you'll get the job
33:58 - if you can code you get the job how
33:59 - about that
34:00 - it's like cooking you can cook you got
34:02 - the job there you go
34:04 - i like it
34:06 - i think with the boot camps it's really
34:09 - the hours that you put in to the boot
34:11 - camp right
34:12 - so at the end of the day boot camp or
34:15 - not if you put in the time it's going to
34:17 - show in the interview process
34:19 - um a lot of people
34:21 - i've i've definitely spoken to people
34:22 - who've gone through a boot camp and
34:24 - they've only prepared
34:26 - to like do well in the interview but
34:28 - haven't really worked on their skill set
34:31 - that is assessed in the interview so
34:34 - that's a key differentiator you really
34:36 - want to just build that skill set that
34:38 - is going to be assessed in the interview
34:40 - itself rather than trying to
34:43 - do your like trying to prep for the
34:45 - interview
34:46 - as a whole if that makes um if that
34:49 - makes any sense but it's really about
34:51 - the hours and the time that you spent in
34:53 - it so if you put in the time and the
34:55 - work and you have something to show for
34:58 - it like will said you have a project you
35:01 - have something on your portfolio and
35:03 - that's something we as recruiters can
35:05 - take back to our team and say
35:07 - hey you know again the year's experience
35:10 - might not be there but what they built
35:12 - is incredible just within the span of
35:14 - like how much they
35:15 - the span of time they've been in the the
35:18 - the space you know what i mean so
35:21 - cool
35:22 - all right let's jump into q and a
35:23 - because i feel like uh the questions
35:25 - probably have a lot to do with what
35:26 - we're talking about anyway so
35:28 - let's see what people are saying um i'm
35:31 - gonna go in order of like oldest to
35:33 - newest so people in the chat right now
35:35 - don't worry about it i'll get to your
35:36 - questions i'm just gonna start from the
35:38 - very beginning
35:39 - uh early in the early in our chat today
35:42 - we had a user called cyan
35:44 - cyano9 that asked
35:47 - address hiring older candidates who are
35:50 - switching careers
35:51 - so what are your thoughts as recruiters
35:54 - when it comes to age and
35:56 - i mean i'm assuming the default answer
35:59 - is is not a factor but it's still a
36:01 - concern and i feel like people sometimes
36:03 - feel like tech it's like a a young
36:05 - person sort of job so
36:08 - how how would you talk to or somebody
36:10 - that might be older trying to get into
36:11 - deck
36:12 - what are your advice i love it i think
36:15 - it's awesome like there's no number
36:17 - there's no age for me when i see
36:18 - somebody who is doing a career change
36:21 - later on in their career i'm like wow
36:23 - you must really have a passion for this
36:26 - because why would you change your career
36:27 - your you know stable career
36:30 - to make a completely
36:31 - big change so me personally
36:35 - there i feel like i'm just assuming
36:37 - there's passion there so non-factor i
36:40 - think it
36:41 - it's like a
36:42 - thumbs up for me it's a it's a green
36:44 - flag
36:48 - yeah and i would also agree yeah it's
36:50 - not a factor i think obviously the
36:51 - reason the question was asked is because
36:53 - probably sometimes it unfortunately
36:55 - maybe becomes a factor and so the one
36:57 - thing that i would recommend is you know
36:58 - if you're applying for jobs you know
37:00 - that require you know certain types of
37:02 - technologies just learn the technologies
37:04 - the same way that any other candidate
37:05 - would that doesn't matter how old like
37:07 - age doesn't matter you know your ability
37:08 - to learn jenkins if you're applying for
37:10 - a devops role or something like that so
37:12 - what i've seen is that i think as long
37:14 - as you know the aptitudes there and like
37:16 - victoria mentioned the passion as well
37:17 - as you know the grasp of like the the
37:20 - tools that it takes to do the job you
37:22 - know age doesn't matter and it's it's uh
37:24 - it's it's a bummer that the question you
37:26 - know has to come up in the first place
37:28 - but i think you know companies are
37:29 - addressing it it's something that does
37:31 - you know
37:32 - is discussed about you know internally
37:33 - both you know you know across the board
37:35 - so i think you know i i think moving
37:38 - forward hopefully it'll be a little bit
37:39 - less of an issue to land some of those
37:41 - jobs
37:44 - okay let's move it on uh so basically
37:46 - it's not a factor obviously we're
37:47 - talking from a u.s centric point of view
37:50 - it should be the same across the world
37:51 - but unfortunately different countries
37:53 - different cultures different
37:54 - expectations like we can't speak for
37:56 - everybody everywhere but at least here
37:58 - in the u.s i know that i mean by law you
38:00 - can't discriminate based on age and just
38:03 - just talent is talent so if if you're
38:05 - working for if you're trying to apply
38:07 - for a company and they don't want you
38:08 - for the age then you don't want to work
38:09 - there anyways
38:10 - uh that's just not the place where you
38:12 - want to work at anyways uh either they
38:14 - if that's their mentality that's how
38:16 - they go doing things another question
38:19 - uh where can i find a job in remote role
38:21 - intermediate skills and learn as i work
38:24 - okay so this is multiple parts uh remote
38:27 - roles intermediate skills and learn
38:29 - hazard work so how do you i guess the
38:31 - question is
38:32 - how do you filter results in a way that
38:35 - maybe
38:36 - focuses on remote work or focuses on
38:38 - certain skills
38:40 - the job boards that we were talking
38:41 - about before like linkedin or any other
38:43 - job board do they have this kind of
38:44 - tooling where you can say i want remote
38:46 - only or i want this i want that
38:53 - most job boards should have some type of
38:55 - filtering based on location
38:58 - and
38:58 - now with everyone
39:00 - in this new age of working
39:03 - um probably have the option to work
39:06 - remote so i would say odds are most
39:08 - companies
39:10 - especially in the startup space in tech
39:13 - are pro remote there might be a few that
39:16 - are very
39:17 - much in office culture and usually those
39:20 - companies are pretty explicit about that
39:21 - too
39:22 - so
39:23 - there definitely are filters to filter
39:25 - out remote rules for sure and i think
39:27 - if anything if you if you read in the
39:29 - job descriptions themselves they'll
39:31 - they'll be very telling of like okay
39:33 - this world is also open to you know
39:34 - anywhere within the us or anywhere
39:36 - within x region and if they are an
39:39 - in-office culture odds are they're going
39:41 - to advertise that because they're trying
39:43 - to draw in people who want that too
39:46 - okay
39:47 - so basically there's filters you can use
39:49 - and just have to
39:50 - use them i know that sometimes it's a
39:51 - little weird uh with the keywords like i
39:53 - remember somebody was talking about how
39:55 - you might be searching for a junior
39:57 - developer role but a comp a different
39:59 - company might call it software engineer
40:00 - one
40:01 - and this
40:03 - this result is not gonna show you're
40:05 - looking for a keyword and you're never
40:06 - gonna find that other job that is
40:07 - actually what you're looking for just
40:09 - because of the keywords right so i guess
40:10 - with the remote is the same if it's
40:12 - remote if it's hybrid or if they call it
40:14 - something else known location i don't
40:16 - know what keywords they use for
40:18 - yeah yeah and one thing just to add
40:20 - there on that so if i remember the
40:21 - jobseeker mentioned that they were like
40:22 - at an intermediate level and looking to
40:24 - learn so one good question if you get on
40:26 - the horn with some of the recruiters is
40:27 - to ask about their internal like
40:29 - learning and development programs or
40:31 - professional development programs
40:32 - because codecademy is mostly a b2c
40:35 - platform where you know we help just
40:37 - individual learners but there's b2b
40:39 - companies out there that also offer
40:40 - similar types of products so like there
40:42 - are options for companies to give you
40:44 - upskilling once you get in the door and
40:46 - that's an example of a wonderful
40:48 - question to ask a recruiter to show that
40:50 - you're like interested in growing
40:51 - interested in engaging and also looking
40:54 - to learn a little bit more about like
40:55 - what the company has to offer so um
40:57 - definitely asking about some of those
40:59 - opportunities um it's totally fair game
41:01 - when you're having an intro with a
41:02 - recruiter
41:03 - cool
41:04 - all right uh question from brittany tour
41:07 - code sorry if i pronounce your own you
41:09 - use name wrong uh yeah the question is
41:12 - i'd love to hear any suggestions about
41:15 - how to navigate ndas with portfolio work
41:17 - i've done so much but i can't legally
41:20 - show off
41:21 - so
41:22 - how do you do that like how do you
41:24 - showcase that you know how to build
41:26 - stuff
41:27 - but you can't really show what you built
41:31 - yeah
41:32 - this is tough because like
41:36 - i i'm gonna say i think most recruiters
41:38 - get it you know i don't know her me well
41:41 - have you jumped on a call when
41:42 - somebody's like hey
41:43 - i want to give you more details about
41:45 - this project i'm working on but i'm it's
41:47 - a government contract
41:49 - so i like
41:50 - can't i think the best way to handle
41:52 - this is having those keywords you can
41:54 - put
41:55 - like what you did without actually
41:58 - sharing that project and i would put
42:00 - that on your resume like
42:03 - due to dna cannot share like links so
42:05 - you're addressing it like hey i've done
42:07 - this and this is what i've done i would
42:09 - give more detail but unfortunately
42:11 - you know legally i can't actually share
42:14 - my portfolio on this project but i think
42:16 - you can still talk about the tools you
42:18 - used and describe
42:21 - what you've done
42:22 - for that um and then bring it ahead and
42:25 - just you know be honest about you know
42:27 - hey i can't actually share this but i've
42:29 - i've done x y and z
42:32 - okay
42:34 - just i guess yeah you can't talk about
42:36 - it but you can still sort of talk about
42:38 - it wow there's two wheels
42:42 - and you're on ul
42:44 - okay so um
42:47 - there was a question here yes so let me
42:49 - get back to the questions
42:54 - someone was asking about overseas
42:55 - opportunities um
42:57 - now
42:58 - when you're a recruiter and you're
42:59 - looking at these applications
43:01 - does it is it important for you to see
43:03 - in the resume somewhere maybe at the top
43:05 - say something like i can legally work in
43:07 - the us or something like is that
43:08 - something that you need to disclose in
43:11 - your in your application process or if
43:14 - you are applying is sort of understood
43:15 - that you can
43:17 - so some companies will handle it
43:19 - differently some companies will have it
43:20 - as part of their like initial
43:22 - questionnaire um when applying but it's
43:25 - usually something that will come up on
43:26 - the intro call with the recruiter just
43:28 - um to make sure that you know it's a fit
43:30 - and that you know the company would be
43:32 - able to to offer you employment but you
43:34 - don't have to disclose it on the resume
43:36 - if you don't want to but it's something
43:37 - that will come up you know pretty early
43:39 - on usually the first call with the
43:41 - recruiter anyways
43:42 - i guess it depends on the company right
43:44 - because i've seen uh job applications
43:46 - where the actual form like the first
43:48 - application the first contact that you
43:50 - have with the company it will have a box
43:52 - that says something like
43:53 - you say that you can legally work in
43:55 - this country or whatever um
43:57 - so i guess it depends on the process
43:59 - right um right
44:01 - okay more questions
44:03 - [Music]
44:05 - somebody had a question about
44:08 - do you think it's okay to use google
44:10 - drive as a resume builder
44:12 - okay so you go to your google drive you
44:14 - use one of the templates wrestling
44:15 - template fill it out what's your
44:17 - thoughts on templates is that a negative
44:19 - is that a positive doesn't matter
44:20 - because my thought process is if
44:23 - everybody's using the same template then
44:24 - that means that the recruiter's eyes are
44:26 - sort of trained to go through the same
44:28 - sections so that can be a positive right
44:30 - because they don't have to fight to find
44:32 - the information they know where the
44:34 - information is going to be on your
44:35 - resume but at the same time you could
44:37 - say well a template means that you
44:39 - didn't put any effort into this do you
44:41 - really want the job
44:43 - so
44:44 - what's the stance on templates
44:48 - i like
44:50 - i feel like templates do
44:52 - nothing for me unless you're going for
44:54 - like a marketing role or a visual
44:56 - designer maybe like ui designer ux
44:58 - designer then i want to see like
45:00 - the pretty
45:02 - i i feel like i maybe i'm popular
45:05 - opinion i hate templates give me just
45:07 - like a generic google i'm just looking
45:09 - for the words
45:11 - i don't know how do you guys feel for me
45:12 - well
45:15 - yeah no i agree i don't care the
45:16 - formatting i'm more interested in the
45:18 - context but i agree for design special
45:20 - roles like if you're gonna get paid to
45:22 - make something look nice you probably
45:24 - should make sure your resume looks nice
45:25 - as well but otherwise
45:27 - more interested in the content and you
45:29 - know if a template helps you get it out
45:30 - quicker to customize it like karmi was
45:32 - mentioning earlier then go for it make a
45:34 - bunch of templates and churn them out
45:36 - that's fine by me
45:38 - i'm a stickler
45:40 - unfortunately
45:42 - and
45:43 - if your resume has poor
45:45 - poor formatting like
45:47 - obviously you're not getting discounted
45:49 - for that but
45:50 - i do look at that
45:52 - and that's something i you know keep in
45:54 - mind but
45:56 - i would say this think about it from the
45:58 - perspective of recruiter like the more
46:00 - well laid out your resume is the easier
46:02 - it is for them to find out where your
46:04 - skills are at what you're experienced in
46:07 - and for us to just get a sense of you as
46:10 - a person and your skill set as a
46:12 - professional um so resume templates do
46:16 - help
46:17 - to help like organize your thoughts your
46:20 - experience and the things you've done in
46:22 - your career um
46:24 - i'm a fan of them
46:26 - but
46:27 - it's not going to be the end-all be-all
46:29 - factor as to why you get the role but
46:31 - that's
46:32 - that's definitely not
46:34 - it but it helps organize yourself i mean
46:37 - obviously
46:38 - it's different poor formatting is
46:40 - different from
46:41 - template formatting right like
46:42 - performance like if there are typos if
46:44 - the
46:45 - task
46:46 - the type is so small that you can't read
46:48 - it right like there's colors everywhere
46:50 - that you can read like that's different
46:52 - than just saying drive new document
46:54 - template resume this my name that's what
46:56 - i did um right like are you are you
46:59 - saying that you consider poor formatting
47:01 - using templating or
47:02 - some templates have it set up where
47:06 - some templates are bad yeah it's just
47:08 - really bad i've seen some resumes that
47:10 - kind of look similar and they follow the
47:12 - same style and i really don't know what
47:14 - they're doing and
47:15 - really have to look and dig through so
47:18 - um
47:19 - odds are you're going to find a good
47:20 - template that lays everything out but if
47:23 - you somehow get a template that doesn't
47:25 - just just stick to the one
47:27 - where visually you can read everything
47:29 - yeah
47:30 - i've uh there's a question here in the
47:32 - chat from aaron gill that was asking
47:33 - about really creative resumes and i
47:35 - think this goes back to victoria what
47:37 - you were saying about if the role that
47:39 - you're applying for requires you to be
47:41 - very creative then the resume is an
47:43 - opportunity for you to showcase that
47:45 - creativity
47:46 - but if you're applying for a very dry
47:48 - job like you're going to be a developer
47:49 - and you're going to be on code all day
47:51 - you know having really great graphics
47:53 - and stuff in your resume might not
47:55 - really give you any points in the
47:57 - application right
47:59 - unless you're applying for hermits role
48:01 - because
48:01 - [Laughter]
48:05 - oh then resume yeah i i honestly think
48:08 - that like it just you have to give to um
48:11 - what
48:12 - job you're applying for something fun i
48:14 - did see in resume so i do a lot of
48:16 - hiring for developers full stack front
48:17 - end second all of that fun stuff um is
48:21 - somebody had like some code
48:23 - in their resume um which i had to look
48:26 - up like what it meant because obviously
48:27 - i'm not a developer but i thought that
48:29 - was fun a fun way to stand out i was
48:31 - like oh cool they not their whole resume
48:33 - wasn't written in code but there was
48:35 - like a little piece like that basically
48:37 - if you looked it up and said like hey
48:39 - i'm a software engineer so i thought
48:41 - that was fun right you know and that was
48:43 - the way this cool way to stand out right
48:45 - like it draws my attention because i was
48:46 - like what is this you know
48:49 - all right well thank you everybody we'll
48:50 - be here for like almost an hour uh time
48:52 - flies when you're having fun with your
48:54 - friends so
48:55 - uh thank you everybody for stopping by
48:57 - today and for asking all the questions
48:59 - in the chat and thank you for the
49:00 - panelists for answering questions
49:02 - i feel like we've covered topics that
49:04 - are
49:05 - so broad and there's so much to that can

Cleaned transcript:

and we're live all right awesome well welcome everybody in the chat waiting we had about 60 people waiting for this so pretty exciting we have three recruiters today with us and welcome everyone to the code academy live discussions that we have once in a while here on youtube hello youtube uh do we want to go around the room introducing ourselves um harvey you go first all right my name is harmeet and i'm a technical recruiter at codecademy i am hiring some engineering managers right now but typically i hire engineers across the board um that is me and i'll pass it to victoria hi everyone i'm victoria i'm also a technical recruiter here at co academy i started in june um loving it i mostly focus on ic roles and software engineering and also cyber security so we just hired two team members in cyber security they'll be starting this month so woohoo exciting stuff um passing the baton to you cool my name is will hi everyone um i'm based in boston massachusetts um i work here at codecademy as well on the technical recruiting team mostly um helping build out some of our product engineering teams um also help on the curriculum side so the folks that actually build out the courses that people learn and so um i've been here around the same amount of time as victoria and so yeah looking forward to chatting awesome and i'm fedi and i'm with the community team and i'll be your host today trying to moderate the chat and like i posted in the chat a few minutes ago if you anyone watching if you have questions for or participants today please save those questions for the end we'll make sure that we have time for q a so write them down or keep them in your mind and we'll go through the chat later to answer all your questions so to get started today uh we thought that would be interesting to have kind of like a threepart discussion where we talk about uh how you find jobs or where is the best places that you can do right now that you can go right now to find your tech jobs uh how once you found those jobs how you stand out from the competition for all the people that are applying for the same jobs and finally part three which is sort of okay so if you've if you already know where to look for jobs and you already know how to stand out or how to be a good candidate then how do you know what job to apply for because at the end of the day it's as much a question of where you want to work as is a question of how good of a candidate you are so let's get started the three of you with uh where to look for jobs what would you say dying to know what are the best places to look for jobs is there any job board that is killing it right now is there any place any website you know word of mouth if your uncle works somewhere is that the best is that um i want to learn i'm interested in her neat and well what do you guys think on this uh because i think referrals are the best you know like you said your uncle works here your cousin choice removed um i'm going to say that referral base goes a long way i always check referrals first um when through applications or if somebody you know has i have this great candidate um so i'm interested what you guys have to say about the job awards well in her meeting i would agree i i would agree victoria definitely you know referrals definitely stand out they go to the top of the pile um in terms of who you're going to check out and you know give a consideration to usually they'll at least get a phone call so yeah you know personal networks and stuff like that definitely um a great place to look in terms of you know asking around seeing if people can forward resumes on and stuff like that um because yeah whenever they come across our desk it's definitely something that stands out to me um personally i spent a lot of time on linkedin um you know just searching and so i know that like codecademy we post our jobs on linkedin as well as our career page so like you know if a job seeker is looking you know they know hey this is a company i definitely want to work for it like any any major company that has an online presence will have a careers page where they can go that'll have active job postings and usually those will link right to you know the they'll come right to our desks basically you know when when we get a uh applicant or a referral they'll come to one of our systems that kind of comes right to our inbox and so whether you apply i mean that's a debate like whether you want to apply on a job board or whether you want to apply directly through a company's website i don't know if it matters too much but usually you know between linkedin or definitely the careers pages that's that's usually what i'd be kind of looking um to source candidates from anyways i don't know hermit what about what are you thinking yeah i think you both hit on great points um referrals are huge for sure if you know someone who works at a place that you really want to work at that's probably your best way to at least get your foot in the door get an interview get like the first interview right so everyone's got an uncle an aunt or a friend or you know you'll walk someone's dog on occasion whatever it may be really scour through your network to leverage anybody who can help you out um you know a good thing is to like connect with all those people too on linkedin because if you're looking at jobs on linkedin and you see that one of your connections works there why not ask them hey like i'm looking at this job could you help me out would you be able to refer me the worst that they can say is no so you got to try any turnover any stone possible so those two linkedin and referrals are huge um google searches for sure just google search like the types of jobs you want at the companies that you want that's going to be huge as well it's a great avenue but leveraging your personal networks is probably your best bet um and if you don't have a personal network try building it you know go to events go to conferences there's a lot of free events and conferences and just talk to people um and it'll be really easy to talk to people if you're going to events that you're actually personally interested in right so it's not like you're it makes it just makes it a little easier when you know about the subject matter and you can strike a conversation that way right i agree i mean it's interesting that you guys bring up this point of referrals because um i know i know that a lot of times we mix up the two of how you showcase your portfolio and how you get experience if you've never worked as a debt before and it's kind of like the problem like i don't have experience i can't get the job and i can't get the job if i don't have the experience and oftentimes i hear that the solution to this is kind of a combination of participating communities or online open source projects that will give you some exposure to what would look like experience and then at the same time you get to meet the people in those communities that might have jobs in tech companies or might have you know a food already in the door and they can help you if you make a good impression with them so it's sort of uh it seems that we are we are talking about different things but it really it's all connected in like how it all plays out in your favor at the end for sure for sure i think i think you definitely nailed it especially with like you know what harmee was saying because as you're getting started you know i remember when i was early on in my recruiting career i didn't know any software engineers and i had to meet them online or i had to meet them through conferences or i had to go to networking events and you know over time over years it eventually you know the network gets bigger but when you find those commonalities things you have in common with people like you went to the same conference it's okay to reach out to them even on linkedin and say hey you know looking to build my professional network i'm not saying spam random people that's not a good idea you'll not get the success you're looking for that way but if you find people that either went to the same boot camp that you did or that went to a conference that you did you know finding those commonalities and then just being proactive and reaching out even if you've never had a oneonone conversation um sometimes just you know building those linkedin networks because when we post a job they like if i post a job today it'll get posted to my immediate network and then some more of like their first degree connections and so the more connections you have you know even if you don't know these people directly the more opportunities you're gonna see just different jobs different other people to connect to um it really can kind of snowball but but yeah the networking is something that never really stops but it's it's it's daunting to start but once you just get it snowballing it gets easier i assure you well i mean i think uh some of the questions that people tend to have are things like well i don't want to cross any red lines i don't have any red flags like if i know someone at the company and i ask them how the recruiting process is is that a red flag is that you know something is it inappropriate it seems like sometimes people have this kind of fear of like not asking too many questions or trying to be too prodding because it might come across as a bad sign and i guess that's just kind of like a hard line to it depends on each company i guess it has different policies on this and how transparent they are with the application process yeah definitely i think a lot of different companies have a lot of different strategies for us at co academy specifically we're very much willing to like let you know what's involved in the interview process what the next step is going to look like and we often do prep calls for final interviews as well so for us we're very very open in terms of the process and uh there are a lot of companies who are open to letting you know about the process and what's involved in the interview um loop for that particular company but there there are some companies maybe they won't give too much information or divulge but the only way you're going to find out is if you ask so don't be afraid to ask all right that's uh i'll take that in mind uh keep that in mind so so we're talking about gel boards and it seems like linkedin it's a pretty strong tool right now um how does that compare to other competitors that they might have like a zip recruiter or indeed or like you you mentioned google like that's an aggregate right like if you go to google search jobs near me the list that is polling is from all these other sites right like you're going to see from every other job board so it's a better just go to one of these aggregates like sometimes you know one question i often have with these boards is you see jobs that are posted 20 days ago 25 days ago 30 plus days ago is that should people filter the results that they're finding in job boards for the most recent ones or is it fairly common to have job postings open for a while i think in tech it's very common to have job postings open for a while um i just it's it's a hot industry right the market's really hot right now whatever you are in your career right like whether you're more junior engineer or whether you're looking for like i mean i think your engineering manager has been open for 30 plus days right um i don't think that's a red flag i just think that it means that hey the role's still open we're still looking for the right fit for the company um i don't know if you guys have anything else to add to that i feel like candidates feel like that they're like oh man the job has been open for 90 days plus that means that they probably have people in final stages yeah maybe we do but i don't also i don't think that's also a deterrent it just means maybe we opened the posting before we had an interview process put in place right so we wanted to get the traction so it took maybe uh you know a couple weeks to get the interview going you know the process in place and training that was the case for me in security i had an opening that i mean it's been open for a while but i didn't have a process in place so we couldn't bring people in because i didn't have an interview process in place so i don't think that's a deterrent um it could be i mean it could be we can have people in final stages but i don't i would say jobs i mean how how likely do you guys think that is uh when you apply for a job and it might not be available anymore for the company to sort of reroute the candidate to something else like is that is that fairly a fairly common practice in companies where they would say oh you apply for this we feel that rule but here is this other opportunity or yeah yeah yeah no for sure like internally both here as well as you know other companies i've worked at if a role gets closed down and there are other active candidates that either have applied or they might be in mid stages if there's another role like another full stack roll for a similar full stack position we will 100 roll those candidates over and then try to see if if that would be of interest you know usually it'll be a little bit of a different team and maybe a different scope and so obviously it would be a question for the candidate if it aligns with what they'd be wanting to do as well but but yeah if if someone's already in process um and there's more roles to fill they'll definitely have a chance at other opportunities and usually even some opportunities might be a little outside their comfort zone usually that's how it works it's rare that we find you know a perfect fit i think in general it's sometimes you know hey you know we think you might be interested in something like this would you be willing to take this on or you know here's an interview loop would you be interested in sort of tackling that and so being open to and being flexible with interview processes will definitely i think be uh an attribute to have in terms of you know just getting a variety of opportunities and seeing what fits the best just to piggyback off that because that was really well said i think like to add to that like recruiters you know we we do this we we help people match up with the job and a lot of the time a lot of recruiters have a lot of tenure and experience doing that and so when you get that recommendation or suggestion trust in that recommendation or suggestion or at least enough to experience the interview loop learn more about it and see if it's a fit for you um because at the end of the day we want to provide people opportunities that's a good fit um it doesn't make sense for any recruiter to bring someone into a role that's not a good fit so usually when you get that suggestion it's coming from a good place it's coming from oh i think your skill set might match with x so if you're interested let's let's let's try it out the worst that happen is you find out it's not a fit yeah i guess so i mean uh you know you miss 100 of the shots you don't take right uh sort of thing so mentality i suppose uh i think that's a good segue we're talking about uh recommendations and how people uh you might apply for a job they tell you hey this is filled or maybe this is not the right fit for you but there's this other one that it is um if you get to that position you're a candidate that has shown some potential at least to the point where a recruiter will get back to you uh because you know a lot of times you don't hear a lot like that the process is not very transparent sometimes you just get a generic email saying we're moving on without you right or like there was a lot of competition there's a lot of applicants whatever unfortunately this unfortunately that so if you get to that point you're like okay yeah i got a shot how do you stand out as an applicant what do you do to say i should get this rule is there any top you know recommendations that you have things that you think that work really well like links to portfolios maybe asking the right questions mentioning certain like keywords like do recruiters listen for keywords like you say certain buzzwords that are aligned with the job is that a plus one how do you stand out yeah um are you for somebody to go i know i know we didn't establish a good speaker i'll get i'll i'll get this started and then uh kick it over you go first yeah um but yeah so i think just in terms of standing out you know asking questions is a great place to start i think you know victoria harmeet and i you know when we're hiring for active roles you know we're talking to a fair amount of folks throughout the day you know our portion tends to be a little bit similar we're obviously talking about the role in the company the one thing the thing that stands out for me with candidates is the ones that do ask questions especially questions that aren't just like the boilerplate um you know stock questions that you know you might read on like a top 10 google search questions of what to ask a recruiter you know asking real questions about like you know hey i noticed you just started working there three months ago how's that been going for you like asking a real question like personal experience of how has my time here been going is a great question to ask for a candidate because it's a way to get some honest feedback on someone who's recently come aboard but it also shows me as the recruiter that they're thinking about you know wanting to be here for the right reasons and so i think asking questions is just a great way to stand out once you get on the phone with recruiters and uh and again that's not to say just ask a bunch of boilerplate questions but especially when you're talking to a company that you really want to work at think about why you want to work there and you know this is a chance to learn a little bit about it so i would definitely say early on asking those those good questions is an awesome place to start okay asking questions a lot of questions but questions that make sense not yeah questions like oh what is the thing that you like the least oh working that's so try not to be too cliche okay right okay i think i think for me yes big on the questions i think we're i think we're all human and i feel like sometimes recruiting can see as transact like be seen as transactional you get a candid email um you know you talk to a maybe a recruiter that is newer in the space and they're asking you more of those generic questions so for me honestly candidates that stand out are people who like line up with our mission right so somebody who's done some research you know we have a conversation during the conversation i get to learn a little bit more aside from just like the tech skills about how this person works with other teams and other people and i'm i'm assessing like oh are you a good fit for x team or maybe this team right um so for me it's kind of like that human that human touch you don't need to you know have like a list of your answers written down and be reading from a script um it's really finding that like right fit and i don't know if that's like a really like i feel like it's a vague answer to give i think it's it's a good answer if we put it in the context of when you apply for a role you should there should be a reason you're applying for this role in particular right i feel like a lot of beginners apply for any role because all they're trying to do is get a job anywhere any way they can right and the problem with that approach is that you it's really hard to stand out when you're just trying it's just one in a million right um so i feel like those kind of questions right like you can only ask the right questions if it's something that is really interesting to you like you've looked at code academy for example you've looked at what we work on the courses and you're like yeah i'm really interested in participating in this team success in these projects and tackling these issues right uh and then you get to ask those questions because you know like you know why you are there so i guess that's it's kind of like what you're saying is to ask those right questions it also has to make sense to you the candidate right yeah exactly anything to add to me it's a tough act to follow they they covered it pretty well if it comes from a genuine interest you will want to go out of your way to research the company and look up things that the company is doing and then you can bring that up too um i guess the only thing i can add to this is like listen to what the recruiter says about the role if they give you an explanation of the role listen to what they're looking for in the role and then when it's time for you to answer the recruiter or to talk about your experience and some of the things you do try to make it match up as close as you can obviously you don't want to um stretch the boundaries and maybe fib about your experience like don't do that talk to your experience and your experience only but see if there's a way to frame it in a way that makes sense based on what the recruiter is looking for in the role and what the like what a successful candidate might look like in that role too and that might be a good question too to ask what if um what if i take a step back army what if we go to the very beginning like you're not talking to the recruiter yet you're applying for the job how do you stand out there you haven't talked to the person you don't get to use your charms and your smile and your smart questions about code academy like how do you stand out then like is there um is this more of a game of keywords is it is there certain things like you have to tailor your portfolio to the role you're looking for or you have to apply in the right places or how how heavy you know how much weight does your cover letter have in that right like there's a lot of questions that surround how to stand out at the very beginning where you're just a number in someone's list right how do you how would you say what would you say in your experience you three are things that make people stand out more is it like restaurants are very clean links to their linkedin pages in the rasmus or is it like mentions to portfolios is it the verbs they use in resumes action verbs or passive things like that like what would you say that's like the most things that you usually find at work yeah i would say in terms of the resume and tailoring it that is something i tell everyone you should definitely tailor your resume towards the job description you're applying to if you just send a cookie cutter resume odds are you're probably not going to get as many responses back as you'd like so take a look at the job description look at all the words that they use and look at what they list out the most i'm pretty sure you can get a sense of like what this job is really looking for based on how many times they repeat something or how many times something's listed multiple times so you can get a sense of that you can also get a sense of what the company's looking for by looking at like they're about us seeing their values seeing what they care about you know if they do pro bono work as well you know there's so much you can learn from just exploring and researching the company page what they do what they've been up to in terms of the news and so incorporating all of that information into your resume or your portfolio and i would say there's some things that you can tailor in terms of your experience in terms of verbiage explaining it away there's so many ways to explain one thing that you've done so try and get creative with it maybe like have a google draft of like different ways to explain the same bullet in your experience for one of your jobs right so the more you get used to that the the more you can kind of um tailor your resume and your portfolio towards a job i'm gonna plus one to that for me i feel like the challenge is when you're writing your resume or your linkedin profile is like you are you assume that people know by one bullet what you're doing and the thing is is like for us who are doing searches saying the linkedin like maybe i'm my search is a little different than like will search right and i'm using a different word and you just didn't rewrite that bullet three times and now you lost your chance because you you assumed that this would cover everything you're like oh just because i wrote you know that i work with um you know javascript it's assumed that i'm working with uh different you know frameworks of it like angular and uh you know react um but don't don't assume that and i i can't i can't plus one enough like you want to rewrite the same thing you're doing in a couple different ways because you don't know how you're going to come up in that search yep yep and then yeah there's lastly one thing that i agree just in terms of how you frame the resume is super important for the jobs you're searching but you know especially if you're even early on and you don't have a lot of those bullets to even write you know you're just getting started in your career you know as in you know as a technology recruiter you know have looking at people's you know active githubs or you know personal sites if you're a mobile developer like have you published something to the app store like if you don't have the actual career experience but can still show that you're actively coding or if you're a designer you're actively designing stuff you know having a body of work to show that hey this is more this is not only a passion for me but this is something that i spend hours doing um is a great indicator of just how committed you would be you know obviously you're getting paid for it too so i think just having some of those open source contributions and you know personal projects definitely githubs for engineers you know those things will help you to get that you know especially early on when you maybe don't have some of the years of experience so definitely you know be working on the side projects too as much as you can they're fun and uh i think they'll also be super helpful yeah i mean um i feel like a lot of people forget that if you're recruiting for a junior role the expectations are set for a junior role too i feel like sometimes people there's this huge impostor syndrome around the tech community where it's like i haven't built enough portfolio projects i don't know enough javascript i don't know enough about all of this i don't i definitely don't know enough react right like they there's always this kind of like thought of negative thoughts of like i'm not good enough for this and people kind of like keep themselves from applying for jobs because they just don't think that they're going to qualify or they're good enough for this so the whole idea of you know you take you take your portfolio and you showcase what you have and just kind of like take a chance and understand that the recruiters on the other side also understand that they're hiring someone with no experience so they're looking for other things right they're not looking for you to say you have five years to experience this because then it wouldn't be a junior role right like this the expectations come from both sides right so when you're building your projects when you're building your resume it's kind of like you and they also understand where you're coming from it's not unreasonable right people have been unreasonable all right well let's say that okay so we talked about how how to stand out a little bit i feel like uh to close this off and go for the q a let's talk about what's out there okay so fulltime parttime freelance contracts uh open source um your recruiters you browse the internet all the time you've gone through linkedin billion times what is out there to get people started in their tech careers in the tech journalists you could be a career switcher right now you could be a teacher accountant you could be somebody right now starbucks like how do you get started with this how do you get the ball rolling what's the best places or what are the best things that you think are out there for this taking some courses on codecademy of course all right well that's it that's the live stream thank you no but dabbling you know like dabbling into seeing what you're interested in i have uh like a fun story at my previous company i hired a bi engineer uh one um and this person this candidate was a manager of a movie theater for most of their career um and it was just a passion she ended up taking a bunch of different courses um and was like i really want to get into tech like i really want to do that and so one of the questions i asked when you know we're going through the interview process i was like why business intelligence well you know there's so much you could have been you know a full stack engineer you could have done database right which i know it kind of falls into that space but like what made you choose this and she was like honestly i did a couple different like courses and she ended up doing this boot camp but before the boot camp she was like i did a little like i dabbled and this was the thing that kept drawing me so i think just like exploring your options right like maybe you know you tinker around with some front end and you're like ah not really for me i would like doing the back end stuff or this language is you know drawing me and again i feel like i'm giving very vague answers but i think the passions kind of come out as you dabble which is why i love codecademy so much because you can go on to our site for free right um or pay for the pro and look at the different options that you have and you're like maybe i'm doing some you know i'm learning some react or some you know angular on the front end and you're like ah you know what i don't really feel like this is fun or interesting and so you move to you know machine learning or data science and you're like wow cool i love math and statistics this is great and hopefully that's a good answer the answer is a good answer yeah i i agree with you victoria because when i talking to candidates for so long i feel like you know especially senior engineers engineers that have you know been around the block for a couple years you know they're there you know scoping projects they're doing more architecture you know when they're going through the interview process and i talked to them about you know how did you get started in engineering they always talk about it being more of a passion pull than anything else you know they were either in a cs program or they were you know doing a career switch but you know something particular you know fascinated them and that's what they were drawn to and that's what they were willing to spend the extra hours studying and getting really good at and i think that's the one thing there's a lot of jobs out there today you know especially when it comes to engineering but it's also pretty competitive and i would say that like finding a way to really be that expert in you know either if it's frontend development or if it's you know the specific database or whatever um having finding what your passion is and then just diving into that um is really what'll help you down the line be able to actually you know land those jobs you want because it's going to be very competitive and so i think you know just following your passions is a great place to to start and then once you kind of figure out what you know you really like you know it might be hard to land that fulltime job right away like realistically that's just going to be hard especially if you don't have a ton of like direct experience in that role um so you know picking up freelance opportunities or you know even if it's contract or parttime work like i know here at codecademy we have different options on that side but also a lot of other companies do too there's different services out there that'll offer you just straight freelance work and so like there's options out there to to play around with but um it's it's a lot easier to do if you love what you're doing versus just trying to do it because you think it's going to pay you a bunch of money down the line so definitely finding out what that is is super important i would agree or like help a buddy out with a website like everybody's online now so like even if you're maybe not getting paid you know like you said well like all of this money for it like if you have the passion there you know help your friend make a website for their business like um it's like photographers you're getting paid in exposure right yeah no but you put that on your resume you put that on your resume i feel like a lot of our users uh especially the beginners are the ones who look in four career searching into tech um i always like to explain this when they walk when we're going around the community and is look at businesses that do this for a living right that get people into their living like boot camps uh when you're in a boot camp you go through an intense 12 weeks and by week six or seven they're already telling you to start writing your resume down so if those people feel that they are ready if those people feel those candidates feel like hey you know i've learned enough or i've done enough or this is my portfolio and i'm good to go if that's what it takes for them to feel ready then that should be what it takes for anyone to feel that they're ready so even if you're learning on your own code academy you go through the full stack path or whatever just think back of like okay if this was a bootcamp what would be my next step they would be telling me to start sending applications out they'll be telling me to start connecting i'm building my network they'll they would be telling me to make sure that my portfolio is posted on github and sharing it right so sometimes i like to come to compare to those because it's you are doing the same thing you just don't have the bootcamp name behind you and people sort of like lose perspective of like that's what it takes you do these things and people are landing jobs right now so why wouldn't you right this there's no difference i mean you you guys are recruiters uh do you feel like when you see someone coming from a boot camp it gives them like a plus one or something is that like a like a strong differentiator i think it definitely helps compared to like absolutely nothing like i think you know in general i like you know when i'm most of the roles that i've worked on you know historically you know there are tend to be a little more on the senior side but when you're looking at entry level or midlevel you know a boot camp is as good as any cs degree but as long as like the experience matches up and like you know the timelines do as well you know i think realistically you can get a lot of the important information and get job ready at those boot camps but like what have you done with that did you use that to you know build up this awesome open source contribution that thousands of people are using or did you spend weeks building out this awesome project on github that you can show me to show my engineering manager to explain hey candidate x doesn't have you know three years of experience but look what they built like if you can use that boot camp knowledge to your advantage just the way you could use like a cs degree to your advantage um you could still land that job but it's just kind of like what you do with it not necessarily like i i don't know some people might you know be i know some companies in some hiring manners maybe aren't as hot to trot on boot camps as you know a cs degree per se but in reality if you can code and you can write it like you'll get the job if you can code you get the job how about that it's like cooking you can cook you got the job there you go i like it i think with the boot camps it's really the hours that you put in to the boot camp right so at the end of the day boot camp or not if you put in the time it's going to show in the interview process um a lot of people i've i've definitely spoken to people who've gone through a boot camp and they've only prepared to like do well in the interview but haven't really worked on their skill set that is assessed in the interview so that's a key differentiator you really want to just build that skill set that is going to be assessed in the interview itself rather than trying to do your like trying to prep for the interview as a whole if that makes um if that makes any sense but it's really about the hours and the time that you spent in it so if you put in the time and the work and you have something to show for it like will said you have a project you have something on your portfolio and that's something we as recruiters can take back to our team and say hey you know again the year's experience might not be there but what they built is incredible just within the span of like how much they the span of time they've been in the the the space you know what i mean so cool all right let's jump into q and a because i feel like uh the questions probably have a lot to do with what we're talking about anyway so let's see what people are saying um i'm gonna go in order of like oldest to newest so people in the chat right now don't worry about it i'll get to your questions i'm just gonna start from the very beginning uh early in the early in our chat today we had a user called cyan cyano9 that asked address hiring older candidates who are switching careers so what are your thoughts as recruiters when it comes to age and i mean i'm assuming the default answer is is not a factor but it's still a concern and i feel like people sometimes feel like tech it's like a a young person sort of job so how how would you talk to or somebody that might be older trying to get into deck what are your advice i love it i think it's awesome like there's no number there's no age for me when i see somebody who is doing a career change later on in their career i'm like wow you must really have a passion for this because why would you change your career your you know stable career to make a completely big change so me personally there i feel like i'm just assuming there's passion there so nonfactor i think it it's like a thumbs up for me it's a it's a green flag yeah and i would also agree yeah it's not a factor i think obviously the reason the question was asked is because probably sometimes it unfortunately maybe becomes a factor and so the one thing that i would recommend is you know if you're applying for jobs you know that require you know certain types of technologies just learn the technologies the same way that any other candidate would that doesn't matter how old like age doesn't matter you know your ability to learn jenkins if you're applying for a devops role or something like that so what i've seen is that i think as long as you know the aptitudes there and like victoria mentioned the passion as well as you know the grasp of like the the tools that it takes to do the job you know age doesn't matter and it's it's uh it's it's a bummer that the question you know has to come up in the first place but i think you know companies are addressing it it's something that does you know is discussed about you know internally both you know you know across the board so i think you know i i think moving forward hopefully it'll be a little bit less of an issue to land some of those jobs okay let's move it on uh so basically it's not a factor obviously we're talking from a u.s centric point of view it should be the same across the world but unfortunately different countries different cultures different expectations like we can't speak for everybody everywhere but at least here in the u.s i know that i mean by law you can't discriminate based on age and just just talent is talent so if if you're working for if you're trying to apply for a company and they don't want you for the age then you don't want to work there anyways uh that's just not the place where you want to work at anyways uh either they if that's their mentality that's how they go doing things another question uh where can i find a job in remote role intermediate skills and learn as i work okay so this is multiple parts uh remote roles intermediate skills and learn hazard work so how do you i guess the question is how do you filter results in a way that maybe focuses on remote work or focuses on certain skills the job boards that we were talking about before like linkedin or any other job board do they have this kind of tooling where you can say i want remote only or i want this i want that most job boards should have some type of filtering based on location and now with everyone in this new age of working um probably have the option to work remote so i would say odds are most companies especially in the startup space in tech are pro remote there might be a few that are very much in office culture and usually those companies are pretty explicit about that too so there definitely are filters to filter out remote rules for sure and i think if anything if you if you read in the job descriptions themselves they'll they'll be very telling of like okay this world is also open to you know anywhere within the us or anywhere within x region and if they are an inoffice culture odds are they're going to advertise that because they're trying to draw in people who want that too okay so basically there's filters you can use and just have to use them i know that sometimes it's a little weird uh with the keywords like i remember somebody was talking about how you might be searching for a junior developer role but a comp a different company might call it software engineer one and this this result is not gonna show you're looking for a keyword and you're never gonna find that other job that is actually what you're looking for just because of the keywords right so i guess with the remote is the same if it's remote if it's hybrid or if they call it something else known location i don't know what keywords they use for yeah yeah and one thing just to add there on that so if i remember the jobseeker mentioned that they were like at an intermediate level and looking to learn so one good question if you get on the horn with some of the recruiters is to ask about their internal like learning and development programs or professional development programs because codecademy is mostly a b2c platform where you know we help just individual learners but there's b2b companies out there that also offer similar types of products so like there are options for companies to give you upskilling once you get in the door and that's an example of a wonderful question to ask a recruiter to show that you're like interested in growing interested in engaging and also looking to learn a little bit more about like what the company has to offer so um definitely asking about some of those opportunities um it's totally fair game when you're having an intro with a recruiter cool all right uh question from brittany tour code sorry if i pronounce your own you use name wrong uh yeah the question is i'd love to hear any suggestions about how to navigate ndas with portfolio work i've done so much but i can't legally show off so how do you do that like how do you showcase that you know how to build stuff but you can't really show what you built yeah this is tough because like i i'm gonna say i think most recruiters get it you know i don't know her me well have you jumped on a call when somebody's like hey i want to give you more details about this project i'm working on but i'm it's a government contract so i like can't i think the best way to handle this is having those keywords you can put like what you did without actually sharing that project and i would put that on your resume like due to dna cannot share like links so you're addressing it like hey i've done this and this is what i've done i would give more detail but unfortunately you know legally i can't actually share my portfolio on this project but i think you can still talk about the tools you used and describe what you've done for that um and then bring it ahead and just you know be honest about you know hey i can't actually share this but i've i've done x y and z okay just i guess yeah you can't talk about it but you can still sort of talk about it wow there's two wheels and you're on ul okay so um there was a question here yes so let me get back to the questions someone was asking about overseas opportunities um now when you're a recruiter and you're looking at these applications does it is it important for you to see in the resume somewhere maybe at the top say something like i can legally work in the us or something like is that something that you need to disclose in your in your application process or if you are applying is sort of understood that you can so some companies will handle it differently some companies will have it as part of their like initial questionnaire um when applying but it's usually something that will come up on the intro call with the recruiter just um to make sure that you know it's a fit and that you know the company would be able to to offer you employment but you don't have to disclose it on the resume if you don't want to but it's something that will come up you know pretty early on usually the first call with the recruiter anyways i guess it depends on the company right because i've seen uh job applications where the actual form like the first application the first contact that you have with the company it will have a box that says something like you say that you can legally work in this country or whatever um so i guess it depends on the process right um right okay more questions somebody had a question about do you think it's okay to use google drive as a resume builder okay so you go to your google drive you use one of the templates wrestling template fill it out what's your thoughts on templates is that a negative is that a positive doesn't matter because my thought process is if everybody's using the same template then that means that the recruiter's eyes are sort of trained to go through the same sections so that can be a positive right because they don't have to fight to find the information they know where the information is going to be on your resume but at the same time you could say well a template means that you didn't put any effort into this do you really want the job so what's the stance on templates i like i feel like templates do nothing for me unless you're going for like a marketing role or a visual designer maybe like ui designer ux designer then i want to see like the pretty i i feel like i maybe i'm popular opinion i hate templates give me just like a generic google i'm just looking for the words i don't know how do you guys feel for me well yeah no i agree i don't care the formatting i'm more interested in the context but i agree for design special roles like if you're gonna get paid to make something look nice you probably should make sure your resume looks nice as well but otherwise more interested in the content and you know if a template helps you get it out quicker to customize it like karmi was mentioning earlier then go for it make a bunch of templates and churn them out that's fine by me i'm a stickler unfortunately and if your resume has poor poor formatting like obviously you're not getting discounted for that but i do look at that and that's something i you know keep in mind but i would say this think about it from the perspective of recruiter like the more well laid out your resume is the easier it is for them to find out where your skills are at what you're experienced in and for us to just get a sense of you as a person and your skill set as a professional um so resume templates do help to help like organize your thoughts your experience and the things you've done in your career um i'm a fan of them but it's not going to be the endall beall factor as to why you get the role but that's that's definitely not it but it helps organize yourself i mean obviously it's different poor formatting is different from template formatting right like performance like if there are typos if the task the type is so small that you can't read it right like there's colors everywhere that you can read like that's different than just saying drive new document template resume this my name that's what i did um right like are you are you saying that you consider poor formatting using templating or some templates have it set up where some templates are bad yeah it's just really bad i've seen some resumes that kind of look similar and they follow the same style and i really don't know what they're doing and really have to look and dig through so um odds are you're going to find a good template that lays everything out but if you somehow get a template that doesn't just just stick to the one where visually you can read everything yeah i've uh there's a question here in the chat from aaron gill that was asking about really creative resumes and i think this goes back to victoria what you were saying about if the role that you're applying for requires you to be very creative then the resume is an opportunity for you to showcase that creativity but if you're applying for a very dry job like you're going to be a developer and you're going to be on code all day you know having really great graphics and stuff in your resume might not really give you any points in the application right unless you're applying for hermits role because [Laughter] oh then resume yeah i i honestly think that like it just you have to give to um what job you're applying for something fun i did see in resume so i do a lot of hiring for developers full stack front end second all of that fun stuff um is somebody had like some code in their resume um which i had to look up like what it meant because obviously i'm not a developer but i thought that was fun a fun way to stand out i was like oh cool they not their whole resume wasn't written in code but there was like a little piece like that basically if you looked it up and said like hey i'm a software engineer so i thought that was fun right you know and that was the way this cool way to stand out right like it draws my attention because i was like what is this you know all right well thank you everybody we'll be here for like almost an hour
