00:00 - everyone it's me again elisa uh
00:03 - i said last week that every week i'd
00:05 - like to hop in with a little bit of
00:07 - encouragement or like a
00:08 - tip for community building and this week
00:12 - i'd like to talk about agendas
00:15 - and creating your agendas and i didn't
00:17 - just pull that out of nowhere there was
00:18 - a few of you that actually were asking
00:20 - about like well what should we do and
00:22 - like how do we organize this and that's
00:24 - such a good question
00:25 - it's um it's not straightforward so i'm
00:29 - i'd like to say that for those of you
00:32 - who are just creating your first meetups
00:34 - let your first meet up be about
00:38 - getting to know your first people
00:40 - because they're going to be so important
00:42 - to your your chapter's health
00:45 - and growth um and just
00:48 - listen so if you if you must and i think
00:52 - it's a good idea
00:52 - to like for your for your creating your
00:54 - first meet up to have an agenda
00:56 - you can ha say 15 minutes for intros
01:00 - x amount like the bulk amount of your
01:01 - time for um
01:03 - an info gathering or for just making
01:06 - decisions about what it is you want to
01:08 - do as a chapter and then a wrap-up time
01:11 - so
01:11 - that's a three-part pretty solid
01:14 - template for what you can imagine a
01:16 - first meetup to be
01:17 - and then as your second meetup gets
01:20 - underway
01:21 - you'll have a bit more of an idea of
01:23 - what your
01:24 - group of people actually want to do so
01:27 - you can be more descriptive
01:29 - in your on your page for your chapter
01:32 - and on your meetup page
01:34 - um a really good example he's not gonna
01:37 - love that i'm calling this out
01:38 - i don't care is to look at the denver
01:41 - meetup
01:42 - that michael bragg is hosting michael
01:44 - bragg is a master
01:46 - online community builder i've been
01:49 - working with him actually for two years
01:52 - in the codecademy community and
01:54 - he is the guy to look to
01:57 - for how to engage a group of people
02:00 - around code
02:01 - uh so for a good example of what a solid
02:05 - agenda
02:05 - and meetup page looks like just check
02:07 - out michael braggs for
02:09 - for the denver group and then once
02:12 - you've got
02:13 - a groove going for your meetup you
02:16 - should
02:17 - not should i like that word you will
02:20 - probably
02:22 - at that point know like what a solid
02:24 - agenda is
02:25 - and also don't be afraid to
02:29 - iterate um it won't always be the same
02:33 - the template probably will um striking
02:36 - the balance between
02:38 - rituals so that your members know what
02:40 - it is
02:41 - that they generally get when they show
02:43 - up
02:44 - and iterating so that we're not sticking
02:47 - to something that doesn't feel right
02:49 - for your chapters most of this is gonna
02:52 - sound like
02:53 - common sense because it is um
02:56 - i think sometimes it's also just nice to
02:59 - hear
03:00 - that you're on the right track and that
03:02 - you
03:03 - knew how to do this all along um
03:06 - the last thing about setting an agenda
03:09 - that i
03:10 - wish i would have known when i was
03:12 - starting
03:13 - to uh host meetups is as a leader
03:17 - bacon time for the after
03:21 - meetup chat so if yours is like 6 30 p.m
03:24 - to 8 30 p.m
03:26 - on a thursday just like set aside 8 30
03:29 - to 8 45 or 8 30 to 9
03:32 - there will inevitably be somebody who
03:34 - had an experience at your meet up and
03:36 - wants to talk to you about it or has an
03:38 - idea um or like wants to engage a little
03:41 - bit more
03:43 - it's fine if you can't talk to them with
03:46 - that
03:46 - at that time of course it's absolutely
03:49 - amazing if you're
03:50 - if you're already baked in that time and
03:52 - you're just relaxed and you're like yeah
03:53 - let's keep talking
