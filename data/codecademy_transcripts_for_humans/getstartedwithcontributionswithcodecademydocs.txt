00:00 - one
00:03 - okay and we are live again on Academy's
00:09 - YouTube channel hello everybody I see
00:11 - that we have some viewers already ready
00:12 - here so that's fun how are you doing
00:15 - Lucas
00:16 - I'm doing all right how are you Fede
00:18 - I'm doing great so today we're going to
00:21 - be talking about Academy docs
00:23 - I'm a community manager here Community
00:26 - manager here at code academy I've been
00:29 - in my role for about two years and I
00:30 - help people connect with one another you
00:32 - know Community platforms and find
00:33 - support and the resources they need and
00:35 - here with us today we have Lucas Lucas
00:38 - can you introduce yourself yeah for sure
00:40 - uh Sam Lucas I'm a curriculum developer
00:43 - here at code academy I work on the web
00:45 - development domain on courses such as
00:48 - our CSS and JS course and our go courses
00:51 - uh and uh my Prime Joy is our UI and ux
00:55 - courses of which we released an intro to
00:58 - UI and ux design course back in the
01:00 - spring and we have just released two
01:02 - more learn user research generative and
01:05 - learn design thinking ideation
01:07 - um you can go check those out after our
01:10 - stream uh I also work on a lot of our
01:13 - free resources including our articles
01:16 - and our docs pages which happened to be
01:19 - the subject of today's live stream and
01:21 - I'm excited to get into it
01:23 - yeah uh yeah let's just run jump right
01:26 - into it I'm going to start sharing my
01:27 - screen and we're going to be talking
01:29 - about what docs is and why you want to
01:33 - hear about it let's go
01:36 - so
01:37 - uh I just share my screen hopefully
01:38 - everybody can see it real quick that I
01:40 - am just going to interject that we do
01:41 - have two uh code academy team members uh
01:44 - in the chat with us as well
01:46 - um Adam and Brandon are here to uh also
01:49 - lend a hand
01:51 - that's right so if you have any
01:53 - questions drop those questions in the
01:55 - chat we're going to be taking a look at
01:56 - the chat and making sure that we answer
01:57 - all those questions and we have team
01:59 - members right there like look I said
02:00 - answering questions as well on the fly
02:02 - so great uh you should be all seeing my
02:05 - screen now this is the main docs page so
02:08 - if you've never seen this page before uh
02:10 - this is called The Academy docs and I'm
02:12 - going to read here from the paragraph of
02:13 - the top docs it's a Community Driven
02:15 - collection of code documentation for
02:17 - popular programming languages and
02:18 - Frameworks so what this means is when
02:21 - you're Googling information online when
02:22 - you're trying to you know you're going
02:23 - through your coursework at code academy
02:25 - and you might be interested in taking a
02:28 - deeper dive into a concept or maybe you
02:30 - want to review something that you just
02:31 - saw a loop uh what is a button what
02:33 - other things uh docs is fulfilling that
02:35 - purpose is giving you that information
02:37 - right right here on this page very easy
02:40 - to navigate very easy to see and and to
02:43 - consume the information and I want to
02:46 - show you some of the pages that we have
02:47 - here just so you get a better sense of
02:49 - what this page can do for you let's say
02:52 - that you are learning JavaScript and you
02:54 - have some comment you know you have some
02:56 - questions about how conditionals work so
02:58 - as you can see once I click JavaScript
03:00 - here on the topics and we are in the
03:02 - JavaScript main page you can you get a
03:04 - collection of all the concepts that are
03:06 - here and by the way because this is
03:08 - Community Driven it means that you also
03:11 - get to contribute to this so we're going
03:13 - to jump into a conditionals one that has
03:15 - an example today but imagine that you
03:17 - come to JavaScript Concepts and there is
03:19 - one that you can't find instead of just
03:22 - you know saying oh well too bad I guess
03:24 - uh nothing to do here you can actually
03:26 - contribute to the docs and make them
03:28 - better for everybody and add that
03:30 - content so if you Google it and you find
03:31 - information somewhere else come back to
03:33 - docs and make it better for it for you
03:35 - and for everyone into in the future
03:38 - so conditionals here is a page or an
03:41 - example page for example here in the
03:43 - conditionals uh
03:45 - it will tell you what JavaScript
03:46 - conditions are if statement you see some
03:49 - example code here so you can understand
03:51 - it real fast L statements you can keep
03:55 - scrolling down more information and this
03:57 - is a really cool part of the page it's
03:59 - called a code byte and this is a live
04:01 - console and better writing to the page
04:03 - which means that when you're writing
04:05 - this you see here that there's a yellow
04:07 - button that says run you can actually
04:09 - click it and run the code that you have
04:12 - so let's say that you just read about
04:13 - JavaScript conditionals and you're
04:15 - thinking wow um I would love to practice
04:18 - this a little bit I don't know where to
04:19 - go you can just use one of these code
04:21 - bytes and run some of your code
04:23 - um I can just go ahead and delete some
04:25 - of this if let's say you don't you're
04:26 - not interested in this delete it you can
04:28 - run it again and you know practice what
04:31 - you just read about
04:34 - let me yeah those are those are a really
04:37 - awesome feature of uh docs um and uh for
04:41 - those of you that are more advanced
04:42 - we'll get into uh this a little bit
04:45 - um but docs was written completely in
04:46 - markdown so
04:48 - um all of these code bytes and you'll
04:50 - see uh where we have like uh the the
04:53 - code blocks and the kind of inline code
04:55 - segments
04:57 - um are all really easy to get into docs
04:59 - once we start contributing
05:01 - let's say I'm gonna go back
05:03 - and we're going to jump into the UI and
05:06 - ux Design
05:08 - hub
05:09 - oh click too fast
05:12 - and let's say that we're interested in
05:14 - learning about buttons
05:16 - um
05:16 - here's some of some more information
05:18 - about buttons right so you're reading
05:20 - about it you're set you're learning what
05:22 - a button is and UI and ux design and
05:24 - here you have some graphics that show
05:27 - you how to work what it is I think I
05:30 - mean it's it's great to see all this
05:32 - information right here so easy and once
05:33 - you've navigated the docs you know for
05:35 - two minutes you already feel so easy so
05:37 - at ease just navigating through and
05:39 - finding information that you need it's
05:41 - it's amazing you even have resources at
05:42 - the bottom and you even have a quick
05:44 - link to the introduction to UI and ux
05:46 - design so maybe you weren't on the
05:49 - course but now that you've read about it
05:50 - you want to you know you might be
05:52 - wondering well is this something I can
05:53 - learn at code academy well just scroll
05:55 - to the bottom and boom there you have
05:57 - your title click it will send you right
05:58 - to the coursework so that's great too
06:00 - I think
06:02 - um maybe we could just uh move on and
06:04 - start showing people uh a bit of how
06:08 - they can contribute to you to to dogs
06:10 - I'm gonna stop asking now
06:13 - yeah and I will take over the screen
06:15 - share
06:16 - um so uh in uh preparation for this uh
06:21 - oh that's actually the
06:24 - wrong screen sorry about that
06:27 - um
06:28 - I will share uh this screen
06:32 - um
06:33 - where uh I will be talking about
06:37 - um some uh bugs that we found
06:40 - in kind of preparation for this live
06:41 - stream
06:42 - um so uh this is type uh typescript it's
06:47 - a
06:48 - um you know a typed superset of
06:50 - JavaScript
06:52 - um and we have our own uh docs category
06:54 - for it
06:56 - um and our uh amazing team member
06:59 - Brandon in the chat noticed that we have
07:01 - uh this weird error happening where we
07:05 - have uh a page for function and a page
07:08 - for functions um and so upon digging a
07:10 - little bit further uh Brandon realized
07:13 - that this function page is actually
07:14 - supposed to be type aliases
07:17 - um which means that uh this is kind of
07:20 - titled incorrectly
07:22 - um luckily this is a really easy fix and
07:25 - I'm going to be showing how you can make
07:27 - a change like this or change if you see
07:30 - kind of a typo somewhere in the content
07:33 - uh we can use the GitHub platform to
07:36 - really quickly uh make a nice and easy
07:40 - fix to this so I'm going to click this
07:42 - edit on GitHub button
07:46 - and uh we'll first be met with this
07:50 - message that you need to Fork this
07:52 - repository so given that this is a big
07:56 - GitHub repo that we have lots of people
07:58 - contributing to we have people Fork off
08:01 - of the repo so that they can contribute
08:04 - back onto the
08:05 - um to the main repo
08:07 - so I'm going to click Fork this repo
08:10 - and now I have my own version of the
08:13 - docs uh you know the entire docs uh
08:16 - service I have a version of it on my own
08:19 - uh forked version of the repo
08:23 - um and so now we can see what this file
08:25 - looks like
08:27 - um so you can see if I jump back we have
08:29 - these code blocks and we can see those
08:31 - code blocks right here in the markdown
08:35 - as I mentioned before
08:37 - um but what I'm going to change up here
08:39 - is this title
08:40 - um as we remember it should be type
08:42 - aliases
08:44 - um but instead it says function here so
08:46 - I'm going to change that to type
08:48 - aliases uh
08:52 - and then uh the description looks okay I
08:56 - think everything is okay in this
08:58 - um this should just be a quick uh a
09:01 - quick fix so I'm going to go down I'm
09:04 - going to say update type aliases I'm
09:07 - going to add in a description I'm going
09:10 - to say
09:12 - um
09:13 - uh
09:15 - fix title to say type aliases
09:23 - um
09:25 - and I'm going to propose this change
09:31 - um
09:32 - and we're going to compare those changes
09:34 - so you'll see up here for those of you
09:37 - that don't know the GitHub interface I'm
09:39 - going to walk through it uh I think this
09:41 - is a good time to make a shout out that
09:43 - we do have courses on learn git and
09:46 - learn GitHub so this is a you know if
09:49 - this is an unfamiliar area for y'all
09:52 - that's a great way to kind of get your
09:54 - feet wet with getting GitHub and dive
09:56 - deep and understand exactly what this is
09:58 - but I'll just be doing kind of a quick
10:01 - overview a lot of of a lot of these uh
10:04 - Concepts so up here at the top you'll
10:07 - see that the head repository so what I'm
10:10 - editing is this live stream Lucas slash
10:12 - docs that's my personal GitHub and I'm
10:16 - going to be comparing that to the code
10:18 - academy docs repo so I'm going to be
10:20 - trying to push this change to the main
10:23 - code academy repo where it will live on
10:27 - the live site
10:28 - um so I am going to uh just double check
10:32 - that everything that I made is correct
10:34 - yes I'm just changing this title uh and
10:37 - I'm going to click create pull requests
10:40 - um it says it looks like uh the first
10:42 - time
10:43 - um if you want to look at the
10:44 - contributing guidelines and code of
10:45 - conduct you could
10:47 - um you know that'll go to our
10:49 - contributing page and uh you'll be able
10:51 - to double check that you're doing
10:52 - everything correctly
10:54 - um but we can scroll down uh and there's
10:57 - a lot of information here
11:00 - um about getting appropriately credited
11:02 - so that you can appear
11:04 - um actually that's that's a good note
11:05 - I'll jump back to the page and we can
11:07 - see here for contributors if you um make
11:12 - a change to any uh any Pages here on the
11:16 - docs page you'll be listed right here as
11:18 - a contributor
11:19 - um and you'll be able to uh you know
11:22 - prove that you uh you contributed to uh
11:25 - this amazing platform
11:27 - um but uh for that you'll need to follow
11:30 - these instructions um so be sure to do
11:32 - that I am going to add a description in
11:37 - here uh luckily I copied that previous
11:39 - uh subscription that I had before fixed
11:42 - title to say type aliases uh it used to
11:46 - say
11:47 - function
11:50 - which was wrong
11:53 - uh I am going to select the type of
11:57 - change that it is so I am editing an
12:00 - existing entry uh fixing a typo bug
12:04 - issues ETC
12:05 - um so I'm going to leave that uh and
12:08 - there are all these check boxes to make
12:09 - sure that we are
12:11 - um you know following all of the code
12:13 - conducts
12:15 - um uh you know all the rules that we
12:17 - have around making uh codecademy docs a
12:20 - nice and legal place to uh contribute to
12:23 - so we do want to avoid uh plagiarism
12:26 - um because it has you know serious
12:28 - impacts on code academy as a whole and
12:30 - we don't want you know uh that affecting
12:32 - any sort of reputation around this so we
12:34 - want to make sure that all writings are
12:36 - uh our own it's okay to use resources
12:38 - but make sure that you uh you know make
12:41 - it your own
12:42 - um that we follow the style guide
12:46 - um that uh we're not generating new
12:48 - warnings um that'll come up a little bit
12:50 - later uh
12:53 - I have performed a self-review make sure
12:55 - that you don't have any typos or bugs in
12:57 - your code when you're putting this up
12:59 - um
13:00 - the next one also applies to that
13:03 - um I uh have made corresponding changes
13:05 - to the documentation if needed
13:07 - um
13:08 - that's not really relevant here but
13:10 - we'll check that I've confirmed my
13:13 - changes are not being pushed from my
13:15 - forked main branch so that's a big part
13:17 - of this we do want to make sure that we
13:20 - are in a different branch that causes
13:23 - some uh issues with the
13:27 - um with the docs platform so we want to
13:28 - make sure that we're on a branch not our
13:30 - main
13:31 - a branch of error repo and I'll I'll
13:35 - cover that a little bit more later
13:38 - um
13:38 - and uh this also uh
13:43 - applies there
13:45 - um and
13:47 - I think that we are ready to uh create
13:49 - our pull request so I will submit that
13:53 - um and we now have that pull request
13:56 - living in the pull request section of
13:58 - the docs
13:59 - um which lists out all the kind of
14:02 - proposed changes we have 56 now
14:05 - um
14:06 - I don't think we mentioned yet that it
14:07 - is hacktoberfest and so hacktoberfest is
14:10 - a big
14:11 - um open source contribution month uh
14:14 - sponsored by digitalocean
14:16 - um where uh you know they encourage
14:18 - everyone to kind of contribute to open
14:20 - source and so
14:21 - um you know that's a way that you can
14:23 - participate is through our platform
14:25 - um and so we now see that update type
14:28 - aliases.md is added to the pull requests
14:31 - um
14:33 - and uh thank you Brandon for noting here
14:35 - that I need to sign the contributor
14:37 - license so this is another aspect of
14:39 - contributing
14:41 - um it's just signing a license saying
14:43 - that you you permit your own writings to
14:45 - be on this platform uh on code academy
14:47 - docs um it's a pretty standard agreement
14:50 - for uh open source contribution but you
14:53 - can go through uh and read the finer
14:55 - details uh I've read it before so I know
14:58 - I'm comfortable signing it um but feel
15:00 - free to read duper into that um so you
15:02 - click sign and you click authorize
15:06 - um
15:08 - and uh I have signed it so if I jump
15:12 - back
15:13 - um to
15:15 - it'll automatically Point me back there
15:17 - uh it says all contributors have signed
15:19 - the CLA uh and uh in some amount of time
15:23 - uh you know it depends on how busy our
15:25 - content contributors are such as Brandon
15:28 - um but eventually that will be uh if
15:31 - there are any edits that need to be made
15:33 - they'll suggest those uh if not it'll be
15:35 - merged straight in
15:37 - um Lucas I know that uh somebody here in
15:39 - the chat uh Brandon already helped them
15:41 - but I just wanted to touch real quick on
15:43 - that they were asking about forks and
15:46 - how they work and if they were a feature
15:47 - of uh code academy or GitHub and Brandon
15:49 - already explained this but I just wanted
15:50 - to put it here on the video as well for
15:52 - people you know that might be watching
15:53 - to the Future could you just kind of
15:55 - like real quick uh touch again on why
15:58 - people have to Fork before they get to
16:00 - contribute to or Docs
16:02 - yeah of course
16:04 - um so uh for full of transparency the
16:07 - reason that we have this setup is um
16:09 - because we want a little bit of a level
16:11 - of Separation where we can have uh
16:13 - thorough reviews by our team before uh
16:16 - changes are made to um to the GitHub
16:19 - repo and so what uh we do that by having
16:21 - Forks
16:23 - um which uh if I go to uh my profile
16:27 - you'll see I have this Fork here
16:30 - um what I could do is I could show the
16:32 - process of making that fork manually uh
16:34 - and then we'll use that fork uh when
16:37 - making
16:38 - um
16:39 - I'm going to be updating some
16:41 - documentation and adding a new entry
16:43 - which is a very exciting thing and a
16:46 - little bit more work
16:48 - um so this is another reason uh why the
16:51 - end GitHub course is great because if
16:53 - you aren't quite caught up or a little
16:56 - confused um this will kind of fill in
16:57 - that course will fill in a lot of the
16:59 - details but I am going to
17:03 - um first delete this Fork
17:05 - um so that I am actually uh that might
17:08 - mess things up but I will just show
17:10 - exactly how it works
17:12 - um so you can click this Fork button
17:16 - um and what that will do is create a
17:19 - version of this uh GitHub repo it's kind
17:22 - of like a big folder that hosts all of
17:25 - the content
17:27 - um so what this is going to do is
17:30 - um create a new version of the
17:33 - codecademy docs on your own GitHub
17:35 - account where you can edit it
17:37 - um make it what you want it to be and
17:39 - then uh you make a pull request for
17:41 - those changes
17:43 - um so that they get merged onto the big
17:45 - code academy docs version uh where it
17:48 - will live live on the site
17:50 - um so once I make those changes uh we
17:53 - would see it on this page for example
17:56 - um so
17:58 - uh that's how forecasting Works
18:01 - um again another advertisement for our
18:03 - learn get in GitHub where you can really
18:05 - uh learn about the fine details of
18:07 - forking
18:09 - um
18:09 - but I think uh if there's not any more
18:13 - questions I would give uh I think this
18:15 - is a perfect opportunity to show how you
18:18 - can uh kind of level up your impact that
18:21 - you have on the code academy docs and
18:23 - not just fix a typo but actually add a
18:25 - new entry which is our uh you know my
18:29 - favorite part of the GitHub repo uh in
18:32 - that we have so many uh contributions
18:35 - happening every day uh if we look at
18:37 - this pull request again uh you see we
18:40 - have someone submitting for Swift UI
18:42 - views
18:44 - um someone's submitting Java math
18:46 - methods C plus plus math functions
18:49 - um all these different folks
18:50 - contributing new terms every day and we
18:54 - are just building this really awesome
18:55 - documentation
18:56 - um so let's be one of those people uh I
18:59 - am going to
19:01 - um go back to the docs main page which I
19:04 - can do by clicking on docs up here
19:07 - and I am going to click this code button
19:10 - which will allow me to open on GitHub
19:12 - desktop this also works in something
19:15 - called a command line interface it's a
19:18 - little bit more advanced some people
19:20 - really like it some people are more
19:22 - comfortable with the GitHub desktop I'm
19:24 - showing this because it's a little bit
19:25 - more approachable and beginner friendly
19:27 - so I again clicked this code button I
19:30 - clicked launch with GitHub desktop
19:33 - um if you don't already have git Hub
19:35 - desktop it'll prompt you to download it
19:37 - but I already have it on my machine
19:40 - um so I am going to just follow the
19:41 - prompts here it'll say it'll it's making
19:43 - a new folder uh in my uh computer
19:47 - uh it is cloning
19:49 - um oh I'm sorry I made a mistake there
19:51 - uh good to show this
19:53 - um so I actually cloned the uh
19:55 - codecademy docs what I actually want to
19:57 - do
19:58 - um is remove this and I want to clone my
20:01 - Fork so I'm going to go to my profile
20:04 - I'm going to go to my Fork and I'm
20:06 - actually going to clone my Fork uh so up
20:09 - here it'll say uh you know your GitHub
20:11 - username and then docs instead of code
20:13 - cabinet docs uh and I'm going to open
20:16 - that with my GitHub desktop
20:19 - uh clone that
20:21 - and uh kind of a little Merit error
20:25 - there but I think everything is okay I'm
20:27 - doing this to contribute to the parent
20:28 - project
20:30 - um that's uh this is just going to
20:32 - change some settings but we do want to
20:33 - contribute to the parent project that's
20:35 - why we're doing this
20:36 - um yes thank you Brandon really want to
20:39 - emphasize that really important to clone
20:40 - the fork and not uh the code academy
20:43 - docs I almost fell into that pit hole
20:45 - glad I caught myself be sure uh not to
20:48 - make the same mistakes as me
20:50 - um so contribute to the parent project
20:52 - that's the setting that we want
20:54 - um I already have this GitHub desktop to
20:57 - be associated with my
20:59 - um
21:00 - text editor of choice you can put
21:03 - anything in here you know if you prefer
21:05 - Adam if you don't know code academy has
21:08 - a lot of great resources to kind of
21:09 - figure out
21:10 - um what text editor or IDE you would
21:15 - prefer to use my preference is Visual
21:17 - Studio code you can set that there and
21:19 - I'm just going to click open in Visual
21:21 - Studio code
21:23 - and that opened on the wrong monitor so
21:26 - I'm going to bring that over
21:28 - and here we have the code academy docs
21:33 - it may look like a jumble of information
21:35 - we have a lot of
21:38 - um you know settings files here the
21:40 - thing that's really important for us is
21:43 - this content folder and inside that
21:45 - content folder is going to host all of
21:48 - the different categories that we have so
21:50 - we see C we have cloud computing we have
21:52 - C plus plus we have CSS a whole bunch of
21:56 - different topics if you'll remember uh I
22:01 - said that I wanted to contribute to the
22:02 - UI and ux design category
22:05 - um because I have
22:08 - written up a little thing about
22:10 - stakeholders
22:11 - as I mentioned I've been putting out a
22:15 - lot of UI ux content and so I want to
22:17 - grow the UI ux category
22:20 - um so I am going to go into the UI ux
22:24 - category go into the concepts folder and
22:26 - here we have the names of all of our
22:28 - Concepts so you'll see accessibility
22:30 - you'll see animation you'll see
22:31 - annotations I want to add a new folder
22:34 - in here because I'm adding a new entry
22:35 - and for that you add a new folder and
22:38 - I'm going to call this folder a
22:40 - stakeholder
22:42 - a little bit of rhyme there uh and I am
22:45 - going to put a file in here called
22:48 - stakeholder
22:50 - .md that's a markdown file as I
22:53 - mentioned before markdown is the
22:55 - formatting language I think I can use
22:58 - the word uh
23:00 - that is how our text is structured I'm
23:04 - going to borrow I think the easiest way
23:06 - to do this is probably borrow another
23:08 - file so I'm going to borrow the
23:09 - sketching file uh just for its
23:12 - formatting and paste that straight in at
23:15 - the top here you'll see some metadata so
23:18 - this is not going to be shown directly
23:20 - on the page but it is going to be
23:24 - um
23:25 - I think it might be helpful actually
23:26 - actually for me to pull up this
23:28 - sketching
23:29 - um
23:32 - file so that we kind of see how all of
23:35 - this translates so I'm going to go to UI
23:36 - and ux I am going to go to sketching
23:42 - and uh
23:46 - we can now see kind of how this
23:47 - translates so
23:50 - um
23:51 - I have over here we have this content
23:53 - you'll see the content update here at
23:55 - the top is metadata so that's not going
23:57 - to show and it's just going to show the
23:59 - uh the title here and then it's going to
24:01 - show this text
24:03 - you'll see we have this double asterisk
24:07 - to designate bold and we have this link
24:10 - so for iterate we have it in square
24:13 - brackets and then we have the link in
24:15 - parentheses and that's what creates this
24:17 - link here
24:19 - um so we are going to uh
24:23 - use this file
24:25 - stakeholder.md I'm going to change the
24:28 - title here to stakeholder I'm going to
24:30 - take out this description
24:34 - um it is still UI and ux so I'm going to
24:36 - kind of leave all of this stuff the
24:39 - subjects the tags the catalog content if
24:43 - you are doing a completely different
24:44 - category you can look up the tags that
24:46 - already exist but those are going to
24:50 - stay the same since this is already in
24:52 - UI ux uh and I am going to
24:55 - um delete this text and off to the side
24:59 - here uh in my magical other monitor I'm
25:02 - going to bring in uh the pre-written uh
25:06 - I did some preparation sorry guys uh I
25:09 - did some preparation and already wrote
25:11 - um this content so in UI and ux design a
25:15 - stakeholder I remember the those double
25:17 - asterisks are going to show as bold a
25:19 - stakeholder is anyone who impacts or is
25:21 - impacted by a certain project this could
25:24 - include your intended users
25:25 - administrators and it professionals
25:27 - helping set up your product uh the
25:29 - engineers and product managers on your
25:31 - team the sales people who will be
25:32 - selling your product and many more so
25:35 - just a really concise
25:37 - um definition there I'm also going to
25:40 - bring this first sentence so just a
25:43 - short snippet of that definition
25:47 - um back up into this description and put
25:49 - that right there uh I think that the
25:52 - description shouldn't have any styling
25:54 - so I'm going to take out those double
25:57 - asterisks and I think that we are set to
26:01 - make this really quick addition
26:03 - so I am going to go back to my GitHub
26:06 - desktop
26:07 - which you'll see now should have some
26:09 - changes showing yep and we've got here
26:13 - it shows that we added a new
26:15 - stakeholder.md file and added in this
26:18 - content
26:20 - um
26:21 - I also want to highlight here we do want
26:24 - to make sure as our contributing
26:28 - documentions I'm going to show this
26:30 - contributing dot so we forked this repo
26:32 - we cloned the repo to our computer the
26:35 - forge repo and we also need to switch to
26:38 - a branch so it's okay that it's on Main
26:41 - right now because I'm going to create a
26:43 - new Branch here
26:44 - uh and I'm going to call this
26:47 - um add
26:48 - uh stakeholder
26:52 - and we're going to create a branch
26:53 - called that it's going to ask me do I
26:55 - want to leave my changes on Main or
26:57 - bring those to add stakeholder I'm
26:59 - definitely going to want to add those to
27:00 - stakeholder this is a really important
27:03 - step because it's going to enable us to
27:05 - make a pull request
27:08 - to the code academy docs repo really
27:12 - easily so I'm going to do switch Branch
27:14 - here
27:15 - and great uh I am going to go down here
27:20 - um and let's create stakeholder.md and
27:24 - stakeholder uh markdown file
27:27 - just a short description there I'm going
27:29 - to say commit
27:30 - uh
27:31 - and
27:34 - I think I made a mistake there I'm also
27:38 - going to commit this uh
27:40 - and
27:43 - uh we're gonna publish this branch
27:45 - so we'll click publish there and that's
27:47 - going to send it to uh to GitHub and uh
27:53 - I can now click this create pull request
27:57 - and I will have a pull request here
28:00 - and it automatically uh since we
28:03 - selected that uh that we want to
28:05 - contribute to the parent repository it's
28:07 - going to assume that we want to make a
28:10 - pull request right to the codecademy
28:12 - docs repo but we're going to check that
28:13 - right there see we're trying to compare
28:15 - to the codecademy docs face main we are
28:19 - going uh we are using our live stream
28:21 - docs add stakeholder Branch right there
28:24 - uh and I'm going to fill out that same
28:26 - information so I'm going to add a
28:28 - description in here saying
28:32 - add stakeholder markdown file
28:36 - type of change I am adding a new entry
28:40 - uh
28:42 - I'm going to fill out all of these uh
28:44 - requirements that we talked about before
28:46 - I won't go too deep into those but just
28:49 - make sure you check those and that
28:52 - you agree and those are all accurate
28:55 - they're really important for our
28:57 - guidelines and making sure that everyone
28:58 - is having a good time and I am going to
29:02 - create a pull request and we'll see how
29:04 - it goes
29:08 - um so yeah we see our uh pull request
29:11 - here if there's any changes that need to
29:13 - be made
29:14 - um that'll happen as comments here in
29:15 - the GitHub uh we have some tests that
29:18 - make sure that everything is running
29:19 - correctly that we've signed the CLA
29:21 - um and if there's any failing there
29:24 - um our content contributors uh we'll be
29:26 - happy to help you out there uh and help
29:29 - you you know have a smooth merge into
29:32 - our uh onto the live site
29:36 - um
29:37 - great I think that's a good natural
29:39 - stopping point do I have any questions
29:41 - uh any
29:43 - any interesting uh anecdotes or anything
29:46 - like that
29:48 - yeah that'll be a perfect time now to
29:50 - drop your questions in the chat if you
29:52 - have any questions I know that there was
29:53 - a lot of information but I mean this you
29:55 - know again this is not meant to be like
29:58 - a full-blown tutorial of how to do
30:00 - contributions on GitHub or git uh for
30:02 - that like Luca said we have a whole
30:04 - course on code academy that is wonderful
30:06 - place to go learn all the intricacies
30:09 - and like the step-by-step of how diesel
30:12 - works but I think still you can see how
30:15 - it's not that bad at all if you've never
30:17 - done it before I'm sure that it's a
30:19 - little uh overwhelming or it could be a
30:21 - little daunting but that that's sort of
30:23 - like Lucas I think it's it's one of the
30:25 - main benefits of why contributing to
30:28 - docs is so great because if you've never
30:31 - contributed to anything online before it
30:33 - can feel very scary like oh wow I'm
30:34 - gonna go to someone's repo that I've
30:36 - never met before rather these big thing
30:38 - and I might mess something up I might
30:40 - change something that I wanted I didn't
30:41 - want to change so having something like
30:45 - code academic docs where the stakes are
30:48 - relatively low or what you can try and
30:50 - you have you know there's people on the
30:51 - other side waiting to give you feedback
30:53 - and like talking to you and like walking
30:55 - you if you have any issues walking you
30:56 - through the issues I mean that's like I
30:58 - see that has a huge benefit for anyone
31:00 - that that wants to practice get on
31:02 - GitHub maybe they just finish the course
31:04 - and they want to practice
31:07 - yeah for sure
31:09 - um it's a really great opportunity
31:11 - um I I think that uh you know I I'm a
31:14 - former teacher
31:16 - um
31:17 - if I was ever struggling to learn a
31:20 - concept
31:21 - um one of the biggest things that helped
31:23 - me was figuring out how I would
31:25 - articulate that concept to someone else
31:28 - um so uh you know a lot of people make
31:30 - uh flash cards for themselves I think
31:33 - that this is a really great learning
31:34 - opportunity as you are learning about
31:37 - things contributing to docs is a great
31:39 - thing for your career but it's also a
31:41 - great thing for your learning experience
31:42 - so that you really drive home exactly
31:45 - what these concepts are
31:47 - um and also you know it great looks
31:49 - great on your GitHub profile a lot of
31:51 - people use that for getting jobs a lot
31:53 - of people use that to kind of show their
31:55 - contribution and so
31:57 - um yeah docs is a really great place I I
32:01 - feel like uh there's basically three
32:03 - main ways that you can look at this and
32:05 - like see the benefits right away uh
32:07 - number one is you get to practice
32:09 - getting GitHub so that's great you get
32:10 - to practice it with us before you go
32:12 - into the wild maybe try to contribute to
32:14 - more complex projects or from open
32:16 - source stories that were in my value
32:18 - more intimidating the second is that you
32:21 - get to practice I mean you get to build
32:23 - your your portfolio on GitHub so
32:25 - somebody who goes to your profile now
32:26 - they see that you are you know
32:28 - committing and making changes to other
32:30 - profiles out there to all the repos so
32:32 - that also builds up your naturally
32:33 - builds up your your profile on GitHub
32:36 - and I think the third one is what you
32:37 - were just touching on which is
32:39 - practicing makes you better the fact
32:42 - that you have to you know do it not just
32:44 - read about it and go through the
32:46 - coursework but actually go into keyword
32:48 - go into machine or using the the edit
32:50 - button on the page doing it yourself
32:52 - that just kind of like Builds on top of
32:54 - that make sure that you have that you
32:55 - really have soaked in the knowledge
32:57 - right and not only the knowledge of
33:00 - GitHub but you're contributing to docs
33:02 - so you know when one teaches to learn
33:06 - you are also researching Concepts maybe
33:08 - you look at docs and go like you know uh
33:10 - this part of dogs looks a little thin
33:12 - I'm going to research this and I'm going
33:13 - to contribute a couple articles here uh
33:15 - you're also learning new things and and
33:17 - it's kind of fun because you're
33:18 - researching it you learn and then you
33:19 - commit it and then other people read
33:20 - your content so you see the impact right
33:22 - so I feel like those three like
33:25 - practicing GitHub and then just building
33:27 - your your resume online I guess your
33:29 - your your profile online and knowing
33:31 - that you are contributing and practicing
33:33 - with other people I mean that sounds all
33:35 - like positives to me
33:37 - yep spot on uh yeah
33:41 - docs is a really great Community we have
33:43 - a really great community of folks uh
33:45 - both internal and external that are
33:47 - really uh willing to uh to help you
33:51 - um you know this is a great learning
33:52 - experience for you
33:54 - um we're very happy to help uh we don't
33:56 - get frustrated if something's not
33:57 - working we're very uh willing to kind of
34:01 - help you through your first contribution
34:03 - um because we know that that can be a
34:04 - scary thing GitHub can be a scary place
34:06 - so we really want to make that
34:09 - um as smooth as possible for you and
34:11 - help you get uh your first pull request
34:13 - through
34:14 - um
34:15 - I'm going to drop in the chat here uh
34:18 - link to our learn git coursework so that
34:21 - way if anyone is wondering well okay
34:23 - that sounds like a really cool uh course
34:25 - to do There's the link Follow It Go
34:27 - learn get in GitHub on me great place

Cleaned transcript:

one okay and we are live again on Academy's YouTube channel hello everybody I see that we have some viewers already ready here so that's fun how are you doing Lucas I'm doing all right how are you Fede I'm doing great so today we're going to be talking about Academy docs I'm a community manager here Community manager here at code academy I've been in my role for about two years and I help people connect with one another you know Community platforms and find support and the resources they need and here with us today we have Lucas Lucas can you introduce yourself yeah for sure uh Sam Lucas I'm a curriculum developer here at code academy I work on the web development domain on courses such as our CSS and JS course and our go courses uh and uh my Prime Joy is our UI and ux courses of which we released an intro to UI and ux design course back in the spring and we have just released two more learn user research generative and learn design thinking ideation um you can go check those out after our stream uh I also work on a lot of our free resources including our articles and our docs pages which happened to be the subject of today's live stream and I'm excited to get into it yeah uh yeah let's just run jump right into it I'm going to start sharing my screen and we're going to be talking about what docs is and why you want to hear about it let's go so uh I just share my screen hopefully everybody can see it real quick that I am just going to interject that we do have two uh code academy team members uh in the chat with us as well um Adam and Brandon are here to uh also lend a hand that's right so if you have any questions drop those questions in the chat we're going to be taking a look at the chat and making sure that we answer all those questions and we have team members right there like look I said answering questions as well on the fly so great uh you should be all seeing my screen now this is the main docs page so if you've never seen this page before uh this is called The Academy docs and I'm going to read here from the paragraph of the top docs it's a Community Driven collection of code documentation for popular programming languages and Frameworks so what this means is when you're Googling information online when you're trying to you know you're going through your coursework at code academy and you might be interested in taking a deeper dive into a concept or maybe you want to review something that you just saw a loop uh what is a button what other things uh docs is fulfilling that purpose is giving you that information right right here on this page very easy to navigate very easy to see and and to consume the information and I want to show you some of the pages that we have here just so you get a better sense of what this page can do for you let's say that you are learning JavaScript and you have some comment you know you have some questions about how conditionals work so as you can see once I click JavaScript here on the topics and we are in the JavaScript main page you can you get a collection of all the concepts that are here and by the way because this is Community Driven it means that you also get to contribute to this so we're going to jump into a conditionals one that has an example today but imagine that you come to JavaScript Concepts and there is one that you can't find instead of just you know saying oh well too bad I guess uh nothing to do here you can actually contribute to the docs and make them better for everybody and add that content so if you Google it and you find information somewhere else come back to docs and make it better for it for you and for everyone into in the future so conditionals here is a page or an example page for example here in the conditionals uh it will tell you what JavaScript conditions are if statement you see some example code here so you can understand it real fast L statements you can keep scrolling down more information and this is a really cool part of the page it's called a code byte and this is a live console and better writing to the page which means that when you're writing this you see here that there's a yellow button that says run you can actually click it and run the code that you have so let's say that you just read about JavaScript conditionals and you're thinking wow um I would love to practice this a little bit I don't know where to go you can just use one of these code bytes and run some of your code um I can just go ahead and delete some of this if let's say you don't you're not interested in this delete it you can run it again and you know practice what you just read about let me yeah those are those are a really awesome feature of uh docs um and uh for those of you that are more advanced we'll get into uh this a little bit um but docs was written completely in markdown so um all of these code bytes and you'll see uh where we have like uh the the code blocks and the kind of inline code segments um are all really easy to get into docs once we start contributing let's say I'm gonna go back and we're going to jump into the UI and ux Design hub oh click too fast and let's say that we're interested in learning about buttons um here's some of some more information about buttons right so you're reading about it you're set you're learning what a button is and UI and ux design and here you have some graphics that show you how to work what it is I think I mean it's it's great to see all this information right here so easy and once you've navigated the docs you know for two minutes you already feel so easy so at ease just navigating through and finding information that you need it's it's amazing you even have resources at the bottom and you even have a quick link to the introduction to UI and ux design so maybe you weren't on the course but now that you've read about it you want to you know you might be wondering well is this something I can learn at code academy well just scroll to the bottom and boom there you have your title click it will send you right to the coursework so that's great too I think um maybe we could just uh move on and start showing people uh a bit of how they can contribute to you to to dogs I'm gonna stop asking now yeah and I will take over the screen share um so uh in uh preparation for this uh oh that's actually the wrong screen sorry about that um I will share uh this screen um where uh I will be talking about um some uh bugs that we found in kind of preparation for this live stream um so uh this is type uh typescript it's a um you know a typed superset of JavaScript um and we have our own uh docs category for it um and our uh amazing team member Brandon in the chat noticed that we have uh this weird error happening where we have uh a page for function and a page for functions um and so upon digging a little bit further uh Brandon realized that this function page is actually supposed to be type aliases um which means that uh this is kind of titled incorrectly um luckily this is a really easy fix and I'm going to be showing how you can make a change like this or change if you see kind of a typo somewhere in the content uh we can use the GitHub platform to really quickly uh make a nice and easy fix to this so I'm going to click this edit on GitHub button and uh we'll first be met with this message that you need to Fork this repository so given that this is a big GitHub repo that we have lots of people contributing to we have people Fork off of the repo so that they can contribute back onto the um to the main repo so I'm going to click Fork this repo and now I have my own version of the docs uh you know the entire docs uh service I have a version of it on my own uh forked version of the repo um and so now we can see what this file looks like um so you can see if I jump back we have these code blocks and we can see those code blocks right here in the markdown as I mentioned before um but what I'm going to change up here is this title um as we remember it should be type aliases um but instead it says function here so I'm going to change that to type aliases uh and then uh the description looks okay I think everything is okay in this um this should just be a quick uh a quick fix so I'm going to go down I'm going to say update type aliases I'm going to add in a description I'm going to say um uh fix title to say type aliases um and I'm going to propose this change um and we're going to compare those changes so you'll see up here for those of you that don't know the GitHub interface I'm going to walk through it uh I think this is a good time to make a shout out that we do have courses on learn git and learn GitHub so this is a you know if this is an unfamiliar area for y'all that's a great way to kind of get your feet wet with getting GitHub and dive deep and understand exactly what this is but I'll just be doing kind of a quick overview a lot of of a lot of these uh Concepts so up here at the top you'll see that the head repository so what I'm editing is this live stream Lucas slash docs that's my personal GitHub and I'm going to be comparing that to the code academy docs repo so I'm going to be trying to push this change to the main code academy repo where it will live on the live site um so I am going to uh just double check that everything that I made is correct yes I'm just changing this title uh and I'm going to click create pull requests um it says it looks like uh the first time um if you want to look at the contributing guidelines and code of conduct you could um you know that'll go to our contributing page and uh you'll be able to double check that you're doing everything correctly um but we can scroll down uh and there's a lot of information here um about getting appropriately credited so that you can appear um actually that's that's a good note I'll jump back to the page and we can see here for contributors if you um make a change to any uh any Pages here on the docs page you'll be listed right here as a contributor um and you'll be able to uh you know prove that you uh you contributed to uh this amazing platform um but uh for that you'll need to follow these instructions um so be sure to do that I am going to add a description in here uh luckily I copied that previous uh subscription that I had before fixed title to say type aliases uh it used to say function which was wrong uh I am going to select the type of change that it is so I am editing an existing entry uh fixing a typo bug issues ETC um so I'm going to leave that uh and there are all these check boxes to make sure that we are um you know following all of the code conducts um uh you know all the rules that we have around making uh codecademy docs a nice and legal place to uh contribute to so we do want to avoid uh plagiarism um because it has you know serious impacts on code academy as a whole and we don't want you know uh that affecting any sort of reputation around this so we want to make sure that all writings are uh our own it's okay to use resources but make sure that you uh you know make it your own um that we follow the style guide um that uh we're not generating new warnings um that'll come up a little bit later uh I have performed a selfreview make sure that you don't have any typos or bugs in your code when you're putting this up um the next one also applies to that um I uh have made corresponding changes to the documentation if needed um that's not really relevant here but we'll check that I've confirmed my changes are not being pushed from my forked main branch so that's a big part of this we do want to make sure that we are in a different branch that causes some uh issues with the um with the docs platform so we want to make sure that we're on a branch not our main a branch of error repo and I'll I'll cover that a little bit more later um and uh this also uh applies there um and I think that we are ready to uh create our pull request so I will submit that um and we now have that pull request living in the pull request section of the docs um which lists out all the kind of proposed changes we have 56 now um I don't think we mentioned yet that it is hacktoberfest and so hacktoberfest is a big um open source contribution month uh sponsored by digitalocean um where uh you know they encourage everyone to kind of contribute to open source and so um you know that's a way that you can participate is through our platform um and so we now see that update type aliases.md is added to the pull requests um and uh thank you Brandon for noting here that I need to sign the contributor license so this is another aspect of contributing um it's just signing a license saying that you you permit your own writings to be on this platform uh on code academy docs um it's a pretty standard agreement for uh open source contribution but you can go through uh and read the finer details uh I've read it before so I know I'm comfortable signing it um but feel free to read duper into that um so you click sign and you click authorize um and uh I have signed it so if I jump back um to it'll automatically Point me back there uh it says all contributors have signed the CLA uh and uh in some amount of time uh you know it depends on how busy our content contributors are such as Brandon um but eventually that will be uh if there are any edits that need to be made they'll suggest those uh if not it'll be merged straight in um Lucas I know that uh somebody here in the chat uh Brandon already helped them but I just wanted to touch real quick on that they were asking about forks and how they work and if they were a feature of uh code academy or GitHub and Brandon already explained this but I just wanted to put it here on the video as well for people you know that might be watching to the Future could you just kind of like real quick uh touch again on why people have to Fork before they get to contribute to or Docs yeah of course um so uh for full of transparency the reason that we have this setup is um because we want a little bit of a level of Separation where we can have uh thorough reviews by our team before uh changes are made to um to the GitHub repo and so what uh we do that by having Forks um which uh if I go to uh my profile you'll see I have this Fork here um what I could do is I could show the process of making that fork manually uh and then we'll use that fork uh when making um I'm going to be updating some documentation and adding a new entry which is a very exciting thing and a little bit more work um so this is another reason uh why the end GitHub course is great because if you aren't quite caught up or a little confused um this will kind of fill in that course will fill in a lot of the details but I am going to um first delete this Fork um so that I am actually uh that might mess things up but I will just show exactly how it works um so you can click this Fork button um and what that will do is create a version of this uh GitHub repo it's kind of like a big folder that hosts all of the content um so what this is going to do is um create a new version of the codecademy docs on your own GitHub account where you can edit it um make it what you want it to be and then uh you make a pull request for those changes um so that they get merged onto the big code academy docs version uh where it will live live on the site um so once I make those changes uh we would see it on this page for example um so uh that's how forecasting Works um again another advertisement for our learn get in GitHub where you can really uh learn about the fine details of forking um but I think uh if there's not any more questions I would give uh I think this is a perfect opportunity to show how you can uh kind of level up your impact that you have on the code academy docs and not just fix a typo but actually add a new entry which is our uh you know my favorite part of the GitHub repo uh in that we have so many uh contributions happening every day uh if we look at this pull request again uh you see we have someone submitting for Swift UI views um someone's submitting Java math methods C plus plus math functions um all these different folks contributing new terms every day and we are just building this really awesome documentation um so let's be one of those people uh I am going to um go back to the docs main page which I can do by clicking on docs up here and I am going to click this code button which will allow me to open on GitHub desktop this also works in something called a command line interface it's a little bit more advanced some people really like it some people are more comfortable with the GitHub desktop I'm showing this because it's a little bit more approachable and beginner friendly so I again clicked this code button I clicked launch with GitHub desktop um if you don't already have git Hub desktop it'll prompt you to download it but I already have it on my machine um so I am going to just follow the prompts here it'll say it'll it's making a new folder uh in my uh computer uh it is cloning um oh I'm sorry I made a mistake there uh good to show this um so I actually cloned the uh codecademy docs what I actually want to do um is remove this and I want to clone my Fork so I'm going to go to my profile I'm going to go to my Fork and I'm actually going to clone my Fork uh so up here it'll say uh you know your GitHub username and then docs instead of code cabinet docs uh and I'm going to open that with my GitHub desktop uh clone that and uh kind of a little Merit error there but I think everything is okay I'm doing this to contribute to the parent project um that's uh this is just going to change some settings but we do want to contribute to the parent project that's why we're doing this um yes thank you Brandon really want to emphasize that really important to clone the fork and not uh the code academy docs I almost fell into that pit hole glad I caught myself be sure uh not to make the same mistakes as me um so contribute to the parent project that's the setting that we want um I already have this GitHub desktop to be associated with my um text editor of choice you can put anything in here you know if you prefer Adam if you don't know code academy has a lot of great resources to kind of figure out um what text editor or IDE you would prefer to use my preference is Visual Studio code you can set that there and I'm just going to click open in Visual Studio code and that opened on the wrong monitor so I'm going to bring that over and here we have the code academy docs it may look like a jumble of information we have a lot of um you know settings files here the thing that's really important for us is this content folder and inside that content folder is going to host all of the different categories that we have so we see C we have cloud computing we have C plus plus we have CSS a whole bunch of different topics if you'll remember uh I said that I wanted to contribute to the UI and ux design category um because I have written up a little thing about stakeholders as I mentioned I've been putting out a lot of UI ux content and so I want to grow the UI ux category um so I am going to go into the UI ux category go into the concepts folder and here we have the names of all of our Concepts so you'll see accessibility you'll see animation you'll see annotations I want to add a new folder in here because I'm adding a new entry and for that you add a new folder and I'm going to call this folder a stakeholder a little bit of rhyme there uh and I am going to put a file in here called stakeholder .md that's a markdown file as I mentioned before markdown is the formatting language I think I can use the word uh that is how our text is structured I'm going to borrow I think the easiest way to do this is probably borrow another file so I'm going to borrow the sketching file uh just for its formatting and paste that straight in at the top here you'll see some metadata so this is not going to be shown directly on the page but it is going to be um I think it might be helpful actually actually for me to pull up this sketching um file so that we kind of see how all of this translates so I'm going to go to UI and ux I am going to go to sketching and uh we can now see kind of how this translates so um I have over here we have this content you'll see the content update here at the top is metadata so that's not going to show and it's just going to show the uh the title here and then it's going to show this text you'll see we have this double asterisk to designate bold and we have this link so for iterate we have it in square brackets and then we have the link in parentheses and that's what creates this link here um so we are going to uh use this file stakeholder.md I'm going to change the title here to stakeholder I'm going to take out this description um it is still UI and ux so I'm going to kind of leave all of this stuff the subjects the tags the catalog content if you are doing a completely different category you can look up the tags that already exist but those are going to stay the same since this is already in UI ux uh and I am going to um delete this text and off to the side here uh in my magical other monitor I'm going to bring in uh the prewritten uh I did some preparation sorry guys uh I did some preparation and already wrote um this content so in UI and ux design a stakeholder I remember the those double asterisks are going to show as bold a stakeholder is anyone who impacts or is impacted by a certain project this could include your intended users administrators and it professionals helping set up your product uh the engineers and product managers on your team the sales people who will be selling your product and many more so just a really concise um definition there I'm also going to bring this first sentence so just a short snippet of that definition um back up into this description and put that right there uh I think that the description shouldn't have any styling so I'm going to take out those double asterisks and I think that we are set to make this really quick addition so I am going to go back to my GitHub desktop which you'll see now should have some changes showing yep and we've got here it shows that we added a new stakeholder.md file and added in this content um I also want to highlight here we do want to make sure as our contributing documentions I'm going to show this contributing dot so we forked this repo we cloned the repo to our computer the forge repo and we also need to switch to a branch so it's okay that it's on Main right now because I'm going to create a new Branch here uh and I'm going to call this um add uh stakeholder and we're going to create a branch called that it's going to ask me do I want to leave my changes on Main or bring those to add stakeholder I'm definitely going to want to add those to stakeholder this is a really important step because it's going to enable us to make a pull request to the code academy docs repo really easily so I'm going to do switch Branch here and great uh I am going to go down here um and let's create stakeholder.md and stakeholder uh markdown file just a short description there I'm going to say commit uh and I think I made a mistake there I'm also going to commit this uh and uh we're gonna publish this branch so we'll click publish there and that's going to send it to uh to GitHub and uh I can now click this create pull request and I will have a pull request here and it automatically uh since we selected that uh that we want to contribute to the parent repository it's going to assume that we want to make a pull request right to the codecademy docs repo but we're going to check that right there see we're trying to compare to the codecademy docs face main we are going uh we are using our live stream docs add stakeholder Branch right there uh and I'm going to fill out that same information so I'm going to add a description in here saying add stakeholder markdown file type of change I am adding a new entry uh I'm going to fill out all of these uh requirements that we talked about before I won't go too deep into those but just make sure you check those and that you agree and those are all accurate they're really important for our guidelines and making sure that everyone is having a good time and I am going to create a pull request and we'll see how it goes um so yeah we see our uh pull request here if there's any changes that need to be made um that'll happen as comments here in the GitHub uh we have some tests that make sure that everything is running correctly that we've signed the CLA um and if there's any failing there um our content contributors uh we'll be happy to help you out there uh and help you you know have a smooth merge into our uh onto the live site um great I think that's a good natural stopping point do I have any questions uh any any interesting uh anecdotes or anything like that yeah that'll be a perfect time now to drop your questions in the chat if you have any questions I know that there was a lot of information but I mean this you know again this is not meant to be like a fullblown tutorial of how to do contributions on GitHub or git uh for that like Luca said we have a whole course on code academy that is wonderful place to go learn all the intricacies and like the stepbystep of how diesel works but I think still you can see how it's not that bad at all if you've never done it before I'm sure that it's a little uh overwhelming or it could be a little daunting but that that's sort of like Lucas I think it's it's one of the main benefits of why contributing to docs is so great because if you've never contributed to anything online before it can feel very scary like oh wow I'm gonna go to someone's repo that I've never met before rather these big thing and I might mess something up I might change something that I wanted I didn't want to change so having something like code academic docs where the stakes are relatively low or what you can try and you have you know there's people on the other side waiting to give you feedback and like talking to you and like walking you if you have any issues walking you through the issues I mean that's like I see that has a huge benefit for anyone that that wants to practice get on GitHub maybe they just finish the course and they want to practice yeah for sure um it's a really great opportunity um I I think that uh you know I I'm a former teacher um if I was ever struggling to learn a concept um one of the biggest things that helped me was figuring out how I would articulate that concept to someone else um so uh you know a lot of people make uh flash cards for themselves I think that this is a really great learning opportunity as you are learning about things contributing to docs is a great thing for your career but it's also a great thing for your learning experience so that you really drive home exactly what these concepts are um and also you know it great looks great on your GitHub profile a lot of people use that for getting jobs a lot of people use that to kind of show their contribution and so um yeah docs is a really great place I I feel like uh there's basically three main ways that you can look at this and like see the benefits right away uh number one is you get to practice getting GitHub so that's great you get to practice it with us before you go into the wild maybe try to contribute to more complex projects or from open source stories that were in my value more intimidating the second is that you get to practice I mean you get to build your your portfolio on GitHub so somebody who goes to your profile now they see that you are you know committing and making changes to other profiles out there to all the repos so that also builds up your naturally builds up your your profile on GitHub and I think the third one is what you were just touching on which is practicing makes you better the fact that you have to you know do it not just read about it and go through the coursework but actually go into keyword go into machine or using the the edit button on the page doing it yourself that just kind of like Builds on top of that make sure that you have that you really have soaked in the knowledge right and not only the knowledge of GitHub but you're contributing to docs so you know when one teaches to learn you are also researching Concepts maybe you look at docs and go like you know uh this part of dogs looks a little thin I'm going to research this and I'm going to contribute a couple articles here uh you're also learning new things and and it's kind of fun because you're researching it you learn and then you commit it and then other people read your content so you see the impact right so I feel like those three like practicing GitHub and then just building your your resume online I guess your your your profile online and knowing that you are contributing and practicing with other people I mean that sounds all like positives to me yep spot on uh yeah docs is a really great Community we have a really great community of folks uh both internal and external that are really uh willing to uh to help you um you know this is a great learning experience for you um we're very happy to help uh we don't get frustrated if something's not working we're very uh willing to kind of help you through your first contribution um because we know that that can be a scary thing GitHub can be a scary place so we really want to make that um as smooth as possible for you and help you get uh your first pull request through um I'm going to drop in the chat here uh link to our learn git coursework so that way if anyone is wondering well okay that sounds like a really cool uh course to do There's the link Follow It Go learn get in GitHub on me great place and if you don't have an account go sign up for one it's free you can just start with all the free courses that we have which is a lot in the catalog and if you ever feel like this is something that you want to pursue as a career or you just want to take a a deeper dive then you can also subscribe for pro and you know the whole catalog is open to you at that point so thank you so much for today Lucas uh thank you for the walkthrough I think a lot of people are going to benefit from this and like just you know getting to know docs a little bit better yeah thanks for hosting Fede and thank you all to Kane uh to everyone who came uh you know uh I hope that this was a great learning experience for all of you thank you and see you on our next live stream bye bye
