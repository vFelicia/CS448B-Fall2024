01:38 - i really enjoy building relationships
01:39 - with people too so like getting people
01:41 - really excited about where they're going
01:42 - to work i just think it's super fun and
01:45 - um you know that's why i've always been
01:46 - you know internal at a company so like
01:48 - being able to you know help build teams
01:50 - uh at codecademy that build things that
01:52 - like not only they care about but i care
01:54 - about too it's just it's a lot of fun
01:57 - you know it's one of those things uh we
01:59 - keep repeating to our learners is that
02:00 - recruiters are also people like
02:02 - sometimes you're so stressed out you're
02:04 - so
02:05 - you know that you're so caught up in the
02:07 - moment like i'm applying for this job
02:08 - are they gonna ask of me technical
02:10 - questions soft skill questions you know
02:13 - the typical like tell me one time where
02:15 - you had a problem how you fix this sort
02:16 - of thing uh yeah so we always try to
02:19 - remind our learners that when you're
02:21 - applying for a job there's somebody on
02:22 - the other side yeah
02:24 - they you know they want you to succeed
02:26 - too like the fact that they have an open
02:28 - role means that they want somebody to
02:30 - join the team so just keep that in mind
02:32 - that you know it doesn't have to be an
02:34 - antagonistic serious um sort of
02:36 - situation where you against them
02:39 - that's always a thing so i'm glad that
02:40 - you said that you know you really enjoy
02:41 - it and it's like very exciting because
02:43 - it is
02:44 - um it can be very exciting so let's just
02:46 - jump into uh what everybody is here for
02:49 - which is like some advice on applying
02:51 - for jobs and you know getting into tech
02:54 - uh do you have any just to get you
02:56 - started uh any sort of general
02:58 - guidance on let's say you are a
03:00 - developer self-taught and you are
03:02 - applying for your first role
03:04 - what are some of the things that people
03:05 - should be
03:06 - considering when they are applying for
03:09 - these jobs
03:10 - yeah yeah i think you know you could
03:12 - take that in a whole bunch of different
03:13 - directions as far as
03:15 - you know some basic you know do's and
03:17 - don'ts or just key things to consider i
03:19 - think when you're applying for roles is
03:21 - you know definitely research the
03:22 - companies that you're applying for at
03:24 - least a little bit i think especially
03:25 - when you're earlier on in your career
03:27 - right super helpful i think to try to
03:29 - get as deep of an understanding of a
03:30 - company and what they do as you can
03:33 - based on the information that's out
03:34 - there um there are a lot of different
03:36 - places you can go to try to look for
03:38 - you know more information on the company
03:40 - whether that's on glassdoor or just
03:42 - simple google searches right
03:44 - another tool that we use is built-in nyc
03:47 - um built-in i believe also just went
03:49 - national so um they you know have
03:52 - information about companies and content
03:53 - around companies all over the place as
03:55 - well so there's a lot of different
03:57 - you know different tools you can use to
03:59 - try to find more information about a
04:01 - company
04:02 - and then also i think also try to find
04:04 - the company values and and think about
04:07 - that and see how that aligns maybe with
04:08 - your own values as well um codecademy
04:11 - for instance we have our company values
04:13 - on our careers page and so i always you
04:16 - know get really excited when a candidate
04:18 - talks to me about you know the values on
04:20 - the careers page that they came across
04:21 - and how that relates to you know what
04:23 - they're trying to do and where they want
04:25 - to go next with their careers and
04:27 - everything like that so definitely
04:28 - recommend you know trying to dig a bit
04:30 - deeper there um and then you know i
04:33 - think of course you know continue to dig
04:34 - into the job descriptions um you know
04:36 - continue to dig into your own resume as
04:39 - well
04:40 - um you know i think you should be able
04:42 - to use a fairly consistent resume across
04:44 - the board but you know if you notice
04:46 - within a job description or within
04:48 - something a company is doing um you know
04:50 - and they might be looking for some
04:51 - experience that you could maybe
04:52 - highlight a little bit more on your
04:54 - resume um that's not a bad idea as well
04:56 - to maybe like amp that up a little bit
04:58 - too
04:59 - trying to imagine myself in the position
05:01 - of um uh first time applicant especially
05:04 - if they don't have uh any you know any
05:06 - tech experience where maybe there are
05:07 - career switchers or the first time you
05:09 - do tech when you talk about researching
05:11 - companies and they and the values um
05:14 - i know there's like a hard balance
05:16 - between finding a good place and just
05:18 - finding a place that will give you a
05:20 - shot
05:21 - um
05:23 - how do you see do you see like that
05:24 - tension happen a lot like do you have
05:26 - any any thoughts on like well you you
05:28 - want to be somewhat picky in where you
05:31 - wanna you wanna make sure that you're
05:32 - gonna have the right mentors you're
05:33 - gonna have the right place to grow as a
05:34 - person but at the same time a lot of
05:36 - people are saying look i'm applying for
05:38 - 100 different places yeah i just need i
05:41 - just need someone to give me a shot so
05:44 - is it like like a balance is this
05:45 - something that people can be thinking
05:46 - about or like any way approaching this
05:48 - problem it doesn't seem to have a
05:49 - solution
05:50 - yeah yeah i don't i don't think there's
05:52 - an easy solution to that one right
05:53 - because of course of course you want to
05:55 - find the place not just a place um and i
05:58 - think that's a great mindset to have in
05:59 - that sense you should definitely be
06:00 - picky but also you know a place you know
06:03 - a company that you might not think
06:05 - initially would be the place uh you know
06:07 - it might just be a place could
06:09 - potentially be the place you know if
06:10 - you're asking the right questions i can
06:11 - find out more information about how you
06:13 - might be able to grow there or you know
06:16 - how the teams work well together or what
06:18 - the mission you know two years down the
06:20 - line at a company might be
06:22 - and that might get you more excited
06:23 - about that too i think
06:26 - you know i think it's it's it's yeah
06:28 - it's a bit hard i think especially
06:29 - earlier on it's good to maybe cast a
06:31 - little bit of a wider net because it's
06:34 - also a lot of like you don't know don't
06:35 - know sometimes too right and so you
06:37 - might uh
06:39 - before like come across something that
06:41 - you didn't realize you would actually be
06:42 - kind of more excited about and it's also
06:44 - okay to recognize that even if you might
06:46 - not
06:47 - do something you are the most excited
06:49 - about initially you can definitely find
06:51 - a way to you know learn things that will
06:54 - be valuable to you in your next role um
06:56 - you know and that maybe end up at the
06:58 - place the next time as well so i think
07:00 - as long as you're thinking about what
07:02 - you're going to be able to learn from
07:03 - that job and how you're going to be able
07:04 - to grow uh even if it's not like the
07:07 - premier company you want to work for
07:09 - still a super valuable experience so i
07:12 - think you can you can continue to guide
07:14 - your career in the ways that you want to
07:15 - that way awesome
07:17 - so what i'm hearing is that sometimes
07:18 - having a bit more of a medium term or
07:20 - long-term approach to your career it
07:22 - helps basically saying maybe short-term
07:25 - you think this is not the place that you
07:26 - thought you would be but if you think
07:28 - about long-longer term like you know
07:29 - accumulate experience add that to your
07:31 - resume you know you will always have
07:33 - like i guess kind of like put things in
07:35 - perspective a bit uh you also touched on
07:37 - researching the company before you apply
07:39 - for has a good point to do when you're
07:40 - applying for jobs how much weight should
07:43 - a candidate put into places like
07:45 - glassdoor like you know you look at the
07:46 - reviews and people are saying like i was
07:48 - here it was a bad experience or like i
07:50 - did this interview or they asked me
07:52 - these questions totally out of place
07:54 - is there
07:55 - is that something to be aware of like
07:56 - beware like okay yeah they're valuable
07:59 - but
08:00 - put it in context
08:02 - yeah yeah no i think uh they are
08:04 - definitely valuable resources but i
08:06 - think you have to be a little cautious
08:09 - as well i think i don't think you can
08:10 - take everything at face value glassdoor
08:12 - you know is essentially right like the
08:13 - yelp of of reviewing companies um and so
08:17 - you know you're going to get better or
08:18 - worse reviews whether they're accurate
08:20 - and accurate um obviously not everything
08:22 - is going to be inaccurate so i'm not
08:23 - trying to say that but um you know
08:25 - definitely be cautious and it and you
08:28 - know feel confident and the fact that
08:30 - you should be able to ask questions
08:32 - throughout your interview process too so
08:34 - even if you're still wanting to move
08:35 - forward with the company even after
08:36 - maybe you've heard things that you don't
08:38 - necessarily love or a little
08:40 - you know you know i think maybe
08:42 - might be a little discouraging um at
08:44 - least initially i think you know just
08:46 - make sure you're asking those questions
08:48 - to address those concerns because you
08:50 - know potentially a review from even just
08:51 - a few months ago uh you know it could
08:54 - could have already been addressed
08:55 - internally and adjustments might have
08:57 - been made and you know they can address
08:59 - how they're working to adjust those
09:01 - types of concerns or improve processes
09:03 - or whatever the case might be um you
09:06 - know wherever your concerns might be
09:07 - with those reviews so i think um
09:09 - definitely encourage candidates to not
09:11 - get totally
09:12 - turned off by things like glassdoor
09:14 - necessarily but you know use that as a
09:16 - part of their process when they're
09:17 - trying to figure out if this is really
09:19 - the best place for them so definitely
09:21 - don't hesitate to ask those questions
09:23 - that sounds like a really good idea it's
09:25 - not
09:26 - don't don't use that as a reason not to
09:28 - apply but do keep it in mind maybe
09:30 - during the the application process where
09:32 - the recruiter says do you have any
09:33 - questions for me maybe that's the moment
09:35 - to say well
09:37 - you know i wanted to address this
09:38 - concern or i wanted to learn more about
09:40 - this particular that's that's a really
09:42 - good point um is there like um like an
09:45 - etiquette when it comes to uh we're
09:47 - talking about researching companies
09:49 - if you find if you go to linkedin or
09:50 - twitter like maybe you find some of the
09:52 - recruiters or some of the people of the
09:53 - company like is there an educator like
09:55 - how far can you connect with these
09:56 - people before it sort of becomes maybe
09:59 - crossing the line or becoming
10:01 - inappropriate like how much research can
10:03 - you do or how much connection can you do
10:04 - with a company before
10:06 - you should worry about it like before it
10:08 - becomes a red flag
10:09 - yeah right right right um no because
10:11 - there's there's definitely a bit of a
10:12 - line right and i you know encourage
10:14 - folks who have mutual connections
10:16 - especially like if you didn't realize
10:18 - someone you went to
10:19 - uh high school with or whatever the case
10:21 - might be or you know just someone that
10:23 - might be in your network um works at the
10:26 - company definitely encourage you to
10:27 - reach out to them via linkedin or you
10:29 - know if you're if you're that close to
10:31 - them shoot them an email or whatever the
10:32 - case might be
10:33 - um and see if they have time to connect
10:36 - or you know refer you to the right
10:37 - person um you know we see candidates who
10:40 - will reach out to folks within the
10:41 - department you know that they're
10:43 - interested in applying for
10:44 - um and so on which is okay but i think
10:47 - um you know the biggest thing to keep in
10:49 - mind is that you know
10:51 - folks of course you know have a lot
10:52 - going on at any point in time whether
10:54 - that's work personal etc so it might be
10:57 - professional or personal reasons that
10:58 - they might not be able to get back to
11:00 - you so i think as long as you're
11:01 - understanding of folks who
11:03 - might not be able to you know either
11:05 - follow up as immediately as you might
11:07 - hope for or you know take the time to
11:09 - connect on the phone um you know i think
11:12 - then you're then you're okay um because
11:14 - we've seen some candidates who you know
11:16 - have kind of crossed the line and become
11:17 - a little more you know
11:19 - don't understand you know why you won't
11:21 - get on the phone with me etc um when
11:23 - they're interested in learning about
11:24 - opportunities and while we absolutely
11:26 - love you know the engagement and you
11:29 - know someone being so excited about an
11:30 - opportunity you know it's just not
11:32 - possible all the time unfortunately and
11:34 - again that could be due to personal
11:36 - reasons as well you know maybe they're
11:37 - just not available um
11:40 - for a reason so i think just keeping
11:41 - that in mind um
11:42 - you know the same way we don't want to
11:44 - waste a candidate's time ever um you
11:46 - know we want to make sure we're staying
11:48 - up to date with candidates as much as we
11:49 - can and getting them feedback as well um
11:52 - you know we have to be respectful of
11:54 - time both ways so i think you know
11:55 - gentle reach outs to folks that work at
11:58 - the company in the department that you
11:59 - work with or other mutual connections if
12:02 - you see
12:03 - someone is connected with someone you
12:05 - know
12:05 - um you know trying to see if you can get
12:07 - an introduction i think those are all
12:09 - great ways to go
12:11 - hmm
12:12 - yeah i i know that uh sometimes that
12:14 - eagerness can translate into annoyance
12:16 - or uh this it's a fine line between
12:19 - trying to just show that you are
12:21 - interested in the role and saying you
12:22 - know i really uh i'm motivated for this
12:25 - or like i really want this uh
12:27 - there's a fine line between that and
12:28 - just just getting in people's nerves
12:30 - basically you're like
12:32 - becoming more of a nuisance i guess a
12:33 - little bit so um
12:43 - everybody wants to get back to everybody
12:44 - all the time you know and you know i
12:46 - think it's just again just you know
12:48 - thinking about it both ways and just
12:49 - trying to you know be respectful and
12:51 - then that's all you can do but you know
12:53 - i think a candidate who is super engaged
12:55 - and you know very excited about an
12:56 - opportunity is great and as long as
12:59 - we're communicating well in that way
13:00 - then you know there's no harm no foul
13:02 - okay
13:03 - and uh thinking about uh newer newcomers
13:06 - applying for jobs is just in general um
13:09 - is there like
13:10 - is there a rule i know that i've heard
13:12 - different versions of this but uh when
13:14 - you're applying for jobs sometimes
13:15 - especially if you don't have any prior
13:17 - experience you might find yourself not
13:19 - checking all the boxes in a job
13:21 - description
13:22 - um
13:23 - what do you think that is like an
13:24 - appropriate ratio of like let's say okay
13:26 - they asked for eight things i know five
13:28 - five out of eight seems like a first
13:30 - shot is there like a like a typical
13:32 - number where recruiters might look at an
13:34 - applicant and say like from the
13:36 - recruiter's perspective you you get i
13:38 - know i talked to harlan i talked to
13:39 - other teammates at her meet uh and they
13:41 - said they said you know we only have so
13:43 - much time to look at resume so we get so
13:44 - many and there's a big volume so
13:46 - what do you think that there's like a
13:47 - fair line between
13:49 - applying for something and definitely
13:51 - not being qualified for it or saying
13:52 - this could be enough that a recruiter on
13:54 - the other side is going to look at and
13:55 - say
13:56 - okay
13:57 - yeah yeah and it can go up and down
13:59 - right you know it sounds like as harlan
14:01 - you might have said uh you know
14:02 - sometimes you're you know you have more
14:04 - or less time or sometimes positions are
14:06 - getting more applications versus not you
14:08 - know and so then you know you might be
14:10 - able to take a little bit more time um
14:12 - to review you know more and more
14:14 - applications or you know dive a little
14:15 - bit deeper um so there's no perfect
14:18 - answer or perfect guess of whether or
14:19 - not i think you know if someone is
14:21 - actually going to be able to reach out
14:22 - and connect with you on the phone um but
14:24 - i think you know give yourself you know
14:26 - some room right you know i think as you
14:28 - were saying right there's not
14:29 - necessarily a perfect number but i think
14:31 - one way to go right is um when you a lot
14:33 - of job descriptions are separated into
14:35 - like must-haves and then nice to haves
14:37 - and so
14:38 - if you look at you know some of the key
14:39 - things in those must-haves like maybe
14:41 - the top few bullet points that are in
14:43 - those must-haves of like must-have x
14:46 - type of experience um if you meet some
14:48 - of those and then especially if you meet
14:50 - some of those nice to haves but maybe
14:52 - not all of the must-haves as well that
14:54 - can you can kind of think of that as
14:55 - maybe supplementing a little bit where a
14:58 - recruiter maybe would be more inclined
14:59 - to say like oh you know they're missing
15:01 - on one or two of these things but then
15:03 - they have these other things that make
15:04 - them really applicable for this job as
15:06 - well so like let's connect and you know
15:08 - try to dive a bit deeper into the
15:09 - experience so i think
15:11 - you know it
15:12 - yeah i think you know it definitely it
15:14 - doesn't hurt to to apply right i think
15:16 - uh you know what i hate seeing
15:18 - candidates get tripped up on and um
15:20 - something that is super prevalent you
15:22 - know
15:22 - throughout you know i think
15:24 - the tech industry and beyond is you know
15:26 - when you see a position that has like
15:29 - we're looking for four or five plus
15:31 - years of experience or something say for
15:32 - like a more senior level role and
15:35 - someone only has three and then they
15:36 - still don't apply you know i think if
15:38 - you're missing on one to two years
15:40 - unless it's you know a senior role and
15:42 - you're just in you're just starting out
15:44 - you know so if you are trying to look
15:46 - for your first engineering role for
15:47 - example if it's a senior engineering
15:49 - role that's looking for four or five
15:51 - plus years of experience then maybe
15:53 - that's not going to be a fit since it's
15:55 - your first role that you're looking for
15:56 - as an engineer but once you're more at a
15:58 - senior level you know if don't take like
16:01 - the just hard line years of experience
16:03 - so to heart that it you know prevents
16:05 - you from applying um because you see
16:07 - that with different types of candidates
16:09 - all the time so i would say that's one
16:10 - where you can you know i think feel a
16:12 - little bit more comfortable at least you
16:13 - know shooting somebody in that respect
16:16 - i think what somebody told me once a few
16:18 - months ago i was talking about this
16:20 - somebody else and they said
16:21 - let them be the ones that say no don't
16:24 - self uh select yourself out
16:26 - and it was sort of like if there is a
16:28 - gray area where you're not sure like you
16:29 - were saying like if you have three years
16:30 - of experience and then looking for
16:31 - somebody with four or five
16:33 - if you are sort of like not sure it's
16:35 - better that they are the ones saying no
16:37 - then you say no to yourself yeah
16:40 - is that fair yeah i think that's a great
16:42 - way to think about it as long as you
16:43 - know yeah let them say no and even if
16:46 - they say no right now in six more months
16:48 - another year you know it could be an
16:50 - absolute yes right so um definitely
16:53 - encourage i love seeing folks who
16:55 - reapply you know after a certain amount
16:57 - of time as well and it's just very
16:59 - exciting to see that you know kind of
17:00 - come through and i'm like oh they've
17:01 - applied to us last year and like oh
17:03 - that's great they've grown in their
17:05 - experience let's talk to them and get
17:06 - them on the phone um so i definitely
17:09 - agree definitely don't select yourself
17:11 - out of the process you know give
17:12 - yourself that opportunity because
17:13 - otherwise you're not going to know
17:15 - either way so might as well try to and i
17:17 - think this uh this is a great point to
17:19 - switch gears into the don dues and the
17:21 - first one that comes to mind is how
17:23 - often can you apply for a role before it
17:25 - becomes sort of like bad like let's say
17:27 - for example that code academy is hiring
17:30 - five different senior engineers should
17:32 - you apply for all five roles or are you
17:34 - or should candidates understand that
17:36 - companies the recruiters own companies
17:38 - like if they think that you're a better
17:40 - fit for a different role like you just
17:41 - apply for one and they will direct you
17:43 - to the right one like how does that work
17:45 - yeah no that's a good question um and a
17:48 - lot of companies think about this
17:49 - differently and i've experienced that
17:51 - throughout my career as well um how
17:53 - folks think about this when folks apply
17:54 - to different roles i think one of the
17:56 - biggest
17:57 - things is
17:58 - not applying to roles that are
17:59 - completely different you know so we've
18:01 - had people apply for just like a role in
18:03 - our marketing team and then a role on
18:04 - the data team and then you know a role
18:06 - in engineering and it just
18:08 - it none of it kind of fits well together
18:10 - you know i think um the example you
18:13 - pointed to is an interesting one in
18:14 - terms of like if we have five senior
18:16 - back-end engineer roles open which i
18:17 - think we have
18:18 - a close close to that number right now
18:20 - um for example and you know they're on
18:23 - just different teams i think in that
18:25 - respect you know if the requirements are
18:27 - pretty similar in that respect i do
18:28 - think it's okay um you know to apply to
18:31 - to multiple roles in that respect
18:33 - because you're essentially applying for
18:35 - you know a senior back-end engineer role
18:37 - and it can be helpful to potentially get
18:40 - your resume seen a bit more because you
18:42 - might have different recruiters working
18:43 - on different roles and so that way you
18:46 - know you might have more of a likelihood
18:47 - of being seen that way um but otherwise
18:50 - i would say usually try to stick to one
18:53 - but i think if it's similar types of
18:55 - roles that way
18:56 - it is okay to apply to both but again
18:58 - it's tough to say um because companies
19:00 - do think about it differently i've
19:01 - worked at a company before over there
19:03 - like if they apply for more than one
19:04 - role we don't even want to talk to them
19:06 - because then they don't
19:08 - they do and i was like okay that seems a
19:10 - bit harsh um but you know that was that
19:12 - was the way they were operating um at
19:14 - that point in time so
19:16 - um you know we handled things a little
19:17 - differently on iron but you know i think
19:20 - there's no perfect answer so again i
19:21 - think if you're applying to a similar
19:23 - type of role um like back end engineer
19:25 - for instance
19:26 - then i think it you shouldn't
19:28 - necessarily be putting yourself in
19:30 - danger if you apply for multiple teams
19:33 - yeah because i imagine that uh when you
19:34 - are applying for jobs you might become
19:36 - you might be concerned that um they're
19:39 - gonna think of you like hey this person
19:41 - is applying for so many roles at once uh
19:44 - and usually when you you want candidates
19:46 - that are strong at the role that they're
19:47 - applying for so if you apply like you
19:49 - said for multiple roles you might come
19:51 - across as
19:53 - you are not good at any of them right
19:55 - right like a little maybe that you
19:58 - it just comes a little like dissolved i
20:00 - guess or like diluted it's just like you
20:01 - value dilutes a little bit when you
20:03 - apply for multiple roles and i know that
20:05 - uh so i mean some
20:07 - especially for junior roles sometimes
20:09 - people are concerned that if they apply
20:10 - even when their roles are similar it's
20:12 - one like you said if you apply for more
20:14 - than one maybe they will disqualify you
20:15 - right right off the bat and number two
20:17 - they're concerned that they built some
20:19 - sort of rapport with the uh with the
20:21 - company where they're like well this
20:22 - person just applied for anything so you
20:24 - know like they just dropped five five
20:26 - copies of the resume here whatever so i
20:29 - know that's a valid concern for some
20:30 - people that just feel like
20:32 - yeah all right they don't want to seem
20:34 - too desperate but they do want to
20:36 - increase their chances of getting higher
20:38 - yeah yeah that's why i think if you're
20:39 - applying for you know a similar
20:41 - back-end engineer role right it can make
20:43 - sense to kind of you know
20:45 - socialize your resume a little bit more
20:46 - in that way but um when they are quite
20:49 - different types of roles or with roles
20:51 - with very different focuses um i think
20:53 - that's when folks might start to
20:55 - question too like do you have an
20:57 - understanding of what you're looking for
20:58 - out of your next role um and then that
21:01 - and that can be a little bit that can
21:03 - raise some flags for folks sometimes um
21:05 - because i think you don't have to know
21:07 - exactly where you want to end up in five
21:09 - ten et cetera years right um and also
21:12 - you can say what you want now and that
21:13 - can always change too um but i think you
21:16 - know when you're applying for such
21:18 - different roles it makes people question
21:20 - again like is are they going to be happy
21:21 - in this role you know and what they're
21:24 - looking for a question um you know i
21:26 - always ask and most recruiters will ask
21:29 - on their initial phone calls with you is
21:31 - you know what are you looking for out of
21:32 - your next role what is most important
21:34 - for you in regards to where you're going
21:36 - next like whether that is compensation
21:37 - whether that's you know a mission-driven
21:39 - organization a team you know that works
21:42 - super cross-functionally you want a role
21:44 - that has a lot of autonomy or whatever
21:46 - the case might be you know having just
21:48 - that sort of understanding so if you are
21:49 - applying for two just very different
21:51 - roles you know then it might you know it
21:54 - might those types of things might not
21:55 - align um for folks that you're speaking
21:57 - to in your process
21:58 - definitely valid um do you have any
22:01 - other like big domes like general like
22:03 - just just in general like if you're
22:05 - applying for a role it might be a junior
22:07 - role might be a more serial is it any
22:08 - sort of like very
22:10 - i would say not obvious but
22:12 - it's things that are just like across
22:14 - the board avoidable that will diminish
22:16 - your chances of getting a job
22:18 - yeah yeah i think something that is
22:21 - coming to mind a lot is uh
22:22 - you know especially once you're speaking
22:24 - with with a company um not you know
22:26 - completely disparaging your current or
22:28 - previous company um especially as you're
22:30 - speaking to past experiences
22:32 - um you know if someone is like why are
22:34 - you looking to leave your current role
22:35 - and you're like i hate my manager
22:37 - you know the company is just a nightmare
22:40 - it's a mess you know you definitely want
22:42 - to avoid things like that you know talk
22:43 - that really even if you your com your
22:46 - company is terrible or something like
22:47 - that whatever that might mean
22:49 - you know you just want to avoid phrasing
22:51 - it that way and talk about how like
22:53 - maybe you know right now you know you're
22:54 - experiencing you know being a little bit
22:56 - micromanaged and you prefer to have a
22:58 - lot more autonomy in a role you know
23:00 - talking to like how you know you want to
23:02 - continue growing in a next role versus
23:04 - kind of hating on um or throwing too
23:06 - much shade at your current or former
23:07 - employer
23:08 - yeah definitely that's something to
23:10 - avoid for sure because the big
23:12 - the big the big thing to do right is to
23:14 - talk about your experience what you've
23:16 - learned you know how you've you know
23:18 - adjusted or made improvements moving
23:20 - forward and like how you'll apply that
23:22 - as you continue to grow within your
23:24 - career as well rather than just kind of
23:26 - focusing on the very direct things that
23:28 - you haven't liked about something um so
23:30 - that's definitely one big thing uh that
23:31 - i think is just a no-no across the board
23:33 - regardless of how junior
23:34 - senior you might be it really sounds to
23:37 - me like um basically the rule of thumb
23:39 - is you should be focusing on yourself so
23:41 - when somebody asks
23:42 - why are you leaving your old role like
23:44 - why are you changing companies instead
23:46 - of disparaging your own company and
23:47 - talking about them you should be talking
23:48 - about you like well i try to achieve
23:50 - this i'm trying to change this i try to
23:52 - tackle new problems i'm trying to find
23:54 - new
23:55 - mentors or new right like it's sort of
23:58 - like you you want to always phrase it in
24:00 - the context of you the candidate and not
24:02 - so much in everybody else right
24:04 - right right yeah i think you know
24:06 - focusing exactly as you said you know on
24:07 - yourself um and your continued growth i
24:10 - think is where you want to be of course
24:11 - it's good to acknowledge you know the
24:13 - team etc in terms of like being you know
24:15 - at codecademy one of our values is we
24:17 - win as a team right so of course you
24:18 - want to think about things that way as
24:19 - you continue to grow but it is in
24:21 - regards to what you are looking for
24:23 - right so people will usually say like
24:25 - yes i'm looking for a mission-driven
24:26 - organization i'm looking to work with
24:28 - new technologies to work on new problems
24:30 - and i'm really just looking for a team
24:31 - that i get along with and you know like
24:33 - want to collaborate with and a team that
24:35 - really you know you know has this type
24:37 - of environment etc um you know i think
24:39 - again even though you know you can still
24:41 - hint at things that are team related it
24:43 - is still focused on what you as a
24:44 - candidate are looking for versus like
24:46 - saying why something else is bad
24:49 - that's nice um
24:51 - it's coming to mind because i think that
24:53 - they don't so don't do this or don't do
24:55 - that in the com when you're applying for
24:56 - jobs it seems that a lot of people uh
24:59 - when they're applying for for roles
25:02 - they
25:03 - they will try to
25:05 - how to put it
25:07 - they
25:08 - i'm not like not embellishing but
25:10 - sometimes you know you're trying to sell
25:12 - yourself and it seems like there's a bit
25:14 - of a give like a wiggle room and how you
25:16 - you can showcase your strengths while
25:19 - minimizing your your weaknesses i guess
25:21 - so um
25:23 - have you had in the past in your
25:25 - experience um anyone that maybe has
25:27 - taken it too far like is there is there
25:29 - a point where you're saying like this is
25:31 - not even going to help you anymore like
25:32 - you don't need to do this
25:34 - um is it is it like
25:36 - is there any sort of like don't do this
25:38 - uh for example you rush me like
25:41 - should you
25:42 - you know
25:43 - i'm just trying to think like journals
25:45 - don't
25:46 - forget
25:47 - yeah general in terms of you know over
25:49 - embellishing or
25:51 - you know yeah you know hiding your
25:53 - experience a bit too much
25:54 - um i think that
25:58 - and let me know if this isn't getting at
25:59 - the heart of the question but i think in
26:01 - terms of your resume and you know how
26:04 - you speak to your experience
26:07 - folks will
26:09 - interviewers are usually able to tell
26:10 - you know when something is kind of like
26:12 - you know where they're getting question
26:14 - marks about you know did you do did you
26:16 - do this or did your team do this or what
26:18 - you know you need to very much be able
26:20 - to speak to
26:21 - the part that you played in that
26:23 - experience um you know where
26:26 - you know
26:27 - you can very clearly talk about you know
26:28 - what you accomplished in previous roles
26:31 - um you know discussing the projects
26:32 - specifically that you worked on and
26:34 - being able to deep dive into that quite
26:36 - a bit um obviously you know if you're a
26:38 - very senior engineer let's say you know
26:40 - talking about a project you worked on 10
26:41 - years ago maybe you don't remember all
26:43 - of the key details but with an
26:44 - experience or two or in your current
26:46 - role you know being able to speak to
26:48 - what your role was you know within uh
26:51 - the work that you did or projects you
26:52 - worked on you know what resources you
26:54 - had um you know what kind of impact
26:56 - project had and who you worked with and
26:58 - talking about you know what that team
27:00 - structure looked like and you know being
27:02 - able to speak to you know your working
27:04 - style or how you iterated on a project
27:06 - et cetera et cetera really being able to
27:07 - like drill down into the details quite a
27:09 - bit um i think uh you know if you get to
27:13 - the place where you're not able to do
27:14 - that you're kind of like yeah i did this
27:15 - thing and someone asks you how you did
27:18 - the thing and you can't really talk you
27:20 - can't really speak to how you did the
27:21 - thing or how you you know iterated or
27:24 - you know improved on the thing
27:25 - or you know who you worked with as a
27:27 - part of doing that thing um then you're
27:30 - going to be i think talking about your
27:31 - experience a little bit too much yeah
27:34 - that's that's fair i think i mean people
27:36 - can tell i think especially recruiters i
27:38 - mean i think it's important for our
27:40 - learners watching this uh to remember
27:42 - that recruiters are
27:44 - professionals that are doing this for a
27:46 - living like
27:47 - you
27:48 - there is you're not the first can
27:50 - and they're they're going they know what
27:52 - they're doing so it's a lot better to be
27:54 - honest yeah and that's going to get you
27:56 - further that's going to get you far
27:58 - more than trying to right work
28:02 - right and i think
28:03 - the key thing to remember too is it is
28:05 - totally okay to admit what you don't
28:07 - know um you know in fact that's that's
28:09 - one of the biggest don'ts that i see
28:10 - sometimes too is folks you know kind of
28:12 - make something up or try to skirt around
28:14 - and answer um you know of course you
28:17 - don't want to just say i don't know and
28:18 - you know in that period yeah you don't
28:20 - want to say that um you could say you
28:22 - know i actually haven't had experience
28:23 - with this before um but you know in a
28:26 - situational sense here's what i think i
28:27 - might do but you know this is also i
28:29 - want to recognize that this is an area
28:30 - of growth for me um or you know this is
28:32 - what i've experienced second hand so far
28:34 - you know you can admit what you don't
28:36 - know um you know i think that's it
28:38 - that's a that's a big strength for
28:40 - someone if they you know admit what they
28:42 - don't know or it are able to like talk
28:44 - about a mistake that they've had it's
28:45 - all about where you go from there right
28:47 - um
28:48 - acknowledging any growth areas or ways
28:50 - you've improved in the past and things
28:52 - like that is like in my opinion and most
28:55 - of the folks i've worked with in
28:56 - interview processes a big thumbs up um
28:59 - you know from everyone
29:01 - yeah i think that people have to get a
29:03 - bit more confidence in their skills like
29:05 - i mean if you got to the phone interview
29:06 - like if you got to the first hurdle like
29:08 - if you submitted your resume and
29:10 - somebody said this is good enough that i
29:11 - want to talk to them like pat yourself
29:13 - in the back just be like okay there must
29:15 - be something there i'm i'm a strong like
29:17 - i have to be a strong enough candidate
29:18 - that they're willing to to talk to me so
29:21 - so you know like
29:22 - sometimes it's like there's no need to
29:24 - to like do anything strap again or to
29:26 - try to push it too far you already
29:28 - passed that sort of like check right
29:30 - like yeah you already showed that yeah
29:33 - so
29:34 - i think uh you know some people just
29:35 - just like
29:37 - yeah put it all in context um before we
29:40 - finish i wanted to also ask you we
29:42 - touched this in the beginning um some of
29:44 - the resources that our learners can use
29:46 - to prep for interviews or to prepare in
29:48 - general for interviewing i know that uh
29:50 - there's a lot that goes into this so
29:51 - this typically for a tech company there
29:53 - might be a phone interview there might
29:54 - be like a some sort of screen that might
29:55 - be technical interviews and behind it
29:58 - you might be talking to future peers or
30:00 - senior or managers that you might be you
30:03 - might have to have some take-home exams
30:04 - or whiteboarding interviews depending on
30:06 - interviews so so there's a lot of moving
30:07 - pieces and all throughout the process
30:09 - you're having to showcase your skills
30:10 - and you need to be able you need to like
30:12 - all these things so
30:14 - besides uh we already mentioned
30:15 - glassdoor do you have any other
30:17 - resources that people
30:18 - should
30:19 - be utilizing more that you see that you
30:22 - maybe feel that they are underutilized
30:24 - when candidates are applying for jobs
30:26 - like for example we talked about
30:27 - researching uh is is researching on
30:30 - twitter or linkedin like a strong
30:33 - thing to do
30:34 - yeah yeah no i i think yeah utilizing
30:37 - all of those different channels like
30:38 - twitter linkedin etc but again i would
30:41 - say you know especially if it's comments
30:43 - kind of like glassdoor right you know
30:44 - you can't rely on you know what everyone
30:46 - else might be saying so a lot of stuff
30:48 - on twitter right is a lot of opinion or
30:50 - you know various different types of
30:51 - content pieces so i think you know don't
30:53 - necessarily take it just at face value
30:55 - um i think you know other good things to
30:58 - keep in mind outside of just
30:59 - resources and researching the company is
31:02 - you know as you get through uh parts of
31:04 - the interview process not being able you
31:07 - know or excuse me not being afraid to
31:09 - make sure you understand who you're
31:10 - gonna be meeting with so if a recruiter
31:12 - like ever doesn't you know give you the
31:14 - schedule of folks that you're meeting
31:16 - with um they're just like hey we're
31:18 - you're meeting at this time for three
31:19 - hours like see you there you know
31:21 - definitely ask them who you're meeting
31:22 - with um you know if possible ideally
31:25 - they'll provide you with linkedin
31:26 - information so you can like research a
31:28 - little bit about who you're meeting with
31:30 - um obviously you don't need to go down a
31:32 - whole rabbit hole of finding out every
31:33 - piece of information about your
31:35 - interviewers um but it's just helpful i
31:37 - think it makes it humanizes the
31:38 - experience a little bit more of you know
31:40 - being able to understand a little bit
31:41 - more about uh your interviewer's journey
31:43 - and how they got there and things like
31:45 - to you know got to you know let's say
31:47 - codecademy for example um and and all of
31:50 - that good stuff and i think um
31:52 - thinking about that not being able
31:54 - you're excuse me not being afraid to you
31:56 - know ask your recruiters if they can
31:57 - like hop on a call before a final round
31:59 - interview to chat about what you can
32:01 - expect and answer any other questions
32:03 - you might have i think
32:06 - yeah not hesitating to ask questions to
32:08 - your recruiter or in your interviews
32:10 - especially as you go through the process
32:13 - definitely you know prepare questions
32:15 - that you might have or you know that you
32:16 - might have time to ask throughout your
32:18 - interview process i think that is also a
32:20 - really great way to learn about the
32:21 - company um i definitely enjoy when
32:24 - candidates even very early on in the
32:25 - process have you know a certain amount
32:27 - of questions um or you know can we can
32:30 - get through a certain amount of
32:31 - questions within a certain amount of
32:32 - time um you know as long as i have time
32:34 - i'm always happy to you know hot like
32:35 - stay on a phone call longer with the
32:37 - candidate to answer questions
32:39 - because it's really invigorating for me
32:40 - too personally i feel when a candidate
32:43 - is like tell me more about code county
32:44 - like why you really enjoy being there
32:46 - what brought you there or you know
32:47 - what's been one of the biggest struggles
32:49 - that you've had you know at co academy
32:50 - or elsewhere et cetera you know things
32:52 - like that i mean doing that in person
32:55 - sort of research is is definitely a
32:56 - great way uh great way to learn about
32:59 - the company um but also i think
33:02 - you know
33:02 - using you know searching for
33:05 - depending on what types of interviews
33:06 - you're doing too throughout the process
33:07 - i think um you know trying to find those
33:10 - resources as far as what you can ask
33:11 - like if someone's doing a behavioral
33:14 - interview um you know understanding i
33:16 - think how you know what types of
33:18 - questions might be asked and you know
33:20 - how to respond to those
33:23 - again i think taking the approach of you
33:25 - know being able to really deep dive into
33:26 - your experience so far with whether how
33:29 - limited or vast that is um and just
33:31 - being able to you know as confidently as
33:32 - you can speak to what you've done the
33:34 - parts that you played how you've
33:36 - improved what you've learned et cetera
33:39 - um you know it's definitely you know one
33:41 - of the best ways to prepare yourself for
33:42 - any interview process
33:45 - all right
33:46 - um this is a closing question that i
33:48 - have um a lot of our learners especially
33:51 - like we keep coming back to the ones
33:52 - that are trying to get the first job and
33:54 - very junior roles i've heard in the past
33:56 - from some of our teammates that
33:58 - they know okay i accept that you're
34:00 - you're applying for a junior role so
34:01 - there's some leeway or there's some some
34:03 - concessions that are given so in terms
34:05 - of your experience or your work
34:07 - experience or what you've achieved
34:09 - because obviously this is going to be
34:10 - your first role uh so um
34:13 - i know that a lot of people get nervous
34:15 - about the soft skills part they were
34:17 - like they're gonna ask me how i work in
34:19 - teams they're going to ask me if how i
34:21 - solve problems in teams or how i
34:23 - communicate my communication skills and
34:25 - some people put in their resume it's
34:26 - almost like a gimmick like on the side
34:28 - of the rest we might say skills and says
34:29 - teamwork communications i don't even
34:31 - know what that means right so
34:33 - do you have any thoughts on on the whole
34:35 - soft skills area of interviewing and
34:37 - going through that interview process
34:39 - where people don't know how to showcase
34:40 - they know how to practice them they
34:41 - don't know what to get them they know
34:42 - what to do with them uh have you seen
34:44 - like in your in your in the past like
34:46 - this struggle and like do you have any
34:48 - any advice
34:49 - yeah how about this yeah absolutely no i
34:52 - think that's a great question um and a
34:53 - great thing for for folks to think about
34:55 - especially earlier on in their careers
34:56 - too um one thing that's coming to mind
34:59 - is you know don't hesitate to utilize
35:01 - experience that you think might not be
35:03 - relevant for these types of questions
35:05 - for example you know especially you know
35:06 - if you're a career changer right um and
35:09 - you're moving into software engineering
35:11 - when someone might ask you about like
35:13 - can you give me an example of a time you
35:14 - worked in a team um you know for a
35:16 - project whatever the case might be that
35:18 - does not have to be necessarily you know
35:20 - an engineering project that can be from
35:22 - you know like something that's coming to
35:23 - mind for me you know before i went into
35:25 - recruiting i worked in hospitality i
35:27 - worked in retail et cetera you know and
35:29 - so moving into the recruiting space for
35:32 - the first time you know i didn't have
35:33 - that experience and that's okay but
35:35 - there are other ways to think about you
35:36 - know similar soft skills and how that
35:38 - translates to any type of position um so
35:41 - when you're thinking about those soft
35:42 - skills type questions about you know can
35:44 - you tell me
35:45 - you know about your collaboration skills
35:47 - things like that that would probably
35:49 - wouldn't be the question but um
35:50 - that's what i'm going to do
35:52 - with your skills
35:54 - if you need to tell yourself
35:55 - skills not so much that wouldn't be the
35:57 - question but you know one one big
35:59 - question that comes to mind is like can
36:00 - you tell me about a time you made a
36:01 - mistake you know as a junior engineer
36:03 - you're like struggling to you know
36:06 - struggling to come up with like oh when
36:07 - did i make a mistake in terms of like
36:09 - you know engineering or how that might
36:11 - you know you know play into the role
36:12 - here you know talk about something else
36:14 - you know there are tons of other
36:16 - experiences that you most likely have
36:18 - whether they're you know inside
36:19 - engineering or tech or not um you know
36:21 - because again soft skills are apply
36:24 - anywhere not necessarily just to this
36:25 - specific role um so of course if you
36:27 - have an example that's relevant to this
36:29 - specific role use that but if you don't
36:31 - um you know it's not like where you a
36:34 - part of
36:35 - you know your background of what you've
36:36 - been in previously
36:38 - you know bring it from elsewhere like
36:39 - talk about the job that you had in high
36:40 - school or you know you know something
36:42 - that you learned at a club um that that
36:45 - you know that you were a part of um at
36:47 - any point in your life um you know for
36:50 - example or you know just whatever the
36:52 - case might be you know it's not usually
36:54 - too much of a reach um to think about it
36:56 - that way so even if you don't haven't
36:58 - had a role within engineering previously
37:01 - pull from previous experiences because
37:03 - again as you're saying it's more about
37:05 - you know the ability to do these things
37:07 - rather than the experience you know
37:08 - depending upon you know what role you
37:10 - might be interviewing for
37:12 - yeah i know that i tell people all the
37:14 - time if you don't have do your research
37:16 - right like what kind of things you need
37:17 - for your role and then once you've done
37:18 - your homework and you know what you need
37:20 - if you don't have it you can get it like
37:22 - especially now with so many online
37:24 - communities and so many online
37:25 - opportunities uh if you feel like oh i
37:28 - don't have a good
37:29 - example of being working on a team or
37:32 - leading a team
37:33 - develop your skills online find and
37:35 - there's
37:36 - so many uh communities online that will
37:38 - give you that chance of like
37:39 - collaborating with people online and
37:41 - then you can showcase that yeah i
37:42 - collaborate with five people online we
37:43 - built these things together we did this
37:45 - thing right so i feel like uh soft
37:47 - skills is one of those things where it's
37:49 - not immediately obvious kind of like
37:50 - when you're going through coursework
37:51 - like oh these are my lessons on python
37:53 - it's not so immediately uh obvious but
37:55 - at the same time i feel like soft skills
37:57 - are everywhere like you just talk to
37:59 - people you're dealing with people you're
38:00 - developing yourself skills so
38:02 - yeah absolutely
38:04 - okay well um i want to leave a few
38:06 - minutes for q a so i'm gonna go check on
38:08 - the chat and see what people are talking
38:10 - about uh let's see if we have any
38:11 - questions
38:13 - for you um
38:16 - let's see somebody was asking how long
38:18 - they should be waiting before they
38:19 - reapply for the same company so uh
38:22 - specifically if they were applying let's
38:23 - let's make that point for a code academy
38:25 - what is that like a good time frame for
38:27 - saying apply didn't get it is it three
38:29 - months is it three months six months
38:32 - yeah is it longer yeah no it depends it
38:34 - depends on the role um i would say
38:36 - anywhere from six months to a year
38:38 - typically um depending upon like how far
38:41 - you got in the interview process you
38:43 - know if you applied to the role um and
38:46 - you know we never got on a phone call
38:47 - for instance whether that was because we
38:49 - just closed the role you know before we
38:50 - were able to speak or
38:52 - um you know we weren't ready to move
38:54 - forward at that point in time i think
38:55 - applying sooner is totally fine as well
38:58 - um you know until you are able to sort
39:00 - of like get on the phone you know with
39:01 - that recruiter or um you know get a more
39:04 - concrete answer as to you know why we're
39:06 - not moving forward um i would say you
39:08 - can kind of gauge the timing that way so
39:11 - uh for example if you know we didn't get
39:13 - on the phone call because you know we
39:15 - felt you weren't qualified for the role
39:17 - or you were lacking some skills um etc
39:19 - you know for what we were looking for
39:20 - then i would say you know six months to
39:22 - a year uh depending upon you know where
39:25 - you were in the process and then i think
39:27 - if you just didn't care from us for some
39:28 - reason because we were closing the role
39:30 - or you know we filled the position you
39:32 - know apply as soon as something reopens
39:35 - um but i think if you you know get
39:37 - anywhere into the process and it's a you
39:39 - know there was a lack of skills i think
39:40 - six months to a year is usually like a
39:42 - good general guideline
39:44 - and and spend that time getting the
39:46 - skills right not just weight like if you
39:48 - didn't get it because of that lack of
39:49 - skills spend those six months learning
39:51 - the skills
39:52 - yeah absolutely he said um i know that a
39:54 - lot of people a lot of companies
39:56 - unfortunately when they get back to you
39:57 - they usually it's like a very simple
39:59 - sort of uh sorry you know there was a
40:01 - lot of candidates who didn't get it yeah
40:04 - is is there like a like a rule of thumb
40:06 - like can you be a little persistent like
40:08 - reach out and be like i would love some
40:09 - feedback on why didn't get this role
40:11 - something like is that totally
40:12 - acceptable like some people feel like
40:13 - maybe that's crossing a line or
40:15 - something can you is that is that fair
40:17 - to ask for for feedback and why you
40:18 - didn't get it or it doesn't depend on
40:20 - how far you got into it yeah yeah i
40:22 - would say it's totally fair to ask for
40:23 - feedback um as far as you know
40:25 - expectations of what you as a candidate
40:28 - can potentially get back you have to be
40:30 - a little bit i think lenient and
40:32 - understanding in that sense i think
40:33 - again no like you know you can always
40:35 - ask for feedback i would say if it's
40:37 - just in an application it is more than
40:39 - likely
40:40 - going to be harder for a recruiter for
40:42 - someone to get back to you very directly
40:44 - um or very quickly about you know why we
40:46 - didn't move forward with the application
40:49 - um you know usually after a phone call
40:52 - um we'll try to provide context or you
40:54 - know after a phone call
40:56 - we may send a slightly more general
40:57 - message and if the candidate follows up
40:59 - for feedback we'll usually try to get
41:01 - back to them as well
41:03 - um but especially after any in-person
41:05 - meetings or after like any take-home
41:07 - evaluations anything like that um we
41:10 - usually offer the opportunity for you
41:13 - know feedback like to get on a call um
41:14 - like after our final round for example
41:17 - so again i think it never hurts to ask
41:18 - right just kind of similarly how it
41:20 - doesn't necessarily hurt to apply to a
41:21 - role that you're not 100 confident um
41:24 - that you might qualify for you know
41:26 - definitely ask but then i think just
41:28 - temper expectations a little bit um you
41:30 - know based on the stage of interview
41:31 - process that you're in
41:33 - okay another question uh when you're
41:35 - looking for your first job should you
41:37 - filter your job search for openings that
41:40 - only say things like junior or
41:41 - internship yeah
41:43 - um it really depends i mean titling is
41:46 - different at every company so you know
41:48 - there's not necessarily a perfect answer
41:50 - because for example
41:51 - you know our um initial software
41:54 - engineering positions are software
41:55 - engineer one so that doesn't have junior
41:57 - in the title anywhere um you know so for
41:59 - you know that might not that might then
42:01 - edge you out of some opportunities as
42:03 - well so i think
42:05 - um
42:06 - so i guess it depends on the company
42:07 - it's like you research the company and
42:09 - if they like to call their junior roles
42:11 - software engineer one then don't search
42:14 - for junior developer right yeah i guess
42:16 - it just comes to the nomenclature or
42:19 - like the keywords that they use yeah
42:21 - yeah there are you know there might be a
42:22 - few key titles that a lot of places use
42:25 - um that as you said uh you know
42:27 - companies can
42:28 - call anything a number of different
42:30 - things to of course they want to try to
42:31 - align with industry standards too um but
42:34 - there's no one perfect thing that you
42:35 - know i can 100 say you know every single
42:38 - company uses so
42:39 - i think um as you said it's a good idea
42:41 - to take a look at you know that company
42:43 - research them um you know see what some
42:45 - of their folks that maybe are a little
42:46 - bit more junior you know call themselves
42:48 - on linkedin and then make searches that
42:50 - way
42:51 - okay and i know this this is probably to
42:53 - a specific question for your role and
42:55 - this seems to be more of a technical
42:57 - interview like uh
42:59 - kind of
43:00 - in the technical interview process
43:01 - sometimes you will interview by
43:02 - engineers that work in a code academy
43:04 - like the company you apply for you
43:06 - talking directly to people that will be
43:07 - your peers or your managers uh so this
43:10 - person is asking if recruiters you often
43:13 - look at an applicant's uh submissions of
43:15 - places like open source places or github
43:18 - repositories and things like this
43:20 - do you know if recruiters specifically
43:23 - look at these kind of submissions or is
43:24 - that like if you're far enough in your
43:26 - application personally somebody will
43:29 - yeah it depends sometimes yes um i would
43:32 - say i think um depending upon you know
43:34 - the amount of hiring that might be going
43:36 - on for example um maybe not but i think
43:38 - especially for like apprentices and
43:40 - things like that for apprenticeships
43:41 - internships um we'll take a look at that
43:44 - as well um or that might be a part of
43:46 - the overall you know application process
43:48 - in general um
43:50 - one thing i can say is for example when
43:53 - we might be looking for candidates for a
43:55 - role um if we're not getting enough
43:57 - folks applying or we do try to
43:59 - proactively just like reach out to
44:01 - candidates as well that might be a fit
44:02 - for positions at times and um
44:05 - we will use you know things like github
44:07 - for example to search for folks too uh
44:10 - based on like the technologies that
44:11 - they're using and their submissions and
44:13 - things like that so it definitely
44:14 - doesn't hurt um you know to have that
44:16 - available um and i think as a part of
44:18 - interview process um you know that's
44:20 - something that a lot of companies look
44:22 - for as well as far as you know what
44:24 - you're doing outside of you know just
44:26 - your nine to five sort of role um to
44:29 - contribute to the overall you know sort
44:30 - of tech space and engineering community
44:32 - in general
44:34 - okay uh this person is asking about
44:36 - technical interviews and they're
44:37 - wondering if technical interviews change
44:39 - depending on the experience showcasing
44:41 - your resume so
44:43 - um
44:44 - i think this is my thought um you can
44:47 - i'm hoping for your answer but i think
44:49 - interviews are usually set for the role
44:52 - not for the candidates so like if you
44:53 - can't this person asking if the
44:55 - technical review interview will change
44:57 - depending on their experience that
44:58 - they're showcasing the resume i think
45:00 - the answer is no
45:02 - no but in a sense right depending upon
45:05 - your experience in the resume that will
45:06 - affect which role you're being
45:07 - considered for right so
45:09 - um in a sense yes but no it is not
45:12 - tailored um directly to each candidate
45:15 - so if we're interviewing candidates for
45:16 - a senior back end role let's say your
45:18 - senior back end engineer
45:20 - if we're going to keep using that
45:21 - example you know every senior back and
45:23 - engineer candidate receives the same
45:24 - technical interview
45:26 - regardless of their experience you know
45:28 - whether that's a little different from
45:29 - someone else's or not
45:31 - they receive the same general interviews
45:33 - across the board
45:35 - okay fair let's see if there's any other
45:37 - questions to wrap this up
45:43 - okay so uh we had a question here say uh
45:47 - are there any underrated tech positions
45:48 - that a candidate should consider to
45:50 - apply for
45:51 - to get their food on the door qa quality
45:54 - assurance testing technical writer
45:57 - how to go about it so have you seen in
45:59 - your experience uh working here at code
46:01 - academy like um any
46:02 - role junior roles that tend to be more
46:06 - first-time friendly
46:08 - first-time friendly first-timer friendly
46:10 - i don't have to say i it's so tough to
46:12 - say i think um not a bad question at all
46:15 - i think um very interesting one you know
46:17 - i've got like broke my way into
46:19 - recruiting by doing something completely
46:20 - different but kind of doing an initial
46:22 - get your foot in the door sort of role
46:24 - um so i i completely understand that um
46:26 - that i think um
46:29 - tough to say i think at cook academy
46:30 - specifically there for example there's
46:32 - not one position i would point to i
46:34 - think
46:35 - um
46:37 - any good company will try to help
46:40 - facilitate you know a transition for you
46:43 - um you know if you come into one role
46:45 - and realize that you would like to you
46:47 - know continue to learn more about
46:49 - another type of opportunity whether
46:50 - that's you know technical or not
46:52 - um you know a good company will help
46:55 - support that transition um of course you
46:57 - have to temper your expectations a
46:58 - little bit you can't just start and be
47:00 - like actually never mind i want to go be
47:01 - an engineer um can you make that happen
47:03 - in the next month no that will that
47:05 - won't happen um but you know for example
47:08 - we have folks uh at codecademy who have
47:10 - made internal transitions since i've
47:11 - been here and we've been able to support
47:13 - those um you know because they've been
47:14 - within their role for you know a certain
47:16 - amount of time and you know they spoke
47:18 - to us whether it's from day one or a
47:20 - year into the role they realized they
47:22 - were really interested in learning more
47:23 - about something else um you know within
47:26 - reason we will try to you know good
47:28 - companies i think will try to help
47:29 - facilitate that type of transition um
47:31 - and that obviously can take some time in
47:33 - terms of making sure that we can
47:35 - you know a company can support the
47:37 - professional development and learning of
47:39 - that person um and help get them
47:41 - exposure to that type of opportunity and
47:43 - then eventually hopefully transition
47:44 - them into that role um you know so i
47:47 - think i think those opportunities can
47:48 - potentially be be anywhere um so it
47:51 - really depends of course if you can get
47:52 - into a role that helps give you some
47:54 - exposure to the type of work you might
47:55 - want to do eventually that's great but i
47:58 - wouldn't necessarily say there's like
47:59 - one particular role
48:00 - and not an academy specifically
48:03 - that's fair i think
48:05 - uh depending on where you're applying
48:06 - for what you're applying for it also you
48:08 - need to learn the keywords that they use
48:10 - like for example you talk about software
48:11 - engineer one versus junior software
48:13 - developer or keywords like that i know
48:15 - that for data particularly it's also you
48:18 - also need to learn the different sort of
48:20 - like ladder the the the wrongs in the
48:22 - ladder because there's a difference
48:24 - between a data analyst being a data
48:27 - scientist i mean uh like there's all
48:29 - these keywords that you can use and they
48:31 - mean different things yeah so i'm not
48:33 - sure that the person asking this
48:34 - question will
48:35 - meant it that way but i would definitely
48:38 - research what the role you're applying
48:40 - for is and what the typical names are
48:42 - for a junior role in that that would be
48:44 - more like you know like everybody knows
48:45 - that internship means low level like
48:47 - it's just it's what it means so
48:49 - uh so i would just yeah uh research your
48:51 - role and what is
48:53 - typically the nomenclature i guess i
48:55 - like the name for it
48:56 - okay well we've been talking here for a
48:58 - while uh madison thank you so much for
49:00 - spending some time with us and the
49:01 - community here i'm sure that a lot of
49:03 - people have learned a lot and i know
49:05 - that there will be a lot more questions
49:06 - so we just kept going all day but uh you
49:08 - know we have to stop at some point um

Cleaned transcript:

fine uh click great okay so we are live on youtube thank you everybody for stopping by in our episode number three of interview tips live streams that we're doing at code academy community trying to bring you the best tips and advice from recruiters about getting jobs in tech your first job and all kinds of help that you might need when you're working on your resume on your cover letter things to know about the phone interviews the technical interviews and any other questions that you might have today our guest is madison madison you want to introduce yourself yeah of course hey everybody um i am madison i'm a manager of technical recruiting here at codecademy so what that means is i lead a team of folks a few that have been on previous live streams included uh responsible for hiring all of codecademy's technical roles uh prior to codecademy um i worked in both recruiting and people ops positions across companies in tech media and advertising spaces so breadth of experience across different industries hiring for various roles yeah seems like you've definitely been around quite a bit um you you um how how does recruiting compared to uh like all the places that you've been like all the roles you've done you like it yeah recruiting um in general yeah no i i enjoy it it's a lot of fun um very i think uh our vp of people calls it like very much like a roller coaster you know because it kind of is like oh are we gonna we're gonna hire these candidates today et cetera et cetera just put it very lightly um so it can be a lot of fun and i really enjoy building relationships with people too so like getting people really excited about where they're going to work i just think it's super fun and um you know that's why i've always been you know internal at a company so like being able to you know help build teams uh at codecademy that build things that like not only they care about but i care about too it's just it's a lot of fun you know it's one of those things uh we keep repeating to our learners is that recruiters are also people like sometimes you're so stressed out you're so you know that you're so caught up in the moment like i'm applying for this job are they gonna ask of me technical questions soft skill questions you know the typical like tell me one time where you had a problem how you fix this sort of thing uh yeah so we always try to remind our learners that when you're applying for a job there's somebody on the other side yeah they you know they want you to succeed too like the fact that they have an open role means that they want somebody to join the team so just keep that in mind that you know it doesn't have to be an antagonistic serious um sort of situation where you against them that's always a thing so i'm glad that you said that you know you really enjoy it and it's like very exciting because it is um it can be very exciting so let's just jump into uh what everybody is here for which is like some advice on applying for jobs and you know getting into tech uh do you have any just to get you started uh any sort of general guidance on let's say you are a developer selftaught and you are applying for your first role what are some of the things that people should be considering when they are applying for these jobs yeah yeah i think you know you could take that in a whole bunch of different directions as far as you know some basic you know do's and don'ts or just key things to consider i think when you're applying for roles is you know definitely research the companies that you're applying for at least a little bit i think especially when you're earlier on in your career right super helpful i think to try to get as deep of an understanding of a company and what they do as you can based on the information that's out there um there are a lot of different places you can go to try to look for you know more information on the company whether that's on glassdoor or just simple google searches right another tool that we use is builtin nyc um builtin i believe also just went national so um they you know have information about companies and content around companies all over the place as well so there's a lot of different you know different tools you can use to try to find more information about a company and then also i think also try to find the company values and and think about that and see how that aligns maybe with your own values as well um codecademy for instance we have our company values on our careers page and so i always you know get really excited when a candidate talks to me about you know the values on the careers page that they came across and how that relates to you know what they're trying to do and where they want to go next with their careers and everything like that so definitely recommend you know trying to dig a bit deeper there um and then you know i think of course you know continue to dig into the job descriptions um you know continue to dig into your own resume as well um you know i think you should be able to use a fairly consistent resume across the board but you know if you notice within a job description or within something a company is doing um you know and they might be looking for some experience that you could maybe highlight a little bit more on your resume um that's not a bad idea as well to maybe like amp that up a little bit too trying to imagine myself in the position of um uh first time applicant especially if they don't have uh any you know any tech experience where maybe there are career switchers or the first time you do tech when you talk about researching companies and they and the values um i know there's like a hard balance between finding a good place and just finding a place that will give you a shot um how do you see do you see like that tension happen a lot like do you have any any thoughts on like well you you want to be somewhat picky in where you wanna you wanna make sure that you're gonna have the right mentors you're gonna have the right place to grow as a person but at the same time a lot of people are saying look i'm applying for 100 different places yeah i just need i just need someone to give me a shot so is it like like a balance is this something that people can be thinking about or like any way approaching this problem it doesn't seem to have a solution yeah yeah i don't i don't think there's an easy solution to that one right because of course of course you want to find the place not just a place um and i think that's a great mindset to have in that sense you should definitely be picky but also you know a place you know a company that you might not think initially would be the place uh you know it might just be a place could potentially be the place you know if you're asking the right questions i can find out more information about how you might be able to grow there or you know how the teams work well together or what the mission you know two years down the line at a company might be and that might get you more excited about that too i think you know i think it's it's it's yeah it's a bit hard i think especially earlier on it's good to maybe cast a little bit of a wider net because it's also a lot of like you don't know don't know sometimes too right and so you might uh before like come across something that you didn't realize you would actually be kind of more excited about and it's also okay to recognize that even if you might not do something you are the most excited about initially you can definitely find a way to you know learn things that will be valuable to you in your next role um you know and that maybe end up at the place the next time as well so i think as long as you're thinking about what you're going to be able to learn from that job and how you're going to be able to grow uh even if it's not like the premier company you want to work for still a super valuable experience so i think you can you can continue to guide your career in the ways that you want to that way awesome so what i'm hearing is that sometimes having a bit more of a medium term or longterm approach to your career it helps basically saying maybe shortterm you think this is not the place that you thought you would be but if you think about longlonger term like you know accumulate experience add that to your resume you know you will always have like i guess kind of like put things in perspective a bit uh you also touched on researching the company before you apply for has a good point to do when you're applying for jobs how much weight should a candidate put into places like glassdoor like you know you look at the reviews and people are saying like i was here it was a bad experience or like i did this interview or they asked me these questions totally out of place is there is that something to be aware of like beware like okay yeah they're valuable but put it in context yeah yeah no i think uh they are definitely valuable resources but i think you have to be a little cautious as well i think i don't think you can take everything at face value glassdoor you know is essentially right like the yelp of of reviewing companies um and so you know you're going to get better or worse reviews whether they're accurate and accurate um obviously not everything is going to be inaccurate so i'm not trying to say that but um you know definitely be cautious and it and you know feel confident and the fact that you should be able to ask questions throughout your interview process too so even if you're still wanting to move forward with the company even after maybe you've heard things that you don't necessarily love or a little you know you know i think maybe might be a little discouraging um at least initially i think you know just make sure you're asking those questions to address those concerns because you know potentially a review from even just a few months ago uh you know it could could have already been addressed internally and adjustments might have been made and you know they can address how they're working to adjust those types of concerns or improve processes or whatever the case might be um you know wherever your concerns might be with those reviews so i think um definitely encourage candidates to not get totally turned off by things like glassdoor necessarily but you know use that as a part of their process when they're trying to figure out if this is really the best place for them so definitely don't hesitate to ask those questions that sounds like a really good idea it's not don't don't use that as a reason not to apply but do keep it in mind maybe during the the application process where the recruiter says do you have any questions for me maybe that's the moment to say well you know i wanted to address this concern or i wanted to learn more about this particular that's that's a really good point um is there like um like an etiquette when it comes to uh we're talking about researching companies if you find if you go to linkedin or twitter like maybe you find some of the recruiters or some of the people of the company like is there an educator like how far can you connect with these people before it sort of becomes maybe crossing the line or becoming inappropriate like how much research can you do or how much connection can you do with a company before you should worry about it like before it becomes a red flag yeah right right right um no because there's there's definitely a bit of a line right and i you know encourage folks who have mutual connections especially like if you didn't realize someone you went to uh high school with or whatever the case might be or you know just someone that might be in your network um works at the company definitely encourage you to reach out to them via linkedin or you know if you're if you're that close to them shoot them an email or whatever the case might be um and see if they have time to connect or you know refer you to the right person um you know we see candidates who will reach out to folks within the department you know that they're interested in applying for um and so on which is okay but i think um you know the biggest thing to keep in mind is that you know folks of course you know have a lot going on at any point in time whether that's work personal etc so it might be professional or personal reasons that they might not be able to get back to you so i think as long as you're understanding of folks who might not be able to you know either follow up as immediately as you might hope for or you know take the time to connect on the phone um you know i think then you're then you're okay um because we've seen some candidates who you know have kind of crossed the line and become a little more you know don't understand you know why you won't get on the phone with me etc um when they're interested in learning about opportunities and while we absolutely love you know the engagement and you know someone being so excited about an opportunity you know it's just not possible all the time unfortunately and again that could be due to personal reasons as well you know maybe they're just not available um for a reason so i think just keeping that in mind um you know the same way we don't want to waste a candidate's time ever um you know we want to make sure we're staying up to date with candidates as much as we can and getting them feedback as well um you know we have to be respectful of time both ways so i think you know gentle reach outs to folks that work at the company in the department that you work with or other mutual connections if you see someone is connected with someone you know um you know trying to see if you can get an introduction i think those are all great ways to go hmm yeah i i know that uh sometimes that eagerness can translate into annoyance or uh this it's a fine line between trying to just show that you are interested in the role and saying you know i really uh i'm motivated for this or like i really want this uh there's a fine line between that and just just getting in people's nerves basically you're like becoming more of a nuisance i guess a little bit so um everybody wants to get back to everybody all the time you know and you know i think it's just again just you know thinking about it both ways and just trying to you know be respectful and then that's all you can do but you know i think a candidate who is super engaged and you know very excited about an opportunity is great and as long as we're communicating well in that way then you know there's no harm no foul okay and uh thinking about uh newer newcomers applying for jobs is just in general um is there like is there a rule i know that i've heard different versions of this but uh when you're applying for jobs sometimes especially if you don't have any prior experience you might find yourself not checking all the boxes in a job description um what do you think that is like an appropriate ratio of like let's say okay they asked for eight things i know five five out of eight seems like a first shot is there like a like a typical number where recruiters might look at an applicant and say like from the recruiter's perspective you you get i know i talked to harlan i talked to other teammates at her meet uh and they said they said you know we only have so much time to look at resume so we get so many and there's a big volume so what do you think that there's like a fair line between applying for something and definitely not being qualified for it or saying this could be enough that a recruiter on the other side is going to look at and say okay yeah yeah and it can go up and down right you know it sounds like as harlan you might have said uh you know sometimes you're you know you have more or less time or sometimes positions are getting more applications versus not you know and so then you know you might be able to take a little bit more time um to review you know more and more applications or you know dive a little bit deeper um so there's no perfect answer or perfect guess of whether or not i think you know if someone is actually going to be able to reach out and connect with you on the phone um but i think you know give yourself you know some room right you know i think as you were saying right there's not necessarily a perfect number but i think one way to go right is um when you a lot of job descriptions are separated into like musthaves and then nice to haves and so if you look at you know some of the key things in those musthaves like maybe the top few bullet points that are in those musthaves of like musthave x type of experience um if you meet some of those and then especially if you meet some of those nice to haves but maybe not all of the musthaves as well that can you can kind of think of that as maybe supplementing a little bit where a recruiter maybe would be more inclined to say like oh you know they're missing on one or two of these things but then they have these other things that make them really applicable for this job as well so like let's connect and you know try to dive a bit deeper into the experience so i think you know it yeah i think you know it definitely it doesn't hurt to to apply right i think uh you know what i hate seeing candidates get tripped up on and um something that is super prevalent you know throughout you know i think the tech industry and beyond is you know when you see a position that has like we're looking for four or five plus years of experience or something say for like a more senior level role and someone only has three and then they still don't apply you know i think if you're missing on one to two years unless it's you know a senior role and you're just in you're just starting out you know so if you are trying to look for your first engineering role for example if it's a senior engineering role that's looking for four or five plus years of experience then maybe that's not going to be a fit since it's your first role that you're looking for as an engineer but once you're more at a senior level you know if don't take like the just hard line years of experience so to heart that it you know prevents you from applying um because you see that with different types of candidates all the time so i would say that's one where you can you know i think feel a little bit more comfortable at least you know shooting somebody in that respect i think what somebody told me once a few months ago i was talking about this somebody else and they said let them be the ones that say no don't self uh select yourself out and it was sort of like if there is a gray area where you're not sure like you were saying like if you have three years of experience and then looking for somebody with four or five if you are sort of like not sure it's better that they are the ones saying no then you say no to yourself yeah is that fair yeah i think that's a great way to think about it as long as you know yeah let them say no and even if they say no right now in six more months another year you know it could be an absolute yes right so um definitely encourage i love seeing folks who reapply you know after a certain amount of time as well and it's just very exciting to see that you know kind of come through and i'm like oh they've applied to us last year and like oh that's great they've grown in their experience let's talk to them and get them on the phone um so i definitely agree definitely don't select yourself out of the process you know give yourself that opportunity because otherwise you're not going to know either way so might as well try to and i think this uh this is a great point to switch gears into the don dues and the first one that comes to mind is how often can you apply for a role before it becomes sort of like bad like let's say for example that code academy is hiring five different senior engineers should you apply for all five roles or are you or should candidates understand that companies the recruiters own companies like if they think that you're a better fit for a different role like you just apply for one and they will direct you to the right one like how does that work yeah no that's a good question um and a lot of companies think about this differently and i've experienced that throughout my career as well um how folks think about this when folks apply to different roles i think one of the biggest things is not applying to roles that are completely different you know so we've had people apply for just like a role in our marketing team and then a role on the data team and then you know a role in engineering and it just it none of it kind of fits well together you know i think um the example you pointed to is an interesting one in terms of like if we have five senior backend engineer roles open which i think we have a close close to that number right now um for example and you know they're on just different teams i think in that respect you know if the requirements are pretty similar in that respect i do think it's okay um you know to apply to to multiple roles in that respect because you're essentially applying for you know a senior backend engineer role and it can be helpful to potentially get your resume seen a bit more because you might have different recruiters working on different roles and so that way you know you might have more of a likelihood of being seen that way um but otherwise i would say usually try to stick to one but i think if it's similar types of roles that way it is okay to apply to both but again it's tough to say um because companies do think about it differently i've worked at a company before over there like if they apply for more than one role we don't even want to talk to them because then they don't they do and i was like okay that seems a bit harsh um but you know that was that was the way they were operating um at that point in time so um you know we handled things a little differently on iron but you know i think there's no perfect answer so again i think if you're applying to a similar type of role um like back end engineer for instance then i think it you shouldn't necessarily be putting yourself in danger if you apply for multiple teams yeah because i imagine that uh when you are applying for jobs you might become you might be concerned that um they're gonna think of you like hey this person is applying for so many roles at once uh and usually when you you want candidates that are strong at the role that they're applying for so if you apply like you said for multiple roles you might come across as you are not good at any of them right right like a little maybe that you it just comes a little like dissolved i guess or like diluted it's just like you value dilutes a little bit when you apply for multiple roles and i know that uh so i mean some especially for junior roles sometimes people are concerned that if they apply even when their roles are similar it's one like you said if you apply for more than one maybe they will disqualify you right right off the bat and number two they're concerned that they built some sort of rapport with the uh with the company where they're like well this person just applied for anything so you know like they just dropped five five copies of the resume here whatever so i know that's a valid concern for some people that just feel like yeah all right they don't want to seem too desperate but they do want to increase their chances of getting higher yeah yeah that's why i think if you're applying for you know a similar backend engineer role right it can make sense to kind of you know socialize your resume a little bit more in that way but um when they are quite different types of roles or with roles with very different focuses um i think that's when folks might start to question too like do you have an understanding of what you're looking for out of your next role um and then that and that can be a little bit that can raise some flags for folks sometimes um because i think you don't have to know exactly where you want to end up in five ten et cetera years right um and also you can say what you want now and that can always change too um but i think you know when you're applying for such different roles it makes people question again like is are they going to be happy in this role you know and what they're looking for a question um you know i always ask and most recruiters will ask on their initial phone calls with you is you know what are you looking for out of your next role what is most important for you in regards to where you're going next like whether that is compensation whether that's you know a missiondriven organization a team you know that works super crossfunctionally you want a role that has a lot of autonomy or whatever the case might be you know having just that sort of understanding so if you are applying for two just very different roles you know then it might you know it might those types of things might not align um for folks that you're speaking to in your process definitely valid um do you have any other like big domes like general like just just in general like if you're applying for a role it might be a junior role might be a more serial is it any sort of like very i would say not obvious but it's things that are just like across the board avoidable that will diminish your chances of getting a job yeah yeah i think something that is coming to mind a lot is uh you know especially once you're speaking with with a company um not you know completely disparaging your current or previous company um especially as you're speaking to past experiences um you know if someone is like why are you looking to leave your current role and you're like i hate my manager you know the company is just a nightmare it's a mess you know you definitely want to avoid things like that you know talk that really even if you your com your company is terrible or something like that whatever that might mean you know you just want to avoid phrasing it that way and talk about how like maybe you know right now you know you're experiencing you know being a little bit micromanaged and you prefer to have a lot more autonomy in a role you know talking to like how you know you want to continue growing in a next role versus kind of hating on um or throwing too much shade at your current or former employer yeah definitely that's something to avoid for sure because the big the big the big thing to do right is to talk about your experience what you've learned you know how you've you know adjusted or made improvements moving forward and like how you'll apply that as you continue to grow within your career as well rather than just kind of focusing on the very direct things that you haven't liked about something um so that's definitely one big thing uh that i think is just a nono across the board regardless of how junior senior you might be it really sounds to me like um basically the rule of thumb is you should be focusing on yourself so when somebody asks why are you leaving your old role like why are you changing companies instead of disparaging your own company and talking about them you should be talking about you like well i try to achieve this i'm trying to change this i try to tackle new problems i'm trying to find new mentors or new right like it's sort of like you you want to always phrase it in the context of you the candidate and not so much in everybody else right right right yeah i think you know focusing exactly as you said you know on yourself um and your continued growth i think is where you want to be of course it's good to acknowledge you know the team etc in terms of like being you know at codecademy one of our values is we win as a team right so of course you want to think about things that way as you continue to grow but it is in regards to what you are looking for right so people will usually say like yes i'm looking for a missiondriven organization i'm looking to work with new technologies to work on new problems and i'm really just looking for a team that i get along with and you know like want to collaborate with and a team that really you know you know has this type of environment etc um you know i think again even though you know you can still hint at things that are team related it is still focused on what you as a candidate are looking for versus like saying why something else is bad that's nice um it's coming to mind because i think that they don't so don't do this or don't do that in the com when you're applying for jobs it seems that a lot of people uh when they're applying for for roles they they will try to how to put it they i'm not like not embellishing but sometimes you know you're trying to sell yourself and it seems like there's a bit of a give like a wiggle room and how you you can showcase your strengths while minimizing your your weaknesses i guess so um have you had in the past in your experience um anyone that maybe has taken it too far like is there is there a point where you're saying like this is not even going to help you anymore like you don't need to do this um is it is it like is there any sort of like don't do this uh for example you rush me like should you you know i'm just trying to think like journals don't forget yeah general in terms of you know over embellishing or you know yeah you know hiding your experience a bit too much um i think that and let me know if this isn't getting at the heart of the question but i think in terms of your resume and you know how you speak to your experience folks will interviewers are usually able to tell you know when something is kind of like you know where they're getting question marks about you know did you do did you do this or did your team do this or what you know you need to very much be able to speak to the part that you played in that experience um you know where you know you can very clearly talk about you know what you accomplished in previous roles um you know discussing the projects specifically that you worked on and being able to deep dive into that quite a bit um obviously you know if you're a very senior engineer let's say you know talking about a project you worked on 10 years ago maybe you don't remember all of the key details but with an experience or two or in your current role you know being able to speak to what your role was you know within uh the work that you did or projects you worked on you know what resources you had um you know what kind of impact project had and who you worked with and talking about you know what that team structure looked like and you know being able to speak to you know your working style or how you iterated on a project et cetera et cetera really being able to like drill down into the details quite a bit um i think uh you know if you get to the place where you're not able to do that you're kind of like yeah i did this thing and someone asks you how you did the thing and you can't really talk you can't really speak to how you did the thing or how you you know iterated or you know improved on the thing or you know who you worked with as a part of doing that thing um then you're going to be i think talking about your experience a little bit too much yeah that's that's fair i think i mean people can tell i think especially recruiters i mean i think it's important for our learners watching this uh to remember that recruiters are professionals that are doing this for a living like you there is you're not the first can and they're they're going they know what they're doing so it's a lot better to be honest yeah and that's going to get you further that's going to get you far more than trying to right work right and i think the key thing to remember too is it is totally okay to admit what you don't know um you know in fact that's that's one of the biggest don'ts that i see sometimes too is folks you know kind of make something up or try to skirt around and answer um you know of course you don't want to just say i don't know and you know in that period yeah you don't want to say that um you could say you know i actually haven't had experience with this before um but you know in a situational sense here's what i think i might do but you know this is also i want to recognize that this is an area of growth for me um or you know this is what i've experienced second hand so far you know you can admit what you don't know um you know i think that's it that's a that's a big strength for someone if they you know admit what they don't know or it are able to like talk about a mistake that they've had it's all about where you go from there right um acknowledging any growth areas or ways you've improved in the past and things like that is like in my opinion and most of the folks i've worked with in interview processes a big thumbs up um you know from everyone yeah i think that people have to get a bit more confidence in their skills like i mean if you got to the phone interview like if you got to the first hurdle like if you submitted your resume and somebody said this is good enough that i want to talk to them like pat yourself in the back just be like okay there must be something there i'm i'm a strong like i have to be a strong enough candidate that they're willing to to talk to me so so you know like sometimes it's like there's no need to to like do anything strap again or to try to push it too far you already passed that sort of like check right like yeah you already showed that yeah so i think uh you know some people just just like yeah put it all in context um before we finish i wanted to also ask you we touched this in the beginning um some of the resources that our learners can use to prep for interviews or to prepare in general for interviewing i know that uh there's a lot that goes into this so this typically for a tech company there might be a phone interview there might be like a some sort of screen that might be technical interviews and behind it you might be talking to future peers or senior or managers that you might be you might have to have some takehome exams or whiteboarding interviews depending on interviews so so there's a lot of moving pieces and all throughout the process you're having to showcase your skills and you need to be able you need to like all these things so besides uh we already mentioned glassdoor do you have any other resources that people should be utilizing more that you see that you maybe feel that they are underutilized when candidates are applying for jobs like for example we talked about researching uh is is researching on twitter or linkedin like a strong thing to do yeah yeah no i i think yeah utilizing all of those different channels like twitter linkedin etc but again i would say you know especially if it's comments kind of like glassdoor right you know you can't rely on you know what everyone else might be saying so a lot of stuff on twitter right is a lot of opinion or you know various different types of content pieces so i think you know don't necessarily take it just at face value um i think you know other good things to keep in mind outside of just resources and researching the company is you know as you get through uh parts of the interview process not being able you know or excuse me not being afraid to make sure you understand who you're gonna be meeting with so if a recruiter like ever doesn't you know give you the schedule of folks that you're meeting with um they're just like hey we're you're meeting at this time for three hours like see you there you know definitely ask them who you're meeting with um you know if possible ideally they'll provide you with linkedin information so you can like research a little bit about who you're meeting with um obviously you don't need to go down a whole rabbit hole of finding out every piece of information about your interviewers um but it's just helpful i think it makes it humanizes the experience a little bit more of you know being able to understand a little bit more about uh your interviewer's journey and how they got there and things like to you know got to you know let's say codecademy for example um and and all of that good stuff and i think um thinking about that not being able you're excuse me not being afraid to you know ask your recruiters if they can like hop on a call before a final round interview to chat about what you can expect and answer any other questions you might have i think yeah not hesitating to ask questions to your recruiter or in your interviews especially as you go through the process definitely you know prepare questions that you might have or you know that you might have time to ask throughout your interview process i think that is also a really great way to learn about the company um i definitely enjoy when candidates even very early on in the process have you know a certain amount of questions um or you know can we can get through a certain amount of questions within a certain amount of time um you know as long as i have time i'm always happy to you know hot like stay on a phone call longer with the candidate to answer questions because it's really invigorating for me too personally i feel when a candidate is like tell me more about code county like why you really enjoy being there what brought you there or you know what's been one of the biggest struggles that you've had you know at co academy or elsewhere et cetera you know things like that i mean doing that in person sort of research is is definitely a great way uh great way to learn about the company um but also i think you know using you know searching for depending on what types of interviews you're doing too throughout the process i think um you know trying to find those resources as far as what you can ask like if someone's doing a behavioral interview um you know understanding i think how you know what types of questions might be asked and you know how to respond to those again i think taking the approach of you know being able to really deep dive into your experience so far with whether how limited or vast that is um and just being able to you know as confidently as you can speak to what you've done the parts that you played how you've improved what you've learned et cetera um you know it's definitely you know one of the best ways to prepare yourself for any interview process all right um this is a closing question that i have um a lot of our learners especially like we keep coming back to the ones that are trying to get the first job and very junior roles i've heard in the past from some of our teammates that they know okay i accept that you're you're applying for a junior role so there's some leeway or there's some some concessions that are given so in terms of your experience or your work experience or what you've achieved because obviously this is going to be your first role uh so um i know that a lot of people get nervous about the soft skills part they were like they're gonna ask me how i work in teams they're going to ask me if how i solve problems in teams or how i communicate my communication skills and some people put in their resume it's almost like a gimmick like on the side of the rest we might say skills and says teamwork communications i don't even know what that means right so do you have any thoughts on on the whole soft skills area of interviewing and going through that interview process where people don't know how to showcase they know how to practice them they don't know what to get them they know what to do with them uh have you seen like in your in your in the past like this struggle and like do you have any any advice yeah how about this yeah absolutely no i think that's a great question um and a great thing for for folks to think about especially earlier on in their careers too um one thing that's coming to mind is you know don't hesitate to utilize experience that you think might not be relevant for these types of questions for example you know especially you know if you're a career changer right um and you're moving into software engineering when someone might ask you about like can you give me an example of a time you worked in a team um you know for a project whatever the case might be that does not have to be necessarily you know an engineering project that can be from you know like something that's coming to mind for me you know before i went into recruiting i worked in hospitality i worked in retail et cetera you know and so moving into the recruiting space for the first time you know i didn't have that experience and that's okay but there are other ways to think about you know similar soft skills and how that translates to any type of position um so when you're thinking about those soft skills type questions about you know can you tell me you know about your collaboration skills things like that that would probably wouldn't be the question but um that's what i'm going to do with your skills if you need to tell yourself skills not so much that wouldn't be the question but you know one one big question that comes to mind is like can you tell me about a time you made a mistake you know as a junior engineer you're like struggling to you know struggling to come up with like oh when did i make a mistake in terms of like you know engineering or how that might you know you know play into the role here you know talk about something else you know there are tons of other experiences that you most likely have whether they're you know inside engineering or tech or not um you know because again soft skills are apply anywhere not necessarily just to this specific role um so of course if you have an example that's relevant to this specific role use that but if you don't um you know it's not like where you a part of you know your background of what you've been in previously you know bring it from elsewhere like talk about the job that you had in high school or you know you know something that you learned at a club um that that you know that you were a part of um at any point in your life um you know for example or you know just whatever the case might be you know it's not usually too much of a reach um to think about it that way so even if you don't haven't had a role within engineering previously pull from previous experiences because again as you're saying it's more about you know the ability to do these things rather than the experience you know depending upon you know what role you might be interviewing for yeah i know that i tell people all the time if you don't have do your research right like what kind of things you need for your role and then once you've done your homework and you know what you need if you don't have it you can get it like especially now with so many online communities and so many online opportunities uh if you feel like oh i don't have a good example of being working on a team or leading a team develop your skills online find and there's so many uh communities online that will give you that chance of like collaborating with people online and then you can showcase that yeah i collaborate with five people online we built these things together we did this thing right so i feel like uh soft skills is one of those things where it's not immediately obvious kind of like when you're going through coursework like oh these are my lessons on python it's not so immediately uh obvious but at the same time i feel like soft skills are everywhere like you just talk to people you're dealing with people you're developing yourself skills so yeah absolutely okay well um i want to leave a few minutes for q a so i'm gonna go check on the chat and see what people are talking about uh let's see if we have any questions for you um let's see somebody was asking how long they should be waiting before they reapply for the same company so uh specifically if they were applying let's let's make that point for a code academy what is that like a good time frame for saying apply didn't get it is it three months is it three months six months yeah is it longer yeah no it depends it depends on the role um i would say anywhere from six months to a year typically um depending upon like how far you got in the interview process you know if you applied to the role um and you know we never got on a phone call for instance whether that was because we just closed the role you know before we were able to speak or um you know we weren't ready to move forward at that point in time i think applying sooner is totally fine as well um you know until you are able to sort of like get on the phone you know with that recruiter or um you know get a more concrete answer as to you know why we're not moving forward um i would say you can kind of gauge the timing that way so uh for example if you know we didn't get on the phone call because you know we felt you weren't qualified for the role or you were lacking some skills um etc you know for what we were looking for then i would say you know six months to a year uh depending upon you know where you were in the process and then i think if you just didn't care from us for some reason because we were closing the role or you know we filled the position you know apply as soon as something reopens um but i think if you you know get anywhere into the process and it's a you know there was a lack of skills i think six months to a year is usually like a good general guideline and and spend that time getting the skills right not just weight like if you didn't get it because of that lack of skills spend those six months learning the skills yeah absolutely he said um i know that a lot of people a lot of companies unfortunately when they get back to you they usually it's like a very simple sort of uh sorry you know there was a lot of candidates who didn't get it yeah is is there like a like a rule of thumb like can you be a little persistent like reach out and be like i would love some feedback on why didn't get this role something like is that totally acceptable like some people feel like maybe that's crossing a line or something can you is that is that fair to ask for for feedback and why you didn't get it or it doesn't depend on how far you got into it yeah yeah i would say it's totally fair to ask for feedback um as far as you know expectations of what you as a candidate can potentially get back you have to be a little bit i think lenient and understanding in that sense i think again no like you know you can always ask for feedback i would say if it's just in an application it is more than likely going to be harder for a recruiter for someone to get back to you very directly um or very quickly about you know why we didn't move forward with the application um you know usually after a phone call um we'll try to provide context or you know after a phone call we may send a slightly more general message and if the candidate follows up for feedback we'll usually try to get back to them as well um but especially after any inperson meetings or after like any takehome evaluations anything like that um we usually offer the opportunity for you know feedback like to get on a call um like after our final round for example so again i think it never hurts to ask right just kind of similarly how it doesn't necessarily hurt to apply to a role that you're not 100 confident um that you might qualify for you know definitely ask but then i think just temper expectations a little bit um you know based on the stage of interview process that you're in okay another question uh when you're looking for your first job should you filter your job search for openings that only say things like junior or internship yeah um it really depends i mean titling is different at every company so you know there's not necessarily a perfect answer because for example you know our um initial software engineering positions are software engineer one so that doesn't have junior in the title anywhere um you know so for you know that might not that might then edge you out of some opportunities as well so i think um so i guess it depends on the company it's like you research the company and if they like to call their junior roles software engineer one then don't search for junior developer right yeah i guess it just comes to the nomenclature or like the keywords that they use yeah yeah there are you know there might be a few key titles that a lot of places use um that as you said uh you know companies can call anything a number of different things to of course they want to try to align with industry standards too um but there's no one perfect thing that you know i can 100 say you know every single company uses so i think um as you said it's a good idea to take a look at you know that company research them um you know see what some of their folks that maybe are a little bit more junior you know call themselves on linkedin and then make searches that way okay and i know this this is probably to a specific question for your role and this seems to be more of a technical interview like uh kind of in the technical interview process sometimes you will interview by engineers that work in a code academy like the company you apply for you talking directly to people that will be your peers or your managers uh so this person is asking if recruiters you often look at an applicant's uh submissions of places like open source places or github repositories and things like this do you know if recruiters specifically look at these kind of submissions or is that like if you're far enough in your application personally somebody will yeah it depends sometimes yes um i would say i think um depending upon you know the amount of hiring that might be going on for example um maybe not but i think especially for like apprentices and things like that for apprenticeships internships um we'll take a look at that as well um or that might be a part of the overall you know application process in general um one thing i can say is for example when we might be looking for candidates for a role um if we're not getting enough folks applying or we do try to proactively just like reach out to candidates as well that might be a fit for positions at times and um we will use you know things like github for example to search for folks too uh based on like the technologies that they're using and their submissions and things like that so it definitely doesn't hurt um you know to have that available um and i think as a part of interview process um you know that's something that a lot of companies look for as well as far as you know what you're doing outside of you know just your nine to five sort of role um to contribute to the overall you know sort of tech space and engineering community in general okay uh this person is asking about technical interviews and they're wondering if technical interviews change depending on the experience showcasing your resume so um i think this is my thought um you can i'm hoping for your answer but i think interviews are usually set for the role not for the candidates so like if you can't this person asking if the technical review interview will change depending on their experience that they're showcasing the resume i think the answer is no no but in a sense right depending upon your experience in the resume that will affect which role you're being considered for right so um in a sense yes but no it is not tailored um directly to each candidate so if we're interviewing candidates for a senior back end role let's say your senior back end engineer if we're going to keep using that example you know every senior back and engineer candidate receives the same technical interview regardless of their experience you know whether that's a little different from someone else's or not they receive the same general interviews across the board okay fair let's see if there's any other questions to wrap this up okay so uh we had a question here say uh are there any underrated tech positions that a candidate should consider to apply for to get their food on the door qa quality assurance testing technical writer how to go about it so have you seen in your experience uh working here at code academy like um any role junior roles that tend to be more firsttime friendly firsttime friendly firsttimer friendly i don't have to say i it's so tough to say i think um not a bad question at all i think um very interesting one you know i've got like broke my way into recruiting by doing something completely different but kind of doing an initial get your foot in the door sort of role um so i i completely understand that um that i think um tough to say i think at cook academy specifically there for example there's not one position i would point to i think um any good company will try to help facilitate you know a transition for you um you know if you come into one role and realize that you would like to you know continue to learn more about another type of opportunity whether that's you know technical or not um you know a good company will help support that transition um of course you have to temper your expectations a little bit you can't just start and be like actually never mind i want to go be an engineer um can you make that happen in the next month no that will that won't happen um but you know for example we have folks uh at codecademy who have made internal transitions since i've been here and we've been able to support those um you know because they've been within their role for you know a certain amount of time and you know they spoke to us whether it's from day one or a year into the role they realized they were really interested in learning more about something else um you know within reason we will try to you know good companies i think will try to help facilitate that type of transition um and that obviously can take some time in terms of making sure that we can you know a company can support the professional development and learning of that person um and help get them exposure to that type of opportunity and then eventually hopefully transition them into that role um you know so i think i think those opportunities can potentially be be anywhere um so it really depends of course if you can get into a role that helps give you some exposure to the type of work you might want to do eventually that's great but i wouldn't necessarily say there's like one particular role and not an academy specifically that's fair i think uh depending on where you're applying for what you're applying for it also you need to learn the keywords that they use like for example you talk about software engineer one versus junior software developer or keywords like that i know that for data particularly it's also you also need to learn the different sort of like ladder the the the wrongs in the ladder because there's a difference between a data analyst being a data scientist i mean uh like there's all these keywords that you can use and they mean different things yeah so i'm not sure that the person asking this question will meant it that way but i would definitely research what the role you're applying for is and what the typical names are for a junior role in that that would be more like you know like everybody knows that internship means low level like it's just it's what it means so uh so i would just yeah uh research your role and what is typically the nomenclature i guess i like the name for it okay well we've been talking here for a while uh madison thank you so much for spending some time with us and the community here i'm sure that a lot of people have learned a lot and i know that there will be a lot more questions so we just kept going all day but uh you know we have to stop at some point um thank you for being here live with us today yeah no thank you so much thank you so much everyone for for dropping by it's great virtually with you yeah and uh reminder that we're doing this every week and we'll have another recruiter on next monday as well so check out the past videos if you haven't seen them yet and we'll see you next week everybody thank you and have a great week and that's the
