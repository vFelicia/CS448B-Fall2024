00:00 - here are three Java projects you can
00:01 - build this week that will look awesome
00:03 - in your portfolio first you can build a
00:05 - code snippet manager basically a place
00:07 - where you and other devs can store your
00:09 - code snippet so they're easy to reuse
00:11 - you'll practice working with databases
00:12 - and implementing search and category
00:14 - functions another idea is to build a
00:16 - playlist generator something that lets
00:18 - people create customized playlists based
00:20 - on their moods or interest and
00:22 - recommends them new songs this is a
00:24 - great way to practice integrating apis
00:26 - like spotifi or titles and then lastly
00:29 - you can build a car loan payments
00:31 - calculator something where people can
00:32 - figure out their monthly payments based
00:34 - on variables like loan amount and
00:36 - interest rate they'll practice working
00:38 - with mathematical formulas and designing
00:40 - a userfriendly interface this one's also
00:42 - great because you can tailor it to the
00:43 - field that you're interested in like if
00:45 - you want to work in healthcare build a
00:47 - nutrition calculator want to work in
00:48 - climate Tech build a carbon footprint
00:50 - calculator make sure you follow for more
00:52 - coding project ideas
