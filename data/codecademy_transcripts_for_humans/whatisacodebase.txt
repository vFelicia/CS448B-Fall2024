00:00 - hey my name is Mike in this video we're
00:01 - gonna break down and define a very
00:04 - important term in computer programming
00:06 - which is a code base a code base is a
00:09 - very general term but it's a term that
00:11 - you'll hear used all the time if you're
00:13 - working with other developers or you're
00:15 - looking up things online and so it's
00:16 - very important that you have an
00:17 - understanding of exactly what a code
00:19 - base is what it's not and where code
00:22 - bases usually live so that's exactly
00:25 - what we're gonna go over we're gonna
00:26 - cover all the basics of what a code base
00:27 - is and really demystify this term so
00:31 - let's get into it what is a code base
00:32 - well believe it or not it's not an
00:34 - actual base like a military base or
00:36 - something that protects code code base
00:38 - is essentially a complete body of source
00:40 - code for a given program or application
00:42 - in other words it's all the code that
00:45 - the program needs to run in one single
00:47 - location and when you're first starting
00:49 - out as a programmer your program might
00:51 - be contained in one single file or a few
00:54 - files at most and so if that's the case
00:56 - then that one file or those few files is
00:59 - your code base but as applications get
01:01 - more complex single programs can spend
01:03 - hundreds if not thousands of files and
01:06 - so the code base is then the collection
01:08 - of those hundreds or thousands of files
01:10 - basically just all the files that you're
01:12 - working on for the program and the cool
01:15 - thing about a code base is that multiple
01:17 - people can use the same code base so if
01:20 - there's two or three developers working
01:21 - on something then they're all using a
01:23 - shared code base and contributing code
01:25 - to it so that's what a code base is now
01:27 - let's talk about what a code base isn't
01:30 - and so this term code base is a very
01:32 - general and high-level term and so
01:34 - sometimes people will use it to define
01:37 - different aspects of the code or
01:39 - different aspects of the project that
01:41 - they're working on and so while it may
01:42 - sometimes code base generally doesn't
01:45 - refer to the standalone compiled
01:47 - minified or bundled code that a computer
01:50 - might execute rather it's the source
01:52 - code that developers would be actively
01:55 - developing and writing so for example if
01:57 - you had a C++ program the code base for
02:00 - that program would be the actual C++
02:02 - files it wouldn't be the compiled files
02:05 - that would be run on the actual machine
02:07 - so here we have a couple examples of
02:09 - code bases out in the real world the
02:10 - first example here is just a hello world
02:13 - pro
02:13 - so you can see that this is just a
02:15 - program it says hello world and even
02:17 - though it's only one file that itself is
02:19 - a code base right it's all the code that
02:22 - makes up this hello world project here
02:24 - we also have another code base this is
02:25 - actually one of the projects on code
02:27 - Academy calm and on here you can see
02:30 - there's a collection of different files
02:31 - that make up this project and all of
02:34 - these files together is considered the
02:36 - code base for this code academy project
02:38 - finally we also have one more example
02:40 - which is the react repository on github
02:44 - so react is a JavaScript framework and
02:46 - github is actually a really great place
02:48 - to store code bases and in this case the
02:51 - entire react code base is stored here on
02:54 - github so it's all these files collected
02:56 - together makes up the code base so now
02:58 - let's talk about where code bases live
03:00 - so where might you find a code base in
03:03 - the real world now code base is a lot of
03:05 - times can just live on the file system
03:07 - of your computer so if you write a hello
03:09 - world program like we saw on the last
03:10 - slide then that code base lives on your
03:12 - computer right it's stored in your file
03:14 - system and that's where it is a lot of
03:17 - code bases though are stored on version
03:19 - control systems so things like github
03:21 - bitbucket stash these are all common
03:23 - examples of where code bases might live
03:25 - and one of the good reasons for storing
03:27 - code bases on places like this is that
03:29 - they provide processes for good
03:31 - communication between developers they
03:33 - allow developers to work in parallel so
03:35 - multiple programmers can work on the
03:36 - code base at once and they also provide
03:38 - ways to ensure a new code isn't breaking
03:41 - anything so you can run for example
03:43 - tests on the code in the code base right
03:46 - from these websites so let's talk about
03:47 - why code bases are important why is it
03:50 - important to have all of the code for a
03:53 - project inside of this one single code
03:55 - base in one location the first is that a
03:58 - code base accesses the source of truth
03:59 - for the application so while individual
04:01 - developers might have a slightly
04:03 - modified version of that code on their
04:04 - personal machines the central code base
04:07 - is the official version so it's good to
04:09 - have one central code base which acts as
04:12 - the one true program and the code base
04:15 - is generally where all the development
04:17 - takes place and where any changes are
04:20 - added so it's basically where all the
04:21 - activity happens code bases also make it
04:24 - really easy to scale a project so the
04:27 - big
04:27 - the codebase the more issues are likely
04:29 - to be encountered in development right
04:31 - if you only have a project with two or
04:33 - three files chances are it's not going
04:35 - to be that difficult to maintain those
04:37 - two or three files but if you have a
04:38 - code base with thousands of files and
04:40 - the code base is a couple years old it
04:42 - can be really difficult to manage all of
04:44 - that so that's why it's important to
04:46 - have a well organized code base a place
04:48 - where all that code can live code bases
04:51 - also allow you to establish rules so you
04:54 - can for example create a style guide and
04:57 - then all the components or all of the
04:59 - user interfaces within that code base
05:01 - can adopt that same consistent style you
05:04 - can also enforce linting rules so
05:07 - linting would basically be like how the
05:09 - code is written how many spaces are
05:11 - between different parts of the code is
05:13 - the code using camelcase as the code
05:16 - using snake case does the code have
05:17 - comments in it etc so because you have
05:19 - this centralized code base you can
05:21 - establish rules for how all of these
05:22 - things work and you can make sure that
05:24 - everything is consistent so now finally
05:26 - let's talk about when you would use a
05:28 - code base a code base can be one single
05:31 - file if that's all you have for your
05:33 - project it could also be thousands of
05:35 - files so anytime that you're writing a
05:37 - program that in itself is its own code
05:39 - base also anytime that you're looking at
05:42 - an open source project for example on
05:44 - github that's considered a code base
05:46 - also any time you're on a software
05:47 - development team so if you get a job as
05:49 - a software developer generally you'll be
05:51 - working with a specific code base to
05:54 - make changes and to ultimately make them

hey my name is Mike in this video we're gonna break down and define a very important term in computer programming which is a code base a code base is a very general term but it's a term that you'll hear used all the time if you're working with other developers or you're looking up things online and so it's very important that you have an understanding of exactly what a code base is what it's not and where code bases usually live so that's exactly what we're gonna go over we're gonna cover all the basics of what a code base is and really demystify this term so let's get into it what is a code base well believe it or not it's not an actual base like a military base or something that protects code code base is essentially a complete body of source code for a given program or application in other words it's all the code that the program needs to run in one single location and when you're first starting out as a programmer your program might be contained in one single file or a few files at most and so if that's the case then that one file or those few files is your code base but as applications get more complex single programs can spend hundreds if not thousands of files and so the code base is then the collection of those hundreds or thousands of files basically just all the files that you're working on for the program and the cool thing about a code base is that multiple people can use the same code base so if there's two or three developers working on something then they're all using a shared code base and contributing code to it so that's what a code base is now let's talk about what a code base isn't and so this term code base is a very general and highlevel term and so sometimes people will use it to define different aspects of the code or different aspects of the project that they're working on and so while it may sometimes code base generally doesn't refer to the standalone compiled minified or bundled code that a computer might execute rather it's the

files that would be run on the actual machine so here we have a couple examples of code bases out in the real world the first example here is just a hello world pro so you can see that this is just a program it says hello world and even though it's only one file that itself is a code base right it's all the code that makes up this hello world project here we also have another code base this is actually one of the projects on code Academy calm and on here you can see there's a collection of different files that make up this project and all of these files together is considered the code base for this code academy project finally we also have one more example which is the react repository on github so react is a JavaScript framework and github is actually a really great place to store code

might you find a code base in the real world now code base is a lot of times can just live on the file system of your computer so if you write a hello world program like we saw on the last slide then that code base lives on your computer right it's stored in your file system and that's where it is a lot of code bases though are stored on version control systems so things like github bitbucket stash these are all common examples of where code bases might live and one of the good reasons for storing code bases on places like this is that they provide processes for good communication between
